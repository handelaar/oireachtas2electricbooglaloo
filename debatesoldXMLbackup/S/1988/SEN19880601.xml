      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to respond urgently to the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on conditions in Our Lady's Hospital, Cork.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of recent allegations made by four employees in the Sellafield Nuclear Power Station the need for the Minister for Energy to make urgent representations to the British Government to have this power station closed immediately.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent decision by the Minister for Finance not to reappoint a director to the board of Irish Life Assurance Company Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ryan, Kiely and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ryan's motion and it <Col N="1654" /> will be taken from 10 o'clock to 10.30 p.m. or at the conclusion of business. Senators Kiely and Ross may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today, to take item No. 1 from 1.30 p.m. to 4 o'clock, item No. 2 from 4 o'clock to 6.30 p.m., item No. 3 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock and to return to item No. 2 from 8 o'clock to 11 o'clock.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to explain to the House that last week it was intimated that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would be coming before the House today.  It was intimated to us by the appropriate Minister that this would be so.  Unfortunately, the Government amendments were not ready for today. We gave an indication to the House that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would not be brought back to the House before Members were circulated with Government amendments in plenty of time for Members to have a chance to look at them and respond to them.  I apologise to the House if Members were expecting the Companies (No. 2) Bill to be ordered for today.  The reason for its postponement was out of our hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I regret that the Companies (No. 2) Bill cannot be on the Order Paper today as was indicated last week, but I do accept that the reasons for this lie outside the control of the Leader of the House.  I would like to put on record the efforts made by the Government Whip to ensure that we got this piece of legislation here.  I hope the Whips can organise to take this Bill in a structured, organised way and that we will get through it by the end of this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also on the Order of Business, in view of the continued onslaught on the office of the Ombudsman I would like to ask for time to be made available today or tomorrow for a limited debate on the <Col N="1655" /> subject matter of item No. 64 on the Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would make some time available to discuss the quite extraordinary decision of the State-owned Irish Life to sell out their shares in Irish Distillers at a time when, particularly all the great financial institutions, including Irish Life, are talking to us about the need to invest in this country and the need for us to take cuts in our wages, to be patriotic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House to make time available for a discussion of this decision as an urgent matter.  I would also like to refer to the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  I indicated last week that I would insist each week that this be taken and I said that I would push it to a vote each week.  I accept the commitment given by the Leader of the House and by the Government Whip that it will be taken next week.  I appreciate and, therefore, accept that.  I would also say that if this does not happen next week I will insist on having a vote on a daily basis.  We have been through the reasons for taking it and the need for legislation. Perhaps people are not aware that there are disreputable people out there who are at this moment selling companies which people are already directors of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the Government Whip mentioned the late sitting on the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill.  Could I be informed of the next process as well?  I take it there will be no rushing through of this legislation.  I know there is a certain amount of urgency about it, but I hope this House will have the fullest opportunity to discuss this Bill on all Stages.  I hope it is not intended to rush it through in total this week &mdash; Report Stage as well &mdash; because I would be totally against that. We want plenty of time to put down amendments, which I had hoped would have been done in the other House, but was not.</P>
      <P>Referring to Senator Manning's comment about Item No. 64, that has now become a matter of public importance. The sooner this House discusses not alone the report, but the onslaught made by the Taoiseach on one of the highest offices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This House was part of the legislative process that set up the office of the Ombudsman.  We will not have the Taoiseach, or anybody else, denigrating that man's responsibility to this House. We want an opportunity to discuss it because that involved in the setting up of this office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support <Col N="1657" /> Senator Manning and, indeed, Senator Ferris, who also referred to Item No. 64. It seems to me that on the Order of Business Senators may ask that certain items on the Order Paper be taken rather than certain other items on the Order Paper, or that Senators may ask that items not on the Order Paper be put on the Order Paper.  I consider that Senator O'Toole, with all his faults, might have been in order in that regard.  With regard to Item No. 64&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join my voice to the voices of other Senators who have requested that the Leader of the <Col N="1658" /> House should consider taking Item No. 64 today.  The reason, succinctly, is that an extraordinary attack was made yesterday in the other House &mdash; I think very ill-advisedly &mdash; by the Taoiseach.  It seems to me that it would be appropriate for us in this House to demonstrate the relevance of the Seanad and to take Item No. 64 in order to show that we can respond immediately as part of a vigorous political life in this country.  A Chathaoirligh, in deference to your rulings on other Senators, I will limit my inclination to indulge in a speech on this matter.  I would greatly welcome, however, the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that only too well but I would, however, look to the opportunity to make a speech at the appropriate time, if the Leader of the House is prepared to make an opportunity available for this very important debate, the urgency of which has already been stressed by other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly on the Order of Business, I want to re-echo what Senator Ferris said about the seemingly undue haste on this Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill.  This Bill was introduced in the Dáil on 18 February.  It was in and out of the other House over all the intervening months.  It has, I think, finished all its Stages there.  If the sitting tonight is to rush Second Stage today, and then get on to Committee Stage tomorrow or even next week, that is totally undue haste for a piece of legislation that is so important and so wide-ranging. I would like an assurance from the Leader of the House that that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How could I resist the opportunity?  Let me say very briefly that I am in sympathy with everything that has been said about Item No. 64.  I urgently request the Leader of the House to allow a debate on the annual report of the Ombudsman.  A Chathaoirligh, I would like to thank you also for allowing me to <Col N="1659" /> raise the other matter on the Adjournment. May I invite those of my colleagues who are from the Southern Health Board area to attend?  May I ask the Leader of the House, for my guidance if for nobody else's, at what time it is proposed the House will adjourn tonight, as there seems to be some uncertainty about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated at the beginning of the Order of Business that we would sit until 11 p.m.  Most of the questions have arisen in regard to Item No. 64 and the urgency with which that particular item should be taken.  I think the comments of the Taoiseach were quite relevant and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sense of hypocrisy in this House.  Item No. 3 on the Order Paper today was put down in the names of the Independent Senators. They realised over the past number of weeks that the Ombudsman question was being asked about here in the Seanad Chamber by various people.  They could have taken the opportunity to bring forward the debate on the Ombudsman but, instead of that, they decided to bring forward a motion on Foreign Affairs, and the setting up of a parliamentary committee which, even if passed by this House, would have no relevance, because this House has not got the power to set up this committee.  The people who are crying crocodile tears for the Ombudsman could very well have brought forward their motion and they could have had it taken today.  As a matter of fact, over the past number of weeks they could have raised this matter under Standing Order 29 if they felt so enraged by what was going on.  Time will be given to discuss Item No. 64 within the next couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked about the question of the late sitting tonight and felt that this might be used to rush through <Col N="1660" /> Item No. 2.  There is absolutely no question of rushing through Item No. 2, but there is a very heavy load of legislation coming through this House during the next few weeks.  Because of that, it is necessary that we sit late.  We will be sitting late most nights from now on.  We will be sitting earlier on Wednesdays.  We will be sitting three days a week from the week after next.  We will have extended sittings on each of those days.  There is no question of all Stages of that Bill going through the House today or tomorrow.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill, I did not say that it will be going through this House next week, but it will be here as soon as we finish the Insurance Bill.  That will also give the Government an opportunity to have the amendments circulated so that everybody will have a good idea of what amendments are coming in.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish Life, also raised by Senator O'Toole, that is not a matter for this House.  Those are the only items of relevance that were raised on the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Leader of the House to say that he was not certain that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would be dealt with next week?  I would like clarification.  My understanding was that it was coming in next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In agreeing to accommodate the Government side today on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, it was my understanding that this Bill would be coming in next week and we would be given a definite commitment on that.  I am take aback by the throwaway line of the Leader of the House, almost as an afterthought, that it will not be coming in next week.  I would like urgent clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now part of the political vocabulary of Ireland, regrettable as that may be.  I welcome the expansion of the English language at every turn. I would like to remark that I find the response of the Leader of the House to my query in regard to Item No. 64 quite inadequate.  He continually refers to the fact that Private Members' time is available. I would like for his benefit to point out that the situation has now altered radically.  That is precisely the reason why so many Senators wish this matter to be taken.  Item No. 64 is simple: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Annual Report of the Ombudsman, 1987.&rdquo;  The reason many people were interested in this, and very anxious to have it discussed, is that this is now superseded by what many people would consider an attack on the office of the Ombudsman.</P>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1987: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on Government amendment No. 52:</P>
    <P>In page 16, before section 30 to insert in Part II a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1)  If an auditor of an insurer&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has reason to believe that there exist circumstances which are likely to affect materially the insurer's ability to fulfill its obligations to policyholders or meet any of its financial requirements under the Insurance Acts, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has reason to believe that there are material defects in the financial systems and controls or accounting records of the insurer which are likely to have that effect, or <Col N="1663" /> (c)  proposes to qualify any certificate which he is to provide in relation to financial statements or returns of the insurer under the Companies Acts or the Insurance Acts or</P>
    <P>(d)  decides to resign or not seek re-election as auditor,</P>
    <P>he shall report the matter to the Minister in writing without delay.</P>
    <P>(2)  The auditor shall send to the insurer a copy of any report made by him to the Minister under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister is of the opinion that the exercise of his function under the Insurance Acts or the protection of the interests of policyholders so requires, he may require an auditor of an insurer to supply him with such information as he may specify in relation to the audit of the business of the insurer and the auditor shall comply with the requirement.  The Minister may require that in supplying such information the auditor shall act independently of the insurer.</P>
    <P>(4)  In the case of an insurer having its head office outside the State, the duties imposed on an auditor under this section shall apply in respect of business written by the insurer at its establishment in the State.</P>
    <P>(5)  No duty to which an auditor of an insurer may be subject shall be regarded as contravened, and no liability to the insurer, or to its shareholders, creditors or other interested parties, shall attach to the auditor, by reason of his compliance with any obligation imposed on him by or under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section.  I want to ensure that auditors notify my Department as soon as they encounter any difficulties or potential difficulties facing a client's insurer.  That is a fairly significant <Col N="1664" /> measure.  This section will also remove any existing constraints on auditors in reporting a problem to the Department or in discussing with the Department the affairs of their clients.  The Minister is also provided in this section with the power to require an auditor of an insurance company to submit specific details about his client's financial position and he may require an auditor of an insurance company to supply him with such information as he may specify in relation to the audit of the business of the insurer and the auditor shall comply with the requirement.  The Minister may also require that, in supplying such information, the auditor shall act independently of the insurance company.</P>
      <P>The obligations laid down in this new section are very important as they provide for an additional perspective on the financial well-being of insurance companies which, I think, will assist the Department in their supervisory duties. Earlier reporting of difficulties, I am convinced will give the Minister valuable time as the supervisory authority to consider what remedial measures are necessary to safeguard the interests of policyholders.  By and large, a Chathaoirligh, auditors will have discretion on whether or not to report on any matter to the Minister having regard to the materiality of the issue and its impact on an insurer's financial position.  It should also be noted that, as a safeguard to insurance companies, an auditor is obliged to send a copy of any report of this kind to the insurance company also.</P>
      <P>I want to stress, as I said already perhaps, that this is not a &ldquo;cry wolf&rdquo; provision in that only matters which are likely to materially affect an insurance company's solvency position will be reported by auditors to the Minister.  In practice, this will probably mean that the auditor will be reporting in a similar vein to an insurance company's shareholders. The purpose of this section is to ensure that auditors notify my Department as soon as they encounter any difficulties or potential difficulties which face an insurance company.  To that extent it is quite a radical proposal, I suppose.</P>

      <P>As we were saying on the previous occasion when we were discussing this section, I am very concerned at the wide-ranging powers the Minister will be asking an auditor to comply with under the terms &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo; or &ldquo;any of its financial requirements&rdquo; as mentioned in the Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill which defines exactly what the financial requirement is, or what financial requirements would be needed by the auditor to satisfy the Minister that the necessary information he sought in relation to a solvency, or otherwise, would be complied with.  It puts an onerous responsibility, and very grave responsibility, on the auditing profession if every single, possible piece of information that could have a bearing on the insolvency or otherwise of an insurance company was not disclosed by the auditor, resulting in that auditor being put into a position leading to very serious trouble.</P>
      <P>The powers the Minister is asking the Seanad to accept in this new section are too far-reaching.  No auditor can be expected to know every little detail and financial requirement that may or may not have a bearing on the affairs of an insurance company.  The insurance company has its own auditing procedures through its in-house accountant, and in-house financial accounting section.  For an audit to be carried out certainly would not mean that the auditor would be privy to all information.  Before I go further I would like the Minister to clarify what he means by the term &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo; and what definition he would put on those words &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow on in the same vein as Senator Hogan.  This is an extraordinary amendment which gives most unusual powers to the Minister to make the most unusual demands on an accountant or auditor who, in fact, is employed by the company.  The first responsibility of this accountant or auditor is to the person who is paying him to do the job, and do the job properly.  We are suddenly putting an imposition on that person to inform on the company <Col N="1666" /> that is paying him.  We take it that, if everything is all right, this will not be required.  I am quite sure that auditors, like everybody else, have to live within a code of conduct amongst themselves. Otherwise they would not get the stamp of approval from the various associations.</P>
      <P>This is a most unusual procedure to be followed here.  The Government expect an auditor employed by the company to give them information which would enable the Government to take action.  If the Government have a responsibility in this area, they should be able to provide this kind of supervision themselves without expecting an employee to become an informer.  The National Insurance Brokers' Association, the association of all legitimate companies in this area, have a set of rules.  Their rules require them and members of the association to keep proper records at all times.  Proper account should be kept of all moneys received on behalf of insurance companies and should be fully accounted for to the companies.  The association have a set of rules.  Now we are setting down a separate rule for the auditor indicating that he must divulge what might be confidential information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like clarification about financial systems and what the Minister intends now.  Naturally, we want to ensure that the industry is viable, that it is run properly and that the client or the customer is protected.  It is debatable whether, in fact, this type of requirement by law on an auditor makes his job almost incompatible with his pay master.  Have there been discussions with accountants, auditors and their associations about this new provision?  What is their response? With this kind of demand being made on them, it is quite likely that insurance companies could have the gravest of difficulties in getting auditors to accept a brief from them in the knowledge that there is a legislative requirement to report directly to the Department.  The Department should have their own auditors in a supervisory capacity.  The Revenue Commissioners or any other such State agency should be able to inspect <Col N="1667" /> the books of any company at any time, but I do not think it is fair to require an auditor employed by the company to do both jobs, to do our job and to do the company's job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that, an auditor being a professional person, he would be anxious to comply.  I accept the point that he is an employee of the company in a situation like this, but he has standards, he has a role to play as a professional man.  I would have thought that if he saw there were some things wrong, if there was any reason at all to believe that there were material defects in the financial system controls and the accounting records of the insurer, apart altogether from having it enshrined in legislation, it would be his duty to inform the appropriate body, which is the Department of Industry and Commerce, that these things were happening.  I must confess that I do not feel as strongly as the previous two speakers on this section. I regard it as being reasonable.  I am as concerned as anybody else to do the proper thing but I feel the Minister is taking further steps to safeguard the companies, the consumers, the policy holders and all the rest and I do not think it is an unreasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>I rarely take an opposite view from my colleagues on this side of the House but I certainly welcome most vehemently this proposal from the Minister.  It is absolutely necessary.  I have never heard such nonsense about the role of the auditor.  The auditor is not an employee of the company.  The only need for an auditor is in order to give confidence to the consumers that the company is being run on proper lines. On the Second Stage of this legislation I called for a more interventionist approach on the part of the State and more of an involvement in the whole industry.  I welcome this.  I want to give an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the major insurance collapses &mdash; that of a major motor company &mdash; in the last number of years, it was well known within the industry for a number <Col N="1668" /> of years before that that the company were only able to meet their liability on the basis of the premiums which were to be collected in the following year; in other words, instead of doing revenue accounting where they were meeting the liability they incurred each year, they were taking the premiums for the next year in order to pay for the liability of the last year.  That kind of cash accounting might work in some organisations but it certainly cannot work in the insurance industry if we are to give confidence to the people who are buying insurance and who are depending on the company or the broker.  Therefore I would certainly say that in order to increase accountability this gives the State a clear overview and a clear understanding of what is happening within a company.  I regret to use words like &ldquo;informing&rdquo;.  They are emotive words which were sunk in our history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is the kind of thing that has led us into the position where tax defaulters become local heroes.  As far as I am concerned, an auditor would have a clear duty, not just to walk away or refuse to sign his or her name to the audited accounts of the company but, if he or she was unhappy about the accounts, to convey it to a higher authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, the regime that auditors impose upon themselves would be very much in line with this kind of thinking. I may be wrong, but from my information and the people I know in that business, they have very strict rules for themselves.  They feel accountable and they would welcome this because it takes them out of an awkward position when they find something wrong.  What are we really talking about here?  Let us forget about the high-falutin' theorists or the philosophy of this.  Say I am an auditor and I am coming in to audit the books of this company: I look at the books and I see that although the books might balance on a cash basis, in terms of meeting <Col N="1669" /> the liability for a number of outstanding claims, which might not come to court for three or four years, I must see, written down in those books, what the liability will be.  I see that the company cannot meet that liability.  In other words, according to the books, they are bust.  At the same time while I am sitting in this office and looking out through the one-way glass I see people coming in and paying premiums into this company. These people are dependent on this company and have a trust in the company. What am I to do?  Am I supposed to let that continue?  I think not.  This amendment makes it an &ldquo;out&rdquo; because it requires me to do something about it.  I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome this amendment.  In recent years insurance companies have made very heavy underwriting losses.  There are companies who are sustaining these losses by utilising investment income.  In view of the fact that it takes such a long time for a claim to come to fruition the policyholder must be protected.  The Minister has a responsibility to protect the policyholder by every means possible. This amendment will give that added protection to the policyholder.  In the final analysis that is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their comments on this proposed amendment.  I want to make clear that we are talking about financial requirements under the Insurance Acts.  I would not be that interested in an amendment which sought to wreck professional arrangements between clients and an auditor. That is an important relationship and one that I would not like to drive a coach and four through.  That is why these are very specific circumstances and very specific areas of denting that relationship.  It is done for the very good reason that part 1 (a) of the amendment says: &ldquo;likely to affect materially the insurer's ability to fulfil its obligations to policyholders or meet any of its financial requirements under the Insurance Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> In response to the question about defining what &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo; mean, I would have to respond that financial requirements in this context mean those financial requirements which are laid down under the Insurance Acts. That obviously does not include any other financial requirements that are not laid on the company under the Insurance Acts.  I think it is entirely reasonable that the Minister should set out to ensure that the companies comply with the Insurance Acts.  What better person to give the Minister that assurance than the person most closely associated with the financial affairs of the company, at least from an auditing point of view, the company's auditor.  It is a limited area of reporting to the Minister under the Insurance Acts, not the broader area.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>If we spelled out the particular financial requirements it would be unwieldy in this Bill and would also perhaps over-narrow the scope of the section.  I am anxious that, if we are going to go down this road of asking the auditor to be of assistance to the Minister, we do not over-tie the auditor's hands or we will not get any real benefit from this amendment.</P>
    <P>I should also ask Senators to focus on the word &ldquo;materially&rdquo;.  The auditor has to have reason to believe that there are material defects, such as in (b) &ldquo;or he has reason to believe that there exist circumstances which are likely to affect materially the insurer's liability&rdquo;.  Therefore you are not talking here about nitpicking or any minor details or any tittle-tattle or rumour-type of financial information which will be passed between an auditor and a Minister.  You are talking here about items which are likely to materially affect the insurance company's ability to fulfil its requirements.  That means that the requirement we are putting here is for very serious areas and areas which materially affect the company's ability to meet, for example, its solvency margins requirements and its obligations to policyholders.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris spoke about the auditor working for those who pay him.  I know exactly what he means but it is probably <Col N="1671" /> too narrow a definition of an auditor's role.  An auditor is not appointed by the board of a company.  He is appointed by the shareholders and those shareholders have public duties as well as their own private duties.  It is eminently sensible to conclude from that that the auditor also has a public duty as well as a private duty to his client.  We are interfering in the normal relationship here to simply say to the auditor that in the public interest if he spots something which might materially affect these companies, he should report that to the supervisor of insurance companies, which is eminently sensible.</P>
    <P>The point Senator O'Toole made is very valuable.  It takes this dilemma away from many auditors, that when they stumble on some of these difficulties they are torn between their responsibility perhaps to the shareholders and their responsibility to the public.  If there is ever a conflict in that arena, then it is certainly a very difficult ethical area for auditors.  This section will go some way to resolving that dilemma for auditors in that their responsibility will now be to report something material to the Minister and also to send a copy to the company so that the company are aware of what is going on.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon talked about the financial systems.  I agree with what he says that the financial systems in insurance companies are absolutely essential because if they are not right and not continually checked and if the control functions are not put in place then you could get into difficulties very quickly and that could threaten the solvency of the company.  For that reason paragraph (b) is very important there.</P>
    <P>There are similar powers in the UK legislation.  I am not necessarily saying that we should automatically copy that &mdash; we do not &mdash; but having said that and being practical about it, they have developed a certain expertise in financial areas and we take the best of what they have and we reject aspects of it that do not suit our system.  This is one aspect that seems to suit here because the insurance industry in the UK is very <Col N="1672" /> highly developed, very sophisticated and they have very similar powers in their legislation.  That is worth noting.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator O'Toole's comments and reiterate the independent nature of auditors, albeit being paid by the company ultimately.  I think very few auditors would accept that even though they are paid by the company they are not independent.  In fairness to any auditors I have come across from time to time, if their independence is in any way interfered with by the company they are never slow to tell that to the company.</P>
    <P>It is an eminently sensible proposal.  If there is wording which we need to tidy up I will be happy to do that on Report Stage.  The thrust of what is here is sensible and we should stay with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I first reassure the Minister and indeed my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that initially when I spoke on this amendment I said I was quite sure there was a code of conduct already governing these people?  I also said I was satisfied that that code of conduct would put a certain demand on the profession.  I did ask the Minister &mdash; and he did not reply &mdash; if he had consultations with the association that governs auditors to find out if they feel this is an unusual requirement to make on them.  In future may we take it that all auditors working for anybody will have this public responsibility?  There is a certain area of incompatibility, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole thought that the companies did not employ the auditor but of course they do.  The Minister just concluded by saying that they do in the final analysis.  If a company, through its shareholders, is employing auditors to do a job their first responsibility is to the shareholders. If they are not satisfied with the material ability of the insurers to fulfil their obligations they have a responsibility to the shareholders.  I want the Minister to have the information but what I am concerned about is that we are using somebody else's agent to get it.  I think the State has a reason for having this information and should have a structure <Col N="1673" /> within the Department to do it.  We are just writing into legislation an obligation on somebody else to do it for us, just because we feel that they have a public responsibility over and beyond any other profession.  Is it that this particular industry is a problem and that we are worried about it because it is a major industry?</P>
    <P>There were problems in the past and the information that finally came out was available even to the Government.  It took Deputy Frank Cluskey to move to do something something about it, to protect a whole range of people in the motor industry who were insured.  That information was available for some time.  The Government knew it but it took some ingenuity to find out how they could overcome the problem without bankrupting a whole area of insurance on which ordinary people in the country were dependent, people who had paid their premiums.  I am not worried about the information but I am worried how weak it is that the Government are depending on somebody else, who is paid by somebody else, to give us information, apart altogether from their natural responsibility in their profession.  I think it is a bad way to go about it.  It is a weak way to do our business.  We should have the power ourselves and the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has sufficient powers under section 14, that he has been granted adequate powers of investigation in order to investigate the affairs of the company if there is a doubt in relation to solvency of a particular insurance company.  While I could agree that the Minister has to seek and get information in order to satisfy himself that solvency might be an issue in a particular insurance company, I agree with Senator Ferris that there is very loose terminology in terms of the financial requirements that are demanded of an auditor which put tremendous pressure on any auditor to comply with the letter of the law in relation to the insurance sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An audit examination is carried out primarily to enable an auditor to express <Col N="1674" /> his professional opinion in relation to the balance sheet and the profit and loss of a company, no more or no less.  That is done for the insurance company involved.  It is up to the Minister then to interpret those comments and interpret the auditor's report and if he considers that there is a case where he should send some of his own departmental people into the insurance company to carry out an investigation after that, then so be it. I would think you are calling into question the good professional conduct, standards and guidelines of the accountancy profession.  I believe no auditor would feel it incumbent on him to hide an insolvency situation that would bring an insurance company to the brink of putting clients' money and policyholders' funds in jeopardy.  The Minister has granted himself adequate powers of investigation under section 14 to ensure that he knows whether the funding arrangments in that insurance company are adequate or not. Despite that I entirely sympathise with what the Minister is trying to achieve, I would not be happy with the manner in which he is trying to achieve it here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate some points and I want to deal with some of the arguments that have been raised. The role of the auditor is certainly something that needs to be looked at, and looked at very carefully.  I do not believe that chartered accountants or anybody else would feel that this was bringing the role of auditor into disrepute, quite the contrary.  This is the kind of legislation which adds to the status of the auditor in a sense that we find ourselves in a position where we can trust them more.  I do not understand what Senator Hogan has said. Representing as he does a party who have been supportive of cutting back on the public service at all stages and all times in the last couple of years, he now stands up and proposes that the State should employ auditors and accountants to do a job which, under this clever bit of legislation, we can get subsidised by the private sector.  As I understood it he maintained that the Minister should send his people out into the companies to <Col N="1675" /> inspect the books.  As I see this legislation the auditor is doing that job.  Therefore we save the State money and therefore it is quite in line with the policy of Senator Hogan's party.  That is one thing.</P>
      <P>The other thing is that it is completely incorrect to say that auditors would not allow a company to reach a position where they might be insolvent.  The sad fact is that we have got two glaring examples in the past five years of precisely that happening.  It is very simple. Forget again about the general principle or the philosophy.  What we have here is that an insurance company is liable for a car crash where a car has been written off and four people have been hospitalised. There are broken legs, a broken arm and somebody dead.  Somebody has to assess what this will cost the insurance company in three, four or five years time and somebody has to work out the costing of each one of them.  The liability there, depending on the judge's liver on the day, or depending on the goodwill or whatever of the jurors on the day &mdash; according to what happens that legislation &mdash; will then decide whether or not the company is going to owe £750,000, or £50,000 or whatever.</P>
      <P>There are certain basic minimums. There is a major difference between the role of the company accountant and the auditor.  The company accountant, who is trying to make the books balance, will write down in the books the liability of an accident as, let us say, £75,000 and will on that basis balance the books.  That is precisely what happened in the PMPA debacle.  That is precisely the sequence of events: the books balanced; the auditor came in and checked them; they did balance; there was nothing wrong with the cash accounting structure; but in terms of assessing the liability to the company, anybody could see that £70,000 was not going to cover that accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you multiply that example by 1,000 you see the difficulty.  I am giving that example to show that having an auditor does not in any way ensure protection &mdash; having books audited where the auditor just says: &ldquo;I have examined and inspected <Col N="1676" /> these books and I find that they balance; they are correct.&rdquo;  The certificate is signed and presented to the shareholders.  It is a bit naive also to think that shareholders scrutinise one step after another.  We had an example this morning where the largest shareholder in the largest company in Ireland, Irish Life, had no say, or no commitment, or no involvement in a decision which had national implications. This kind of thing can also happen.  That is an aside which has little to do with this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that under section 14 the powers of investigation which he has sought and which we have agreed here in this House are sufficient to give adequate powers of <Col N="1677" /> investigation.  If I may paraphrase subsection (2) of that section it says where the Minister directs such investigation he may require the undertaking to furnish to him any return, document, or account whether in relation to the undertaking itself or any connected body which the Minister may specify.  I think that gives sufficient power to the Minister of the day to go into an insurance company and carry out an investigation.  If the auditor is required in that company to supply necessary information to assist that process, that will be done as part of this investigation.  It is very wide-ranging investigative power which has been vested in the Minister.  I see no reason why he has to introduce a new section to give powers way and beyond what are necessary in order to avert a situation in which an insurance company might be going into insolvency.  The Minister has adequate powers under section 14 at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am not altogether satisfied that a Government investigation will give protection to the policyholder because investigations tend to be time-consuming and cumbersome and they tend to come too late to protect the policyholder.  For that reason I am not sure section 14 will give that protection. This amendment will keep insurance companies on their toes.  Anyone running a business knows there are areas where they just do not deal with all matters as competently as they should but with this legislation the auditor will point out to the company that they must comply with this provision and keep these books in order and so on.  By and large, they will do it and, in the long run, this will give better protection to the policyholder.</P>

      <P>An important point has been raised by Senator Hogan.  I would just say in all sincerity that I consider section 14 is a toothless tiger without this new amendment.  It says that the Minister may direct an investigation whenever he considers that the public interest or the interest of the policyholder so requires but the difficulty with that <Col N="1678" /> section, as I pointed out on Second Stage, is: how does the Minister know?  Where does he initiate.  What is the catalyst for implementing that section unless somebody brings something to his attention? A policyholder could say: &ldquo;I suspect and I want something to be looked at&rdquo; but what this does is to provide the Minister with the ground for initiating and the catalyst for implementing section 14.  The two things are bound together.  Section 14 on its own means the Minister must be dependent on some form of inspiration before he goes in to investigate, whereas now he has the catalyst in order to begin to implement section 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the debate on this section has gone on so long.  I had a note taken before Senator O'Toole spoke.  To me, this amendment the Minister is now talking about is a natural extension of section 14 of the Bill.  It is clearly further strengthening section 14 and it has strengthened the whole audit procedures of the insurance industry.  I know we are all concerned about and behind that idea.  We all know of cases in the past of the two insurance companies who found themselves in trouble.  I can remember the years before the PMPA collapsed, when, if you like, the bush telegraph of the industry was saying they are in trouble.  I can remember saying to a Minister of State at the time that I felt &mdash; this was before PMPA even collapsed &mdash; that if the auditors who examined the Legal and General Insurance Company in England at the time were asked to audit PMPA, the company might well be asked to stop trading.  Legal and General were a £25 million motor insurance in England and the PMPA case was a repeat performance of Legal and General.  Of course, when you audit insurance companies transacting liability insurance or motor insurance where you have large personal injuries, unless you go through each file in detail, and you almost have to have a legal person on hand &mdash; and this will have to happen as a result of this section &mdash; auditors will no longer be able to ask: &ldquo;What do you think your outstanding claims will be?&rdquo;  They will no <Col N="1679" /> longer be satisfied, I believe, with a reply from the insurance company on a claim for example, of, £50,000.  They will ask and will have to ask for the files.  They will have to go through the file with legal people and put a proper valuation on that claim.</P>
      <P>Recently, in my own county, a public liability claim estimated at £50,000 by the insurer finally settled two or three years later at £250,000.  Therefore, I think that the onus on auditors to go into every claim file in detail and come up with its true settlement value is necessary and this is what the auditor will have to do as a result of this section.  If I was an auditor I would welcome this amendment.</P>
      <P>One of the most valid points the Minister made in his reply was that it is no longer a case of the auditor saying &ldquo;Will I be loyal to my company?&rdquo;  He has a strict instruction in writing, in the legislation, the law of the land, that he must report to the Minister.  I believe auditors will welcome this.  As a result of this section in the Bill we are going to get far more detailed audit and provision for claims will be recognised and treated as the most serious aspect of the audit.  Ordinary audits of income, premium income and expenses for wages, salaries and lighting are simple enough but the provision for outstanding claims is the kernel of the future solvency of the insurance company.  Rather than being in any way critical of this amendment I certainly welcome it with open arms.  It is a proper amendment and I am pleased to have it inserted in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully, but I am not that taken with many of the arguments.  There is something very fundamental involved here.  Of course there is a duty on the auditor to shareholders, as Senator Ferris said, and that is an important duty but there is a prior duty to the policyholders who, in my view, have a broader right than the shareholders in this context.  That duty to the policyholder is one I would lay on the auditor in advance of his duty to the shareholder.  That is getting into deep <Col N="1680" /> water, but I think that in the pecking order of duties, that prior duty to the policyholder who is investing with and working with the company is ahead of that other duty to the shareholder, although that duty to the shareholders is very important and a traditional duty of the auditor to the company.  This other duty is slightly ahead of it and for that reason we are right to go this road.</P>
      <P>I want to respond directly to the Senator's question about whether we consulted with the accountancy bodies because I know he is interested in that. We had formal consultations with the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies of Ireland, that is, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.  We have taken a very detailed account of their views and they have been most helpful in letting us have their opinions.  We have been unable to accept some of their recommendations, in particular the mechanism for conveying this report to the Minister, but I should stress that it is implicit in the system which they proposed to me that at some stage the auditor would report directly to the Minister.  For example, their method of handling this duty was that they would in the first instance report to the insurance company and if the insurance company did not pass on the report to the Minister, they would send it directly.  They feel obviously that it keeps their professional relationship alive, if they first tell the insurance company and then they wash their hands of it for a while, but if the insurance company does not pass on the report then they can send it anyway.  What they are saying in that argument is that when the chips are down, if the insurance company does not pass on the report, they will then step out of this relationship and do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt quite seriously that was unnecessarily bureaucratic, that if, in fact, an auditor finds something that <Col N="1681" /> in his opinion is likely to affect materially the company's obligations to its policyholders &mdash; think about those words: materially affect the obligations to the policyholders &mdash; then we should not mess about and say: &ldquo;Tell the insurance company and hopefully they will tell the Minister, so that that keeps us as nice boys and we do not lose our fees or whatever.&rdquo; It is much too serious.  If an auditor at that stage spots something that is likely to materially affect the company's obligations to its policyholders, then by far the quickest and cleanest way is to send that report immediately to the Minister and send a copy to the company, which they will both have at virtually the same time.  It is shorter, snappier and it certainly reflects the circumstances, and again I stress, it would only be in circumstances which in the auditor's opinion &ldquo;are likely to affect materially the insurer's ability to fulfil its obligations to policyholders&rdquo; under the Insurance Acts. In those very serious circumstances an auditor really should not delay, but should immediately bring that to the attention of the legal supervisor of insurance companies, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is cleaner and quicker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consulted with the accountancy bodies and we differed from them mainly on the mechanism which they suggested to deal with this.  I thank them very much for their submission and for their very thoughtful point of view.  I see their point of view, but which is more important at this stage: to protect the nicety of professional relationships, or to ensure that there is no doubt about the seriousness of insurance companies getting into difficulty and that information not coming out early.  If I have to make a decision between those two, then I opt for slightly denting a very strong professional relationship on the basis that they admit themselves, in any case, that if the company did not tell the Minister they would tell the Minister.  It seems to me to be of very little difference whether they tell the Minister now or whether they test the insurance company and then <Col N="1682" /> they tell the Minister.  It makes no major difference in my view at this stage, particularly if in the auditor's view it is likely to materially affect the ability of the insurance company to meet its obligations.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, it does not matter a great deal whether they do it immediately or whether they give the insurance company the first crack at it. There is also the possibility &mdash; one would want to be careful of how one phrases this &mdash; that in those circumstances, bringing it first to the attention of the insurance company, they would leave themselves open to perhaps seeing the other point of view, that it was not necessary at the time or it was not so material.  It is important that an auditor's first inclination as to what is material is acted on immediately rather than leave himself open to being convinced that perhaps it is not material and, therefore, not acting on it as quickly as it should be acted on.  I thank the accountants for their submission which has been very helpful in clearing our mind on that issue.</P>
    <P>Section 14 has been mentioned by a number of Senators.  This section does not solve my problem.  It says: &ldquo;The Minister may direct an investigation at any time&rdquo; ... but before a Minister would direct that an investigation takes place, he would obviously need as much input as possible.  A letter to the Minister from an auditor bringing to his attention that there was something which might materially affect the company is precisely the kind of information that might lead to section 14 being implemented because the natural response to getting such a letter is to refer immediately to section 14 and send in the investigators.</P>
    <P>There is a timing difference between the benefit of section 14 and the benefit of this amendment and it is an important timing difference.  For that reason, this amendment, which requires the auditor to bring to the Minister's attention that there was something which might materially affect the company, supplements section 14 and section 14 cannot really be used instead of it.  Under section 14 we are more likely to get the information <Col N="1683" /> much later and timing is of the essence in these kind of problems.  When you get the information earlier, you can make more use of it and act more swiftly.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that what we are trying to do here is build in an early warning mechanism.  The person who is likely to find out quickest of all &mdash; or one of the people who is likely to find out quickest of all &mdash; is an auditor who perhaps is working on the very early stages of the audit and comes across some items which might materially affect the insurer's ability. We are trying to make sure doubly that if an auditor spots something which is very serious he will bring it to the attention of the legitimate authority who have to supervise insurance companies. It is not telltale stuff because the selfsame report has to go to the insurance company and they will know precisely what the auditor told the Minister and, in practice, probably on the same day and at exactly the same time.  I imagine an auditor would write to the Minister and circulate it immediately to the insurance company.  That is almost certainly the way an auditor would do it so that both parties will have the information at the same time.  Both parties are entitled to have that information as quickly as possible. These are the main points I want to make in regard to section 14 and the question of the submission from the auditors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate confirms what all of us, including the Minister, recognise as a special relationship between auditors and their employers, whether that employer is the company, management, shareholders, or the policyholders.  This legislation reflects our concern for the policyholders.  Naturally this is a new dimension to the requirements.  Whereas I have defended the Minister's right to get this information, and to get it as early as possible, I am concerned that the Minister is depending on other people to do it.  The Minister has powers under section 14, but he is obviously now admitting that, unless he is told by somebody else, he has no way of finding out.  That is <Col N="1684" /> admitting our lack of control over these situations we are all worried about.  We are now totally dependent on an outside body who have a national responsibility.</P>
      <P>We are putting legislation in place to make it obligatory by law for them to do so.  That is why I asked if the Minister had got agreement from the associations. I have seen a copy of their recommendations to the Minister.  They recommended another procedure which also took into account the special relationship that we all agreed they have with employers.  They felt that the four or five days limit in between, not alone protected that relationship but met the Minister's demand.  If five days make that much difference to the material running of a company, we are in right trouble. That is why the Minister should be absolutely specific.  They are not satisfied that the words used in this amendment define sufficiently the point originally made by Senator Hogan &mdash; the area which puts this responsibility on them.  You would imagine the words &ldquo;affect materially an insurer's ability to fulfil its obligations to policyholders&rdquo; would meet the day to day requirements of an auditor, but this could be misrepresented.  If the Minister is absolutely specific about the information he requires, he should write it down and tell them.  Let us not use words that could be misinterpreted.  An auditor might consider that a company was materially able to fulfil its obligations but the Minister's investigators might not agree and the public might not agree either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be very specific.  I agree the Minister should get this information.  I do not think he should depend on anybody else to give it to him.  If the Minister cannot get it or if he wants a prior warning, perhaps this is the best way out of it.  We need to look at the words used to make sure that there is no ambiguity about the role of the auditor.  Because it is in the Insurance Acts, are the profession to expect it in all other Acts? We depend in the final analysis on an auditor's overview of how businesses are being run.  We worry about things being done correctly.  If the parent companies are in England and their auditors are in <Col N="1685" /> England, what effect has our law outside of the jurisdiction?  Will this Bill apply to a company registered outside the jurisdiction with auditors in London, or do we have to bring in the Extradition Bill as well to meet that requirement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on the Extradition Bill under this legislation. The Cathaoirleach might decide it was outside the scope of the Bill.  I want to say something which I think is the nub of this.  Section 14 gives the Minister power to direct that he gets information.  The actual wording is</P>
      <P>... He may require the undertaking to furnish to him any return, document or account, whether in relation to the undertaking itself or any connected body which the Minister may specify, necessary for the conduct of the investigation, and he may also require the undertaking to furnish to him returns and accounts duly certified, or any document duly attested, necessary to satisfy him as to the financial state of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>The Minister has wide-ranging powers there to get information.  This is a parallel mechanism.  It is not meant to be instead of and is slightly more qualitative than just getting information.  Section 14 gets the Minister the information from the company into which the Minister is thinking about sending investigators.</P>
      <P>Here you have an independent opinion and an independent source giving your qualitative information, this is, where the auditor has reason to believe that these circumstances exist.  What you are getting here really is a highly valuable opinion on information which has come into the hands of the auditor during the course of his work with the company.  They are slightly different mechanisms.  They are parallel to an extent, although you may need amendment No. 52 before you embark on section 14.  It would be one of the mechanisms which would trigger off section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also different in that under section 14 you get the information.  You do not get an independent opinion on that information, whereas with amendment No. 52 <Col N="1686" /> you may get a letter from an auditor of an insurance company pointing out that he has come across something like this and, in his opinion, he has reason to believe that it would affect the insurer's ability materially to meet his obligations. That is certainly completely different from section 14 but it is also necessary to have it there from a parallel point of view.</P>
    <P>I know the Senator is concerned about the fact that the Department get this information.  What I am saying here is that we actually need both of these clauses to ensure that we get the earliest possible information.  One without the other would mean that we are not closing all of the doors.  I am keen here to close all the doors which block the Department getting the earliest possible information. In many cases the Department can do their own thing and have plenty of power but they do not have enough here and do not avail of this additional resource which is sitting there, which is the auditor who may come across a lot of very valuable information well in advance of a Minister deciding to direct that any information should be made available to him. He will probably come across that stuff much earlier than a Minister who would suddenly decide for various reasons that he should seek additional information from a company.</P>
    <P>That kind of routine information which an auditor may come across in routine day to day work is almost certain to emerge and surface much earlier.  What tends to happen, I would guess, with investigations in that kind of area, and Ministers seeking information, is that it is often too late because a lot of that takes place as a result of rumours in the marketplace, tip-offs, auditors accounts which are finally published and information which is really much too late. This is necessary and it is parallel.  It is not a major onus on auditors and it is purely a timing difference between the auditors and myself as to when they actually tell the Minister that they spotted something.</P>

      <P>I have a query for the <Col N="1687" /> Minister on amendment No. 52 (c) and (d).  If an auditor of an insurer (c) proposes to qualify any certificate which he is to provide in relation to financial statements or returns of the insurer under the Companies Acts or the Insurance Acts, or (d) decides to resign or not seek reelection as auditor, he shall report the matter to the Minister in writing without delay.  I am worried about the wording &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;.  It may be too weak and perhaps the Minister could come in with something much stronger like &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;. I know it probably makes very little difference, but it would seem to be more positive.</P>

At the end of the day that is obviously our own decision.  I prefer the wording &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; in this case because I do not want to rely on the professional competence and integrity of the professional auditors.  If this legislation lays it on them to report something which they believe will affect materially a company &mdash; and the Act will say eventually that they are to report that in writing without delay &mdash; I will rely on the professional integrity of the people involved to do that as quick as possible.</P>

      <P>The Senator might be misreading it.  Their submission to me was that that five days was the time between the insurance company getting it and the auditor deciding that he had not passed it on.  The auditor was then to pass it on.  In other words, the auditor was not laying a time limit on himself; he was laying a time limit on the insurance company.  He was saying to the insurance company: &ldquo;You had better pass it on to <Col N="1688" /> the Minister within five days.&rdquo;  The five days apply to different circumstances.  It would be unreasonable to lay five days on the auditor.  Certainly the auditors did not suggest laying the five days on themselves.  They suggested laying the five days on the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am conscious of the fact that if we insert the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in subsection 1 (a) the Minister will have to be aware that if he reduces commission levels to intermediaries the insurance companies might decide that the commission levels were <Col N="1690" /> not sufficient to keep the intermediary in business either.  On the one hand if the Minister takes power to reduce the level of commission which he might consider excessive, on the other side of the coin, there might be cases where he should have power to increase the level of commission where it is insufficient.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not anyway.  The Minister should be aware that insurance companies have decided to reduce commission levels to intermediaries under the pretext of reducing policyholders' premiums.  When they reduce commission levels to intermediaries, as sure as night follows day, within a month policyholders' premiums will go up by 10 per cent.  That emphasises the very minimal impact commission payments have on the overall finances of an insurance company.  As Senator Fallon has pointed out, 5 per cent is the commission on a motor insurance premium. I am dealing now with the non-life side where there is a problem in relation to general insurance.  There are reasons that commission payments are attractive on the life side.  The commission payments given on the life side are sufficient at present.  On the non-life side there are difficulties.  If an intermediary was over-reliant on general insurance business, he might run into financial difficulties if insurance companies decide to reduce commissions to such an extent that he will not be in a position to keep going in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly we are at the stage now where insurance commissions to intermediaries have been reduced by half over the past three years in most levels of business but this has not reduced the premiums to policyholders.  That was the excuse originally given for reducing those commission levels.  If the Minister wants to ensure that people will have competition and that they will have a choice in relation to the number of companies they will have at their disposal, if companies want <Col N="1691" /> to continue to use insurance intermediaries in order to give that choice and to give that element of competition to the policyholder, it is essential that the Minister should have some power to raise the level or ask the insurance companies to raise the level of commission payments to insurance intermediaries.  I would like the Minister to define the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in the context of this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 deals with the power of the Minister to require reductions in commissions and states: &ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, the rates of commission payments of the holder of an authorisation are excessive, he may, by notice in writing sent by post to the holders, require the holder to reduce ...&rdquo;.  I thought that the other side of the fence would also be covered and that if the Minister felt for some reason or other that the rates of commission were very low he could intervene in that area and perhaps get an increase. I would like to think that that would be part and parcel of the spirit of the Bill.  It is a well-known fact that commissions are extremely low.  The 5 per cent commission on motor insurance is ludicrous. The commission on household insurance ranges from 12½ per cent to 20 per cent but it is a well-known fact that building societies get something like 25 per cent and this seems a little unfair.  I would like to think that this amendment would enable the Minister, if he thought the amount of commission was too low, to say: &ldquo;Can you not grant a higher commission rate to the intermediares?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very confused about the need for this amendment but I am sure Senator Hogan will spell it out to me in more detail.  I understood that the thrust of this legislation was to protect consumers and to give them more confidence in the insurance industry and that the section would ensure that the consumer a person at the end of the road would not be overcharged in any way. The argument Senator Hogan put forward <Col N="1692" /> seems to be a genuine one.  I have no doubt he was right in what he said about the insurance companies reducing the commission and increasing the premiums and thereby making the broker an intermediary pay the cost of the increased premiums.  That may be the case but I do not know if this legislation should cover that activity.  In other words I want to hear the argument in favour of the consumer.</P>
      <P>As the amendment stands at present I do not see a need for it.  If there is something in this amendment which adds further to the protection of the person who is buying insurance, it should be spelled out for us.  It seems unusual to ask the Minister to increase the commission. With regard to the party of the free market and the party of open competition, who are well represented here today by Senator Hogan, I find it extraordinary that he should attempt to propose that an increase in commission and an increase in prices would increase the competitiveness on the market.  I am a very simple soul and, being a Kerryman, I need things spelled out for me in black and white and in simple terms.</P>

      <P>If the INTO can get the commission that is all the better because at will be of benefit to the organisation. I think you mentioned that as a free marketeer I should not be looking for an increase in the amount of commission that might be paid to an intermediary.  I am trying to react to the words that are used in the section which says that if the Minister deems that the commissions paid to intermediaries are excessive he has the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the Chair but Senator O'Toole has been addressing me.  The Minister will have power to reduce commission levels by using the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;, in other words if commission payments are excessive he has the power to reduce them.  On the other side of the coin, if commission payments in relation to particular levels of business are insufficient rather than excessive.  I think the Minister should equally have the power to increase them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance intermediaries are important to consumers from the point of having independent advice available on the various companies who will offer an insurance product on the market.  In fairness there should be some recognition of that.  Later on we will be trying to put limitations on who can be called an <Col N="1694" />&ldquo;agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;broker&rdquo;.  A broker can have as many insurance agencies as he wants under his agency portfolio and he must have more than five.  If the consumer wants to have an independent and wide range of companies at his or her disposal in order to choose the cheapest premium with the best cover, the Minister of the day should have power to interfere in a company if proper financial recognition is not given to an intermediary who is doing a good job for the consumer in that regard.  I do not think the Minister should need the power to reduce the commission levels if they are excessive.  However, he may need the power if a building society's commission payments on household policies are excessive and if one level of commission is paid to intermediaries or insurance brokers and a different level of commission is paid to somebody else. That is what I would call excessive and it is not in the interests of the intermediary, the insurance industry or the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by appealing to the Minister to see the logic of my case.  If he is looking for powers in one direction he should do so in both directions in order to give a balanced view of the overall situation.  I would not like to see what happened in the United Kingdom happening here where brokers and intermediaries went out of business because of the Insurance Bill that was brought in that jurisdiction.  If commission levels are to play a minor part in putting insurance intermediaries out of <Col N="1695" /> business, I would be in favour of putting in an amendment which would give the Minister some power to levelling out the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> insurance companies and insurance intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is the Minister's role under this Bill to dictate at what level intermediaries' commission should be paid because back in the early eighties insurance companies were paying over the odds to brokers and agents in competition for business and these excessive rates were paid at the expense of the policyholder.</P>
      <P>I understand that Part III of this Bill was introduced in the Seanad in 1982 as a separate Bill but because the industry came to an agreement among themselves at that time the Bill was not proceeded with.  I understand that earlier this year the old problem of excessive rates surfaced again but that following the threat of such legislation the industry came into line with a new inter-company agreement. The Insurance Industry Federation have a commission agreement with different companies and they should look after the minimum level of commission to be paid.  I do not think it is the Minister's job to dictate what the minimum level should be.  There are other agencies who can do that on behalf of the intermediaries and brokers.  I welcome the section which will tackle excessive commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the powers in Part III are being taken is to enable me to curb excessive commissions should the need arise and they are, in effect, maximum price control powers. On the non-life side, some brokers would argue, as has been argued here today, that commission levels are too low for certain classes and that they were reduced by insurers.  Insurers, on the other hand, will point out to me that <Col N="1696" /> these commissions are calculated on a percentage of gross premiums and that, generally speaking, over the last decade increases in liability and, in particular, motor rates have far outstripped the level of general inflation.  That is the point they would make and that is why the Government are taking action now to reduce the cost of insurance to the general public.</P>
      <P>As Senators will already be aware, the powers to control commission levels are reserved powers to be activated if self-regulation by the industry fails and consumer interests are eroded by excessive commission payments.  My primary concern in all of this has to be for the consumer. We cannot go back to the old days of holiday in the sun in exotic locations at the expense of the consumer.</P>

      <P>I thought I would mention it on this section.  I would expect all sectors of the industry to regulate their affairs in a reasonable manner.  However, it is not the intention that the Minister should interfere with responsible market forces or the normal commercial interaction between intermediaries and insurance companies.  For example, I will not act as a form of pay arbitrator for insurance companies and their intermediaries. This is a function of insurance company management, on the one hand, and of the intermediaries and their repreentative bodies on the other hand.  I am sure the House appreciates that for these reasons I do not propose to take on board these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the words &ldquo;by post&rdquo; in this context limits the Minister to sending notices by post and notices not sent by post, for example, recorded delivery by hand, could therefore be deemed to be invalid.  That is not what was intended so I am trying to correct that.  The effect of the amendment will be that the Minister may use any method to send notices and he will not be tied to any one particular method.  In reality, the Minister, as supervisory authority, would decide in particular circumstances on the most appropriate means of delivery of notices.  This could include ordinary post or registered post, depending on the circumstances and the location of the addressee; delivery by hand with registered signatory of receipt, if required, and this could be required in certain circumstances; telex in the interests of speed, if that is appropriate and registered FAX transmission of documents if that is appropriate at the time.  The important point here is that the correct method of communication will be determined having regard to individual circumstances at the time.  The important thing is that there should be some flexibility and that the Minister should be free to determine the appropriate way to serve the documents.  This is a sensible adjustment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get clarification on two points.  Did the Minister say that it was acceptable now to send notices by FAX? I think this should be so but he either deliberately or otherwise did not refer to the fact that they could be sent through, for instance, Eirpac or one of the computer mailing systems.  I want to clarify whether it would be appropriate to use <Col N="1699" /> those particular avenues of distribution as well.  I believe that it should be and I am glad that it is not just a facility which allows courier companies to get in on the act but that it goes far wider and includes technological mail services.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment in relation to this matter because, as he will be aware, I proposed a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  I thought the most appropriate way to deal with the handling of correspondence from the Minister to the policyholder would be through registered post.  Perhaps the fact that he is now deleting &ldquo;by post&rdquo; is opening up the avenue whereby he will be in a position to send by registered post or by some other means as deemed suitable on the occasion.  I would welcome it from the point of view that the Minister is not tying our hands by one method of transportation of material.  It is essential to have good communications between the Minister and the policyholder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope these are fairly non-contentious amendments although <Col N="1700" /> that may be presumptuous of me.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;in respect of work carried out&rdquo; in the Bill has two disadvantages. First, it tends to imply that indemnity commissions or commissions paid to an insurance intermediary in advance of any work carried out are outside the scope of the section.  This is certainly not the case.  Secondly, if allowed to stand, insurance companies would have an unlimited period in which to settle commission accounts at the higher rate with intermediaries.  So the deletion of the words eliminates the former disadvantage, while reducing the time allowed to insurance companies to settle such accounts with intermediaries to a more reasonable time of two months. The new paragraphs (b) and (c), which are contained in amendments Nos. 59 and 60 respectively, are proposed because they are couched in more readily comprehensive language than the existing text and they avoid the use of the phrases &ldquo;rates of&rdquo; and &ldquo;in respect of work carried out&rdquo; for reasons which I have already explained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to ensure that every payment or award paid to an insurance intermediary is regarded as commission, no matter what form it takes.  I agree with the thinking behind this amendment to delete the words &ldquo;in respect of work carried out&rdquo;. I seek clarification in relation to amendment No. 60.  It cuts across section 31 (2) of the original Bill.  Should we be discussing that at the moment, or should we discuss it in the context of a later amendment, No. 65, as Senator Fallon and I have been anxious to have that subsection deleted?  If so, I will have much more to say on amendment No. 60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because they deal with that matter.  Whether they can be moved is a technical matter.  The effect of the original text of this section originally was to prohibit all commission payments in the form of benefits in kind, for example, all non-cash payments, advance or indemnity commissions in the form of loans and to prohibit intermediary remitting of premium net of his commission to the insurer.  The insurance industry has argued that normal arrangements between insurers and intermediaries, for <Col N="1703" /> example, in regard to the supply of calendars, pens, business lunches, co-operation in the development of technology, computerisation matters and the like should not be unnecessarily hindered. They have also argued that an intermediary is entitled to receive his due commission when the work is done, that is, when the contract is concluded or renewed, and that deferred premium payment plans, deduction schemes and so on, where policyholders normally make payments on a deferred basis and which are designed to assist consumers were not catered for in the wording of the original section 31 of the published Bill.  I know that some Senators repeated these points during the course of the debate on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, this new subsection proposed by the Government makes it explicit that the powers being taken to control indemnity commissions and benefits in kind are reserve powers, to be activated only if consumer interests are threatened by excessive commission payments. We are not seeking to prescribe the form of bona fide commission payments, merely to have the power to control or prohibit abuses if these occur.  In addition, the new powers will be flexible enough to allow the Minister to target abuses in specific classes and to grant exemptions in those classes where no abuse occurs.  The intention, therefore, is not to interfere in the normal commercial freedoms and relationships between insurance companies and intermediaries unless commission levels or benefits rise to levels which threaten to destablise the market and devalue consumers' interests. I hope this objective is achieved by the amendment which I commend to the House.</P>
      <P>I presume also that the new section 31, proposed on behalf of the Government, takes care of the concerns of Senators Hogan, Mulroy and Fallon, reflected in their amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment and I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has eased a situation which would <Col N="1704" /> have created difficulties for a number of Senators and for the consumer in relation to premium payments plans over a considerable length of time.  The Minister acknowledged that premiums have increased dramatically recently and consumers or policyholders are finding it increasingly difficult to pay their premiums to the companies and their intermediaries in one lump sum.  I am glad the Minister acknowledged that and decided to insert an amendment which will take due cognisance of that dilemma.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that the Minister has taken the opportunity to outlaw benefits in kind and to frown upon, in legislation, the various practices and arrangements which have been entered into by insurance companies and some intermediaries in the form of loans or holidays and certain cash up-front in relation to policies.  It was not in the best interest of the consumer that payments of this nature were given to certain intermediaries. It infringed on the best available product being given to the policyholder which was not in the interests of fairness or giving the best value for money to the policyholder or consumer.  Outlawing that certainly has my full support.  I welcome the fact that the industry has brought about self-regulation in recent times, particularly in the life area.  This has been a major problem in the life assurance area but it has not been one in the non-life area.  Inducements given in order to get an insurance company to do more business with certain intermediaries had begun to take very strong effect in recent times.  The Bill is timely in so far as it eliminates that in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the insurance federation made a submission to the Minister that they would like to see greater movement and technological innovation in relation to intermediaries in the form of computerisation.  If you open the gate in allowing an exceptional case in relation to technology, you are opening the floodgates to other forms of benefit in kind which would not solve the problem the Minister is trying to alleviate in this amendment.  I welcome the amendment <Col N="1705" /> because it adequately addresses two important problems.  I am glad that the deduction authorities and premium payment plans will not come under duress from the Minister in this amendment and that benefit in kind in all its respects and every reward and payment made wrongly to the intermediary, not made under the self-regulation agreement, to the detriment of the consumer, is outlawed under this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this amendment. It is common knowledge in the life insurance industry that many companies over the past few years were offering over-generous incentives such as holidays abroad.  If this had continued on this level the customers' interests might well have been seriously threatened.  For that reason I am glad the Minister has acted in this way.  At the time the Minister of the day brought in the life companies and they, in turn, regulated themselves with new proposals which come into play some time in August.  On the non-life side, on section 31 (2) of the original Bill, I could see very real problems with insurance brokers apart from the fact that we have, as has been referred to by Senator Hogan, the premium solvent schemes.  It has been a long tradition that insurance brokers pay their accounts net.  Brokers coult not understand the fact that this section could be in a Bill and I am pleased that the Minister has wisely decided to remove it.</P>
      <P>If insurers were obliged to pay commission on a premium received basis it would cause many administrative and technical problems.  That would also be the case for the insurance brokers and intermediaries generally who, clearly, over the years felt that commissions should be paid on the basis of a net account.  Not alone would there be administrative and technical problems; it would be unworkable.  We have no choice but to remove section 31 from the Bill.</P>

The cost of insurance is increasingly more expensive and if this had been left in place it would have added <Col N="1706" /> to the cost of insurance because it would have put the fair payments and premium payment plans in jeopardy.  It would have also caused undue hardship to brokers because of a cash flow problem.  This is a very welcome amendment and I am very pleased the Minister has introduced it.</P>

      <P>The court would decide on that.  The purpose of this section is to make it an offence for an insurance company convicted under sections 30 or 31 of the Bill to publish, or to cause to be published, an advertisement in relation to its insurance business, unless it first reduces its commission rates to a level not higher than the relevant level specified in the notice from <Col N="1707" /> the Minister to which the conviction related or unless it no longer breaches the requirements of section 31.  This provision is confined to the insurance company only.  It is not felt necessary to extend it to those cases where intermediaries may independently advertise the business of a particular company.  It is considered that the provision in section 34, making it an offence for a broker to accept certain commission payments, is an adequate disincentive to brokers to continue to handle the business of an insurance company that is in contravention of the Act.  We are very confined to the company and its advertising.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1)  Subject to subsection (2), where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an insurance intermediary accepts a commission payment,</P>
      <P>(i)  from a person who has been sent a notice under section 30 or a copy of such a notice, or from a person acting on behalf of such a person, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the payment is higher than the level specified in relation to such payments under the notice, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the payment is made after the date specified in the notice, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an insurance intermediary accepts a commission payment contravening section 31,</P>
      <P>the intermediary shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall be a defence for the defendant to show that he did not know, and could not reasonably <Col N="1708" /> be expected to have known, that the commission payment concerned was&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  higher than the level specified in relation to a payment of that kind in the notice concerned under section 30 and that, upon its becoming known to him, he returned the excess of the commission payment concerned to the person who made it, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in contravention of section 31 and that, upon its becoming known to him, he returned the commission payment concerned to the person who made it.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section and its wording is more easily understood than the existing text.  The only change of any substance occurs in subsection (2). The original text required the total commission payment in contravention of section 30 to be returned to the person who made it.  The new text requires that only the part of the commission payment which was in excess of that allowed under section 30 is to be returned as soon as the intermediary becomes aware of the fact that it is greater than permitted.  That is a fairer and more reasonable approach to it, that the excess is returned rather than the premium.</P>

      <P>On to section 35 we are talking about certain policies of life assurance being voidable.  The Minister will be aware of the cooling off period introduced recently as part of the self-regulation process in the life assurance area. I welcome this in relation to the life assurance companies because it is giving what Senator O'Toole and other Members advocate &mdash; a period of time in which a policyholder can decide to go ahead once and for all with the particular policy or to throw out the contract entered into through the proposal form.  Is the Minister aware if the cooling off periods and self-regulation are working satisfactorily? If not, what steps does he intend to take to ensure that the process is monitored properly and will continue to work satisfactorily?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only source of information I have in that regard is the complaints section of my Department and the information from that section is that the cooling off structure seems to be working satisfactorily.  We do not have any undue complaints.  In fact, we have hardly any complaints about the working of the system so it must be working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said that because I thought it was an excellent initiative taken by the life offices in view of the fact that when a person signed a proposal form he or she felt they were compelled to go ahead with it.  They can <Col N="1710" /> now avail of a cooling off period and as many people as possible should be aware of it.  Maybe the Department and the life companies could assist the process through the letter they send when the proposal form is returned to the company. It is a very fair and equitable way of dealing with the information sent from the intermediary agent to the proposer of the policy.</P>
      <P>I am delighted at the concept of a cooling off period and I am glad the Minister has justified my delight by saying that there are no complaints of any particular significance in his Department in relation to policyholders because there are a number of companies &mdash; Senator Fallon referred to this on Second Stage &mdash; in which unqualified people are going around the country signing people up for policies.  Unsuspecting individuals are not aware of what they are signing, they are given a line of argument in relation to the sale of the policy.  The cooling off period and the letter they will receive from the company will be a second opportunity for the proposed policy holder to have another look at it and to rethink what they signed in the first place.  That is a very worthwhile initiative and I am glad it is working well.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and ACOT and to transfer the functions of the two bodies to a new single Authority with responsibility for agricultural advisory, training, education and research services.  The Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann on 25 May.</P>
      <P>As this House is aware, radical changes are taking place in agriculture.  Increased productivity through improved technology has created surpluses in a number of products both in the European Community and elsewhere.  It is vital that we meet these changes in agriculture in a positive, constructive and developmental way.  We simply cannot continue to supply services just because they were effective and relevant in the past.  We must respond to the challenge of the new circumstances by tailoring our services to the development needs of the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc will be responsible for maintaining the knowledge base of our most important industry and for disseminating that knowledge to the primary producers, through training and advice, and to the <Col N="1713" /> food processing sector, through research and development.</P>
    <P>A strong, vibrant agriculture and food sector is central to the well-being of the economy.  In this situation, Teagasc will be required to provide the services relevant to the developmental needs of the sector.  This Bill provides the framework for the establishment of the organisation which will contribute to the fullest development of the agriculture and food industries.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Government is to ensure better co-ordination and cost-effectiveness of agricultural research, training and advisory services.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to put in place, by combining the considerable resources of the existing organisations, a strong, unified structure for the effective delivery of the support services vital for the agriculture and food industry.  This body will be a powerful aid to the industry in its response to the difficulties &mdash; and, indeed, the opportunities &mdash; which the rapidly changing developments in agriculture are bringing.</P>
    <P>At the same time, given the constraints on the Exchequer, there is an overriding need to apply the resources that can be made available in the most efficient and effective way.  A single body should ensure that any duplication or overlapping of services will be eliminated and that resources are not wasted in unnecessary administration.</P>
    <P>These considerations led to the Government's decision to amalgamate An Foras and ACOT.  In taking that decision, the Government were mindful of the excellent services provided and the invaluable contributions made by both organisations over the years to the development of agriculture and the economy as a whole.  An Foras Talúntais have earned a worldwide reputation for the excellence of their research.  The improvements since the early Sixties in the production and quality of our primary farm products &mdash; in dairying, beef, pig production, crop husbandry and horticulture, for example &mdash; have been dramatic. <Col N="1714" /> ACOT, for their part, transformed the former county advisory services and the education services of my Department into an integrated, tightly organised national body.  In particular, they have, through the certificate in farming, achieved a major breakthrough in the training of farm entrants.  I confidently expect that the commitment and service to the farming community and to the food industry, which AFT and ACOT provided over the years, will continue under Teagasc.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the major provisions of the Bill.  In brief, it provides for the transfer of the existing functions, responsibilities, assets and liabilities of An Foras and ACOT to a new Authority &mdash; Teagasc &mdash; The Agriculture and Food Development Authority.</P>
    <P>This Irish name, meaning teaching or instruction, will, in my view, provide an appropriate short title for an organisation whose objective will be to transmit scientific and technological information to the agriculture and food industries.  The Bill, in outlining the functions of Teagasc in section 4, places special emphasis on the training of young farmers and in research in the food sector.  In singling out these priorities, the Government recognise the complementarity of these aims and also that the food processing sector is faced with changing consumer preferences and greater competition on home and export markets.  The priority to be given to entrants into farming will not mean the exclusion of the advisory services, as has been suggested, but rather will ensure that the advisory service will be utilised by fully trained farmers in a cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for Teagasc to be governed by a chairman and ten ordinary members.  The chairman and five of the ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the basis of appropriate experience or qualifications.  The remaining five will be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisations which the Minister determines are representative of persons engaged in agriculture and food industries or in its promotion or development. <Col N="1715" /> The latter provision reflects an amendment proposed by me during the passage of the Bill by the Dáil.  It strikes a balance between the Government's desire to appoint the best possible membership from the industry and the traditional practice of representative organisations nominating persons for appointment.  In deciding on the composition of the Authority, the Government's concern is that it should not be unwieldy in size but should consist of persons of the highest calibre in order to discharge its responsibilities in an effective, business-like manner.  Because of constraints on the Exchequer an important thrust in Government policy is that bodies such as Teagasc should have a strong commercial orientation and receive a good measure of funding from the industry.  Teagasc will be expected to secure funding from the agriculture and food sector to the maximum degree possible by gearing their services to the essential commercial development needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately extended the definition of agriculture in section 1 to include <i>inter alia</i>&ldquo;Agricultural Economics and Rural Development&rdquo;.  I have, as is now generally known, drawn up plans for a comprehensive integrated rural development programme and I initiated recently a pilot scheme in 11 selected areas throughout the country. The Bill in section 6, enables Teagasc to charge for any of their services, though charges in the case of education, training or advice will require ministerial approval because of the wider policy implications that such charges might have.  Charges in appropriate circumstances should establish an effective professional relationship between producer and adviser, ensure that the services are of the highest professional standards and are relevant to the needs of the users.  The Bill also provides that the new Authority, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, may engage in activities outside the State.  Both An Foras and ACOT have, over the years, built up a considerable reservoir of technical, scientific <Col N="1716" /> and other expertise and have earned a wide reputation overseas through their participation in international consultancies and other projects.  No doubt further opportunities for income generation will emerge in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable discussion over the past several months on the adequacy of the Exchequer funding for the research, advisory and training services. I explained, during the Dáil debate on the Bill, that the Estimates provision for AFT-ACOT services was based on certain expectations which did not fully materialise and accordingly I gave the undertaking that if there are any initial temporary difficulties it will be my purpose to ensure that Teagasc will not lack for essential funds to enable them to become an efficient, cost effective agency to service the agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate the view was expressed that the Bill was unduly restrictive in relation to the Authority's functions in veterinary research.  The restrictions were removed, however, by my tabling and appropriate amendment on Committee Stage which allows Teagasc wider scope in these areas of research.</P>
    <P>On the question of staff, it will be seen, from section 8, that, on the date of establishment of Teagasc, staff members of An Foras and ACOT will be transferred to and become members of it.  Such transfers of staff will be on the basis that their terms and conditions of service shall not be less favourable then those applying before transfer.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the inevitable staff reductions following the formation of a single agency, the new Authority will be formidable in size with a diverse range of important functions and nationwide distribution of staff and resources.  Their Exchequer funding requirements remain substantial.  It is important, therefore, that a proper balance should be struck between, on the one hand, the exercise of effective overall policy and financial control by the Minister and, on the other hand, scope for Teagasc to implement their mandate.  Section 13 accordingly <Col N="1717" /> provides for arrangements, on the lines of those in the Labour Services Act which covers the broadly analogous area of industrial training, whereby Teagasc will be required to furnish the Minister with an advance report of their planned activities and associated cost estimates for each year.  The report will indicate the main areas of intended resource allocation as between research, training and advisory work and will require the approval of the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance.  This mechanism will enable an adequate measure of central policy control while leaving Teagasc with the requisite degree of freedom and flexibility to carry out their work.  Under section 19 the Minister may give a direction to Teagasc to carry out, or not carry out, specified activities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amalgamation of An Foras and ACOT the Bill provides, in section 20, for the abolition of the county committees of agriculture.  The policy considerations which led to the decision to amalgamate An Foras and ACOT made it necessary also to review the position of the committees, particularly in view of the linkages with ACOT under present legislation.  The fact must be faced that, since the transfer to ACOT in 1980 of the committees' responsibilities for farm training and advice, the committees' scope for playing an active role in agricultural development work has become increasingly attenuated, particularly under the developments of the CAP and the pressure on national funding. The position now is that over 70 per cent of committee expenditure has been absorbed in travelling expenses of the members and payment to ACOT for administrative services.</P>
    <P>The Government have looked at the situation in the light of the general thrust of their rationalisation objectives and the need to shed any layer of public administration where possible.  They decided that in the integrated organisation of the agricultural services, the continued maintenance of the county committee structures could no longer be warranted on cost-effective criteria.  Hence, the Bill <Col N="1718" /> provides in section 20 for the dissolution of the committees.  Given the long-standing place of the committees in the local agricultural scene, that decision was not taken without a measure of regret.  Over the years, since their establishment in 1931, they have rendered a special service to Irish agriculture of which the Government were mindful.  However, I am sure that the new Authority will want to have available to them constant access to the best practical advice at local level and will make appropriate arrangements accordingly.</P>
    <P>In section 22 the Bill provides for the transfer to the Minister of the assets and liabilities of each committee on the date the legislation comes into effect.  Any sum remaining after the discharge of liabilities will be disposed of in a manner acceptable also to the Minister for the Environment since the committee funds have been derived in roughly equal measure from county council contributions and Exchequer grants.</P>
    <P>The legislation will have the consequence of terminating the statutory obligation on the councils to make annual contributions towards the cost of the agricultural services provided in the counties. The Government have directed that administrative arrangements be made to compensate for the loss of funding to agriculture through an appropriate transfer from the rates support grant provision in the Environment Vote.  The revised system will have beneficial effects in assisting the rationalisation of the local authority finances and eliminating wasteful administration in transfers of moneys from county councils through the committees of agriculture to ACOT.</P>
    <P>During the course of Committee Stage in the Dáil, I showed that I was prepared to take account of any suggestions to make Teagasc a more effective body.  The Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann shows this.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue on which I have been reflecting since the Dáil debate concluded, namely the question of Teagasc establishing subsidiaries generally, not merely wholly-owned as is currently provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want Teagasc to be as commercially <Col N="1719" /> oriented as possible in their operations. I have now decided, therefore, to table an amendment in the Seanad to remove the restriction to subsidiaries being wholly-owned. This will enable Teagasc to establish joint ventures with commercial interests, with, as already provided for in the Bill in relation to subsidiaries, ministerial consent.  I am sure this amendment will be generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>In summary then, the objectives behind the Government's decision to establish a new Authority are,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to bring together the education, training, advisory and research services under unified management for greater efficiency,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to deliver the specific services that are crucial to the success of the agriculture and food industry in the competitive environment in which it will have to operate in the coming years,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to get the best value for money for the Exchequer on the resources at the disposal of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in the Government's view, the most appropriate and effective framework within which these objectives can be realised in a dynamic and cost-effective manner to the future benefit of the agriculture and food industry and consequently to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will obey your ruling in the spirit and in the letter.  The Minister announced last year the Government's conversion in regard to the amalgamation of ACOT and AFT. Generally speaking, the move was welcomed but not for long.  When the Book of Estimates was published, what the Government really had in mind came out, and that was the proposed decimation of the research and education programme in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined budgets of ACOT and AFT in 1987 was around £38 million.  The Government's proposal for 1988 was to cut it to £20 million, or a percentage cut of almost 45 per cent.  The staff complement, both in ACOT and AFT at the end of 1987, stood at 2,200 persons approximately.  The logic of the Minister's proposal and, indeed, the demand <Col N="1721" /> of the directors of both bodies was to effect a staff reduction of 50 per cent. This, to start with, was completely impossible and indeed, impractical and unrealistic.  Even the Minister now realises this, but it has had a devastating effect on both bodies.</P>
    <P>That devastating effect ripples right out into the agricultural industry generally. The feeling of insecurity meant that many of the best people in both organisations opted to leave, bringing with them invaluable talents that Irish agriculture never more badly needed, but we will come back to that later.  We did not get precise figures on the numbers of people opting for redundancy or opting for redeployment but I gather at least 450 people have opted for redundancy, or a good deal fewer than half needed to meet the financial strictures laid down in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The way the Minister allowed the destructive trends to continue after the production of the Book of Estimates is absolutely outrageous.  The least he might have done was to see to it that there would be no redundancies or no redeployment until the new body were fully established and their staff needs properly worked out.  Even at this late stage the Minister could save some of the undoubted damage to the advisory, training and research services by putting a complete ban on the processing of redundancy and redeployment applications until the amalgamated body is up and running and until their staff have been properly determined.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil, and again here today, gave what I would call a halfhearted commitment that if the shedding of 1,000 staff could not be achieved in 1988, the budgetary shortfall would be made up by savings from other areas of his Department.  To his credit, I must say the Minister for State, Deputy Walsh, was much more positive in his commitment when he spoke on the matter in the Dáil.  If the commitment is true &mdash; and we hope it is &mdash; then the funding for this year must be increased by an extra £10 million to at least £30 million, rather <Col N="1722" /> than the £20 million laid down in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister bitten on the bullet at Estimates time and pegged the budget for this new organisation at, say, £30 million to £35 million, then we would not have the mayhem and flight of talent which the institute and ACOT have suffered since the Estimates publication. The Minister could have saved all of this had he even a little courage and said to his Department&rdquo;, I want a greater cut than 10 per cent in your expenditure in 1988&rdquo;.  Then we would have experienced very little of the damage that we have today.  But no, the soft target, or what was seen to be the soft target, was hit again.</P>
    <P>This country is hugely dependent upon agriculture.  Do I need to repeat that once again in this House?  I have spoken on every agricultural matter since I became spokesperson for my party.  I always find myself saying that.  I say it not to bore people, but of necessity.  It has been said on dozens of occasions in the Dáil in this debate that agriculture contributes almost half of the value of net exports when real raw material values are taken into account.  Nineteen per cent of the workforce are employed directly on the land.  That is the largest direct agricultural employment in what we call the older EC, the older Twelve.  It is among the very highest level of agricultural employment developed economies in what we call the First World as expressed through membership of the OECD.</P>
    <P>We have studies that show that good research, education and advice to the agricultural sector give a positive internal rate of return into the whole economy of about 16 per cent.  In 1970 the proportion of Government spending on agriculture was 15.5 per cent of total.  This year it is 2 per cent of total spending.  That is quite a dramatic fall since 1970.  I know the difference has been made up by transfers from the EC.  Nevertheless, that is what it is costing the taxpayer of this country at present.  It is against this background of facts that clearly illustrate the link between the sound agricultural economy and a well maintained, or growing, <Col N="1723" /> national income that this Government decided to cut back so disastrously on advice, research and education to our farmers.  They tried to do it on the sly by effecting vandalism, hidden or couched they hope, on what was originally a Fine Gael Bill to marry research and education back in 1978.  The Coalition proposal had, ten or 11 years ago, a realistic budget, unlike this one.  I know of hardly any other State in the developed world where the need to improve advice and research facilities to farmers is greater than the need of this country.  That is based on the earlier points, and on dozens of other arguments which I am not going to make here today but which have been made elsewhere.  Indeed, it might bore people if we repeat them too often.</P>
    <P>If we take 1987 we find, before this onslaught, that in comparison with neighbouring countries or, more important, in comparison with our main competitors, we spend less on research, development and advice.  We can make our comparisons in two ways.  If we look at expenditure as a proportion of gross added-value in agriculture, Ireland lags behind Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and West Germany on expenditure on R&amp;D. If we look at expenditure on advice and research <i>per capita</i> to the workforce on the land we get a much better reference, but we make a much worse finding.  By this reference we find that the UK spend three and a half times more than we do on research and development and on advice and education.</P>
    <P>In the UK the contribution to Gross National Product by agriculture is 2 per cent.  Here it is 11 per cent.  It makes an 11 per cent contribution to the Gross National Product.  Belgium spends twice as much as we do; the Netherlands spends one and a half times as much; France spends about one and a half times as much as we do on research, education and advice.  Denmark, with probably the most integrated and developed agricultural industry in the whole world, spends about 50 per cent more than we do.  Is it any wonder that Denmark, the <Col N="1724" /> Netherlands, Belgium and other countries beat us blind in marketing their products on the European and world markets?  Is it any wonder that we can make little progress in establishing ourselves in the growing world market for pork and pigmeat, especially in the Far Eastern markets competing with these people?  Good luck to them with the back up services which they have developed and which they intend to keep.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the pigmeat industry as an example.  In recent years we have invested millions of pounds in developing capacity to process something like three million pigs annually.  We have a national herd of pigs of about two million and the number is steadily falling.  If this Minister does what he is doing to AFT and ACOT it will fall even further.  Look at what is happening to the national cattle herd and the national cow herd.  Since 1984 cow numbers, which supply all the replacement stock to the beef sector, have fallen by one and a half million.  If present trends are not arrested, our beef output in 1992 will be lower than it was in 1978. At that time it was just recovering after the disasters of 1974 and 1975.  It will be lower in 1992 than it was in 1978 with countless millions lost to the economy.</P>
    <P>Good advisory services and education are important instruments in improving the situation.  The ACOT intensive programme proves this.  Last year there were 7,000 dry stock farmers participating in this scheme.  The achieved a 12 per cent, on average, increase in output in the year while, generally speaking, on all dry stock farms nationally &mdash; they are the ones not in the scheme &mdash; there was a fall in output in most cases or at best it remained static, or at about the level it was in 1986.</P>
    <P>Ewe numbers in the ACOT intensive scheme went up by 18 per cent on farms participating in the scheme, as against on increase of 10 per cent nationally.  They are the figures for 1987.  Another point we might make is that the vast majority of full or partial transfers of management control from older to younger farmers &mdash; about 1,500 in recent years &mdash; took place on farms where there was a very high level of contact with the ACOT advisory <Col N="1725" /> services.  In fact, many of them were organised through the aegis of ACOT.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have had the multi-launch of the western package.  The Minister and his caravan were moving from place to place trying to generate media hype about it and, I suppose, trying to assuage the anger of the small farmers arising from other cuts, such as the cuts in the social welfare area and grant payments, and the closure of drainage schemes.  There was no word, of course, about the fact that the money value of the western package scheme is no greater than the one announced in 1982.  There was no word, of course, that the new western package will apply using the same amount of money, not taking into account the effects of inflation or that it will apply in an area one third larger than it was in 1982, because of an extension of the disadvantaged areas, not that we are against the disadvantaged areas, lest somebody in front, behind or beside me should jump up and say I am saying that in some way to denigrate the extension of the disadvantage areas.  A proper package should have taken account, in money terms, of the fall in the value of money since 1982, and the increase by one third in territory since 1982 also.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of bruhaha about the integrated rural development programmes in my part of the world, the west of Ireland, by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn.  If we are to have integrated programmes, and if we are to decimate the research and advisory services, especially in the western region where the numbers of advisers on the ground has fallen by almost 50 per cent in recent years, and if we are to reduce this figure further, who will do the in-depth surveys in these regions before proper integrated programmes can be put in place?  Perhaps the Minister would answer that crucial question when he is replying to this debate.  These surveys will have to be in-depth socio-economic surveys. With the personnel of ACOT and AFT gone from the ground who has the expertise, knowledge, know-how or the wherewithal to compile it?  Would the <Col N="1726" /> Minister please answer that question when he is replying to this debate?</P>
    <P>What is to become of the very valuable contract research work done by AFT? Last year the institute earned £2.5 million in contracts research for the EC alone and almost £5 million from operating receipts from sales at the various research stations.  Let us not forget that AFT earned 33 per cent of their income from outside contracts and these operating receipts.  What is to become of all that activity?</P>
    <P>The Minister conveniently forgets to tell us that the cost of funding the Agricultural Institute at the end of 1987 was 77 per cent of what it was at the end of 1980.  The Minister also forgets to tell us that the cost of running ACOT at the end of 1987 was 74 per cent of what it was in 1980.  He also forgets to tell us that the cost of running the ever-burgeoning administrative side of his own Department increased to 106 per cent of what it was in 1980.</P>
    <P>Another question we might ask is why is there duplication of research work in animal disease, cereals, potatoes and so on in the Minister's Department?  Is it that the Minister is afraid of vested intersts within the walls of Agriculture House to end this duplication and unnecessary waste, especially given that so much of the emphasis in this Bill is upon saving money?  What is to become of the independence and quality of AFT's annual farm management survey?  This is the only independent, objective, comprehensive report on the state of agricultural income compiled and published annually in the State.  What will happen to that excellent publication issued quarterly by the institute called <i>Farm and Food Research</i>?  I believe section 10 clearly poses a threat to publications by the new body.  We must ask are the independence and objectivity that have been so well identified with anything published by the institute or ACOT to end because of the greater control over the new body by the Minister?</P>
    <P>What guarantees can the Minister give this House this evening that resources will be maintained to continue research <Col N="1727" /> into breeding stock profligacy given the disastrous drop in cattle, cow and pig numbers?  Will we continue to investigate the efficiency of the feeds we use and on which the institute had been doing excellent research?  Will we continue our research and advice on pre- and post-harvest care of crops and technology? Will research and advice on appropriate crops and enterprises for the appropriate places continue against the ever-increasing climate of competition and the ever-evident madness of inappropriate farming practices, allowing that the expenditure on this new body this year may be £30 million rather than the £20 million as predicted in the Book of Estimates?  We hope the Minister will keep his word on that one.  Can we have an assurance for the Minister that the £30 million figure at the outturn of 1988 will be the bottom line for budgeting for the new body for all future years?</P>
    <P>Quite a number of amendments will be moved on Committee Stage.  Could I mention in passing the very name of this new body, Teagasc?  It is generally unpopular or rejected throughout the industry.  Even the ordinary small farmer finds it very difficult to come to terms with it.  An Foras Talúntais and, of course, ACOT, have occupied a very special place in the consciousness of most farmers. The very name of this body, wherever it was devised, is so off-putting.  I would plead with the Minister to have another look at the title he is giving this new body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister for Agriculture to this House.  I would also like to welcome the Bill which he has presented this afternoon and which has been debated at length in the other House.  There are three main objectives behind the Government's decision to establish this new Authority; first, to bring together the education, training, advisory and research services under unified management for greater efficiency; second, to deliver the specific services <Col N="1728" /> that are crucial to the success of the agricultural and food industry in the competitive environment in which it will have to operate in the coming years, and thirdly, to get the best value for money for the Exchequer from the resources at the disposal of Teagasc.  None of us can disagree with those three objectives.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the amendment which the Minister is bringing forward at this stage.  It shows he has been listening to the debate in the other House and that he is prepared to make amendments and to make changes in the Bill if it is in the best interests of agriculture.  I am referring to the question of Teagasc establishing subsidiaries generally.  The changes the Minister has made there are to be welcomed.  He wants Teagasc to be as commercially oriented as possible in their operations and he has now decided to table an amendment in the Seanad to remove the restrictions to subsidiaries being wholly-owned.  This will enable Teagasc to establish joint ventures with commercial interests with ministerial consent, as already provided for in the Bill.  The change is to be welcomed and I am sure it will be welcomed by everybody in the agricultural industry also.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly said that agriculture is undergoing a period of rapid &mdash; almost revolutionary &mdash; change at present.  All of us who have an interest in agriculture witness those changes and sometimes we wonder why we are witnessing those rapid changes or if we can survive in this rapidly-changing world.  It is certain that we will not survive if we decide to stand still.  We must always search out and respond to opportunities that present themselves.  We must make full use of modern technology and use that technology to our advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Authority will be responsible for establishing the knowledge base of the most important agriculture and food sector in any European country.  Our agriculture and food exports amount to 27.6 per cent of our total exports, which is the highest proportion in the European Communities. Our external trade as a percentage of GNP is at 62 per cent.  One can see from <Col N="1729" /> those figures the importance of the agriculture and food industry for Ireland.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be criticism from certain quarters of the measures proposed in this Bill.  Indeed, this is to be expected because certain people and organisations can have a vested interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, but if we have the best interests of agriculture at heart, we must take those criticisms on board and deal with them.  We must also be prepared to change our views, or change course, as some commentators will accuse the Government of doing on this occasion, considering statements that were made during the debate on the National Agriculture Educational Research, Advisory, Education and Authority Bill in 1977 and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta Bill, enacted in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Governments on both occasions were doing what they considered best for Irish agriculture at that time but that was ten or 11 years ago and things have changed drastically in those ten years. There was no talk of super-levies or quotas in those days.  Farmers were instructed to increase productivity by every means possible and told that there would be a ready market available for their produce.  If we look at the situation as regards milk in those intervening ten or 11 years, we see that the number of milk suppliers in 1961 was 104,700; in 1978, that figure, because of the constraints on the production of milk, the quotas, levies and so on has been reduced to 52,500.  That is the situation.  Nobody could foresee that kind of thing happening ten years ago when farmers were being encouraged to produce and produce and advised that there would be a ready market available for them.  That is the reality of the situation and the same can be said of the situation as regards the suckler herd which is about half what it was in 1978.  Again, there were very few people who could foresee that kind of situation arising away back when the Bills for these Authorities, that have been debated so much, were being discussed in 1977 and 1979.  So, we have to march ahead and change with the times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Over the years, An Foras Talúntais have contributed enormously to the development of our agriculture.  The research carried out by their dedicated staff has been an enormous benefit to Irish farmers who have eagerly sought their advice.  Their first director, Dr. Tom Walsh, pioneered soil-testing and grassland management and indeed has a number of publications to his name.  He also took a very keen interest in land drainage.  I had the pleasure of working very closely with him during my years in the Department of Agriculture, particularly when I launched the western drainage scheme in 1978.  He was a very enthusiastic supporter of that scheme because he saw in it an opportunity for the western farmer to reclaim marginal land and so improve his standard of living.  Indeed, that was a very good scheme because it provided us &mdash; for the very first time &mdash; with a 70 per cent grant for land drainage and a lot of the red tape we associate with many of those schemes was cut out.  Much of a Minister's time is taken up in trying to get rid of the red tape and trying to make those schemes simpler for the farmers.  This was one scheme, the western drainage scheme which was a huge success because a lot of the red tape was cut out.  The target set of a quarter of a million acres of land was achieved and, indeed, exceeded, and for that reason I believe it contributed enormously to the development of agriculture in the western region.</P>
    <P>Dr. P. Ryan is the current director and he, too, has made a tremendous contribution to agricultural development in this country.  ACOT, as we know, is a much younger organisation and it was their job to take over the 27 independent advisory services and streamline them. We know, too, that it was a very difficult task for them but their director and officers throughout the country showed great determination in bringing all those more or less independent authorities under one umbrella.</P>
    <P>Like every other public representative, I am sorry to see the departure of the county committees of agriculture.  I served for a number of years on a county <Col N="1731" /> committee of agriculture and indeed I found it a very useful forum at which all agricultural matters pertaining to the county were debated thoroughly and very useful schemes were initiated.  The setting up of ACOT took away much of the power of the committees of agriculture and from there on they were merely advisory committees without any real muscle.</P>
    <P>I regret that elected councillors will not be represented on the new board and to my mind this is a weakening of local democracy.  Those elected councillors were answerable to the electorate every five years but the appointed member is answerable to nobody, or at least not in the same way as the elected member.</P>
    <P>One great advantage of the old committee of agriculture system was that every few parishes had their own adviser and farmers availed readily of that advisory service.  Whether it was testing soil fertility or planning farm buildings the adviser was always at hand.  Under ACOT the advisers got thinner on the ground.  Many of the ACOT offices throughout the county were closed and you got advisers who specialised in a particular area of farming, let it be dairying, beef production, tillage or whatever. Eventually, we have reached a stage where farmers are being charged for the advisory service and advisers are expected to generate an income of from £5,000 to £7,000 each.  I disagreed with this type of policy and indeed Galway County Committee of Agriculture, of which I was a member at the time, expressed disagreement with this type of policy also.  Our principal objection was that you cannot treat farmers in the western counties in the same way as you treat farmers in the more prosperous eastern and southern regions.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the west have many disadvantages and I will mention just a few in passing.  The first, I would say, is the weather.  We get quite an amount of rain in the west, a lot more than in the remainder of the country.  The second is the soil. We have an inferior quality of soil in the west.  We all know that.  We have the <Col N="1732" /> drumlin soil in Leitrim, for example, and we have the other soil in Connemara which is very much inferior to any of the other soils in any other part of the country.  We also have the structure of the farms.  They are fragmented and, accordingly, they are more difficult to manage.  You cannot have the same production levels on those farms as you would have, say, on a farm in County Meath or in County Cork.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that in the west you have a large number of elderly people who are registered owners of farms and for various reasons they are slow in handing on their farms to younger and more progressive successors.  A number of schemes were introduced over the years to try to correct the social structure of agriculture in the west, including the EC retirement scheme.  Unfortunately, those schemes have not been successful and have not made the impact that we had hoped they would.</P>
    <P>The western package has been mentioned by my colleague from the west, Senator Connor, and I see the western package negotiated recently by the Minister, as a great boost for agriculture in the western counties.  The increased funding from Europe for cattle-housing, for roads, pollution control etc., will encourage farmers to develop their farms and provide the type of accommodation for their cattle that farmers in the better-off regions have had for years.</P>
    <P>I believe it is only right that this kind of incentive should be offered to the western farmers at this time and, as I said at so many meetings, it will be bringing £87 million into the western region over the next three years.  Whatever type of scheme that money is to be spent on, it is not to be scoffed at and I believe that western farmers will take full advantage of it.  I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis being placed on accommodation for cattle, to try to get the cattle in off the land during the winter period, because that is not only damaging to the cattle &mdash; they cannot thrive as well when they are out on the land over the winter months &mdash; but it is also damaging the land structure, poaching the land, and so on. <Col N="1733" /> For that reason I think it is very important that farmers should be encouraged to provide proper housing for their cattle for the winter months.  I believe that the increased grants being offered under this scheme will encourage farmers in the west to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this new body will, I hope, revitalise agricultural development in this country.  I believe that when they get off the ground Teagasc, which will be staffed by the best from the two Authorities now being amalgamated, will provide the best possible service for agriculture.  They may have teething problems, and we all accept that because most organisations at the start have this kind of problem.  I believe the Government will be keeping the situation constantly under review and if there are problems those can be sorted out.  If additional finance is needed to provide the best possible service for agriculture I believe this Government will not shirk their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this new body is a challenge to agriculture.  It is taking into consideration the changes that have taken place over the years.  I believe that we can all look forward to a period of revitalisation when we will have the best service possible for Irish agriculture.  We should support this new body because agriculture is our main industry and we know quite well that if agriculture is going well then everything else is going well also.  For that reason, I wish this new organisation every success.  I hope it will be staffed with the best possible people and I believe that that will be the case from what I have heard from the Minister. I know that he has the interests of agriculture at heart and that he will select the best people to act on this board.</P>
    <P>There will be 11 members, ten and a chairman.  I had certain reservations about the number of people on the board. I thought perhaps if you had a larger board you might have a better chance of getting a fairer spread of the best possible people to serve on the board.  I am sure the Minister has done his research into this and if he is satisfied that ten members and a chairman are sufficient, then I go <Col N="1734" /> along with that.  I wish them every success and I hope that before too long we will see this new organisation off the ground and that we can look forward to a period of improved standards for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister into the House with this legislation. Being a Tipperary man, there is a natural affinity between us and he can rest assured that any contribution that I may make on the Bill, by way of Second Stage speech or by way of amendments, will be constructive because the amalgamation of these two bodies, AFT and ACOT, is something that we on the General Council of Agricultural Committees and, indeed, in the country committees, have discussed for some considerable time.  As a matter of principle we have always felt that these two bodies could be united, with the elimination of any duplication which there might have been, and so bring together the best brains in the country in the area of education and research.  So, from a point of principle, we start in total agreement.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate too, that Senator Connor should put on the record that the original Bill had all these bodies together in one effective unit.  I know the Minister does not like looking backwards but it is appropriate to put on record that it was a Fianna Fáil Government that separated them.  Bringing back this level of research and education under the one roof is long overdue.  I am glad that the Minister had the courage to do so.  I was extremely disappointed with the budget which was published this year in the knowledge that this amalgamation was taking place but I am also conscious of the fact that the Minister has made some kind of commitment about a possible increase in funding if that is considered to be necessary. We will look with interest to that commitment in the future and we want to see proof positive that the Minister's words and, indeed, the comment of the Minister of State can be taken as serious, particularly in view of the stated intention of the Government to have further cutbacks in all areas in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> I am extremely concerned that there may not be sufficient funding for this new body to carry out their functions. Reference has been made to the name Teagasc.  Everybody who made a submission to members of my party and to the other speakers, passed a comment on the name of this new organisation.  I know the word in the Irish language refers to what this new body will do.  Unfortunately, it is too much like the name of an anthelmintic for my liking.  Something more imaginative could have been thought up.  One of the first objections the staff who will work in this new group had was to the name and how it could be interpreted by the farming community as being the magical body who will look after research, development, education and training.</P>
    <P>A review committee was set up in 1985 by the then Minister who gave a group of knowledgeable people a brief to review the operation of the advisory and training services provided by ACOT and the research services provided by An Foras Talúntais with a view to establishing the fullest possible degree of co-ordination between the services and ensuring that the resources which can be made available are used to the best advantage in helping the agricultural industry to expand and to make recommendations in relation to these matters. That was the brief set down for the committee chaired by Mr. Cashman, a former President of the IFA.  I notice also that some of the Department nominees are still advising the Minister, so continuity has followed through from the brief to what eventually came out in the report.</P>
    <P>The report was widely welcomed by the industry in general.  It was responded to positively by ACOT who had, naturally, a keen interest in what an outside review body would have to say about an area in which they were involved directly. Many changes had taken place in the relationship between staff and their clients, and the redefinition of some of the advisory roles of county committees of agriculture.  Naturally, the board and <Col N="1736" /> the membership of ACOT, the county committees and the general council discussed the report and published a lengthy response which took into account some of the areas the Minister has now taken on board in the legislation.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that ACOT had made quite a lot of changes from the time they were set up to the time of the report of this review committee which led to this legislation.  There is no doubt that the new client-enterprise system, based on the district unit which was being operated by ACOT, had a major input into agricultural advice and training.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach, with his experience in that area and having been elected on that panel, knows exactly the work ACOT and their staff throughout the country have put into the new client-enterprise system which had been in operation for a number of years and was working very satisfactorily.  It is important that that role should not be diminished in any way by legislation to amalgamate and bring under one body, agricultural research and training.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Connor, I am concerned about the independence of the new body. Agricultural research requires independence particularly as it had a great deal of independence in the past.  The people who used the service depended on the absolute and completely independent views given by An Foras Talúntais.  I sincerely hope that any apparent restrictions in the Bill are without foundation. I have no doubt that if there are restrictions on the independence of research, on who this research will be made available to on the findings of the research, this will worry the staff.</P>
    <P>Many changes have taken place.  I hope there will be a continuation of the certificate on farming which is coming to the end of one of its modules.  I am pleased to have had a major input in trying to ensure that the concept of the certificate on farming and the use of youth employment funds were accepted by the then Government.  I am confident that the products of that course will stand to the industry in the future.  They have now achieved a level of competence and <Col N="1737" /> expertise which had not been readily available even through the formal agricultural college courses.</P>
    <P>The role of ACOT cannot be understated. In their response to the publication of this document ACOT listed their idea of what should be put in place by way of legislation.  They mentioned, in particular, technology transfer in their report to the Minister.  The three main functions listed were the areas of enterprise, discipline and leadership.  In addition, the review group saw the specialities as an essential link in technology transfer especially in relation to AFT.</P>
    <P>In developing this dimension of the specialist's role the report is most progressive and points out that the link between the specialist and the research worker could be the more basic contact between the two organisations the Minister is now linking under this legislation. This should be a key link in the regular exchange of information between the bodies.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to recommend the development of a continuous and formalised liaison mechanism between the specialised adviser or enterprise leader in ACOT and the research worker in AFT. The Bill goes down that road to a very large degree.  It goes even further by putting them under the control of a board with management structure and a reporting process and procedure which will eliminate some of the duplication and will try to get this fusion between the best brains in the country engaged in agricultural training and research.</P>
    <P>In that regard I join with Senator Hussey in paying tribute to some of the people involved in the two areas in the past, Dr. Tom Walsh the original director of ACOT, his successor Dr. Downey, who, I think, is one of the greatest brains in agriculture, and to Dr. Ryan in AFT. I have worked closely with all of these people and with people who are working in these positions at present through the general council.  I have been on deputations to them representing county committees of agriculture and the general <Col N="1738" /> council.  I have had nothing but co-operation from these people and the agencies they represent.  I hope that recognition will be given to the expertise available from these two men by whoever chairs this new body.  I also pay tribute to some of their staff, who have expressed extreme concern about the level of funding to which I have referred briefly.  The Minister has more or less assured us that that will not be a problem.  They were of the opinion that for any amalgamated body which had a budget of less than £30 million &mdash; this amalgamated body has an allocation of less than that &mdash; the effect would be to reduce agricultural research and advice to a level of irreversible decay and to a level where nothing worthwhile on a national basis could be achieved. Charging for services is one way to overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>In this legislation there are provisions which should make it possible for the new body to charge for their services.  These charges would be at the discretion of the board, subject to the control of the Minister. Basically the whole concept of charging through this new board is a reversal of a procedure ACOT had advocated because they suddenly found that, if they charged for services and unless some categories of farmers were exempt from these charges, the whole concept of trying to give advice to people in an area that could not afford advice would be extremely serious for the industry.</P>
    <P>It was stated by the previous Government that, to accelerate growth in agricultural output, one must concentrate on the segment of the farming population which has real development potential.  At times, people in that category are those least well able to afford the charges.  At that time we were asking ACOT to concentrate their advisory service on farmers who had the resources and the motivation to achieve this development.  The Government pointed out that a significant number of farmers have considerable potential for development which could be realised with the support of an intensive advisory service which only the State is in a position to provide. In other words, the State should not be <Col N="1739" /> dependent totally on this segment being able to make the changes and make the investment without some level of State intervention by way of advice and research.</P>
    <P>I hope that whatever charges emanate from this legislation &mdash; and I will be trying to indemnify sub-sectors by way of amendment &mdash; the whole concept of trying to help people to help themselves particularly in the area of agriculture will not be forgotten by a board who may be starved of State funding and may have to resort to making charges which would be outside the scope of the beneficiaries to contribute to.  If we do not realise that is a possibility we have lost the game.  We are trying to get advice to people who perhaps need specialist advice but cannot afford to pay for it.  The specialist advice is already available privately through the private sector at creameries and co-operatives. I know farmers who have paid for that service but the advice they get is never independent advice.  It is always advice with some vested interest attached to it.</P>
    <P>It is important that the State should be able to give advice which is in the best interests of farmers and the national economy as a whole.  By charging for advice, we might remove a segment of the agricultural community, which I would be concerned about, and which research by the country committees showed was at risk.  Changes are taking place in Europe, and nobody is more competent to talk about the changes and the challenges that are there than the Minister.  He knows the changes that will have to be made in Irish agriculture to try to keep pace with all the demands that have been made on his Department by his colleagues, the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance in other countries. There is no bonanza out there any more for us.  Major changes are already taking place in the milk industry, the milk assembly industry, in the production, research and development of new products and in marketing.</P>
    <P>The Minister witnessed recently what had happened in County Kilkenny over <Col N="1740" /> 21 years.  Who would have believed 21 years ago that what is there now would have been possible?  These are the kind of changes that are taking place.  They have only taken place with assistance, guidance and advice and much of that advice was given through the county committees of agriculture, by the board of ACOT and by our agricultural advisers. It is a pity the Minister can decide with the stroke of a pen that county committees of agriculture do not have a place in this new structure.  I know they were linked together in the legislation that set up ACOT.  I am confirmed in my belief that some input at county level is required.  The Minister said that the board of Teagasc may appoint local advisory committees.  I will be insisting that they should do so.  I am also of the belief that some of that advice is already available and was made available free of charge when there was a curtailment of expenditure at county committee level. Advice was available from political groupings and county councils who had direct responsibility for funding the county committees' work until the changes took place with the ACOT Bill.  The General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture, a statutory body, are not even mentioned in the legislation. That is a disservice to a body who coordinated all the country committees and were very responsible in any proposals they made to the Minister, or to his officials, or to his predecessors.  They never went out to grab the headlines. They were always constructive in what they said and they were always supportive of the Minister and his Department.  I am pleased to say that the board of ACOT were always complimentary to the county committee structure and to the general council.</P>
    <P>One cannot throw away 40 or 50 years of excellent voluntary advice given at county committee level by way of new legislation without ensuring some replacement.  I am quite sure I am reflecting the views of every Fianna Fáil county councillor when I say this.  I am not just expressing a party opinion on this, but I am expressing what has been <Col N="1741" /> said by every county committee of agriculture in Ireland and by most Fianna Fáil county councillors I have spoken to. I understand that they were recently on a deputation and one final effort was made to convince the Taoiseach that this legislation should be amended accordingly. I will be trying to assist the Minister in giving county committees a different type of structure and certainly there will be an amendment to that section which would make it obligatory on this new board to have regard to local opinion and to have a structure set up.  There are experts available at county level.  The farming organisations will verify this and the people with agricultural expertise who are elected by the people will be available to this new board to assist in preparing plans and programmes.  If it is all directed from the top, nothing will happen at ground level because there is always and has always been a relationship between the farmer on the ground, his local adviser and his county committee representative.</P>
    <P>In the development programme published by ACOT which brought us up to the nineties, they actually confirmed that they relied on the guidance and support of district advisory committees, county committees of agriculture and farming organisations to ensure that services at district and county level were operating to a maximum effect and were fully responsive to the needs of farmers.  That is what ACOT considered the county committee role was.  That was their input in the past and that is what I consider the input in the future should be.  I am disappointed that this legislation does not seem to reflect that concept.</P>
    <P>Another part of the legislation to which I object in principle is the transfer of property.  This has been a pet subject of mine for some time.  The county committees were set up through the generosity of county councils and ratepayers &mdash; and ratepayers at that time included county council cottiers as well as shopkeepers and farmers.  Ratepayers were generous in their support in the striking of rates and, through that process, county committees acquired property with <Col N="1742" /> premises suitable for educational programmes, for night classes, for adult education for farmers, for meeting places for farming organisations and a whole lot of things.  They put all those together at very little expense to the State.</P>
    <P>The ACOT Bill came along and set in train a process whereby property could be transferred back to the board of ACOT. They were supposed to compensate county committees afterwards so that there would be some compensation for the offices taken over by ACOT.  No such transfer of resources ever took place between the board of ACOT and county committees to help us to do some of our budgeting at county committee level.  The Minister takes upon himself all these properties, paid for and unpaid for to which the Departments of Finance and Agriculture in the past made a minimal contribution by way of capital grants or capital contribution.  The counties put in the major funding and the Minister is giving them to this new amalgamated body as their property.  I object to that. County committees of agriculture could have been and should have been recompensed, and certainly county councils who are starved of cash should have been in some way recompensed for the contribution they made through that complicated rating structure.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there was a certain ambuigity about how the funds were moving from county councils to county committees and back to ACOT and there was a certain amount of unreality about it.  There was also unreality when striking the rates this year.  I still had demands on the county council in South Tipperary for money for ACOT. ACOT could not tell me what it was for but some auditor said: &ldquo;If you do not put this in we will remove this from your rate support grant&rdquo;.  We had an ultimatum to include the figure although, technically, from 1 January we did not have a county committee of agriculture.  I hold the view that the county committees of agriculture are still legally in force until this law is passed and signed by the President to abolish them as such.</P>
    <P>By starving them of funds the Minister <Col N="1743" /> actually killed them while they were in hospital.  We knew they were dying but he killed them in hospital before they had a chance to recover or get better.  This is the last opportunity to give them a bit of an injection by putting down an amendment to ensure that there is some county structure.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will give some consideration to what I am saying because I do not trust any body he sets up with his authority and with some of his nominees on it, because there will be other nominees.  They may not want to have any input whatsoever from a local point of view.  ACOT know the differences in soil structures, the whole layout of the actual management structures and all the different facets of farming in Ireland in Donegal or in Cork. They are all so different that it is important to have a local view.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the voluntary redundancies that have been applied for and there seems to be some dispute about the figures.  In a letter to me dated 8 February the Minister confirmed that between 450 and 500 public servants would avail of the offer of early retirement. In my opinion, having talked with some people who opted for early retirement, agriculture will be the poorer for it.  It is a pity that some of the people who applied had so little confidence in the future of this body that they opted out.  I am concerned about the impact of the loss of scientists and experts on this new board.  People like that are irreplaceable. It is a tragedy that the board started off on the wrong footing.  The board should have been set up first of all.  This would have eliminated duplication in natural wastage besides giving people an opportunity to get out while the two ships were meeting, before both of them were sunk and replaced with a new liner.  The best seamen jumped overboard and most of the captains.</P>
    <P>I want to see this new body succeeding. I want to see a new vibrant body with the best brains in the country available to us. Because of the budget we are likely to lose up to 1,000 people in the service. That would mean that the staff of AFT <Col N="1744" /> and ACOT jointly would lose half their membership.  That must be a very bad beginning for any new board.  Let us hope the Minister will remember that he will need additional funding to set this body up and running.  People need advice on cow numbers and the beef herd and, if that advice is not taken and actively pursued, the agricultural sector could be in a desperate economic situation within four or five years.  The Minister is aware of this.  He does not need me to tell him. Between now and 1992, when we will have other problems, agriculture will have to be geared to take account of the changes which will take place because in Europe where they are so far advanced in their agricultural structures that we need the best possible chance to be able to compete with them.</P>
    <P>There are signs that we are able to do that in some areas such as I mentioned last week.  There are signs that there are people in management in the milk assembly industry who are capable of matching that challenge, but we also need to help the producer.  After all, they are all dependent on the producer.  The producer who is now so restricted will have every conceivable bit of advice and research available to him on what his farm can do, what area production it can achieve without being penalised because the super-levy and the quota system involve quite a penalty, apart altogether from the fact that you can only achieve a certain production figure.  If you exceed it by even a gallon you can actually disqualify yourself from a lot of the grants to which you would normally be entitled. It may not be generally known that farmers who exceed their milk quota actually disadvantage themselves by taking themselves out of grant assistance and any grants that have been paid to them can be recouped by the Department quite legally.  This is part of the EC regulation; this is part of the community policy. There is a big stick all the time over people in the area of over-production and now, in particular, coming into an area of consciousness about agricultural pollution. Farmers need assistance with pollution control.  They need grants.  If they <Col N="1745" /> are unfortunate enough to exceed their quota, they can exclude themselves from that category of beneficiary.  I hope that that is not true, but I understand that that is the case and people should be aware of it.  Flexi-milk and other schemes have been tried.  You have been trying to do your best to grapple with the problems of milk production throughout the country, on the advice of ACOT and other organisations. This has created an imbalance in the minds of people who are capable of increasing production without penalty.</P>
    <P>We have a major task in front of us and we have to have across the political divide an understanding of this industry and general support for it.  I only hope that, in spite of some of the concerns we have in this area, perhaps this legislation, warts and all, may have the effect of bringing our act together, bringing the two bodies together, bringing the staff and the experts of the two bodies together.  I sincerely hope that adequate funding will be available to them to have the staff and any directions about what they can or cannot do will not unduly restrict them.  They had a certain amount of autonomy and responded, in consultation with local people, to local needs.  They always had regard to the overall funding available from the State and the restrictions that put on them.</P>
    <P>There must be flexibility for this new board so that they can act within their budget.  They must be able to promote schemes and plans and carry out research within their budget without being restricted by the Minister, the Department or &mdash; and this is what would worry me most &mdash; the Department of Finance.  Some people in the Department of Finance who set-up programmes for agricultural development had only one interest in mind, and that was finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and I say this in support of any discussions the Minister might want to have with the Department of Finance in the future.  I was privileged <Col N="1746" /> to sit on a board who prepared a four-year plan for agriculture on behalf of the State.  I was reappointed by Deputy Lenihan and this might be an indication that I made some contribution to the committee.  Our biggest problem was with the input from the Department of Finance and any scheme to assist people that did not have a pay back for the State was immediately considered to be a risk and probably should not have been recommended as part of an overall plan for the development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>That can be a very negative book-keeping exercise in the area of agriculture, which is an industry of risk, good fortune, has the blessings of God and a little bit of help from Europe.  That is the kind of industry we are in.  We depend on God every day of the week for fine weather. We need a lot of support and we pray daily for it.  This Bill &mdash; and I do not know whether it is a novena Bill &mdash; has an aspiration and a bit of prayer about it.  I hope that the finances from Government will be improved because if the board are restricted by the finances the Minister has allocated to them this year they will not succeed.  I hope the Minister will be successful in getting more finance because there needs to be a financial commitment. They should not have to depend on charges like the local authorities had to do.  When the Government removed funding from the local authorities they had to depend on charges.  The charges were almost inoperable and people had to disregard their needs.  There is a social and economic need in the agricultural area which many people do not recognise. I hope that whatever ensues on Committee Stage will be constructive and supportive of what the Minister is trying to do in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address the purpose of this Bill which will, firstly, amalgamate the Agricultural Institute, AFT, and ACOT and transfer all their functions to a single body which will have responsibility for agricultural, advisory, training, educational and research services. Secondly, it will provide for the <Col N="1747" /> abolition of county committees of agriculture. I wish to deal first with the second purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am a farmer and I have been a member of the County Longford Committee of Agriculture for many years. Section 20 of the Bill states that the committees of agriculture established by the Agricultural Act, 1931, shall, on the establishment day, become and be dissolved. The policy considerations which led the Minister to the decision to amalgamate the Agricultural Institute and ACOT, has made it necessary for them to look at the position of county committees of agriculture, particularly in view of the close links of committees with ACOT under the present legislation.  I also recognise that since the transfer of county committees of agriculture property, moneys and responsibility for agricultural institutions in 1980, the scope of committees in playing an active and leading role in agricultural development work has become progressively weaker, particularly as a result of EC conditions and the pressures on Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the County Longford Committee of Agriculture is that over 70 per cent of their funds have been absorbed by the travelling expenses of members, the payment to ACOT for the services of their chief agricultural officer and staff officer and for the use of the ACOT centre in Longford.  What is left goes to pay for a very limited number of schemes for farm development.  The Government looked at this situation in the light of their general programme of rationalisation and the need to shed any layer of public administration where possible.  Hence, we in this House are confronted with the dissolution of the county committees of agriculture.  Before we take section 20 of this Bill on board, we should look at how this section squares with the development of democracy at local and county level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record my deep concern at the growing trend in recent years of centralising activities in every walk of life, at national level or in the capital city of Dublin.  I am fully aware <Col N="1748" /> that Government financial policy should face reality in putting the economy back on the road to long term sustained economic growth.  There are, however, some aspects of the policy presently operated which make me uneasy.  This arises especially with the dismantling of local bodies, such as the county committees of agriculture and the regional development organisations.  Over the years they underpinned local development but they are now being struck down, their functions handed over to national highly centralised bodies and their staffs drastically reduced.  In 1979 there were 14 professional ACOT staff and three clerical officers serving the farmers of County Longford, most of whom were smallholders. Today, more than half of those people have gone and the remainder are nearing retirement.  I will deal with this matter when I refer to other sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Because of the longstanding place of county committees of agriculture in the daily lives of farmers and rural people, I regret that section 20 was included in this Bill.  The agricultural development and the consequent rise in the standard of living of farm families which we have seen over the past decades has without doubt been due in great measure to the hard work and dedication of the members of the county committees of agriculture who discharged their duties to promote, foster and develop agriculture in all areas with remarkable thoroughness and success, considering the very limited annual financial allocation under which they had to operate.  I exhort the Minister to put in place new structures at local or county level to replace those that are proposed to be dismantled.  Those new structure would not hinder cost-effectiveness or thwart policies of financial rectitude; rather, in the final analysis they would involve and commit local farmers, homemakers and rural people to the development of rural areas.</P>
    <P>Section 20 must be broadened so that arrangements can be put in place whereby the Minister will have constant access to the best practical advice at local level.  Too often in the past individuals <Col N="1749" /> and organisations, without any mandate from the people, have criticised the county committees of agriculture unjustly and in many cases attempted to blame them for the lack of development in counties.  The general tendency to blame everything on politicians seeps down to all levels of politics and the totally unjustified suggestion that county committees of agriculture are out of touch with the refinements of farming stem from the unjustified allegation that politicians do not have sufficient knowledge of the industry.  The simple fact is that 90 per cent of the members of county committees of agriculture are farmers and most of them are leading farmers in their own localities.  This Bill ought to ensure that structures which will include people of similar standing will be put in place.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the main thrust of the Bill, the amalgamation of ACOT and AFT into one body.  I hope the Bill will have a quick passage into law and that the merger of those two bodies will take place smoothly and quickly in order to maintain and strengthen staff morale.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very wise to allow Teagasc to become involved in basic veterinary research, including TB research.  This is a very important concession because there has been a very bad bovine TB problem in County Longford since 1986 and it appears that we are only now getting ahead of the problem.  Time and again over the past decade the members of the County Longford Committee of Agriculture and their subsidiary, the County Voluntary Animal Health Committee, have requested the Department of Agriculture to intensify studies on the nature and causes of bovine tuberculosis.  In desperation, they went even further and asked the Government to amend sections 20 and 23 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, so as to exclude badgers from the list of protected wild animals because it appeared that badgers play a major role in the transmission of bovine TB.  I am sure that Teagasc will look at problems like that as soon as they get their act together.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill enables Teagasc <Col N="1750" /> to charge for any of their services and it appears that the new body will be required to secure outside funding by charging for services to the maximum degree possible.  In so doing it appears that the income earning targets will be maintained at realistic levels and will not exceed current levels.  In this way, Teagasc will maintain contact with the maximum number of viable farmers.  In this connection it is essential that the new organisation get under way quickly with a sound programme of rural development in disadvantaged areas, of which County Longford is part.</P>
    <P>There are about 60 DEDs in County Longford and it is classified as a disadvantaged area.  Thirteen of these DEDs are classified as severely handicapped. If it is not possible for the Minister to classify all of County Longford as a severely handicapped area, I ask him to have another look at about 20 of these DEDs because on the basis of population, emigration and GMS card holders those areas are equally as bad as the ones that are classified as severely handicapped. I would ask the Minister to take a look at that situation.</P>
    <P>Restrictive farm prices and milk quotas are putting ever-increasing pressure on farm families.  Therefore in order to ensure the continued viability of rural communities in County Longford and other disadvantaged areas, adequate levels of advisory and training services from Teagasc must be maintained without expecting the farmers concerned to pay for appreciable increases in charges. Teagasc, at no extra cost to farmers in the disadvantaged areas, should have a strong rural development base and should put emphasis on employment creation, both directly and indirectly, so as to maintain the population levels in the disadvantaged areas.  Rural development programmes that enhance employment opportunities and increase population in the less favoured areas of the country are a very slow, tedious and painstaking process and for that reason Teagasc must be provided with additional Exchequer funding over what farmers in those areas can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> I should like at this stage to compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, for withstanding pressure in the Dáil last week and for retaining the name Teagasc for the new body.  Teagasc is a good Gaelic name and should present no difficulty in pronunciation for anybody, whether they are from the town or country, young or old. I cannot see what difficulty the pronunciation of this common Irish word would create for the young, up and coming generation whom this Bill is intended to benefit most.</P>
    <P>I had intended to cross the white line with regard to other aspects but I will not do so because time is running out, other Members want to speak and I do not want to draw the anger of the Cathaoirleach on me at this stage.  I agree with the Minister that Teagasc will have to secure extra funding by way of charges for services to the maximum degree possible but I want to stress that special priority in the allocation of finance, discounts and fees will have to be given to smallholders in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take an example from what Senator Doherty said and I will not detain you too long, as Henry VIII said to his seventh or eight wife.  This Bill will amalgamate ACOT and AFT.  I want to pose a few questions which the Minister may be able to clarify in his reply later tonight.  I understand that the combined budget for ACOT and AFT last year was approximately £38 million but in this years Estimates the Minister has provided a budget of £20 million for the new body.  I should like to ask what effect that will have on the services that will be provided by the new body and on the services to agriculture. I think there are about 2,200 people employed in both bodies and I understand the Minister is seeking up to 1,000 redundancies.  From the letter read by Senator Ferris in his contribution, apparently only 450 employees have indicated their acceptance of this.  How will the 1,000 redundancies sought be achieved <Col N="1752" /> when only 450 employees have so far offered to take redundancy?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask what effect this Bill will have on the advice available to farmers.  Will the advice provided to farmers by ACOT continue when this Bill becomes law?  Farming has become such a skilled and hi-tech industry that farmers need advice daily not alone on the ordinary running of the farms but on all aspects of their dealings &mdash; farm taxation, inheritance, inheritance tax, wills, social living and anything else concerned with farming.  Instead of having to go to five or six bodies to seek advice on different matters they will be pleased to have one body offering them the advice that is necessary for everyday living.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask a question on section 17 of the Bill which states: &ldquo;Teagasc may establish committees to assist and advise it in relation to the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  I would support any amendment that would replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  I would like to follow up the question asked by Senator Doherty about what body will replace the county committees of agriculture.  Will there be a body with an input from elected representatives, in other words the representatives of the people with grassroots knowledge?  Will elected councillors be represented on this new body?  Section 17 says that a committee may include persons who are not members of Teagasc.  Does that mean there can be provision &mdash; and I think there should be provision &mdash; for the inclusion on those committees of elected representatives of the people, as was the situation heretofore in the committees of agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the privilege of serving on the Galway County Committee of Agriculture for a number of years.  I also served on the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture and I can say that those bodies were in touch with the problems in farming and were in a position at first hand to bring those problems to the notice of the Department and the Minister.  They will be a great loss.  I should like to ask what effect the merger of the two bodies will have on <Col N="1753" /> agricultural education for young people entering farming.  It is vital that people entering farming are equipped with first class knowledge of the business they are going into both from a technical and a practical point of view.  What effect will this Bill have on this?</P>
    <P>With regard to the charges introduced by ACOT last year, I should like to say to the Minister that he should not depend on charges.  I know charges were estimated to bring in £1 million in the first year but the Minister should neither depend on charges not cut back his budget in anticipation that this amount can be made up by charges because, where charges were introduced in other areas of local government, their budgets were cut back as a result and this did not work out.  I know the Cathaoirleach will forgive me for mentioning that the charges introduced this year for rod licences have not worked out either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>They have not worked in Galway where I live.  They have not been successful there and they have done a lot of damage.  I ask the Minister to have a proper planned reallocation of the funding within his Department so that the services to agriculture, and in particular to the family based farm, are not affected and are maintained.  I am sure the Minister realises that a great proportion of our population depends either directly or indirectly on agriculture for a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague from County Longford, Senator Doherty, referred to the name Teagasc and said it should be retained.  I have reservations about the name Teagasc.  I do not want to make a big point about this but the name ACOT was accepted and associated with agriculture, agricultural organisations, etc. and I do not think the new name is right.  It does not sound right to me and the Minister should have a look at alternative names even at this stage and perhaps he should seek suggestions on different names.  I am <Col N="1754" /> sure he would be inundated with suggestions because a name has to be marketed and people in marketing will tell you that a brand name has to be marketed.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look at any reasonable alternative names that may be suggested to him by farming organisations or perhaps he might initiate an opinion poll on alternative names. There is no point in my suggesting names but I believe we could come up with a more catchy name than Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to some of the points I have made.  He said that a strong, viable agricultural and food sector is central to the wellbeing of our economy and that Teagasc will be required to provide the services relevant to the developing needs of the sector.  The Bill provides the framework for the establishment of an organisation who will contribute to the fullest development of agriculture and its food industries.  That is fine at face value but I would like the Minister to spell out, as a result of the points I have raised, exactly how this can be done if the budget is reduced from £38 million to approximately £20 million.  How can it be done by eliminating the county committees of agriculture?  These committees were abolished well in advance of this Bill but they should have been left there.  I would like the Minister in his response to answer thoroughly the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you Senator Ryan.  I have a few points to make on this Bill.  I have no doubt that savings can be made by ACOT and An Foras Talúntais but the manner in which both budgets are being slashed and amalgamated is unworthy of support and is frightening.  I want to deal specifically with the area of the Bill relating to research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from Ballinamore, County Leitrim, I have no doubt that the Minister will be aware of my affinity with the research station in that town and I am glad that I have the opportunity to make <Col N="1755" /> a case for retaining it.  If this Bill is passed I fear that agricultural research in the west will be at an end.  The research station in Ballinamore was established in 1959 to investigate the agricultural use of heavy clay soils on drumlins of north central islands.  The original objective of the institute was to investigate the role of drainage and fertiliser practice in soil improvement.  Subsequently, the programme was extended to cover most aspects of farming on heavy lands.  The direct sphere covered by the research station was 4,000 square miles or 12 per cent of land area, chiefly in Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and parts of Mayo, Clare and west Cork.  It was also relevant to all marginal land which compromises 41 per cent of the country.</P>
    <P>It must also be taken into account how adjacent Ballinamore is to Northern Ireland.  I specifically regret that if cutbacks are made, this station will be abolished as it helped many farmers in County Fermanagh; that is co-operation between North and South which politicians here hold dear to their hearts.  That is another reason for holding on to the research station in Ballinamore.  It is only ten miles from Northern Ireland and has been very helpful to farmers in Leitrim, and specifically in Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>Past activities of the research station in Ballinamore include dairying.  Stock rates increased from a level of one livestock unit per five acres to one livestock unit per one and a half acres.  All aspects of dairying husbandry were investigated with emphasis on breeding, nutrition and disease control.  That research was essential and beneficial to farmers all over the country.  Any research on disease which has ravaged this country, specifically TB, is relevant.  There were also grassland improvement trials to study appropriate grass species for heavy land, together with optimum use of lime and fertiliser, for silage and pasture swards and simple systems of reseeding were also studied. This was beneficial to small farmers in the west and on marginal land, especially when they could reseed their land at a <Col N="1756" /> cheap rate.  That is another worthwhile research aspect that was carried out at Ballinamore.</P>
    <P>The gravel tunnel drainage system was developed at Ballinamore, a breakthrough in effective drainage of unstable clay soils.  This has been internationally acclaimed although many people in Ireland are not aware of it.  We should take credit for it and I compliment the people who were involved in its development. It has been of great benefit.  We have had western packages and moneys from Europe.  A lot of land in my part of the country has been drained successfully due to research undertaken in Ballinamore. I am very proud to be able to say that this drainage has been internationally acclaimed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environment, studies have been carried out in Leitrim and Cavan to formulate appropriate rates and the time of application of artifical fertilisers to pig slurries to avoid water pollution. I have come across the problem of water pollution specifically in the past couple of months.  There has been much hype by this Government about water pollution and it is definitely a problem especially in tourist areas.  Research in this area is most beneficial.  I come from a county where in a ten miles radius there are 52 lakes.  Pollution causes problems and farmers have been willing and working hard to try to alleviate them.  There is a major tourist industry.  I am glad the Government have decided to implement a financial package for farmers in the near future which will help them to stop pollution and to finance slurry tanks which are essential.  From a tourism point of view, the studies carried out in Ballinamore were of great benefit.  There have been intensive investigations into the control of internal and external parasites in cattle and sheep with particular emphasis on liver fluke and red water which caused hardship in farming communities. The research station in Ballinamore came up with many helpful ideas in this regard.</P>
    <P>Farm machinery is another area in which research was carried out.  There was modification of conventional farm <Col N="1757" /> machinery so that it would operate effectively on soft hilly soils with minimum surface damage.  The fruits of these studies were most apparent during the wet summers of 1985 and 1986 on the station and on similar types of terrain throughout the county.  I availed of the services provided by Ballinamore research station in those wet summers of 1985 and 1986 and many farmers in my county would be out of business today but for the hard work done by employees of An Foras Talúntais. They deserve great credit and are held in high esteem in the area for all the helpful work they did in those periods. They worked from 6 o'clock in the morning until 12 midnight and 1 o'clock the following morning.  I thank them most sincerely for a job well done.</P>
    <P>The station also researched amenities. The highly successful sand carpet all-weather playing fields design was developed at Ballinamore, something that very few people are aware of.  Most sports organisations building new pitches are putting in this very successful carpet all-weather playing surface.  This was another phenomenal breakthrough for the research station in Ballinamore.  They also undertook contracts works from outside bodies in the sphere of drug testing, arterial drainage, disposal of dairy effluent and Third World development.  This is also very beneficial in relation to research.  The present activities at the station include dairying and there is an emphasis on the quality and quantity of grass produced for sileage and pasture so as to obtain maximum output with maximum use of concentrates.</P>
    <P>Attention to breeding and disease control is a continuing priority.  The returns from winter versus summer milk production will be evaluated.  This is very worthwhile research because we still do not know enough about the best output we can get from marginal land.  The station is still carrying out drainage tests and various systems are being investigated. Particular emphasis is laid on shallow moulding.  These studies are part of an EC funded national project.</P>
    <P>They are also carrying out studies on grassland.  (1) to establish optimum rates <Col N="1758" /> in times of application of fertilisers in drumlin areas; (2) to determine grass species most suitable to drumlin soils and climate; (3) to evaluate a new source of fertiliser nitrogen; (4) to formulate climatic soil models for use in determining rates of grass growth; and (5) to establish an economic and effective technique of grassland reselling.  They are also carrying out research in mixed stock to establish the economic return from a mixed stock enterprise of sheep and cattle.  Performance of both species was very satisfactory during 1987.  The way forward in agriculture is in mixed farming rather than dealing specifically in one area.  This is very beneficial research and I hope the station will still be there to carry it out for quite a long time to come. In regard to Biomass, different species of trees and sedge are being studied as possible alternative energy sources.</P>
    <P>I listened with great attention to all Government speakers stating how good the land is in Leitrim for afforestation.  If you ask anybody about Leitrim the first thing they will tell you is that it should be planted and that trees grow there at twice the rate in any other area in Western Europe.  This research will also help afforestation within the county.  There have been many emotive issues as far as forestry is concerned.  People do not want to move off the land and they do not want trees planted where farmers and cattle used to roam.  At the same time there is an acceptance within the county that employment can be created from afforestation. There is also a willingness on the part of people from Leitrim to accept afforestation when the Government provide worthwhile jobs, such as a wood pulp industry and the setting up of the headquarters of the new proposed forestry body in the county.  If we are serious and if we want to make the best use of the land available for planting, people within the county have to see the fruits in other ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This research <Col N="1759" /> station covers all aspects of agriculture, and forestry is a part of agriculture.  We are talking about research.  The Minister should use his influence to make sure that the research station in Ballinamore is maintained not just for research but because 12 public service jobs in my home area are now at stake &mdash; people who have worked hard and long hours to help their neighbours to have better living standards because of improvements in farming. Those people have worked diligently in Ballinamore research station and they and their families live in the area.</P>
      <P>Leitrim has suffered greatly and has had a continuous decline in population. We need public service jobs in the county.  If the research stations in the west are done away with or cut back to any great extent, not alone will the people who have been working there be doomed to emigration but also many young farmers depending on advice from these research stations and who have benefited greatly from research will also have to go.  The Government have a social obligation to provide for the poorer regions and I would be very happy to see Ballinamore agricultural research station going on for years and making major breakthroughs in agricultural research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation.  I welcome the Bill, which is to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and ACOT into one single body, Teagasc, who will have responsibility for agricultural advisory training, education and research services.  It is timely from two points of view.  First, the new single organisation will be better able to cope with the various needs at present.  The amalgamation makes sense not just because it will do away with the tendency to duplicate services but also because it provides us with the potential for increasing the efficiency with which the results of wider research can be dissemmated to the independent users, primary producers and processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are the first in Europe to take such a step is inspiring.  It reflects <Col N="1760" /> the fact that agriculture is more important to us than any other European country. For that reason it is fitting that, after due thought and consideration, we should have the courage and foresight to take this step which we all agree is necessary.  It is not the first time Ireland has led Europe in agricultural terms.</P>
    <P>Secondly, because of the severe financial restrictions and the need to reduce public expenditure as much as possible in the interests of the overall financial position, it is well that amalgamation be carried out to increase efficiency as quickly as possible.  The possibility of matching AFT and ACOT was mooted many years ago and there were doubts that such amalgamation would be of benefit to agriculture.  In the present circumstance this amalgamation will certainly benefit agriculture.  All we can ever do in politics and public administration generally is to provide the best means for the needs of the day and, at the same time, try to identify and develop the best possibilities for the future.  Changes have been made in agriculture before. I was present when the ACOT Bill was introduced seven years or eight years ago. That changed at the time, we have changed now and I am sure that there will be changes in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for agricultural research, advice and education.  Now that we are in the European Community and competing with other agricultural countries the need is all the greater.  We all know the great work that has been carried out by the two bodies that have amalgamated under this legislation, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT.  An Foras Talúntais were established approximately 30 years ago and have contributed enormously to the development of the agricultural industry.  They have done great work in the field of research.  ACOT have done equally tremendous work in conveying the results of the research of An Foras Talúntais to their advisory service department.  No doubt, the agriculture advisers in ACOT have helped individual farmers to operate their farming businesses more economically, helping them to plan their farms so as to make their <Col N="1761" /> operations more accommodating and more economical.  The Minister of State is very familiar with the good work in their dairy research centre in relation to dairying equipment, especially milking machines and other dairy items used on farms.  This has been of the greatest value to the dairying community and their research in milk machines liners is most extensive and thorough.  The research and opinions of the Moore Park scientists on milking machine liners is something dairy farmers acknowledge and very much appreciate because similar tests are not carried out in Britain and some other European countries.  Moore Park could have played a more vital role because, as a result of our entry into the EC, there was an emphasis on feeding cows and dairy cattle using the minimum of meals. The dairy farmers should produce as economically as possible, but if we had more emphasis on feeding there would be a better overall yield per cow per acre and a better quota now.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the milk recording scheme I mentioned that the milk yield in the Netherlands was 5,290 kgs and 3,654 in Ireland.  I am always emphasising that, if there was more interest in pedigree breeding and better feeding, we would have a better base yield and we would not have the quota problems.  The Government have done good work in reallocating the quotas and helping new farmers, especially those starting off business in a dairy enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government must be congratulated on setting up An Bord Glas. With restrictions on land for uses other than dairying, there is a great opening for the development of horticulture, especially when we are importing commodities which could be grown here. Land will be available from Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which could be used very effectively and efficiently for horticultural production.  I am sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Kirk, and his Department, in conjunction with An Bord Glas, will do a great job in this respect.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill provides that the new body, Teagasc, will be in a position <Col N="1762" /> to form committees.  I was delighted that the Minister said he was sure the new Authority would want to have constant access to the best practical advice at local level and that appropriate arrangements would be made accordingly.  I hope the committees will be formed at local level, because the committees of agriculture in the past played a very important role in the development of agriculture.  New committees formed and set up by Teagasc should represent local opinions, needs and objectives.  It is very important that the new board, Teagasc, should form the local committees immediately so that the voice of local interests will be heard in this very important industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and trust that agriculture will benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could be sure of what will come out of this Bill I might be able to make up my mind whether I welcome it.  There are so many layers of possibilities about what it is about that it is difficult for a person who, is interested in the country's future to have more than a passing interest in what happens in what is described as our largest industry, agriculture. Whatever one thinks of the future of Agriculture, a number of facts must be taken into consideration.  The first is that it exists and that it consumes a considerable amount of resources.  The second is that it is the source of income of somewhere around 20 per cent of our population who, whatever the future of agriculture, have the right to be accommodated and to expect a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks made here this evening and on previous occasions in this House about agriculture are the nearest thing to cloud cuckoo land economics that I ever had the misfortune to listen to.  I have heard a succession &mdash; and this relates very clearly to the Bill &mdash; of representatives of farming talk about the performance of other sectors of the economy with a remarkable abandon.  I have in particular heard the alleged imperfections of the semi-State sector of commercial activity criticised by a succession of authoritative representatives of farming.  Since 1980 <Col N="1763" /> the combined commercial semi-State sector made a profit of about £2 billion &mdash; in other words, it contributed something to the economy in excess of what was contributed to it and did not involve substantial subsidies from outside the State.  On the other hand, agriculture masquerades as an industry.  Compared with the chemical industry, with which I have some professional familiarity, I can only stand back in amazement at the prospect of that industry attempting to argue that it was entitled to go on producing more and more of the same commodities that it has produced for the last 50 years, demand guaranteed prices for them, expect a substantial body of State assistance to ensure that they go on producing more and more of those products and tell us that it is not our responsibility to find a market for those products.  They do not produce what the market needs or indeed do not respond to what the market expects or demands.</P>
    <P>It is quite astonishing to describe it as an industry.  Just a moment ago Senator Kiely, who is a good friend of mine, talked about the possibility of yet more milk production.  He compared us to other countries that have produced even greater quantities of something for which there is no market.  He asserted that somehow it is rational and sensible to build the future of a large part of our industrial development on producing something that nobody wants to buy at a price that nobody wants to pay.  That is the underlying reality of Irish agriculture, as the vast bulk of what it produces has no existing markets and no likelihood of any future markets.  It is a protected, safeguarded, cosseted and guaranteed income industry of a kind that would not be tolerated in any other area of economic activity.  It does not demand an economic price &mdash; that is, the price that the market will pay &mdash; but grossly inflated prices on the basis of some mythological concept of a family farm which is supposed to contribute so much to our spiritual well-being that it deserves these enormous unreal, artificial, subsidies, not <Col N="1764" /> based on any index of economic performance that I have ever read or on an index of market requirement that I have ever seen underlined.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is, to a large extent, inefficient since somewhere around 40 to 50 per cent of our arable or potentially arable land is owned or controlled by people who because of their age and status have no interest in increasing production. For example, 45 per cent of agricultural land is owned by elderly bachelors over 55 years of age who have no particular incentive or wish to produce any more.  I hold no grudge against those people, but it is a mockery of any sort of model of future economic development to pretend that a sector where so much of its productive capacity is in such hands is somehow either geared or capable of being a real, sustained source of economic growth.  I remember Professor Tom Raftery talking about some other things and, since neither the Minister nor I agree with Professor Tom Raftery about most things, we at least will not fall out and he cannot accuse me of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  That it is expedient in order to provide formal structures within the parliamentary framework for the discussion of foreign policy matters that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Foreign Policy) consisting of seven Members of Seanad Éireann and eight Members of Dáil <Col N="1765" /> Éireann be appointed to review, examine and report to each House with its recommendations on all aspects of foreign policy of the State including&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the establishment and maintenance of good relations with countries with which Ireland has commercial and diplomatic dealings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the special relationship of Ireland with countries in the Developing World,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the welfare and rights of Irish citizens abroad,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the international dimensions of the concept of Human Rights,</P>
    <P>(v)  policy with regard to International trade.</P>
    <P>(vi)  policy positions adopted on behalf of the State in the United Nations General Assembly and other such International Assemblies,</P>
    <P>(vii)  Ireland's position with regard to neutrality and nonalignment.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees and to refer to such sub-committees any matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution.</P>
    <P>(3)  That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the Joint Committee or each sub-committee who are unable to attend particular meetings.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee and in each sub-committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee and <Col N="1766" /> each sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries.</P>
    <P>(7)  That any Member of either House may attend and be heard in the proceedings of the Joint Committee or in each sub-committee without having a right to vote, subject to the prior consent of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every report of the Joint Committee shall on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(10)  That no document relating to matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution received by the Clerk to the Joint Committee or to each sub-committee shall be withdrawn or altered without the knowledge and approval of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(11)  That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four of whom at least one shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one a shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and that the quorum of each sub-committee shall be three at least one of whom shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would like to welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad and to send, through him, if I may, my best wishes and, I am sure, the best wishes of all Members of this House, to the <Col N="1767" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, and say how gald we are to hear the news that he is well on the way to recovery.  We look forward to welcoming him back, in person, to this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to address myself to certain technical matters and particularly to the nature of the framing of this motion as an expediency motion because some reference was made on the Order of Business to the question of whether or not this motion was properly framed.  My belief and understanding, which I have confirmed this afternoon, is that it is so properly framed and that there is a specific reason, which I deliberately intended, behind the use of an expediency motion.  The reason is that if this motion is passed by this House a message is then sent to the Dáil containing its wording.  This is then discussed in the Dáil and if there is a Dáil decision to agree with the terms of the motion a message of agreement is sent back to the Upper House and a committee is then set up by way of another resolution in the same terms.  If the Dáil declines to agree with the substance of this motion it still lies within the remit of Seanad Éireann to establish its own House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This, I am sure the Cathaoirleach and the Minister will agree, is a far stronger and more incisive instrument than merely the loose wording that &ldquo;we propose to consider the establishment&rdquo;. We should, at this stage, many years after the institution of a framework under which committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas can be established, be far further along the road than merely &ldquo;considering&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to recent exchanges in the Dáil when Deputy Higgins questioned the Taoiseach on this very matter, and was told again that it was being given consideration.  Upon being pressed on it, the Taoiseach replied that it was being given considered consideration. Well, the proliferation of these terms is potentially endless, but I <Col N="1768" /> believe that there is an all-party concensus that such a committee would be a useful instrument.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into too great depth with regard to the technicalities of the clauses of this motion, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 6 in particular.  This empowers a joint committee to send for persons and papers and could, perhaps, be a source of contention between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the senior civil servants there who might perhaps feel, as indeed might some Ministers, that part of their territory was being poached on. As a matter of personal choice I would have preferred, if I regarded it as possible, a stronger paragraph 6, which included the power, as exists in the Parliament at Westminister, to <i>subpoena.</i> However, because I am a practical man and politics is the art of the possible, I realise that this would raise hackles.  I had it watered down to allow only the power &ldquo;to send for persons and papers&rdquo;, but of course Ministers and civil servants have the capacity, politely, to decline and to disengage themselves.  So, although it is a fairly weak section this very weakness, as I would perceive it, should recommend it to the Minister and to the senior personnel of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I think we all believe that foreign policy is an extremely important area of our political life.  It is, so to speak, the graduate school of politics.  Many people start in local politics and graduate then to parliamentary politics.  There is, of course, a rung now above that &mdash; the rung of international institutions and of our international affairs.  I would point out to the Minister the irony of the fact that there is a committee on foreign policy within the European Parliament, upon which some of our MEPs actually sit, and make a very important contribution.  I have here with me the <i>European Political Cooperation Documentation Bulletin,</i> which is crammed with matters on foreign policy which have taken the active interest of members of the European Parliament and in which, I am very glad <Col N="1769" /> to see, many of our own Irish MEPs participate very vigorously.</P>
    <P>It is very true, I think, that as the poet, John Donne, said, no man is an island entire of itself.  No nation is an island entire of itself either, particularly in this century when we are confronted with threats of global famine and of nuclear disaster, no State can operate alone.</P>
    <P>Also this State since its very inception has by its own nature accepted the importance of foreign affairs in the very creation of the State.  When the State was struggling to be born our political leaders recognised the importance of international contact and established contacts in Washington, Paris, Rome and at the Vatican.  The then leader of what is now the Government party, Éamon de Valera, who was unquestionably a world figure himself, noted this aspect of affairs and was instrumental in the establishment of the League of Nations in the late twenties. There is in the world today a growing understanding of the interrelationship of nations.  We are also, I am very glad to say &mdash; and I am sure the Minister, as a Member of the Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, will agree with me &mdash; a Republic.  It is refreshing that the area of foreign policy is no longer as it was in the 19th century the prerogative of princes and prelates.  We have gone beyond the days of Metternich, Peel and Melbourne and these sort of people.</P>
    <P>There is an importance attached to foreign policy by Members of this House.  If you look at the Order Paper for today, for example, there are on every page of quite a lengthy Order Paper at least two or three items relating to foreign policy issues.  It is also of importance to the public.  I believe very strongly that there should be some degree of public accountability in this very important aspect of the nation's life.  One has only got to look, for example, at <i>The Irish Times</i> today where there is on the letters' page a very cogently reasoned letter teasing out the implications of the Single European Act with regard to issues of our neutrality.  My first day in this House was the day on which, having been reconvened after the general election, we set <Col N="1770" /> about discussing the Single European Act and its implications and the repercussions of the Crotty judgement in the Supreme Court.  At that time my distinguished colleague, Senator Mary Robinson, pointed out the important consequences of this judgement and in particular the words of Mr. Justice Walsh in his decision where, in a consideration of the Single European Act, he said:</P>
    <P>It commits the State and therefore all future Governments and the Oireachtas, to the other Member States to do the following things:</P>
    <P>(1)  To endeavour to formulate and to implement a European Foreign policy.</P>
    <P>(2)  To undertake to inform or consult the other Member States on any foreign policy matters of general interest (not just of common interest) to ensure that the combined influence of the States is exercised as effectively as possible through co-ordination, the convergence of their positions and the implementation of joint action.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out by a number of people during that debate that it was very necessary in the light of this debate to establish a committee to investigate and report on the implications of this judgment.  In the first speech that I had the privilege of making in this House I myself said that I would like very strongly to support the suggestion of my colleague, Senator Mary Robinson, who made the recommendation that a committee of experts should be established to investigate the foreign policy consequences of this judgment.  We still have not had that committee established, nor do we have the more wide-ranging joint committee of foreign policy issues.  I believe that it is vitally important that we do so and that we start the process here this evening.</P>
    <P>Although I have the greatest respect for this House &mdash; and it is a respect that increases with every day I spend in it &mdash; I would have to say that within the provisions of the Standing Orders of this House the machinery for the discussion of foreign policy it totally inadequate.  I <Col N="1771" /> say this without any disrespect to those Members who participate in discussions. One gets, for example, occasionally adjournment debates on foreign policy matters.  I myself raised the question of Irish diplomatic representation at the time of the Waldheim visit to Rome. However, the drawback, even when you manage to get an adjournment debate on an issue like this, is that the Member who raises such an issue comes in, speaks for 20 minutes and the Minister then replies, normally by reading a prepared script which has been written in advance of any notification or any knowledge of the principal and substantive points which may be raised by the Senator.  In a sense it is the very reverse of dialogue.  There is no real exchange of opinions, although I am glad to say that certain Ministers do sometimes step aside from the prepared script and courteously answer some of the points that were raised.  It is an ineffective machinery through which to pursue foreign policy.</P>
    <P>There are also contacts between Members of both Houses and other parliamentary institutions, notably through the Inter-parliamentary Union.  I believe that this is fairly useful.  I use the qualification advisedly because although sometimes valuable work is done, this is by no means always the case; and, as somebody who has always decried junkets when they occur in county councils, I would have to say that there can be and certainly exists in the public mind a suspicion that one aspect of these trips abroad is the aspect of junketing.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago a delegation from the Houses of the Oireachtas went to Nicaragua.  They went there to investigate the Nicaraguan elections.  I am very glad to say that, having gone out there with this specific brief under the aegis of the Interparliamentary Union, they actually did their job.  They came back here, issued a communique and a very detailed and well-produced report on the Nacaraguan elections.  This was principally at the executive initiative of the leader of the group, the then Senator <Col N="1772" /> Michael D. Higgins.  It was not a requirement of the machinery.  We have just had a group which has gone to Guatemala.  I do not know why they went.  I do not know much about what they did there.  I have heard no communique.  I know of no report being issued, although I did &mdash; and I am very glad as an Independent Senator to be able to say this &mdash; hear by accident a very interesting explanation of what went on in a Radio Éireann news programme.  Even that aspect which lies inert and can be used, is by no means adequately or fully used.</P>
    <P>I believe that one important aspect of the establishment of a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs would be that it would have the capacity to invite submissions and engage in discussions with senior and responsible voluntary organisations like Amnesty International, Oxfam and the Catholic relief agency, Trocaire, who have so valiantly upheld the honour and dignity of this country.  The contribution they could make would be exceedingly important.</P>
    <P>I could instance many different groups, but I would like to draw to the Minister's attention, for example, three such groups.  First of all, I will start with Amnesty International.  This year is the fortieth anniversary of universal declaration of human rights; and Amnesty International have issued an appeal to Governments, including our own Government here, to make human rights a major foreign policy goal.  This is not only the fortieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, which occurs on the 10 December 1988, but it is also the anniversary of several international covenants.  I would like to refer to those in some detail.  First of all, there is the international covenant on civil and political rights.  Secondly, there is the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.  These were signed on behalf of the Irish people by an Irish Government 22 years go, but they yet wait to be ratified.  I believe that an Oireachtas Joint Committee on foreign policy would ask, and ask very <Col N="1773" /> trenchantly and continuously, why this is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">

      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is some legislative difficulty and that there is a problem of the repercussion in domestic legislation of incorporating fully these most desirable covenants.  So much the better, say I.  If it is necessary to alter Irish domestic law as a result of our given commitments to international concepts of morality, then the sooner we set about changing our Irish domestic law the better.  I can think of no better forum in which to introduce such legislation than Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>There is, finally, a third member of this triad, and that is the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  Why has this not been fully activated?  Again, we get promise after promise after promise. In the debate on the Video Bill, for example, the question of incitement to hatred was raised.  I thought that it was an inappropriate place in which to raise it as an adjunct to a Bill with which it had absolutely no connection.  But I welcomed it.  I said &ldquo;Fine, I will support that&rdquo;.  I did make some small additions to it, but I also attempted to provoke the Minister into producing a full Bill outlawing incitement to hatred.  A commitment was given that this would be done, but it seems to be another case of &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; leading virtually nowhere.  Again, it seems to me here in this area a joint committee on foreign affairs would be a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International also have some very interesting things to say to us in terms of the documentation of human rights abuses throughout the world.  I would like to point to a rather anomalous situation that exists in our foreign policy. For example, we have here and we welcome here an Iranian diplomatic mission. In Iran, however, the basic safeguards of human rights are still not in place.  This is quite clear.  In Ervin prison in Tehran torture is still widespread.  Beatings on the feet and with electric cables are a <Col N="1774" /> matter of course; torture by electrical probes continues as do torture with cigarette burns and mock executions.  In addition, punishments are regularly carried out involving flogging and amputation of limbs and fingers.  There were 4,467 acts of corporal punishment involving flogging and multilation, such as the amputation of fingers and other major limbs, in the Tehran area alone in 1986-87. There were 160 executions in 1987, which is an increase of 45 over 1986.  That is only the official figure.  God knows how many more are being executed, often after summary trial or no trial at all. There is &mdash; as the Minister is, I am sure, aware &mdash; on the Order Paper today a motion deploring the treatment of members of the Ba-hai faith in Iran.</P>
    <P>I would like to know of and to be able to get at the principles underlying our foreign policy.  Are they simply matters of commercial self-interest, that we do not want to aggravate a potential economic market?  Beef, perhaps, may raise its sometimes attractive head once more again.  But I would remind the Minister that under the Constitution this is supposed to be a Christian and democratic state.  If it is, I would like to be informed of the Christian principles underlying our practical and diplomatic relations with other countries.  I realise that we live in a practical world and that economic considerations must be taken into account.  But it is required that certain other moral principles be taken into account in the context of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Anti-Apartheid Movement is also a highly respected movement in this country.  In June there will be the renewal of the Free Nelson Mandela Campaign. Nelson Mandela, a figure internationally respected, will be 70 in July.  He should, I believe, be unconditionally released. There should be pressure from our Government to do this.  We have also got a situation where the mind of the public is far in advance of Government policy with regard to sanctions.  The official Irish Government attitude appears to be towards a kind of creeping sanction, where the Anti-Apartheid Movement <Col N="1775" /> would seek full, immediate and mandatory sanctions.  I believe that the present attitude of Government was very largely formed by the brave stand of the Dunne's Stores' strikers rather than any development of policy attitude on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Even what we have done with regard to sanctions, the limited moves in regards to sanctions are rendered almost meaningless by virtue of the fact that, while our imports from South Africa are certainly declining very rapidly, exports of meat once more are rocketing and are estimated to reach £87 million this year.  I am very concerned by this, because it means that we will be dependent upon the goodwill of South Africa and there is no question of doubt whatever but that this must help to colour our attitude towards the South African regime.</P>
    <P>We had just this year a moving debate in this House on the Sharpeville Six.  I am very glad to say that in this case international pressure, which I believe would have been maximised had there been a committee on foreign affairs, had some success.  Recently, there has also been another case, not in South Africa but in Namibia, during which six South African soldiers penetrated Namibia and murdered a member of SWAPO.  A trial was commenced.  They first of all denied that they were South African soldiers. They were not, of course, in uniform.  It then emerged conclusively that they were South African soldiers and on the day of the trial Mr. Botha intervened personally and quashed the whole thing.  There was not a squeak throughout the world about this.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to Oxfam, another group that I would hope would be able to make a contribution to the development in the area of foreign policy.  Everyone in this country is concerned with the kind of work that Oxfam does.  It is vitally important, particularly psychologically, in this country, which still remembers the impact of the famine of the last century. We, as a people, have a particular sensitivity in this matter.  We are used to people bewailing the fact that throughout <Col N="1776" /> the world people who were aware of the grief, suffering and misery of the Irish people stood idly by and did nothing. What are we doing ourselves now?  If one reads the reports of Oxfam in Ireland, or if one reads the Estimates &mdash; the summary of supply service net estimates &mdash; you find what we are doing; or, rather, not doing.  It does seem rather cynical.  In the Estimates for this year, while the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs goes up by 3 per cent, International Co-operation goes down by 21 per cent.  We are actually in a sense welching on our commitment to the international community and the Third World.</P>

      <P>I would like to say also that I would welcome a return to the very active foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s.  It is remarkable that during that period Ireland did draw an independent line.  It is interesting to note that during the recent visit of President Hillery to China the President of the Peoples Republic of China paid particular and warm tribute to the fact that Ireland had taken an independent line with regard to the seating of the Peoples Republic of China at the United Nations.  I would urge the Minister to consider that the 10th anniversary of the overthrow of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge will come in January 1989, not very far away.  We are already envisaging the spectre of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops in 1990, which leads to a fear of the return of Pol Pot.  No significant development aid has been given to Kampuchea because there exists there at present a Vietnamese-backed Government, thus preventing total economic recovery. Ireland must vote at the next United <Col N="1777" /> Nations assembly against the recognition of the CGDJ, which has a large Khmer Rouge regime membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the motion and if my contribution is not as fully prepared as it might be, I must say it is entirely my own fault.  I did not realise until half an hour ago, in fact, that this motion was being taken tonight and there are some references I would like to have verified and so on.  Nonetheless, I am very glad to be in a position to second it.  With reference to what Senator Norris said a moment ago about the President of the Peoples's Republic of China, that particular gentleman was not terribly well informed about the course of events back at the United Nations nearly 30 years ago because, as I understand it, while we are active in pushing for a discussion of whether or not the People's Republic of China should supplant their Formosan rivals in the United Nations, when it actually came to a decision, we were less than fortright if, indeed, we did not take our stand against the People's Republic of China.  Fortunately such subtleties are not recalled by our Chinese friends, for which we should be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of foreign policy, with which this motion is concerned, is sometimes relegated to an inferior place because there is the mundane assumption that it is not bread and butter.  Well, even that assumption, in the last analysis, cannot be substantiated because, indeed, foreign policy can be very much about bread and butter, if not about our bread and butter, other people's bread and butter.  It also touches an essential part <Col N="1778" /> of a nation's personality.  Foreign policy is really how other people see us, the face we present to them and the way we behave in a community of nations.  That, indeed, is a very crucial part of our behaviour.</P>
    <P>In the time of Grattan's Parliament, as it is familiarly if erroneously known, one of the Members, aflush with the new Protestant nation's awareness of their quite illusory independence, full of a kind of new delusion of grandeur that the Parliament really meant something, stood up one day &mdash; again I regret that I cannot give the exact reference &mdash; and said plaintively that one of the great drawbacks of the constitutional situation which prevailed after 1782 up to the Act of Union, was that the kingdom of Ireland, as it was then, had no foreign policy of its own; it was subordinate to the foreign policy of London.  He used the phrase which, I think, sums up the importance of foreign policy: &ldquo;Who, out of Ireland&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;has ever heard of Ireland?&rdquo;  That kind of defeatist isolationism, that voice was still to be heard very much later.</P>
    <P>Patrick Keating opens his book, <i>A Place Among the Nations,</i> as I recall, with a quotation from a Deputy in Dáil Éireann in the twenties when there was a debate on the Department of External Affairs, as it was known then, who more or less said: &ldquo;What do we want a Department like that for?  We do not have any external affairs.&rdquo;  I hasten to add, they did not have many internal affairs either at that stage.  What he meant was, of course, that in the forefront of Irish consciousness in the twenties the only foreign affairs were Anglo-Irish relations.  We live in a very different world now.</P>
    <P>This motion is not mainly designed to inform the people of this country about the international scene.  In fact, they are exceptionally well-informed.  Anybody who has spent some time abroad and who has compared the reactions of other plain people, as it were, with that of our own when it comes to international matters, would be very gratified to discover that the level of public consciousness and awareness and interest of the average Irish citizen in what is going on around <Col N="1779" /> him in the world, is exceptionally high by any standards.  American visitors, for example, are astonished in a presidential year, as it happens to be, at the familiarity of the ordinary Irish citizen with the issues involved and the personalities at present competing for the highest office in the United States.</P>
    <P>This, of course, shines out by comparison with the abysmally and dangerously low level of information on the outside world of the average American citizen.  It is not then in order to make our people more informed on international affairs that we are pushing this motion. They are very aware and very sophisticated but I think they feel somehow, at the same time, that they have no power over what is happening, that decisions in the international sphere are taken without their knowledge and outside their power and the whole point of this motion, as I put my name to it, is to make foreign policy representative and responsible and a matter of popular control.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said that foreign policy is no longer the exclusive business of princes and prelates, but they have modern counterparts and we should beware that our affairs are not taken out of our hands and run for us in these vital areas by anonymous diplomatic mandarins.  I have nothing but the highest praise, indeed, for the Department of Foreign Affairs and for those who have served there down the years.  I have come to know many of them personally.  At the same time I will not relinquish my claim as a citizen and that of those I represent to a right to know what is going on and to be able to direct policy rather than leave it to an elite in Iveagh House.</P>
    <P>Éamon de Valera intended our Constitution to operate in such a way that the people would be masters.  That shines out through every clause in the Constitution. They must be masters also in these matters which are not simply esoteric matters to be left to our betters.  In the nuclear age, they are of absolutely vital concern to every citizen and the people cannot take proper decisions in these areas at election times and during referenda <Col N="1780" /> unless they know what is going on.  One of the main purposes of this motion is to provide them with that knowledge through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have been uneasy, from time to time, about the way in which the professionals in the Department of Foreign Affairs take certain things upon themselves which, in my view, on certain occasions they were not entitled to do.  I still have very grave reservations about the way in which, for example, the Government funded the referendum campaign on the Single European Act.  I held in this House that that was a usurpation and a violation of the proper use of public funds and I must say I got a very unsatisfactory answer to it.  Matters like that should be brought under the scrutiny of such a committee.  That is a classic case where it would not be up to an individual Senator from the back benches to try to get some answer out of the Department of Foreign Affairs but where a real, representative Oireachtas committee with teeth could make a much more formidable demand.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go into the subparagraphs and paragraphs except to say that they are all very important.  Our relationship with countries in the developing world is of special importance because we do have a very special relationship with them and they see us in a very special light.  The matter of human rights, referred to in the sub-paragraph (iv) is important because frequently our concept of human rights in Ireland is limited and clouded by certain very conservative traditions and we need the illumination of outside courts and outside views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (vi) refers to the need to deal with &ldquo;policy positions adopted on behalf of the State in the United Nations General Assembly and other such International Assemblies&rdquo; Again, this is a matter of great concern because insensibly, over the years since the time to which Senator Norris referred when we seemed to have a very independent foreign policy, our attitude in the United Nations has become modified by the imperatives prevailing nearer home. <Col N="1781" /> That is something which has always caused me particular unease.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to sub-paragraph (vii), our position with regard to neutrality and non-alignment, a cause very dear to my own heart.  I am going to be saying this weekend in a speech at Listowel Writers Week that, despite all the ambiguity of our neutrality, despite the reservations we have about how we came to acquire it, despite its anomalous operation, nonetheless it is the right policy.  It is the moral policy; it belongs to the high moral order. It is those who want us to be part of a nuclear military pact who are insane.  It is those who want to keep us out of these pacts who are sensible and who have the right moral approach.</P>
    <P>Moreover, apart from the nuclear context altogether, to be anything but neutral in a world where armaments and arms deals deprive countless millions of people of their food and their rights, it seems to me that to be anything but to be neutral is to take the wrong policy. Finally it is good business, because we have no imperial past and because we are seen &mdash; though rather incorrectly so &mdash; as non-aligned by certain countries all over the developing world, we have a good standing there and that is something which is extremely valuable.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, these are matters to be resolved and discussed not by individual partisan views but by this committee. I do not think foreign affairs is a luxury; in this modern age it is an absolute essential.  Many of us may disagree on many of these issues.  I am sure my friend Senator Ross who put his name to this motion would not be <i>ad idem</i> with me on many issues here, but he does agree with me and with Senator Norris on the need for representative dealings, if you like, and representative handlings of these vital issues.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government, in concluding, that if they are really serious about making the Oireachtas relevant and making it of interest to the people, as would seem to be the case from the recent decision about televising proceedings and so on, there can be nothing of more direct relevance and more representative than <Col N="1782" /> the establishing of such a committee.  I have pleasure in seconding the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first of all, that the motion seems, to have broadened out from the setting up of the committee. Those who put down this motion are not the first to talk about the setting up of a committee such as this.  Indeed, the matter was discussed in 1983 in this House and a motion very similar to this was discussed in December 1986.  On that occasion the Government parties, as they were at the time, split and there was a vote on how this particular committee should be set up.  The Labour group within the Government at that stage put down a motion which was very similar to this motion and there was an amendment put down in the name of Senator Dooge. It was an unusual debate at the time in that the motion put before the House was put forward by Senator Ferris, representing the Labour Party, but not in the name of the Labour Party.  The proposer of the amendment was Senator Dooge who put it down in his own name and not on behalf of Fine Gael and not on behalf of the Government of the time.  There was a reasonable and very broad discussion on the implications of the setting up of this joint committee during that debate.  The debate in the way it has begun here this evening is developing along the same lines and with the same arguments as were put forward in 1986.</P>
      <P>The motion, as has been said by Senator Norris, would go a long part of the way in the setting up of the committee but it is a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges as to what committees are set up.  It is not our function to set up committees.  It could be said that we can recommend that committees be set up but we have no function in the matter here in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made, in debates of this kind throughout the years, of the fact that in most other countries there is a committee of the Houses of Parliament on foreign affairs but in most other countries they do not have the same type of Oireachtas set-up as we have here.  In many countries there is a total distinction <Col N="1783" /> between the executive and the legislative function.  Here we do not have such differentiation. They are not quite as separate as they are in other countries. Indeed, in most of the countries of Europe which have foreign affairs committees, the business of legislation is dealt with by committees.  The bulk of the work in all areas is done at committee level.  It would be wrong to attempt to suggest that, just because we do not have one here, we are out of order in relation to other countries throughout Europe.  We have our own way of doing business. They have their way and, just because we do not have a joint committee on foreign affairs, does not mean that the other countries that have it are right and we are wrong.</P>
    <P>The motion itself is a very broad one and there are a number of implications that could be read into it which would give a sense of criticism of what has been happening in our attitude towards certain areas of foreign affairs.  It was suggested by Senator Norris that many of our stands in various countries on foreign affairs were based on our economic priorities and not on the rights of the people involved, that when we take stances we take them on economic grounds and not on moral or social grounds.  I would have to refute that suggestion because, throughout the years, we have taken the high moral ground on issues which could definitely have been harmful to us in economic terms.</P>
    <P>It should be stated quite categorically here that, long before anybody was taking the side of the Palestinians in the Middle East, our present Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1970 in Bahrein gave recognition to the PLO which was not given by other countries in Europe until the oil crisis began to hit them.  Suddenly, some of these countries decided to take sides in the Middle East due to the very economic considerations Senator Norris mentioned.  We had made the decisions on the rights of the situation and we did not take economic considerations into account at all.</P>

      <P>Sub-paragraph (iii) refers to the welfare and rights of Irish citizens abroad as if consideration is not being given at present by the Government and by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the welfare and rights of citizens abroad.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, indeed, our Embassy officials throughout the world have taken quite a considerable interest in the welfare and rights of our citizens abroad and on all occasions when representations were made on behalf of our citizens abroad through our embassies, through our Minister for Foreign Affairs or through the Taoiseach, there was an instant response.  Sometimes it might appear as if enough is not being done but we have to consider the fact that sometimes nothing can be done because we are dealing with Governments who may not be as open as ours in certain cases.  Indeed, it is very easy to get the wrong story coming back from abroad at times when it might appear that there are people who are totally innocent of crime or innocent in certain acts which they may have committed and matters may not be as they appear on the surface.</P>
      <P>I have seen at first-hand the care and concern given to Irish citizens abroad. The work done by the Taoiseach recently in terms of the problems associated with the Irish in America has to be acknowledged and we have to compliment him on the amount of work he has done in this area.  We have a policy with regard to international trade.  That policy is well covered by both the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Industry and Commerce at present.  I am not too sure why sub-paragraph (v) should be included in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to set up a joint committee of both Houses to deal with the establishment and maintenance of good relations in countries with which <Col N="1785" /> Ireland has commercial and diplomatic dealings.  The position is that the establishment of good relations comes about because of commercial considerations rather than the consideration of the moral ground mentioned in Senator Norris's speech.  It would appear that in relation to sub-paragraph (vii), Ireland's position with regard to neutrality and non-alignment, there might be a questioning of our situation.  It cannot but be said that Ireland's position as a neutral nation is regarded highly throughout the world and that, because of this, we are accepted in areas where other people of Europe are not.  We have a non-colonial past.  We are accepted as being neutral in the very best sense of the word and because of this we have seen that our troops are welcomed as neutral peace-keeping forces wherever they have been asked to go.  They have never gone outside the bounds of the mandate given them by the United Nations, wherever they have been.  They are extremely highly respected no matter where they go.  I suggest that our policy on neutrality is not up for discussion by any joint committee. It is a position which is well-known to the Irish people and is well-respected by them and will not change.</P>
    <P>I noticed that at the Christian Democrats meeting in Galway recently the leader of the Fine Gael party, Deputy Dukes, came under quite some pressure from some members of the European Parliament regarding our position on neutrality.  I was glad that Deputy Dukes on that occasion came out quite strongly and said he had no intention of changing this position.  I am glad he agrees with the majority of the Irish people on this very, very important matter and I would have absolutely no wish to have this situation brought before a committee to be examined and reported on to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Again, last weekend in Cork we had a questioning of our neutrality by the Progressive Democrat spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.  I must say it was not a nice sound to listen to her discussing what she called our &ldquo;sham attitude&rdquo; towards neutrality.  We have a perfectly legitimate <Col N="1786" /> attitude towards neutrality and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) is disturbing in the sense that there is a suggestion that there would be power to send for persons, papers and records.  This could have a devastating effect on the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Not alone that, but because of the nature of things at times there is a coming together as between what happens in the Department of Foreign Affairs and in the Department of Justice and I do not think any committee of the Oireachtas should be allowed to have for discussion papers and records which could be used or misused by the media.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have had many very good discussions on foreign affairs.  The lack of a committee on foreign affairs has never inhibited Members of either House from putting forward their own views, popular or unpopular.  I do not think there has ever been a lack of goodwill on the part of any Government to allow somebody to bring forward as a matter of priority something which is in the area of foreign affairs. Indeed, that has happened on numerous occasions during the period of this particular Oireachtas and it was not only on the Adjournment that these discussions took place.  It was not, as Senator Norris said, that the House was misused in the sense that the debate was not answered because the Ministers came in and made speeches.  I think on all occasions when there were contributions on foreign affairs in this House the Ministers came in and replied to the debate rather than giving set speeches.</P>
    <P>The debate which started originally in 1983 continued in 1986 and continued with a question to the Minister &mdash; the Tánaiste, not to the Taoiseach &mdash; in March, 1987.  The Minister said on that occasion that the Whips could discuss the matter but that basically it was a matter for the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses to decide whether these committees should be set up.</P>
    <P>The motion is an extremely broad one. There are a number of issues in it to which I would take exception in the sense <Col N="1787" /> that they do not give credit to the various people who have been working in the areas of human rights, neutrality, international trade and special relations with countries in the developing world which I have touched on.  I do not think it is a motion that the Government could accept at this stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to commend the Independent Senators for bringing this motion before the House tonight.  It must have been tempting for them at this time to have opted for some more immediate motion which perhaps would have caught public attention to a greater extent.  This is a motion which in parliamentary terms is important and it is one which my party will support vigorously.</P>
      <P>It is an appalling comment on this House and on this Parliament that we have to debate this topic here this evening. It is an appalling comment that we have to ask from Government as a favour what should be an established right of this House.  What we are asking for is no more and no less than that this House and all parts of this House should have the right to scrutinise our foreign policy; that we should have the right, on a regular basis and in detailed discussions with full access to information, to review our foreign policy; that we should have the right by engaging in this process to educate ourselves and, by extension, to educate the wider public in the details and the nuances of our foreign policy.  Finally, what this debate is asking is that, through the process of education, information, scrutiny and access, this House and the other House and the elected politicians in both Houses should provide a leadership role in foreign policy.  That is what this debate is all about.  That is what we are asking from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished at the reaction of the Leader of the House to the very reasonable <Col N="1788" /> case made by the first two speakers this evening, and the case made in the context of this motion.  It was a speech of apology.  We, the politicians should not get involved in matters which are too complicated, matters that we might not understand; we should not get involved in issues which already are being well taken care of by our bureaucrats; Government Departments understand these things; Government Departments should not be disturbed; these are not matters for the elected Houses of Parliament. I do not know how he could stand up here this evening and make this case and call himself our Leader in this House, the person who speaks collectively on behalf of all of us when this House has to make its case.</P>
    <P>I remember the famous occasion during Ireland's triple crown rugby game when Ciarán Fitzgerald rallied the Irish team from behind and that famous evocation came across over the radio and television.  I will leave one word out.  He asked the Irish team: &ldquo;Have ye no pride in yourselves?&rdquo;  I am asking ourselves this evening: have we no pride in ourselves as parliamentarians that we are prepared to be told by the Leader of this House that these things are too important, too complicated, too delicate for us to engage ourselves in the detailed scrutiny and examination of them?  Unfortunately, what the Leaders of the House said this evening reflects the Fianna Fáil attitude to the whole question of parliamentary reform, parliamentary committees and the vigorous participation by the Members of all parties in the two Houses.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions, and I believe it very deeply, that the only justification for the Seanad is that it be a good Seanad, that it work, participate and be informed, that it gives itself, and takes where it is not given, a role which justifies its very existence.  The speech made by the Leader of the House this evening is the best speech in favour of the Progressive Democrat's motion to abolish this House that I have heard in a very long time.  If we are not going to involve ourselves in these relevant and important matters, what role have we <Col N="1789" /> got?  This committee being proposed here this evening is only one of a number of committees which this House and the other House need if we are to be the sort of strong, vibrant and relevant parliamentary democracy which all of us want both Houses to be.</P>
    <P>The history of committees in this Parliament has been a very unhappy one. We saw the attempt in the previous Oireachtas to establish a widespread system of parliamentary committees.  We saw that an attempt to provide greater information for ordinary backbenchers and for Members of this House.  We saw it as an attempt to bring about a greater degree of accountability.  We saw it as an attempt to provide a meeting place between interest groups, the ordinary public and the legislators.  We saw it as a place where real influence on policy-making could be exerted by parliamentarians. The last experiment was not fully successful.  During that time Government Ministers found, as Government always do when in office, that Parliament can be tiresome, a nuisance; it can ask questions which they or their officials do not want asked.  The committee system was not used to the full.  Some committees were not successful. Nonetheless the experiment was well worth undertaking.  By and large it justified the hopes of those who put it in place.</P>
    <P>Since the coming into existence of this Government we have seen under the guise of public spending cuts or savings in public expenditure the playing down, the almost wiping out of existence of most of the committees.  This is a very unhealthy development which again calls into question the self-perception of Members of both Houses and their view on what the role of Parliament in a democracy should be.  If we are not to take ourselves seriously, if we are not to give ourselves a role which is carried out as a normal matter of course in every Parliament in the free world, how can we expect the people outside, the daily <Col N="1790" /> denigrators on talk shows, television programmes and the back pages of Sunday newspapers to take us seriously.</P>
    <P>This motion tonight is a very small but worthy attempt to turn back that process. That is why I appeal to every Member of this House who is concerned about the rights, dignity, stature and usefulness of Parliament to support this motion.  It does not have to be a party motion.  I am very sorry that the Leader of the House sought to make it such, sought to be defensive, when he knows in his heart and is on record as saying in the past that such a committee is worthwhile and would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>He went down through the various functions which the Senators proposing this motion have assigned to it.  I would like to hone in especially on paragraph (1) (ii), &ldquo;the special relationship of Ireland with countries in the Developing World.&rdquo;  That should not be part of this motion tonight.  There should be a special committee dealing with Irish aid and Ireland's role in helping the countries of the developing world.  It is nothing short of a scandal that that committee has not been reactivated.  I know that the Minister here at this moment has a deep concern for the Third World and for Ireland's role on aid to the Third World and all of that.</P>
    <P>In the last Oireachtas the development aid committee was an example to all other committees.  Under the chairmanship of the then Deputy Nora Owen it set a lead.  It informed the consciousness of people.  It raised that consciousness. It was educative and it was influential.  It gave a very strong feeling to people outside this House that Irish Parliamentarians were concerned with Ireland playing an effective, and not just a bureaucratic role, in the development of Third World countries.  It is a shame on both our Houses that that committee has not been reactivated.  That is the only part of this motion with which I would not agree.  I believe there should be a separate, special committee for Third World development.  With every other part of the motion I find myself in total agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> Senator Lanigan referred to the needs, welfare and rights of Irish citizens and said they are being adequately protected. He knows that that is not so.  He knows there is widespread concern among members of all parties about the plight of Irish emigrants.  He knows also that we cannot just depend on our extremely hard-working dedicated and diligent diplomats in foreign countries, especially in Britain and the United States, to look after the needs and interests of these Irish people.  He knows that.  Nobody is going to turn this into a debate on knocking Irish diplomats.  They are probably amongst the best in the world.  Our Department of Foreign Affairs, for their size and resources, are superb.  They are first class and the members of our diplomatic service have given disinterested, honest service to this country over the years.  Clearly the question of emigration affects elected representatives, the people who day by day are in contact with the parents, brothers and sisters of those who have emigrated.  If they cannot be a through-put of information and exchange of ideas and pressure on the Government to do more through a committee such as the one proposed in this motion, where can this type of activity take place?  I know Senator Lanigan cannot be serious when he says all that can be done is being done at present.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be party political, but two years ago, day in and day out in the other House, the then Government were blamed for the plight of these emigrants. The Government at that time were told what they were doing was inadequate, and that they carried the full responsibility. That criticism was unfair then.  It would be unfair to the present Government. What we are doing is only at the very tip of the iceberg.  I can see an extraordinary useful role &mdash; a role which would strike a chord with the mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of those who have been forced to emigrate &mdash; if a committee of this House or of both Houses was to concern itself directly with the role and the plight of our emigrants.  We can go right down this list; we can look at the <Col N="1792" /> next sub-paragrpah, &ldquo;the international dimensions of the concept of Human Rights.&rdquo;  We in this country have a proud but not umblemished record as far as human rights are concerned.  There is a great deal that we can do &mdash; without sermonising, as President Reagan is doing in the Soviet Union at present &mdash; by our own record and from our own example to strengthen the mood for the extension of human rights right across all the civilised countries of the world.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;International trade&rdquo;&mdash; why should that be outside the scope of a parliamentary committee?  Surely at this time, with the need for Irish companies need to export and need to find new places in the export market, the expertise, the feedback, the participation of a parliamentary committee could not but be helpful in this regard?  But I will go down to the question Senator Lanigan took most time to deal with &mdash; the question of our neutrality and our nonalignment. Yes, we are neutral and we are nonaligned.  This policy did not come out of the skies. It is not the eleventh Commandment; it is not on a tablet of stone.  Our policy has evolved slowly over the years.  That evolution had more to do with practice and national advantage rather than any ideological commitment to the idea as such.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera, the father of Irish neutrality, was not neutral in the conflict between fascism and democracy.  He was not neutral in the conflict between Communism and parliamentary democracy. Our neutrality in the war was a policy which was in the national interest and received support as such.  In the years after the war there was a healthy and lively debate as to whether we should continue to be neutral.  The late Seán MacBride was quite prepared in the late forties to enter into a military alliance with the US, if he thought that was in Ireland's interest at the time.  As a member of the European Communities we are not nonaligned; we are aligned with the third biggest trading group in the world.  We are aligned in matters of philosophy, in large chunks of ideology, in our commitment to parliamentary <Col N="1793" /> democracy and in our commitment to European integration.  There are huge questions to be discussed here and to be teased out.</P>
    <P>Neutrality is not a sacred cow; it is not something like the Irish language and Irish unity to which Fianna Fáil can say; &ldquo;Yes, we agree with it&rdquo; and then put it on the shelf and take it down when it is convenient.  Neutrality is a real evolving issue.  Our neutrality must always be interpreted as best befits our national interest.  A committee which would look at it, which would tear away the shibboleths and all the reflex thinking of the past, is something which would be well worthwhile.  I would love to see a detailed examination of Irish neutrality.  It can only be in our interest if we do that.  It can only be in our interest if we actually take the idea, look at it, see where it came from, ask ourselves to what extent it is still in our interest, ask ourselves to what extent are we fooling ourselves &mdash; and we are not bad at doing that &mdash; in claiming that we are neutral, when our Minister for Foreign Affairs nips out for a cup of tea when the Foreign Ministers of the other 11 members of the European Communities sit down to discuss matters of defence or security at the end of their meetings, which is the case at present. Why not be honest about it? Why not use our position of neutrality to exert even greater influence than we have in the past?  We have used it to effect in the past, but I think we could use it to greater effect.</P>
    <P>For all of the reasons I have mentioned &mdash; and there are many more I could mention &mdash; this motion is well worth supporting this evening.  I would appeal to the Government side to support this motion as parliamentarians, as people who want to see a strong, vigorous foreign policy and as people who are ready to stand up and assert the rights of both Houses of this Parliament.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris and his colleagues for bringing this to our attention.  I enjoyed very much listening to his thorough preparation of his brief, with the vast majority of which <Col N="1794" /> I would be in complete accord.  I also feel that Senator Maurice Manning has done not only the Seanad and the Oireachtas a service but indeed the country a service, by highlighting the fact that the Leader of the House has probably had an off day, if not an off year.  Because if one reads his speeches back in 1986 one will find there are some differences between the emphasis that he gave here today and the emphasis he gave then.</P>

      <P>I would be quite shattered to feel that we were moving into an Ireland where the whole organisation of the State and the management of its affairs were going to become more closed, more secretive, at a time when we have been prepared to laud Irish education, the intelligence of young people and their awareness of issues that affect the global state at this time.  The Irish youth are very committed to change in the world at large.  They are committed to the great issues.  We have seen them demonstrating, and debating.  We are aware of their pressure in areas to do with nuclearism, neurtrality, matters of the Third World, in particular, the peace making role of Ireland and the whole philosophy and concept of a positive neutrality, to which I shall return.</P>
      <P>I would wholeheartedly support the words of Senator Manning when he pays a tribute to the dedicated service of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In the short time I have been here and in my own dealings with them I have had nothing but help and much constructive suggestion.  I have found them extremely responsive to anything I have to say, always willing to listen.  I feel that the work they have done, in particular in relation to Northern Ireland, is something for which this whole island should be very indebted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I must, however, come back to some of the points raised by Senator Norris in his delivery, because in other areas my association has not been just quite so happy.  This relates to some of the things which the Leader of <Col N="1795" /> the House referred to &mdash; the conflict between commercial self-interest and wider principles in relation to foreign affairs.  In the last Seanad I had many motions down &mdash; you may notice that I have very few down this time because I found that it was a very fruitless exercise &mdash; but one of them referred to the appalling atrocities being perpetrated in Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime. I felt quite qualified to talk about this because at that time I had working with me in Ballymoney the brother of Mahoud Rajavi who, as you probably know, is the Leader of the Mujhaden.  Therefore, I did know the situation in Iran first hand. I was telephoned, however, to suggest that I should take that motion off the Order Paper.  Similarly I had a motion down dealing with the need for Ireland to ratify the UN Covenants on Human Rights.  I was delighted to hear Senator Norris raise this matter also.  If he is not a colleague, I am sure he is certainly associated with Ronald Tynan, who has made this a great central issue of his platform letter writing to the national newspapers.  In addition, I had another motion down, which still remains on the Order Paper; and it has been there for some five or six years in more or less the same form as it is at present, that is, Item No. 34.  I did not put those two matters on the Order Paper just for fun; I did it because they are very central to the philosophy which the little group to which I belong, the New Ireland Group, has been advocating for a long number of years.  It was also suggested that perhaps by airing these matters one would be raising some very thorny issues at the United Nations which could disturb the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the definition of the term &ldquo;right to self-determination&rdquo;. Indeed, one could go further but I think one need no longer fear this.  That is why I am ventilating it.</P>
    <P>We have moved into an era in Irish political life where at long last there seems to be an opportunity, however tentative and however tenuous, of meaningful dialogue between people who have been traditionally and for a very long <Col N="1796" /> time not prepared to speak to each other because Article 1.1 in both UN Covenants on Human Rights Affairs the right of all peoples to self-determination.  One of the problems I have had and one of the reasons I wanted to have this matter aired was that I could see immediately that this could become a recipe for conflict. If Irish Republicans are, on the one hand, affirming the right of the people of Ireland to self-determination and Northern Loyalists, on the other hand, are affirming the right of the people of Northern Ireland to self-determination, what is affirmed as a fundamental human right, instead of becoming a recipe for resolution of conflict, becomes a means of promoting it.</P>
    <P>It was within that context that I put down Item No. 34 on the Order Paper and I now take the opportunity afforded to me by Senator Norris to refer to it:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the significance of the right to self-determination in giving freedom to the peoples of the world [that was in the old colonial context] observing with concern the social and political conflict which has been caused in many nations States by domination of minorities by majorities, urges the Government to recommend to the United Nations the amending of the first sentence of Article 1, Clause 1 of the United Nations Covenants on Human Rights by adding to the words all peoples have the right to self-determination', the words &lsquo;based on the achievement of consensus&rsquo; and to press urgently for a suitable definition of consensus and also for wider publication of the means of achieving it and methods of assessing it.</P>
    <P>Just to make the point which has been made by other Senators, I have had that on the Order Paper for six years.</P>
    <P>I realise I am in a very privileged position to be in this House at all without a vote to my name.  I am not really accountable to anyone and I do not claim to be representative.  Nevertheless it is frustrating because I feel it could be of benefit. It highlights perhaps what could be <Col N="1797" /> achieved were Senator Norris' motion to be taken really seriously not only by the Government but by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It would be possible for me not to have to wait five or six years but through sub-paragraph (vii) of Senator Norris' motion to put my viewpoint forward to this committee.  Furthermore I would know that through paragraph (9), if the committee felt there was any merit in what I was saying, it would be duly published and it would, therefore, reach a wider audience and could promote further debate and test one's opinion against the views of others.</P>
    <P>The attitude which I, as say, the Leader of the House took in his off day perhaps, prevents me from having that discussed, in particular, if the Department of Foreign Affairs are advising behind the scenes in the way they were advising some years ago &mdash; and perhaps things have changed &mdash; that this motion would be better not discussed because of other reasons to which I am not privy and reasons, presumably, related to their particular expertise, their knowledge, the sanctity of communications to which we are not privy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we have a right to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  What Senator Manning said was that we have a right to know.  It is because of that feeling that we have a right to know, and because we are dealing with a Fianna Fáil Government, and because their previous Leader, the late Éamon de Valera, drafted a Constitution which, for all its faults highlights the rights of the individual in the State, that I feel this must be taken much more seriously than it seems to be taken by the Government at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of our foreign affairs with which we could be dealing through this machinery and it would open up a very dynamic form of communication between the people who are interested.  I have mentioned the youth of Ireland.  After all, the globe is getting smaller and we talk about a space ship berth and a global village.  We are all <Col N="1798" /> partly inter-dependent and related to many many different peoples who have traditionally not known each other so well until this century.  I think the young people feel they must be part of the debate too.</P>
    <P>We have talked about neutrality. Senator Manning showed that Irish neutrality had evolved.  I do not think I could quite go along with the conclusions he was making at the end of his deliberations, but certainly at the start it was an expression of independence.  It then became a subject for debate to which he alluded.  More recently we have heard talk about positive neutrality.  Now, what do we mean by positive neutrality?  I have asked that question before in this House. Who better to try to tease out the implications of positive neutrality than a committee such as this?  That committee would not only be debating with people who would make submissions to it but would also presumably have a very healthy, positive and constructive communication with the very fine people who work in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It would seem to me, therefore, that there would be a very healthy symbiosis between the Civil Service on the one hand and the elected representatives on the other.  There would be accountability to the ordinary people and a much wider, more open, more free and thereby more constructive debate with many many ideas being poured in for consideration and for sieving, if Senators will excuse this word.</P>
    <P>The question of positive neutrality raises opportunities for Ireland because we could be looking, for example, at whether we could be the central focus of a new commonwealth of small nations.  I am not referring to what was understood once as the British Commonwealth. Indeed, talking about a new commonwealth of small non-aligned nations, I think it would be interesting to see what happens in the Soviet Union over the next 20 years.  Undoubtedly, once the controlling centralism of that huge monolith which operated from Moscow begins to be released and there is a lighter touch, a lighter hand, we will see arising <Col N="1799" /> throughout the Soviet Union this ethnic awareness, awareness of religious minorities, marginalised sections, and so on and, so forth.</P>
    <P>The Fourth World concept which some more sophisticated Europeans have been aware of for some time will probably become very either a problem or a challenge depending on how things go in the Soviet Union.  The re-emergences of the old states that have been trapped inside the centralised nation state will be something which will have to be grappled with. Ireland in a sense has been part of the problem and suffered from the problem. After all, we have in our own country different groups who look at the island in different ways.  You could take as one extreme the Gaeltacht and you could take the Northern Loyalist community as another.  We have to grapple with these sort of dilemmas in this shrinking world as we move away from the old concept of the nation state and into a more internationally inter-dependent type of global community where identity is certainly important.  It will always give us our roots and our strength, but how we relate that identity to the wider world will also be an issue.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I could raise at this time.  I did mention the word &ldquo;commonwealth&rdquo;. Why, for example, particularly in relation to what is happening in Northern Ireland at the moment &mdash; and there are rather hopeful signs &mdash; could we not have a look at the old Commonwealth, if you like?  I have emphasised here &mdash; and some Senators seem to be unaware of it &mdash; that the so-called British Commonwealth no longer exists.  The old commonwealth does not count for much but it is surely a further platform for Ireland in the affairs of the world.  It is also a means, if you like, of keeping under control our nearest neighbour and our most patronising partner. The Commonwealth contains many other republics and the late Éamon de Valera did not want Ireland to depart from the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>This type of issue could once again <Col N="1800" /> become more openly debated and could become the concern of a committee such as this.  It could also be indirectly transferred to the interests in the Department of Foreign Affairs who I have no doubt, because of the talents and the enthusiasm which exists there, could use the setting up of this type of special committee to advantage for Ireland as a whole and also beyond its shores.  Ireland is facing a very interesting time in its global responsibility and because of that it is vital that we take the proposal made by Senator Norris, and seconded by Senator John A. Murphy, very seriously.  I hope that the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition does not reflect the viewpoint of the Government.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was referring to the mythology, and it is probably the worst pun one could think of, that agriculture is a sacred cow which is not permitted to be subjected to rational and dispassionate analysis.  That is the way it appears; otherwise I could not understand why the apparent army of economists who have lectured this country about waste, inefficiency, poor markets, poor marketing, and in particular market rigidities within the labour market &mdash; which, of course, is newspeak for excessively high wages or trade unions that are too powerful &mdash; have directed their analysis at the manufacturing industry and the services area, both in the private sector and in the public sector, but no similar ruthless cost-benefit analysis has ever been done of what masquerades as an industry under the heading of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the inefficiencies that are built into agriculture.  We should remember that we produce milk for which there is no market; we produce <Col N="1801" /> butter for which there is no market; and we produce cheese for which there is no market.  Indeed, it has been outside the mainstream agricultural industry that the greater part of the cheese industry, which actually is a competitive industry, has developed.  It has not happened within the mainstream of agriculture.  We produce beef for which there is no market.  We do not &mdash; and I know that the Minister who is present is attempting to do something about this &mdash; produce those products for which there is a market &mdash; for example, vegetables and horticultural products.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that New Zealand, the same size as Ireland, can produce lamb, ship it half way around the world and apparently, if they were allowed, sell it cheaper than the meat we produce for continental Europe.  Somebody ought to look at the facts about the agriculture industry in New Zealand so that a number of pet Irish myths about agriculture could be disposed of, the myth that farming is somehow a mysterious semi-black art which can best be done by those who have inherited from their parents the black magic of how to be a good farmer. The truth is that agriculture, properly done, is a business like every other business and can be run by a competent person in the way a person who graduates from university can run an engineering business, a chemical manufacturing business, a pharmaceutical manufacturing business or any other business.  There are no mysteries and there are no black arts involved.  Agriculture is a business and it ought to be seen and treated as such.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of New Zealand agriculture is that an astonishingly large proportion of the people in the farming sector come from a non-farming background and go into farming as a career choice after they leave school or college.  It is astonishing that we have no third level professional qualification equivalent to a degree in farming.  One can get a degree in agricultural science, a qualification for those who are going to instruct farmers.  To most Irish people it is almost a contradiction to talk in terms <Col N="1802" /> of a third level degree which would qualify somebody to be a farmer in the way that I did a third level degree to qualify as a chemical engineer or somebody else did to qualify as a doctor or a solicitor. Of course, if we were talking about a real business which competed in a real world of real prices and real markets that is the orientation we would have; but because what we have is so different one cannot invest in education for something which does not really exist, and the industry of agriculture does not exist.  What we have is an expensive and expansive and &mdash; for those who benefit from it &mdash; a relatively comfortable rural welfare organisation which masquerades under the title of an industry.  It needs to be dealt with at root and branch.  That which agriculture is most given to lecturing the rest of us about &mdash; the benefits of the free market &mdash; ought to be experienced by agriculture for about ten years.  If the people in Irish agriculture and European agriculture were to have about ten years of market forces and market competition they would appreciate more the sort of advice they are prepared to hand out to everybody else.</P>
    <P>We cannot go on producing products, irrespective of market demand, at guaranteed prices.  There is no point in imagining that what we have achieved at this stage can be retained.  The tide of European opinion on the Common Agricultural Policy is shifting and we are going to have to shift with it.  Can anybody imagine what would be said if, in our present financial crisis, a manufacturing industry which employed 20 per cent of our population, which produced something that nobody wanted to buy and which was dependent on guaranteed prices, was funded by the European Community to keep it going?  Every economist in the country would be outraged, up in arms and telling us that this was artificial, unreal, an inefficient use of resources, and was so subsidy ridden that it would be impossible to make a decent economic cost-benefit analysis of what it was actually contributing to the country. Economists would, therefore, denounce it and the Government would begin to <Col N="1803" /> renounce it, in the way that the Government are withdrawing from most other areas of support for industry.  Of course, if the industry remained inefficient they could always blame the unions.  One of the great problems farmers have is that they cannot blame the trades unions for their own ineptitudes and, therefore, they pick on alleged trades union ineptitudes elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The problem with Irish agriculture is that it is large, powerful and appallingly inefficient.  It is not inefficient in the sense of its capacity to produce those goods for which there are guaranteed prices but it is inefficient in its capacity to produce goods for which there is a market, and that is quite different.  That is what a real agricultural industry should be about.  It should be about doing that which everybody recognises all productive sectors must do &mdash; produce products which a willing consumer wants to buy at a price which is attractive to the producer.  Irish agriculture has singularly failed to do that.  It is time that problem was confronted.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to talk about increasing milk production and beef production in that context.</P>
    <P>It has been a long held view of mine that there is an unwillingness to confront the inherent inefficiencies in agriculture. It is important to say that our agricultural land is perhaps the most important natural resource this country has.  It is a fundamental, an non-expandable resource and it is, therefore, a resource that cannot be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold in the same way as other commodities, the supply of which can respond to demand.  Therefore, it needs to be said that nobody can claim absolute ownership to a national resource like agriculture. It has to be also said that those who are either unwilling or unable to make proper use of such a fundamental natural resource should be encouraged to find some other form of activity and should be given an income which will encourage them to find some other form of activity.  I do not believe anybody is entitled to live on or off the land in a way <Col N="1804" /> which does not use that resource to the maximum benefit of our society.  If land is to be used it must be used in a way so that it will produce products which can be sold on the international market.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of inevitability, whether it be in the short or longer term, that Irish agriculture and European agriculture will be exposed to market forces and to competitive forces, as Europe becomes more and more obsessed with internal free markets and internal competition.  As a socialist I could defend the Common Agricultural Policy if the people who were defending it shared a philosophical value about the necessity of guaranteed prices and guaranteed food supplies.  But since most of those who vigorously defend the Common Agricultural Policy would vigorously condemn a separate policy elsewhere, I find it impossible to any longer give my support to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, land is a major resource and it must be used.  The only way to bring about the proper use of our land resources is through research and development and, on the basis of that research and development, training and the development of new markets.  I regard agriculture, as it currently stands, as a non-industry with no future and it is in that context that the question of agricultural research must be addressed. It is quite clear that, if that non-industry is to be brought into a competitive position, new products and, therefore, new markets will have to be developed.  That can only be done through an investment in research.  The idea that a mysterious entrepreneur can sniff the wind and think up a new product and miraculously create it into something that can be sold in the market place is a little bit of free market nonsense that does not really exist.  Those countries and industries which have been successful at developing new products, successful at maintaining their position in the market place and successful in their attempts to expand their share of the market have done it by planned and considerable investment in research.</P>
    <P>What do we find here?  According to the most recent estimates there will be a <Col N="1805" /> cut back of the order of a 43 per cent in the budget available for the new agency, Teagasc.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of the new agency, there are a couple of matters of detail on which I should like the Minister to tell me I am wrong so that he can give me the correct figures.  A 43 per cent reduction implies, if it is evenly spread, a reduction in the combined staff of AFT and ACOT from 2,200 to about 1,200. There will be about 1,000 reduction in staff if the 43 per cent budget cut is sustained. It is interesting that the Department of Agriculture are subject to a 5 per cent reduction in their expenditure.  It is interesting also that nobody can apparently persuade the Minister or the Department to tell us whether an audit of the efficiency of the Department has been conducted, whether that audit has indicated if the Department are over-staffed or understaffed and what, if anything, it is proposed to do about the alleged overstaffing.</P>
    <P>I do not think public servants should be made redundant.  Our public service is too small and it is not properly organised, adequate or sufficiently extensive.  I stand over that, and I want to remind the House that the Economic and Social Research Institute have concluded that and solution to Irish unemployment must involve an extension or expansion of the public service.  I am simply contrasting the reduction in the budget of an important area of development in agriculture &mdash; that is ACOT and AFT &mdash; with the relatively small contraction in the administration of agriculture via the Department of Agriculture.  I am not suggesting that anybody in the Department of Agriculture should be made redundant.  I do not believe in that.  The present scheme of public service redundancies must be the most wasteful use of public money that this country has seen since the great election give-away of 1977, because we are going to spend a fortune in paying people to do nothing.  That is the greatest and most ludricous farce this country will ever have been confronted with.  I do not believe in that and I do not think it should <Col N="1806" /> have been introduced.  I am not suggesting that it should be introduced now but I am simply contrasting the budget cutbacks for the new agency with the budget cutback for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The figures I have suggest that so far there have been between 450 and 500 voluntary redundancies in the two agencies. The disturbing feature about the figures I have at my disposal is that there have been about two voluntary redundancies in AFT for every one in ACOT. In other words, about 300 people have left AFT and about 150 have left ACOT. That means that the most fundamental area of Irish agricultural development and the one we most desperately need if we are ever to have an agricultural industry, which we do not have at present, is the one which has suffered most severely from the indiscriminate voluntary redundancies that seem to characterise this shift in employment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>These figures also show that in 1982 there were about 250 people employed by AFT in Moorepark but that by October last year that number had been reduced to 193 and by June of this year the number will be down to 142.  This has happened in an area which is central to research and the dairy industry.  Is that an indication that the reality that there is no future for dairying I mentioned has dawned or is it simply the usual sort of thing that seems to characterise many of our cutbacks &mdash; an unwillingness to think through at all levels and to take clear-cut policy decisions which would be implemented?  It is astonishing that the major centre of dairy research should have suffered a 40 per cent reduction in staff between 1982 and 1988.  I find that extremely disturbing.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one specific area which was referred to in some detail in the farming column in <i>The Irish Press,</i> EC Directive 85/397 on mastitis control, which will be effective next year.  It is suggested that if the EC standard was implemented about 30 per cent of milk producers would fail to meet its requirements and their products could not be <Col N="1807" /> sold.  That could cost us up to £250 million and could put the best part of 5,000 jobs at risk.  Obviously the control of mastitis is extremely important for the future of the dairy industry in the short term &mdash; and I do not believe that in its present form it can have any future in the long term.  The farming column also states that three people who specialised in the area of mastitis control were employed at Moorepark, one of whom was responsible for the development of proper standards of milking equipment, particularly for imported machines.  I am not a specialist in this area but I understand that the kind of milking machine used, and its care and maintenance, have a critical role in the spread and development of mastitis.  Those three people have now left the service of An Foras Talúntais and this means, because a critical standard of mastitis control has to be met within the next 12 to 18 months, that there will be no expertise in the one area of research and development which could have educated, organised and developed standards, etc.  If the Minister says he is confident that he has the resources within his Department to do this I think, without wanting to be offensive, that the Irish nation, in the light of the debacle of bovine tuberculosis eradication, has the right to be sceptical about such an assertion.  That sort of mindless cutting back of public expenditure &mdash; not to achieve any clear objective but to meet an ideological target of reduction in the public service <i>per se</i>&mdash; even if it does not save a penny, which in my view it does not do, is going to devastate a large section of Irish industry and we are going to have a similar debacle to that which we all associate now with the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There is a serious crisis facing Irish agriculture, but I have not a scrap of evidence which shows that the industry, whatever about the Minister or the Department, are prepared to face up to it.  People still apparently believe that they can use their considerable political clout to intimidate whoever happens to be Minister for Agriculture and Food to <Col N="1808" /> go on looking for more money to produce the same things which fewer people want to buy.  As a result of this more of these products are accumulating in storage all over Europe.  That is not a response to changing markets; it is not the response of a vibrant industry; and it is not the response of a self-reliant sector of our economy who are competing in the open market.  It has all the characteristics of dependency, handouts and of everything that many people in agriculture are prepared to attribute to other sectors of our society.  The greatest receivers and demanders of State hand-outs in our society are the agricultural community and until such time as that is brought to an end there will be no real vibrant agriculture industry in our society.  That is the context in which this Bill needs to be judged because it will do nothing to develop vibrant alternative products, or achieve high levels of added value products and agriculture related food-based products.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an article by Professor Cunningham of An Foras Talúntais in the January, 1988 edition of the <i>Food and Research Journal</i>.  That factual information in the article needs to be addressed the most, because Professor Cunningham refers to expenditure on research as a percentage of the value of agricultural production.  He shows that our level of investment on that index is well below that of most of our partners in the European Communities and is more on a par with countries like, and I quote &ldquo;Algeria, Turkey and Nigeria&rdquo;. Do we really accept that what we have is a Third World agricultural economy, or are we talking about an agricultural economy which is actually part of the most developed agricultural industry in the world?  If we are, then it is quite clear that all our partners in Northern Europe who are in the European Communities have recognised that there is only one way to develop agriculture and that is to invest heavily in research.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; because one of the other disturbing characteristics of Irish expenditure is that we actually expend proportionately more on training than we <Col N="1809" /> do on research.  I would have thought that at this stage in our development, and after almost 20 years within the European Communities, we would have sufficient levels of skill in agriculture to be able to begin to shift our resources out of training and into fundamental research and development in order to give a future to what I have already described, and will continue to describe, as a &ldquo;non-industry&rdquo;. In other words, we should start producing products that can be sold.</P>
    <P>Underlying the dubious values of combining these two agencies, something that is unprecedented in Europe, is the more fundamental threat contained in the reduction in the budget of the combined agencies.  Nobody could convince me that that is not going to be at the expense of the development of agriculture.  Unfortunately, in recent years our attitude to our physical environment, to developments in education and to industrial policy has been characterised by the notion that if we ignore something it will probably go away.  That seems to characterise our attitude to official agricultural policy also.  The Government and the major Opposition party believe we have to fight to defend the Common Agricultural Policy at all costs and hope for the best after that.  That is not policy; that is putting your head in the sand mentality and hoping it will go away.  The Common Agricultural Policy is effectively on its way out.  It will be reduced in either absolute terms or real terms and Irish farmers will be the victims.  There will be, as many of us involved in the Single European Act referendum predicted, a transfer of resources out of the Common Agricultural Policy into the increased Regional and Social Funds. Farming and farmers will be the victims and yet again farmers will become impoverished, dependent and will not have the resources to develop a vibrant industry.  I do not think there is anything in this Bill which gives any hope that we will have a real vibrant agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas of the Bill which could be elaborated on.  It is indicative of the real thinking behind this <Col N="1810" /> Bill that the official name in Irish bears no reference to the importance of research. Teagasc is the Irish word for instruction or teaching.  Clearly, it does not involve research, because &ldquo;taighde&rdquo; is the Irish word for research.  An amendment was put down in the other House to change the name of the body to An Comhairle Oiliúna Teagasc agus Taighde.  Those who drafted this Bill and those who brought it in obviously did not regard research with the same importance as they regarded training.  This is a national characteristic.  We are not particularly heavy investors in research.  The smaller countries of Europe have a heavier investment in research than we have and those which have <i>per capita</i> GNPs that compare with the best in the world have substantial investments in research. There is only one form of investment in research, and that is State investment. Members might not like that particular emphasis, but if they read OECD reports they will see that, effectively, all research is State funded &mdash; it is either funded directly by the State or it is funded indirectly by the State as tax write-offs.</P>
    <P>There is a philosophical deficiency in this Bill which is crystalised by the absence of any reference to research in the official title of the new body.  It would have been no problem to change the name to, for instance, An Foras Taighde and Teagasc, AFTT, so that it would have not been very different from the name An Foras Talúntáis.  I have listened to many of the speeches made here and there seems to be a far greater concern about the instruction element of this new agency than there is about the research element, whereas I believe there is no point anymore in instructing more Irish farmers on how to produce more goods that nobody wants to buy.  What we need to do is develop more new products other people want to buy at a price that is worthwhile to us.  Of course, that area is being played down in this Bill.  For instance, the Bill makes no reference to the publication of research findings and there is no obligation on Teagasc to publish anything.  As Professor Cunningham <Col N="1811" /> says in the same paper, the only guarantee of quality in research, as distinct from quantity, is publication in refereed journals from outside the country.  That is the only way one can have a guarantee that research is of an internationally acceptable standard.  This Bill does not require Teagasc to publish anything.  I find it an astonishing omission that whoever drafted this Bill &mdash; it is the Minister's responsibility at this stage &mdash; did not apparently either appreciate or have available to him the advice to enable him to appreciate the importance of publishing research material.  Research which is not published, which is not internally refereed and which is not meeting international standards is entirely worthless, not because of the quality of the people but because there is no international yardstick against which it can be judged.  That is the first amendment I would like to see in this Bill.  It is a simple amendment to ensure that as far as possible all research done by this body, Teagasc, ought to be published.  It is remarkable that it has not got such a reference in it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I find it astonishing that we have the extraordinarily heavily worded section 14 on disclosure of information. Disclosure of information seems to be a pet obsession of parliamentary draftspersons in my time in this House because the wording of section 14 is as follows:</P>
    <P>A person shall not, without the consent of Teagasc, disclose any information obtained by him while performing duties as a member, or member of the staff of ... Teagasc.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in a tiff, but I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.  I would like to know how that will affect, in particular, a member of a trade union working for Teagasc who gets involved in a Labour Court dispute about, for instance, conditions of employment, work practices, changes in job description, etc.  In regard to anything that he knows about Teagasc, he or she will have to get his or her employer's permission before he can disclose it in <Col N="1812" /> an adversarial confrontation before the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill to allow a member of a trade union to use publicly his knowledge about how Teagasc works, or what his job should be, in a trade union dispute without his being guilty of a criminal offence and subject to a fine of up to £800.  I find the philosophy behind that astonishing.  I think that it is actually not the intention, but it is one of the things that characterises a considerable amount of legislation that comes into this House &mdash; sloppy drafting.  The Minister is getting fidgety, so I had better let him go to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a couple of other matters.  I was emphasising the importance of publication of research.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce an amendment, given that he announced on Second Stage that he would introduce an amendment here.  It appears there are no administrative or practical problems about accepting further amendments and I believe that an amendment on the question of publication of research is one that deserves serious consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other issues. There has been a considerable amount of talk about the name, but I think we have said enough about that. It is extremely important that a provision, similar to that which exists for members of the board of <Col N="1813" /> Eolas, which is the amalgamation of the IRS and the NBST, should be introduced into this Bill.  It is astonishing that there is no requirement on members of the board of Teagasc, or members of Teagasc, to make a disclosure of interest where such an interest might arise.  For instance, if Teagasc is involved in doing some business with some agency with which the member of Teagasc has a business conncection, then that person should be required to disclose the interest.  It would be wrong, improper and a waste of resources to provide that people could not be on the board of Teagasc simply because of that.  But they should be required in the wording of the Bill which set up Eolas to declare such an interest and distance themselves from any decision making and that such an interest declared should be recorded in the minutes of Eolas.</P>
    <P>I again invite the Minister to consider that, or to explain to me why he does not think it is necessary to have such a provision about disclosure of interest.  It is both a healthy and a proper thing.  The Minister may say that we can leave it up to the good sense of the people involved, and I am quite sure that is true in most cases.  But if it is proper to have a disclosure of interest from the board of one agency dealing with research and development in the area of science and technology then it is quite clearly proper to have a similar requirement to have a disclosure of interest provision in an area dealing with agricultural research and development.</P>
    <P>Finally, and at the risk quite clearly of pleading a special interest, which is what I am doing, I would like some member of this or of any Government to explain to me why it is that in every Bill that sets up a State agency there is a secific requirement on Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament, if employees of such an agency, that they go on leave.  I do not know whether the people who draft legislation realise what the salary of a Member of Seanad Éireann is.  The truth is that the salary of a Member of Seanad Éireann is about marginally in excess of the average <Col N="1814" /> male industrial earnings last year; and £10,000 is about the average male industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>Every single Bill that comes in here has a provision that anybody who is an employee of an agency like Eolas or like Teagasc or like a long list of others, including the National Institute for Higher Education, must go on full time leave and draw no salary.  I do not understand what motivates this.  But if the successive Governments and the parliamentary draftspersons all feel that they want full time Members of Seanad Éireann, then Seanad Eireann Members should be paid a full time salary.  If, on the other hand, we do not want the Seanad to be a vocational body representing a variety of vocational interests, then let it not be seen to be such.</P>
    <P>I find it astonishing that we are to have in this House a panel representing agriculture from which, effectively, most of the specialist employees of the major State agency dealing with agriculture will be excluded because of the fact that nobody working in that sort of area could afford to live on what Seanad Éireann pays.  I make no apologies for that.</P>
    <P>Probably because I get myself into trouble for criticising politicians for having too much money I might get away with this.  I would like the Minister to explain what precisely he means.  Does he really mean that a researcher in An Foras Talúntais who is, perhaps, being paid £15,000 to £20,000 a year should accept a halving of his salary to become a member of the Seanad, or is it that this is a little frame of words because the wording verbatim moves from one agency to another?  It is simply a decision by somebody somewhere in the offices of the Government that participation in politics and work is a bad thing.  The truth is that many large sectors of the private sector in both the United States and Britain encourage participation in politics because they believe it gives an insight into politics and into their own activities. In this country we apparently tell people: &ldquo;If you want to be a Member of that House of the Oireachtas which is specifically designed to be a vocational body <Col N="1815" /> representing vocational interests, then off you go; we will not sack you; we will be very benevolent but we will not pay you either&rdquo; even though Seanad Éireann meets for about two days a week for about 40 weeks of the year which is about 80 days a year out of an average working year of about 220 days.  You are missing 80 days out of that, one third of the time, and your salary is taken from you.  I find that astonishing.  I will be introducing amendments to delete the reference to Seanad Éireann and I will introduce amendments on every single Bill that comes from this Government or any other Government who make that ludicrous exclusion.  There is a world of difference between membership of either the European Parliament and Dáil Éireann and membership of this House. This House incorporates a variety of people, some of whom have ambitions to be in the other House, many of whom have not, some of whom have party political affiliations, some of whom have not. It ought to be recognised as being different. It is quite clear in the perceptions of many Ministers that it is different and subordinate and, therefore, it ought to be recognised in legislation.  I will happily introduce such an amendment on Committee Stage.  I would like the Minister to explain in simple English to us how he, who earns well in excess of a Seanad salary, expects employees of Teagasc to live on £10,000 a year if they decide to become Members of Seanad Éireann and, if he does not, why he has such an unsustainable provision inserted into this Bill.  If it is not sustainable, I invite him to remove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I would like to compliment the Minister on his initiative in re-organising the research, education and advice services to the agricultural and food industry. Current national strategies for marketing tourism and food production must capitalise on Ireland's international image as a land of clean air and unpolluted soils and water.  In the seventies and early eighties, agricultural policy was directed <Col N="1816" /> towards production with little thought given to factors beyond the farm gate. We are now in an era in which quality rather than quantity determines who is successful in the world food market.  Consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in discerning the merits and failings of different patterns of food intake.  Chemical and artificial additives in the food chain are now being rigorously examined by consumer protection groups.</P>
      <P>The disaster at Chernobyl and constant spillages at Sellafield have brought home to us all the lethal destructive potential of nuclear power.  They also demonstrated to us the deficiencies in our environmental monitoring systems.  We have seen recent attempts by countries to question the radioactive levels in some of our food exports, for example powdered milk, thereby causing a doubt about the clean status of our environment. It is all very well for us politicians to pontificate about Ireland's clean and unpolluted image when we know in our hearts that at best our position is uncertain.  We must be in a position to back up our claims with solid scientific data and to refute those who would sully the clean image of Ireland's food producing capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to report to this House that at present a beginning has been made with regard to a study of the status of our soils, crops and water.  This investigation, under the aegis of the Nuclear Energy Board, in collaboration with the soil division of Johnstown Castle Research Centre, County Wexford, is but a first step towards providing the information needed in this critical area.  Member states of the EC are becoming more and more concerned about the prospect of nitrate contamination of ground water. The principal factors generally associated with this problem are the application of a high rate of chemical nitrogenous fertilisers and the production of vast amounts of animal manures which result from intensive rearing and feeding systerms. Johnstown Castle Research Centre is currently investigating many of these <Col N="1817" /> vital questions on soil and water pollutants, their causes and effects on the environment.  Much research needs to be done on this subject so that the producers, both industrial and agricultural, can be educated and persuaded to assist with our priceless national asset, our clean environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment An Foras Talúntais and ACOT on their contribution to Irish agriculture in the past. We are now living in a very challenging time.  The open European market is imminent.  Competition in the agri-food sector will be cut-throat.  Our back-up services must have progressive and aggressive policies to meet and beat these challenges.  Bearing this in mind, I urge the Minister to ensure that the management structures within the new Authority are capable of absorbing ideas and initiatives from all sectors of their staff and from the agri-food sector generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we have to speak about a very important legislative matter, which I support, the merger of ACOT and AFT, in the context of a lack of funding for that merger and at a particularly difficult time for agriculture <i>vis-á-vis</i> the national economic scene and the European budgetary scene.  The recent severe cuts in the budget of ACOT and AFT raise major issues in relation to public policy.  We must ask ourselves whether those responsible for this decision have seriously under-estimated the contribution which agriculture can make to the economic growth of the country.  If this is so, it is no harm to remind ourselves about the contribution agriculture can make and is making to the level of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a cliché at this stage to say that it is by far the most important industry in terms of share of national income, in terms of exports and employment which it generates in our economy.  Its exports play a vital role in the economy from the point of view that they bring foreign earnings into the country to a greater extent than any other industry and they are a source of revenue that is much needed in order to repay our massive <Col N="1818" /> foreign debt.  The gross value of visible exports increased from £4.1 billion in 1980 to £9.5 billion in 1986.  Over £7 billion comes from so-called modern industries, many of which are attracted by our low tax regime for manufacturing industry and the remaining £2.5 billion comes from agricultural exports.  That is the context in which we are talking about the value of agriculture to our total exports.</P>
    <P>In assessing the value of agriculture to the economy, account must be taken of the fact that a very small import content is required to add to the value of our domestic agricultural produce.  IDA surveys reveal that it takes about £16,000 for each job in foreign industries set up with the assistance of IDA grants.  The amount of money it would take to keep family farmers on the land or to set up people in agricultural industry is considerably less than that.  If we were to go by the EC figures it takes only £5,600 in terms of installation aid to fully instal a young farmer on the home farm.  I do not think that is an adequate reflection of what it would take in order to instal a young farmer, but certainly it is a considerable help to many of them.</P>
    <P>Profit repatriation is taking place on a large scale in this country in many of our multinational companies.  The direction of our policy should be to limit our dependence on multinational companies by giving a lead to agriculture and having a vigorous campaign for improving the agricultural employment potential that is so evident today in an industry starved of investment.</P>
    <P>Some of the modern industries with the most spectacular export performances contribute rather less than is realised to overall employment.  For example, the office machines industry increased the value of its exports from £250 million in 1980 to over £1.8 billion in 1986.  Over the same period it increased its employment by just 2,000 to reach 6,400 in 1986. In contrast, the agricultural and food industry, with exports valued at £2.5 billion in 1985, provided employment for 214,000 people.  We have heard a lot in <Col N="1819" /> the recent past about the need for the country to reassert itself in terms of a more vigorous approach to creating more employment in the food industry.  Before the last general election we had many posters and programmes of intent in relation to the value added that is essential, and indicating the employment that could be created in the value added areas of food, and its export potential.  I am sorry to say that that aspiration has proved to be nothing more than a myth. We have seen over the last couple of years &mdash; and exacerbated over the last year &mdash; the serious decimation of our national herd.  The statistics speak for themselves.  We have lost 100,000 female animals over the last three years as a result of the super levy.  The evidence suggests that we could lose 200,000 more cows in the next three years if we do nothing about the situation as it presently exists.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to appeal to the Minister to draw up a radical and comprehensive programme immediately to tackle the problem of increasing our national herd so that we can realistically talk about increasing the amount of value we can add to our agricultural produce.  We could then talk about creating jobs in the food and processing industry.  We would not be talking in aspirational terms but about imaginative and real steps rather than fictional pious aspirations.  We have the outlandish situation of Government policy throwing money at beef barons in order to create more meat processing capacity at a time when the actual national herd &mdash; the very raw material to create employment in that industry &mdash; is being whittled away daily by the decimation of the cow herd.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made attempts to knock together the heads of various interest groups.  I am sorry to say that his efforts have resulted in failure.  I know it does not give the Minister any satisfaction to have to acknowledge that the efforts have been a failure.  I would look forward in the coming weeks to the Minister drawing up a vigorous and comprehensive programme of his own. <Col N="1820" /> without depending on any other sector, to provide essential finance.  I hope there will be also an imaginative programme to boost the national herd and to boost employment.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge that over the last year or two ACOT had a significant involvement in trying to increase the suckler herd in many of the marginal and disadvantaged areas.  In my own area we recorded a considerable degree of success in terms of a 12 per cent increase in the number of animals in County Kilkenny. It is very little because of the low base from which they are starting.  Certainly, the disadvantaged areas and marginalised land can make a further contribution towards holding more female animals. The reclassification process and the extension of the boundaries is most urgent in this regard.  It will make much more headage available.  In view of the fact that two-thirds of that finance can now be recouped, following the success of the negotiations in February at the European Council meeting, we can now get back £2 out of every £3.  Up to recently we were getting recoupment from the EC only on a 50/50 basis.  This is a golden opportunity for the Minister to bring £2 into this country where he was able to bring in only £1 before.  It makes financial sense to do so.  It will assist many farmers in keeping female animals on their land in order to put them in calf to continental animals; because of the surpluses in milk production we would have to be realistic and promote continental animals and get payment for quality.  The standards of grading and the standards of payment at factories are a disgrace when one considers the efforts farmers are making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am leading up to the importance of having good research and advice in relation to this area.  I am complimenting ACOT on the role they have taken in this regard in promoting the importance of having good agricultural practices and the general contribution that organisation has made.  I hope they <Col N="1821" /> will continue to make progress under the provisions of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Five times more money on agricultural advice and education is being spent in Europe than in this country. This is a very serious problem and is very hard to understand.  At a time when we need more money in research and advice than ever before, because of the tightening margins in all our national enterprises, greater emphasis on research and development and advice and education is needed in order to bring farmers out of this present trough.  They should have less dependency on surplus products, such as dairy and beef products.  There should be alternative farming enterprises to provide some source of income for their families without having to resort to off-farm income in industrial employment, something which is very difficult to get.</P>
      <P>In 1960 northern Europe was spending more on advice than on research.  I do not have to remind this House that advice in Ireland is provided by ACOT and research is carried out by AFT.  A decade later research expenditure there has doubled while spending on advice has increased more slowly.  The Minister would have to take cognisance of the fact that the funding arrangements which he has proposed up to now in relation to our direction of policy, and the emphasis that has been put on ACOT and AFT under this merger, and on the development of education, advice and research is certainly not one that I would share.  We have had a debacle over the last six months in relation to the morale of the organisation.  The Minister may say otherwise, but he should realise that the morale of the organisation, because of the uncertainty in relation to funding, was never at a lower level.  This is something which I hope he will be able to redress in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to address the problem of this merger in its historical context. Various speakers have gone through the historical context of the county committee of agriculture structure which was there before 1979.  The Minister of the day, former Deputy James Gibbons, <Col N="1822" /> decided that we were going to have an organisation which was less than adequate.  The National Agricultural Authority which was proposed by the then Minister, former Deputy Clinton, at the time had left out research.  It is ironic that 12 years later we have all State agencies under the one body.  Farmers, rather than going to a plethora of organisations seeking advice on one hand and research on the other, are availing of services under the one roof.  We are able to eliminate the duplication of research and advice which we had up to now.  There may have been political reasons for leaving ACOT and AFT separate at that time.  I am glad to say that those political considerations do not now exist.  In the interests of amalgamation and rationalisation the Minister has decided that it is better to be less political and more efficient.</P>
    <P>There was a tremendous amount of duplication, undoubtedly, in that organisation. I know the Minister, aided by the voluntary redundancy scheme, is eliminating rather quickly any possibility of further inefficiencies, with the assistance of an efficiency audit unit ordered by the Taoiseach.  I know that he will have considerable studies at his disposal to ensure that there will be no duplication in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The officials will not mind the Minister taking £10 million out of the administation section and giving it to the new body under the ACOT-AFT merger. They would be delighted to do so.  In fact, they advised the Minister so well on the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food that he was clouded by some of the advice.  The Minister seemed to forget about the arms of the State that extend down the country.  I am talking about the funding arrangements he forgot about in relation to ACOT and AFT&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That speaks volumes.  I would love to agree with him that it is a myth.  He is a good man for statistics and the statistics show me that he has certainly lost the battle with his civil servants on this occasion.  The ordinary people down the country in Nenagh, Roscrea, Thurles and all over North Tipperary and, indeed, some people from Tipperary all know that the story down the country is that various civil servants looked after themselves on this occasion, and rightly so.

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry for the rude interruptions, and now I will continue.  As somebody who has been a member of the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture since 1982, and somebody who has had a close association with that forum for a considerable length of time through my family connections, I must say I was very disappointed that a more assertive insertion into the legislation was not provided on the importance of a county forum in order to have local involvement in discussing and airing the agricultural policies of the day in relation to county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Section 17 is unclear as to the importance and powers the Minister will have to tell an organisation such as Teagasc &mdash; a name which I find very difficult to pronounce &mdash; what to do so that people like Senator Ryan and others in this House can continue to make a local contribution to the agricultural development in their own counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of coming together once a month to speak about the various involvements and aspects of agriculture is important.  Perhaps people in the Department may not have liked getting some of the correspondence they received as a result of some of those meetings.  Maybe the Minister was guided by some of the same people to whom I referred earlier in relation to dismantling the county committees of agriculture in the context of this Bill.  I am sorry the Minister saw them in that light.  We cannot all be perfect in all the county committees.  I have to pay tribute to the tremendous contribution that Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture made in putting forward constructive suggestions on how various schemes could be <Col N="1825" /> adapted to meet the needs of the local people and the local farmers.  They feel now that they have been deprived of a voice in communicating directly through their elected representatives and their representatives at county level to the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>This will leave a vacuum.  It will be more difficult for national politicians to explain at each and every cross-roads in their constituencies the various directions which Department policy is taking. Various individual problems might arise in the implementation of a scheme.  I will give one example.  In September 1986, the Euro-currency loans came in.  They were very welcome to the farming community. They provided for the first time ever a cheap source of finance at 5.5 per cent to assist people to retain viable farming enterprises in the cereal and beef sector in particular.  This allowed the financial institutions to give some breathing space to the farming community who were in financial difficulties.  I am glad that, under duress, the Minister decided to continue the Euro-currency loans.  The roll-over was very welcome at the time. It continues to make an important contribution to the viability of many farmers who find themselves, through no fault of their own but because of bad weather and higher interest rates which they could have foreseen at the time, unable to get themselves out of trouble. Hopefully it will assist them to become viable once more.</P>
    <P>At that time we were delighted in the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture to bring before us representatives of the banks and of the State, and a Minister of State, to ask the State and the banks to forego their handling charges to make the cost of that scheme, and the interest rate that applied to that scheme, even more effective and attractive to the farmers involved.  I am glad that we succeeded in having our little &ldquo;tuppence worth&rdquo; thrown into that particular argument. I was glad at that time that the Government decided to drop their handling charges.  The banks did, too.  Adaptations of various schemes should be <Col N="1826" /> aired at local level.  There are problems at local level which might not arise in the Department of Agriculture and Food in Kildare Street, but which do arise down the country in the implementation of a scheme.  It is essential that they should be sorted out for the betterment of agriculture and the farming community. ACOT after 1979 certainly took on a very aggressive role in terms of providing education and advice.</P>
    <P>One of the major successes of ACOT since 1979 has been the green certificate course whereby 95 per cent of all young farmers entering agriculture in County Kilkenny are now coming through with the green cert qualification or with an agricultural college qualification before they go full time into farming.  This is a wonderful tribute to the success of the course.  The fact that it received assistance from the European Social Funding was a considerable help from the Exchequer point of view.  I am sorry to see that that funding has ceased.  I hope that the Minister will be able to restore most of that money on a future occasion through the increased funds available through the Regional and Social funds. The importance of education and advice through the agricultural colleges and through ACOT was emphasised by building into that certificate an incentive for land transfer.  People had to have their 80 hours or 180 hours' education to be eligible for that installation aid, as it is called now.  It provided a great incentive for young farmers to go into the ACOT centre, do their courses and qualify in order to be fully equipped to take on the family farm.  Many people in my part of the country would like to see the Minister paying out that £5,600 a little more quickly than he has been doing.  They would like to see the Minister providing more money in the Estimates for 1989.  I was told today that people who were approved in February 1988 would not receive payment for the installation aid grant until 1989.  Many young farmers will be disappointed to hear that.  I hope that the Minister in the course of his reply to this debate, will be able to assist me in that process.  Hopefully he will be able to <Col N="1827" /> assist the young farmers of north Tipperary, Kilkenny and places like that with the help of this grant.  I knows they have not been jumping the queue yet.</P>
    <P>ACOT's role in relation to promotion of agricultural production has been enormous. One of the things I am very disappointed about in relation to the voluntary redundancy scheme is that it has taken the best people out of the system.  This has been referred to by other Senators here today.  You cannot buy experience.  You cannot buy commonsense. Perhaps some of the people who should have got out under the voluntary redundancy scheme did not.  The unfortunate thing is that many of the people whom I would like to see retained in the service were unfortunately forced out of it under the voluntary redundancy scheme.  The very nature of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is a contradiction.  Nevertheless, they found that they had no future in the particular organisation in the direction in which it was heading. Morale was low at the time.  The confusion that up to today exists in relation to funding arrangements for the future of the organisation has left some people in the invidious position that the best thing they could do was get out of the organisation altogether and go into some other place of employment, or enjoy their latter years of life in happy retirement.  I would suggest that it will be very difficult to build up that same level of expertise and experience that has been of paramount importance in many areas of the country.  It is going to take a number of years to recover from that decimation of the service.</P>
    <P>The importance of ACOT and of AFT has been emphasised because of the need to promote alternative enterprises for agriculture.  The Minister will be aware that never before was this so important, because of the fact, as I referred to earlier, that the lid is on beef production. There is considerable scope and expansion in relation to peas and beans and in other areas of agriculture which have yet to come to fruition.  Tillage crops, which have been very well researched in <Col N="1828" /> research stations like Oak Park in Carlow, have contributed to the doubling of the yield of various cereal crops over the years.  Equally, spectacular progress has been made on sugar beet, potatoes and new alternative crops.  In terms of present prices this amounts to a national gain, in raw material costs alone, of approximately £250 million annually to the State.  The importance of research on tillage crops is significant when viewed in such stark financial terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore referred to the important contribution that Johnstown Castle was making in Wexford.  It is another research station which has had a cloud over it for the past number of months.  An investigation in Johnstown Castle into alternative nitrogen fertilisers &mdash; and this is important in the context of all the various debates that are going on about pollution at the moment &mdash; discovered that urea which is about 75 per cent of the cost of the standard calcium ammonium nitrate, could substitute for between one half and three quarters of the total nitrogen required.  The saving is considerable when you consider that the countrywide application of nitrogen is currently 320,000 tonnes per year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Kirk, has been assisting the process in trying to get more substitution for and less importation of horticultural products.  The mushroom industry, which is worth about £20 million and employs 1,600 people, was brought to its current level of national importance largely through research and development work that was carried out at Kinsealy.  These developments in research and the improvements that have taken place in those areas cannot be underestimated when we are talking about the important contribution that these organisations can make.  In addition, ACOT have now developed a very aggressive role and expanded into a number of other areas.  In the farm business service, for example, they have put in very strenuous work in trying to assist farmers to get out of financial difficulty by introducing a scheme called the Farm Business Service.  This scheme will <Col N="1829" /> assist farmers to keep on the rails financially so that they will not get into the position they were in a few years ago in relation to paying out large amounts of money for land.  They will get on-the-spot recognition of their problems at a much earlier stage of development, so that they can farm their way out of it rather than have to be baled out by the State.</P>
    <P>Another area which is of critical importance, and which ACOT have focused their minds on &mdash; and I must say that the Government have been focusing their mind on it also in recent times &mdash; is the area of pollution control.  This is crucially important.  It is something which has taken on significance in view of the debacle we had in 1987 in relation to some pollution spillages throughout the country.  Not all of them were related to farming problems; some of them related to the problem of silage effluent.  ACOT appointed a specialist in pollution control. Studies have been carried out and surveys done by ACOT people in the last couple of months while visiting farms. They give some sort of hope to farmers, so that they can in a year or two get themselves into a situation where they are free of the various problems in relation to pollution.  I welcome that development.  I acknowledge ACOT's contribution to that, as also will the Minister. I also welcome the extra grant aid from the State to eliminate the problem of farm pollution, which could get out of control if we do not take steps to remedy the situation now.  A 55 per cent grant has been mentioned as a possible figure. I would hope that the Minister, with the silage season in full swing at the moment will recognise the need for people to put down silage slabs and to introduce preventative measures to control silage effluent now.  Perhaps he would consider the suggestion that he would waive the necessity for application forms &mdash; I understand they are not yet available&mdash; so that farmers could start the work now, get the job done, get the necessary inspections carried out afterwards and then have the application forms filled up. <Col N="1830" /> If any farmer decides to do pollution control work he can only do good in terms of protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>To get on to the future funding of ACOT and AFT under the Bill, and recognising what I have been saying about the importance of research and advice and education, I regret that ACOT have been living on overdraft accommodation since January 1988.  That is not good for the organisation.  It should never have happened.  The confusion which arose over that merger has been compounded by the fact that there was a serious lack of funding.  They were not able to pay wages at the end of January and they had to seek overdraft accommodation. I thought the Fine Gael proposal put forward at the time by which we could amalgamate ACOT, AFT, the Farm Development Service and An Bord Glas and transfer £7.5 million from the Department of Agriculture and Food Estimate to the administration section in that area, was a constructive approach which would have helped to keep the organisation on a sound financial footing at a very critical time.  In the infancy of the merger it would have helped morale. It would have helped to streamline the organisation in a more confident and effective way.  It would have helped the Minister in his consideration of the merger of ACOT and AFT as a very dynamic factor.  He referred to it as a central dynamic feature of agricultural policy in the future.  I do not think he instilled any confidence about dynamism in relation to the merger of ACOT and AFT by starving them of finances in the early stages of bringing about the merged organisation.</P>
    <P>In referring to the charges for services, which we passed through this House last year, even though they had signed contracts with ACOT personnel many farmers were wondering if they would get the service for which they signed a contract in view of the fact that the number of advisers would be considerably less. There were worries about that and that has not been clarified.  The funding arrangement is critical in relation to <Col N="1831" /> satisfying the fears of the farming community about charges and they want this matter clarified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see so much ministerial control inserted into this Bill.  That has been referred to by other speakers, and in the other House.  The Minister should have given more autonomy to this organisation. He has adopted the big stick approach and he has brought more power from the outside world into the Kildare Street location, much more than I like to see.  Perhaps he will comment on that in winding up the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that Teagasc will concentrate on the essential services and those of low priority will be reduced or phased out.  That was a dangerous statement to make because the smaller producer could take that statement out of context and think that the Minister was making a statement about a new organisation and did not care whether or not the smaller producer existed in relation to giving Teagasc the necessary back-up. That could be misinterpreted.</P>

I hope the Minister will reassure the House at the conclusion of this debate that he is not forgetting about the smaller producer who has an important contribution to make that such producers will not be phased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> Various people have mentioned the change of name to Teagasc.  Senator Ryan was speaking about it as I entered the House.  It is regrettable that, in the context of the debate in the other House, the Minister did not see fit to change the name.  I hope an amendment will be supported by various people in this House asking the Minister to consider changing the name at this stage.  I was surprised such confusion had arisen about the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; of which various interpretations have been given.  Some people suggest that it means incantations or magic spells.  If it will have a considerable impact on agriculture, in the fashion which I have outlined, if it will cast a magic spell so as to transform agriculture, I will allow the Minister to keep the name.  I would not like to see the name developed in the magic spell direction from the point of view of the fairytale association.  I hope the Minister will think of a more realistic, saleable name.  A lot of money has been invested by ACOT and the Department in selling the name &ldquo;ACOT&rdquo;.  It is a household name and some variation of that might have been acceptable, such as ACOTT, which would have included the research element in the ACOT name.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to welcome the merger Bill, which is part of the business we are discussing here this evening.  I regret that such legislation to merge ACOT and AFT was not better handled. Perhaps the Minister also regrets this. I hope the future funding of this new organisation will be such that it will guarantee a service to farmers, and that research and development, which are of more importance now than ever before, will continue to commend the same importance they did in the past and that the rationalisation which the Minister spoke about and which needs to be undertaken in agricultural centres will not impinge on various research stations in Kildalton, Oak Park or places like that. Perhaps the Minister can head into Tipperary for some of the savings he wants to make in terms of institutional care.  I welcome the merger.  I wish the organisation every success.  I hope the changes <Col N="1833" /> we have suggested in the course of the debate will assist the process whereby agriculture can be promoted to the best possible extent in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the changes that are proposed.  I welcome the restructuring of the agricultural industry and the new body that will now have responsibility for promoting agriculture.</P>
      <P>Many people involved in agriculture, nationwide, will welcome the new Bill. Unlike Senator Hogan, I do not see any magic solution to our difficulties in agriculture. We can sing the praise of ACOT: we can be hypocritical, but we have to judge from our experience on the ground. Having spent 25 years as a member of a committee of agriculture, in 1985 I considered it not worth my while putting forward my name to be a member of that body.  That is the value I would give it. Committees of agriculture have outlived their usefulness.  We have so many structures and so many organisations.  Some people who supported Governments in the past are speaking with their tongue in their cheek.  It was impossible for ACOT to survive when we had offices full of staff who had nothing to do.  I am thinking of the backlog before the farm development service was finally cancelled and withdrawn.  I am thinking of the many backlogs, the thousands of applications, the number of people who were caught with applications for farm improvement and farm development schemes which never got off the ground.  They were caught and they never had their grants paid.  This Minister and the present Government were not part of that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You would not need to be a university graduate to recognise that we have had a fairly difficult history in agriculture. Anybody coming from the West, especially from the patch I represent in Donegal, would welcome with open arms the setting up of new structures.  I want to make some brief comments about my <Col N="1834" /> hopes and aspirations for the new organisation.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister when he is appointing the chairman and the ten members of the new organisation &mdash; and I have read the Bill and I realised that the Minister is making provision for people with experience &mdash; to consider people who have a knowledge, and a background, and an input, and an experience in tillage.  While Senator Hogan complains that the Minister may not be doing enough to support the cow herd, and far be it from it for me to not welcome any advances in any area in agriculture, those of us who represent areas with a tradition in tillage are asking the Minister at this stage how far can he go.  Even in today's post I got two communications from the Minister.  One of them says that I will be interested in the following announcement made this week about temporary milk leasing schemes, increased reactor grants, sale of intervention beef and so on.  There has been talk about beef, about herds, about milk, transfer of quotas, clawbacks etc. to the total exclusion of those who actually have generations of commitment to the family farm and who have been working at tillage all their lives.  We are enthusiastic about the new structures.</P>
    <P>We sincerely hope the Minister will recognise that there is an imbalance at the moment and that now is the time to correct that imbalance.  We applaud the decision to restructure the whole area of agriculture.  I have read the Bill and I recognise that the Minister provided in section 10 that no Dáil Member, or Seanad Member, or MEP may be a member of the new board.  I think that is right and proper.  Senator Ryan said we spend only 80 days in the Seanad and this should not debar us from being on that body.  Senator Ryan must be getting off a bit lighter than some of the rest of us who represent rural areas because I would claim as one Member of this Seanad that I spend nearly five days a week &mdash; not 80 days a year &mdash; at my work. It highlights the lack of input the lack of knowledge on the part of people who are the most eloquent when it comes to <Col N="1835" /> contributing to a Bill.  I certainly think that it is right and proper that no Dáil, Seanad or MEP Members should be included in the ten-man structure.  Under section 17 (1) the new structure will plan to set up subcommittees.  Does the same restriction apply under this subsection? Would a Member of the Dáil, an MEP or a Member of the Seanad be excluded from those?  I would be less definite about that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 4 (5) (ii) where provision is made for testing of seeds and plants, including potatoes, I would ask the Minister to clarify for me what provision is in the Bill to make people who import seeds and plants, including potatoes and seed potatoes, meet the required standard to be laid down.  In the past we have had an area where growers and packers and assemblers and wholesalers and those involved in the food industry, seeds and plants, were forced to comply with standards.  I totally support the rigid standards laid down. However, coming up to the Border, or coming from outside the country, there was no examination to confirm that you had conformed to the standards laid down.  Now is an opportune time for the Minister to include in this Bill a provision for inspection and to advertise widely abroad that where products fail to comply with the standards set under the new Bill they will be rejected and turned back.  I ask for clarification on this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Coming from a farming background I am enthusiastic about the Bill's provisions and I look forward hopefully to a completely new approach.  There is room for fresh thinking on the potential development of agriculture.  I have a very strong view about our involvement in Europe.  We have to look at areas where we have to discontinue the production of many products because there has been a beef mountain, a butter mountain, a milk lake, wine lake or a mountain of agricultural produce of some kind or another.  The people who enjoyed the benefits and got the intervention money to build those mountains are I think, the <Col N="1836" /> people who must be identified and who must pay to eliminate the mountains. Recently we had an important seminar in the Royal Marine Hotel in Dún Laoghaire which was held to highlight the technical advances in agriculture.  We had somebody there from a university in the United States who highlighted the potential and the advantages of modern technology and what it could do for agriculture.  I asked the professor who was there representing the University of Washington one question: &ldquo;When you get your technology advanced to the stage when you have reached the peak and the maximum of aiding those involved in agriculture, and all of the those involved make a great success and increase their income from agriculture, what would you suggest can be done for the small producer in the West of Ireland who is put out of business in the course of achieving your great technological advance?&rdquo;  I am still waiting for an answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has major responsibilities and it is nearly impossible for him to meet all the difficulties. I see great hope in the laying down of new structures.  A lot of fresh thinking will have to go into agriculture and I strongly appeal to him to lay down guidelines for the new body which will include provision for the survival of those involved in tillage.  If we allow the land to be abandoned and if we listen to Europe at the moment saying &ldquo;We will pay you so much not to grow anything on your land, to abandon your land&rdquo; I think we are going to pay the price later on.  It would be a tragedy if we lose the value of the small home, the input, the number of people that are employed and the small farm that can sustain itself and the family. Many eloquent speakers on a variety of subjects have highlighted the value of the small family farm.  I have great fears for the small family farm.  I hope that this will be an opportunity to provide some support and to provide structures that will sustain those who are involved in this crucial area.  I know that the Minister has many people advising him on how best to restructure the agricultural busines.  I <Col N="1837" /> think he has a very difficult task ahead of him and I am looking forward with great expectations to this new organisation. The general public and those who are committed to live on and to work the land will welcome the setting up of the new structure.  I just hope that when the Minister is appointing the new body he recognises that tillage must not be allowed to disappear as a part of our future in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak on one central aspect of this Bill.  The Minister knows I would not chance my arm as an agricultural expert, but there are things in the Bill which do concern me.  Normally, I would be very glad to welcome any measures likely to enhance the performance of the agricultural economy, but there are aspects of this Bill which do give me pause.  I think it is a bit of a leap in the dark to put all these aspects of agricultural and food activity under one umbrella, as I understand there is no comparable organisation in European member states.  If economy of administration is one of the aims, that is obviously, in these harsh budgetary times, a good thing; but it would be shortsighted if these aims were to be achieved at the expense of more important long-term considerations.  If the new dispensation increases the efficiency with which research results can reach the end-users, then that will certainly be welcomed. There must be misgiving &mdash; and I know there is misgiving &mdash; in various sectors of the services affected about any new Bill which would introduce further ministerial and departmental restriction in areas which have not been accustomed to those restrictions; and, apart from the necessary fiscal control, an extension of bureaucratic control is quite clearly undesirable.  The danger is that this might interfere with research activity, which is so vital to the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has praised the excellence of the work which has been carried on in the research aspect of this industry; but any diminution of this research, any deterioration in research standards, any change in the nature of the research <Col N="1838" /> would be bad for the food industry with its promise of further employment, with its potential for expansion and the challenge that faces us with the completion of the internal market.  It would be ironic if this legislation were in any way to militate against the objective which is being emphasised so much these days of putting our best foot forward in all areas of productivity in the next few years before 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister has paid tribute to the excellence of the work of An Foras Talúntais, which over the last two or three decades has played a crucial part in the increased productivity of Irish agriculture, especially over the halcyon years in the 1970s which we may not &mdash; probably will not &mdash; see again.  The years ahead are going to be very competitive, the food industry is much more sophisticated than it used to be and obviously competitiveness is the name of the game now all along the line, not simply where farmers and food firms are concerned but competitiveness to research level as well. The research back-up is vital so that we can maximise cost reductions, improve quality, add value and add profitability. Unless we can match our European partners in the quality standards of their research and the skill and effectiveness of their research &mdash; people like the Dutch and the French &mdash; not alone will we not advance in the European market, where the new opportunities will be provided very shortly, but, even worse, we will lose our place here in our own home market.</P>
    <P>It is important &mdash; and the Minister will, I am sure, agree &mdash; that the continuation of research in An Foras Talúntais should be related to our own specific needs, our own conditions &mdash; in other words, that our research should not be derived at second hand, or simply taken from other sources; so that, at the very least, it is important to maintain the present level of research.  In previous contributions Senator Brendan Ryan quoted from Professor Cunningham's article which pointed out that the present level of research is no great shakes in the sense that the money spent on research does <Col N="1839" /> not put us in very favourable competition <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European partners and that really we are at the level of what are called middle income developing countries like Algeria, Turkey and Nigeria. At the very least, the expenditure on research should not be allowed fall below its present level.</P>
    <P>There is disquiet about certain implications of this Bill among professional research staff.  Everyone knows that morale is at a low level in many areas of the public service, and of what you might call the semi-State service, and that this is indicated by the departure for more fruitful fields of excellent public service staff.  The morale will be further adversely affected if what is suspected of this Bill comes to pass, namely, if the spirit of restrictiveness and bureaucratic interference which seems to be represented in many clauses of the Bill is implemented.</P>
    <P>I hope to make further coments on Committee Stage.  Like Senator Ryan, I would like to say that there are things which should be put into the Bill and things that should be taken out of the Bill.  What should be put into the Bill is an emphasis on the importance of research findings, because there is widespread fear among the people who would be affected by the Bill that research would be curtailed, that other activities will be imposed on the staff to the detriment of research, or that research will be custom made to particular ventures or operations and that the real value of research, which is research for its own sake paradoxically &mdash; that is what finally is of most benefit &mdash; will be affected.  So, what I would like to see put into the Bill is an encouragement or a guarantee of the continuing importance of the publication of research findings, the kind of research which is referred at international level, which is the guarantee of international information being available to our researchers and that the whole international dimension of research will not be affected by the Bill.  What is needed here is an explicit <Col N="1840" /> assurance and reassurance of the continuing importance of research.  That is one thing which should be put into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Again I echo the objection of Senator Ryan to the lack of any disclosure of interest clause for members of the board. He pointed out that such a clause appears in the Eolas Bill and the comparison is fairly close because Eolas is also concerned with areas of research.  There seems to be no good reason why an interest clause for members of the board should not be inserted into this Bill and, indeed, into all Bills of this nature.  It seems that one of the areas about which we are continuing to be very coy and reticent is the extent of the interests of public representatives, the extent of their private interests and the way in which that private interest may conflict with the public good.  I cannot see any reason why such a disclosure of interest clause should not be inserted into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Attention was drawn by Senator Ryan to the provision contained in the Bill prohibiting staff members of the new organisation from being Members of Seanad Éireann.  It may be said, as it was often said to me in the past in this House when I lamented the fact that the expertise of a particular person should be lost to this House in particular because of membership of a particular board, that this is a long-standing tradition.  There is a sense in which Seanad Éireann is a suitable place for people who are researchers and it seems odd to deprive if you like &mdash; because this is what it would mean in effect &mdash; a vocational body such as Seanad Éireann was intended to be, of the expertise of people like that.  In fact, it seems to do far less harm, to put it negatively, to have a staff member of Teagasc as a Member of Seanad Éireann then it would to have a member of the board not disclosing his interest which might well be in conflict with the public interest. These are some of the things I would like to see put into the Bill and, correspondingly, I would like to see sections removed from the Bill which I will refer to again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (3) which would seem to <Col N="1841" /> limit the freedom of research and section 19 which would again create an environment where the research arm of the new body would seem not to be independent, are some of the areas in which the Bill could be improved.  I regret that in Bills of this kind I cannot give a wholehearted assent to them.  This is a thing I would normally like to do.  It seems to me there is a whole area of legislation to object to which would be simply perverse &mdash; and I do see the good intentions of this Bill &mdash; but it does seem to carry the harzards I mention and for that reason I have grave reservation about it.  Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will not speak for too long because I believe that every day that passes is a costly day for the farming community and the nation.  In the months that have passed we have lost some of the finest brains in both ACOT and AFT due to their complete frustration and not knowing what was ahead of them.  That was a great loss to the nation as well as to the farming community.  We have lost people with long experience in research and in advising people.  Even in my own county we have lost some of our key advisers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will pass through this House as speedily as possible in the national interest.  I have been a member of the local committee of agriculture in South Tipperary for over 21 years.  I thought I would never see the day when, due to the delay in this Bill being passed, we had not the price of a stamp since early January. That is a sad day for our most important industry.  The members of any committee of agriculture could go to the officials and be told: &ldquo;We had no money even to write to you about any problem.&rdquo; That is very sad.  Under successive Governments billions have been wasted since this State was founded and continue to be wasted in useless areas in various Departments. This is a crying national scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Government have made a gallant effort to try to tidy up every Department.  It is about time.  The more I dig, the more I find out.  We would have <Col N="1842" /> had a revolution if the ordinary public knew about squandermania in every Government Department over the past 30 or 40 years.  It is a national scandal. Meanwhile, the county committees of agriculture have been living on a shoestring since 1 January.  We met many times at our own expense. I wonder are there many people in the Department of Agriculture and Food who would do that. I believe they are slightly over-staffed there.  Some of them do not know where they are or what their duties are.  That is also a national scandal.  There are people who do not want to be told what their duties are and where they are.  They are reading <i>The Irish Times</i> every day.  What consolation is that to a farmer down in Tipperary or up in Donegal with the tax man at one door, the pollution officer at another door and somebody else at some other door?  Survival has been the name of the game in agriculture over the past four or five years with bad weather and quotas of every description.  It is about time we as a nation stopped blaming everybody else for our problems and did something about them ourselves and got off the bloody fence.  We have to much bureaucracy and very little democracy.  I hope this Bill is not leading us that way. I have faith in the present Minister &mdash; being a Tipperary man himself &mdash; not to allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>I also believe there should be no taxation without representation.  I have seen some of the finest people in my own county of Tipperary and in other counties as well who spent many days holding meetings.  I saw this coming about three years ago under the previous Government when we had various people trotting around holding area meetings.  I was chairman of the County Committee of Agriculture in South Tipperary at the time.  We had a big meeting down in Kildalton and we were brought in and asked for our views.  I knew what would come.  All the smart guys over in Kildare Street said: &ldquo;These bloody fellows are sending up resolutions from various counties.  We will have to get rid of them, silence them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The committees, as such, may have <Col N="1843" /> outlived their usefulness.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that there will be a replacement county structure because we want to monitor what is going on.  The farmers in the various counties want to have some input into what type of advice is being given, that is, if we are to have any advice or any service because it is very thin on the ground now.  Our advisory staff were not educated and employed to be revenue collectors.  This is disgraceful.  There are so few of them now on the ground that they are spending more of their time filling forms in the offices with no time to go to the ordinary farmer.  This is a bloody disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is doing his best in Brussels and at home. The whole ACOT service has been stood on its head in recent times.  They have lost so many staff in each county that the few who are there have too many clients. They should not be wasting their time as revenue collectors.  They should be giving advice, not filling forms and collecting revenue.  Perhaps some of my friends over in Kildare Street could go down and spend time collecting money rather than reading <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I am not making any false accusations.  It is in the public press every day of the week.  There are reports of so many hundred people; I do not know where they are trotting to or from.  I would prefer to see them in Tipperary or any other county going out and collecting that money and let our advisers have more time to give advice on the ground to the small, the medium and the big farmers.  This may be a bit of a joke, <Col N="1844" /> but to the people who have to live off the land it is not a joke, with the reduction in their incomes over the past number of years and all the various quotas &mdash; milk quotas, beet quotas, beef mountains, grain levies, and so on.  The only exception is sheep.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister and his officials will not try to pull the wool over the farmers' eyes in this Bill.  If the Minister does so, the people will remember him for it.  Like the old advertisement on the radio for the veterinary product says: it is a queer name but good stuff.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the area offices in each county.  We have splendid offices in Clonmel, Cashel, Tipperary town and in my own area, Cahir &mdash; as good a farming area as any part of the country.  I was very annoyed early in January when the area office was closed down.  They had some of the finest advisers there down through the years.  It is a dairy, beef and grain intensive area, stretching back to the borders of Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  From the furthest point to the head office in Clonmel is 25 miles.  That office was closed down and the secretarial staff were sent to Dublin to add to the pile.  After a lot of hassle they agreed they would open the office two days a week.  There was no saving there.  We were told there were big savings to be made.</P>
      <P>What section of society would accept that kind of carry on?  If we were in a trade union we would bring the country to a standstill.  Anything is good enough for the farmers.  Close down the Garda stations, schools, polling booths, post offices and everything.  What would be the reaction?  They would not vote in some of the cities and towns unless there was a polling booth around the corner. Close down agricultural advice centres for farmers &mdash; to hell with them, let them go where they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent that attitude very much, and I wonder what the Minister will do with the other permanent offices we have? Will they be closed down and sold off?  I hope not.  I do not want to live to see the day when we would be just getting circulars from Kildare Street from people <Col N="1845" /> who have no practical knowledge of farming.  I say this with all respect.  This is what Senator McGowan said there a while ago.  I will repeat it again: there is waste going on in this State in the wrong areas &mdash; consultants for this and architects for that hospital or school or whatever. Millions are being poured down the drain annually; yet we are crying out, saying: &ldquo;Well, there is no money to do this and there is no money to do that&rdquo;. We are penny pinching in an area where we should not be penny pinching; but we are not sweeping out all the wastefulness in the various Departments.  Why hit agriculture? It is our own most important industry and has stood the people well in tougher times than we have now.  I believe we will end up with about 250 advisers for the Twenty-six Counties, about 40 per cent of the total staff in that area.  I think that is a bit lopsided, to say the least.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister again to use his good offices when this board is set up to see to it that there is a county structure, whatever it is.  The farmers are not greedy people.  I am not saying that any one ever became a millionaire out of committees of agriculture.  Twenty years ago and more farmers were classed as second-class citizens.  The advisory service went out to the boreens and parochial halls to advise farmers and to help and encourage them to raise their families and improve their incomes.  They have great confidence in the advisory service to advise them about taxation, etc.  That is all shattered now because most of the good people have gone.  They could not sit around any longer and wait to know what is going to happen.  Uncertainty in any area of life is bad, particularly in agriculture. It is like rain coming when you are cutting a field of hay or a field of corn.</P>
    <P>One could go on.  I hope when this Bill is passed that it will not be another layer of bureaucracy that will hinder the farmers of this country in their tough future. As I outlined a while ago, with all the various levies and quotas, I believe we need a top class advisory and research staff in order to assist as many people as <Col N="1846" /> possible to make a living on the land.  Our Constitution refers to this as well.</P>
    <P>At this critical time I think it is wrong that we should have such a valley period without a good service.  I do not know the reason for all the uncertainty, why the Bill did not get greater priority last year, why it was not pushed through to get on with the job.  We had to wait until June, but we hope it will be done as soon as possible at this stage anyway.</P>
    <P>One could go on and talk about the wastefulness.  I do not know why the Cathaoirleach objected to the point I made.  If I made some slip of the tongue, I would not be the first in this House to make a slip of the tongue.  I apologise if I made some slip of the tongue about something there a while ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the people in Moorepark, who are not too far from me, and also to those in Kildalton.  There are wonderful people there.  We have lost some of them as well, and I hope that the future of both Kildalton and Mooepark, Fermoy, will not be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the point I made about the collection of the fee from the farmer for advice.  That has worked fairly well to a point.  A lot more money is available out there, but the advisers have not time to collect it.  I know this from practical experience.  In our county the few advisers we have left cannot afford to offer assistance and advice to any more farmers.  In other words, there are many of them out there willing to pay £100 or £200 but the advisers have not the time to provide the advice.  That is rather serious.  I would like the Minister to look into that urgently.  Those people should not be spending their time filling forms. They are not revenue collectors; they are agriculture advisers.  I would like the people in the Department to listen to that too.  We should have plenty of other people to do that job.</P>
    <P>I will admit that advisers as late as yesterday said: &ldquo;We want to pull out of this thing.  It is a sick joke.  We are not qualified to go around sponging money off people, wasting our time.  The farmers are ringing up but we tell them that we cannot go out because we have not the <Col N="1847" /> time&rdquo;.  There was a period earlier in the year when they were not allowed out because there was no travelling expenses for them.  I wonder if that ever happened in Kildare Street?</P>
    <P>As a result of all this the farmer down the boreen is losing faith in the whole system.  The farmer who cannot increase his quota, the farmer who cannot grow beet, the farmer who cannot produce too much beef because his holding would not suit or who cannot go into the sheep production either because of the type of land he has &mdash; those are the people who need assistance, whether they be medium or small farmers.  The big farmer can afford to pay for his advice more freely than the small man.  A hundred pounds to a small farmer today with a young family is tough enough.  The bigger man can lose it in his tax affairs and get some kind of a rebate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a practical man. I would appeal to him not to forget, as Senator Paddy McGowan said, the small family farms because they stood to this nation in the past not alone producing quality food during the war years but when men and women were needed, when we were trying to gain our freedom, they were there as well.  It would be a pity if the qualify of life on our small farms is destroyed by too much of this red tape.  We are notorious for it in this country.  We have more people telling a few people what to do at great expenses. That is sad.  The people out there, whether it is agriculture or any other area, are getting sick of this thing.  Everything is costing so much.  We have not the price of a stamp in the committee of agriculture since 1 January, and that is no exaggeration.</P>
    <P>We cannot go blaming other people about the problems in this country because we cannot run our own affairs here efficiently.  We will have to do it one of these days, because the taxpayers and the young people coming up are not as gullible perhaps as I and other Senators here would be to put up with this from any Government.  I know the Government have made a gallant effort in the past <Col N="1848" /> year and a half and I compliment every Minister, including the Minister Deputy O'Kennedy.  In my humble opinion they are the best Government since 1961 including the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is about time because the people out there are getting fed up with it.  They are paying too much for too little service.</P>

      <P>Of course it does.  Our role as participants in the Irish agricultural industry should be and must be to retain our standards as producers of pure, high quality natural farm products. Our standard should be the badge of highly guaranteed quality natural products. We need continuing research to maintain these high standards of value-added fresh quality foods.  I must admit at the outset that, when the 1977 agriculture Bill was going through, that is, the National Agricultural Advisory Education and Research Authority, Bill, 1977, I was in favour of a unified system for the advisory service and the research services.  I also personally favoured section 22 with the whole lot going into the Department, or what we used to refer to as section 22 of the Department of Agriculture coming out into the new service. I have nothing against the Civil Service running these services.  As a matter of fact, from a political point of view it is much easier to get a response from a Department of State than it is from a <Col N="1849" /> statutory authority.  We have 115 semi-State or statutory authorities with varying degrees of profitability and efficiency. We all know exactly the kind of service we get and the responses or non-responses we get most of the time from some of the most notable ones.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I was a member of a committee of agriculture since the mid-fifties, until the last local elections when we lost a few seats in my county.  The number of seats allocated to us was quite small.  Nevertheless, I do not have any regrets because I heard from colleagues who served on that committee that it was quite a disaster.  Regionalisation of the service which was started in the 1977 Act was a change that did not work.  As a farmer who needs the advice of the advisory service I have profited from it over the past 30 years.  I have no great regrets about a change being made. Now as much as ever, we require a top-class advisory service and we certainly require a top-class research and development service.  In this country we have never got down to having a top-class service.</P>
      <P>I know that great work has been done by An Foras Talúntais over the years and Dr. Tom Walsh, Pearse Ryan and the present director Mr. Downey have led very notable and worth-while teams and have achieved a lot.  The big mistake is again repeated in this Bill.  One need only look at the back page and to see in the Second Schedule &ldquo;Enactments Repealed&rdquo;, including a section of the Bee Pest Prevention Act (Ireland), 1908.  I do not think that is terribly important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Agriculture Act, 1931, which set up the county committees of agriculture, Parts II and III are repealed.  The whole of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1934 is repealed; all of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1944; all of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1948; all of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1955; all of the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais Act), 1958; the whole of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958.  We have the de-democratisation of the system by the removal of section 81 of the Electoral <Col N="1850" /> Act, 1963.  The Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964, is gone; the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1967, is repealed; the entire Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1970, is repealed; the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1971 is repealed; the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1974 is repealed; the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, is repealed; the Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Act, 1979, is repealed; the whole Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1980, is gone and the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1987, is gone.</P>
    <P>That is 57 years of legislation replaced by a small Bill, which I do not particularly like, with 31 sections.  What I do not like about this is that in 13 of those 31 sections the power in 57 years of agricultural legislation goes not to the Minister for Agriculture and Food but to the Minister for Finance.  That is a disgrace.  The gurus in the Department of Finance in every area of activity, whether it is State, semi-State or you name it have dealt a death blow to the economy of this country.  In every county and in every electoral area in the entire Republic, there small industries are closed down because the tax man, the Revenue Commissioners, put in receivers.  There is no county in this country where the Revenue Commissioners, have not closed down industries and done away with employment and the amount of money spent on redundancy payments and on dole has far outweighed the debt due to the revenue.  That is a fact.  No Member of this House can deny it.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Minister for Agriculture and Food after 57 years of legislation dealing with and improving the lot of Irish agriculture &mdash; an important industry in this country &mdash; have been transferred to the Minister for Finance who already has too much power.  The officers of his Department have usurped the powers of every other Department in this State and this is my sole crib with this Bill.  It is a disgrace and I am disappointed in the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has, I would submit, reneged on his loyalty to the farmers and the industry <Col N="1851" /> that he represents by allowing that to happen.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to indicate when he is replying to this debate what reserved functions are now left for agricultural research and education and the advisory services.  On top of that we have the food industry.  We have the entire production and service industry and we have the Department of Agriculture and Food with 4,000 civil servants with very little to do.  I am absolutely shattered at this Bill.  I do not want to be accused of being political but why must we have that?</P>
    <P>Section 4 (6) provides that Teagasc can earn money outside of the State, probably through agency work in the Third World.  Is that the basis on which Irish farmers will have to compete after 1992?  I do not understand where the priorities lie.  Obviously, the draftsman is from the Department of Finance and once we accept that, we can see that this is just a new way of getting in additional taxation.  It does not even have to be hidden at this stage and the fact that it will milk the system for what it is worth is a pity.</P>
    <P>The original Bill was drafted in 1977 after considerable effort during 1975, 1976 and probably during 1977 before the change of Government.  I submit that Mr. Gibbons who was the Minister for Agriculture in 1977 changed, as he was entitled to do, the Bill that was prepared by the previous Government because he did not like it.  This Bill writes off agriculture and contains no recognition that in future the agricultural industry will require top class research programmes and facilities.  I notice that the word &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; is not even mentioned in the definition section and yet if we listen to the advice we are getting sheep will be an increasingly important commodity in agricultural economics.  Last year An Foras Talúntais were forced to discontinue their sheep research station in either Roscommon or Mayo, I do not know which.  I want to know whether those services will be adequate.</P>
    <P>I believe I can speak with a fair amount <Col N="1852" /> of authority on this Bill.  I suppose I should declare an interest in it because I am a farmer and have been a member of a committee of agriculture for the best part of 30 years.  I live quite near the research station in Oak Park which specialises in crop husbandry.  The work carried out there is significant but there was a 50 per cent cutback in their funding last year.  The Minister must be aware that crops, whether cereal or root, have not maintained their percentage profitability. The research arm of An Foras Talúntais should be available to devise and propagate new varieties of crops and pest control systems.  I should like to know how they will compete with the services being provided by central Government now that their budget has been halved.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be kind enough to let the House know what powers are reserved to him and the Department of Agriculture and Food because the guy calling the tune in 13 of the sections is his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  That is nonsensical.  For many years we advocated the transfer of the semi-State organisation Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann which was under the Department of Finance to the Department of Agriculture and Food because we thought the Department of Agriculture and Food would be more sympathetic to that important semi-State industry.  All of the technical services for agriculture advice and education are going to be under the thumb of the Minister for Finance and I think this is a nonsense &mdash; there are better words I could use to describe this but I do not want to incur the wrath of the Cathaoirleach.  If the new body want to set up a scheme on a new strain of barley which requires finance, what sort of a hearing will they get in the Department of Finance?  It is regrettable that they should have to make special provision for external agency services because that will not be required if we are going to compete in the Community.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) provides that the functions of Teagasc shall be to provide or procure the provision of &ldquo;educational, <Col N="1853" /> training and advisory services in agriculture, including such educational, training and advisory services in agriculture as may be specified by the Minister for the purpose of giving effect to any directive, regulation or other act adopted by an institution of the European Communities...&rdquo; That is a very important function, but I should like to know why it has to be written in here.  Will the Minister have a say in this or will he just implement directives?  I ask the Minister to explain the phraseology used in this Bill?  It will be a sorry state if the profitability of agriculture has to depend on the people in the Department of Finance, who do not have the slightest care about whether people are in or out of work. They have treated every other sector in the same manner and cutbacks are taken percentage wise.  I believe that the officials who are specially chosen for the Department of Finance do not care about the human element of any job.  If the Minister has any other experience of this he should tell the House.</P>
    <P>In the early sixties there was great movement in the advisory services and the greatest boost they got especially in Tipperary, was the parish plan, which meant that there was one adviser for three rural parishes.  The adviser was directed to become the friend, confidant and supporter of individual farmers and that system worked well during that period.  I am not suggesting that we should revert back to that, but if the Minister funded the new organisation so that they could install a new computerised information service there might be some hope for this system.  During the last few years ACOT were denuded of their ordinary advisory services in each county.  The staff either went to regional offices or to the office in Blackrock, which overnight acquired a staff of almost 100 people.</P>
    <P>At one stage County Laois had 17 advisers and one secretary.  In order that services could be supervised at regional level ACOT had an office in the Lyons Estate of University College, Dublin, which was staffed by a regional director, a couple of assistant directors and a <Col N="1854" /> number of staff.  In order that they could cater for the rest of the regions between 70 and 100 administrative staff were located in a new headquarters in Blackrock. I do not know which section of the Department of Agriculture and Food directed the service.  I do not understand why the Minister of the day took that direct control away from the section because in the ordinary way that the Civil Service works they had achieved quite a lot.  Output was much improved over the years and the service met most of the challenges of the time.  The county committees of agriculture who have been castigated for the past five or six years for want of finance are now being unceremoniously abolished.  I believe that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture were a valuable asset in channelling local advice to a central authority. Civil servants and draftsmen seem to have a tremendous detestation of public representatives and this is obvious from section 10.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said &mdash; and I was surprised at this &mdash; that the position now is over 70 per cent of the committees' expenditure has been absorbed in travelling expenses of the members.  I was a member of the Laois County Committee of Agriculture and for years and my reimbursement for travelling expenses amounted to the princely sum of £1.0.6.  When I was chairman of the committee in 1979 I let the Laois Conference of the Blind use a section of the ground floor of our building which consisted of a kitchen, a pantry and another room, so that they could set up a craft shop to make baskets and so on. There were six or eight blind people involved in that craft shop, as well as a social worker from Tullamore.  I rented the kitchen for one shilling a year because I thought it was the charitable and proper thing to do.  The auditor surcharged me approximately £100 per year, but in effect I had not got a penny for years.</P>
    <P>Before the last local elections I used to get £16 or £19 for each monthly meeting. There were 16 members on the committee and I think most people used to receive about the same amount.  Is the <Col N="1855" /> Minister now saying that 70 per cent of the finance allocated to a county committee of agriculture was used to run the advisory service?  I do not know the exact figures but I do not think the expenses for each member should have amounted to more than £170 or £190 a year.  I have not been a member of a committee for the past three or four years but nevertheless I do not understand how travelling expenses could amount for 70 per cent of a budget.  I am surprised that the Minister laid the blame for the closure of the advisory service on the cost of member's travelling expenses.  I would like the Minister to explain that in fairness to county councillors and farmers of all political shades and opinions who have, since 1931, served their counties well.</P>
    <P>When the first of the green certificates were introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Food my committee actually had to canvass farmers to let their sons go.  The farming community in the main are conservative.  The older farmers had got by without any such grandiose classes and they assumed their sons could do the same.  Members went out of their way to ensure the success of the scheme and it is beyond me how the Department or the draftsman did not know exactly the nature of the work undertaken by the committees.  I regret that a role has not been found for the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. It is an important aspect and I would be amazed if the Department and Minister were not aware of the fact that practices, procedures and husbandry in counties vary greatly depending on the quality of the land from one parish or townland to another.  Therefore, one generalised grandiose scheme is not going to work, because what might suit one area may well be of little value to another area.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few general remarks about the service we are doing away with.  To my certain knowledge An Foras Talúntais have been effective and efficient in carrying out the duties and responsibilities assigned to them under the Acts I mentioned earlier.  The <Col N="1856" /> research centres at Moorepark, Oak Park, Johnstown Castle and Lullymore made an excellent contribution to the dairy, pig husbandry, root cereals, tillage, peat soil, vegetable and forestry sectors. I read in the newspaper that the research centre at Lullymore was to be closed and the board dispensed with and I believe this would be typical of the Department of Finance.  In the midlands there are over a quarter of a million acres of cutaway bog and Bord na Móna, who I understand are on a wind-down, do not know what to do with it.  It is not fit for forestry because Bord na Móna, despite protestations over the years, cut it down to the gravel so that there is not sufficient peat there to support an afforestation programme.  I hope that the new organisation will ensure, in the interests of the midlands, that the peat experimental station at Lullymore will be expanded so that they can find ways of utilising that huge expanse of cutaway bog which covers large tracts of land in Counties Offaly, Kildare, Westmeath and Laois. If that bog is not utilised the people in those areas will be left with a brown desert and that would be highly undesirable. The people who are charged with research are the ones who must come forward with the suggestions and proposals for that bog.  Research has been carried out in Lullymore for the past 25 or 26 years and results must be available which would ensure the proper utilisation of that bog.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us a clear indication of where the agricultural industry is heading, especially when the research arm are not enthused by the importance of their job.  Anyone who has visited any of the research stations over the last few months will know that the people there did not know whether they were coming or going and they do not have any great spirit.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that ACOT and An Foras Talúntais be merged into one organisation.  The recruitment grade for An Foras Talúntais was an honours graduate.  They had no such requirement for the advisory service.  I suppose that <Col N="1857" /> will not constitute a problem.  Nevertheless, I think that we need this long research, for trials and for the development of new varieties.  Indeed, the food technology sector is a whole new region where we must have an input and have results from the research if we are going to keep abreast and to benefit from the value-added, high quality guaranteed food products that this country is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know where one would try to amend the Bill.  I would submit that it is a poor substitute for the 57 years of agricultural legislation that it repeals and I would hope that time and the Minister's expert ideas on quality will prove me completely wrong.  I would hope to see a future in agriculture for myself, but from where do I get advice?  I certainly will not get sympathy if I am depending on the Department of Finance.  It has never been there in the 30 years I am here.  In regard to any section of the community or any Department in the State, if they want to cut back they will cut back percentagewise and they do not really care what section is affected or is left out. I very much regret that this Bill is so restricted.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Reading speech, which I followed on the monitor and read with great care, paid a fullsome and very well deserved tribute to An Foras Talúntais and said it had a worldwide reputation for the excellence of its research.  I quite concur with that.  But, if the Minister is so proud of the work of An Foras Talúntais, why does he abolish their title and their designation and replace them with an unpronouncable Irish word &ldquo;An Teagasc&rdquo;, or whatever it is &mdash; I have not got my tongue around it yet.  What will that mean to their colleagues in the research institute in Scotland or the Northern Ireland people who will probably work very hard to come to terms with it.  I think these people will be obscure for the next ten years.  Certainly, for the next four years they will be invisible.  At this time, when we need the support of every arm of the State, it is important that An Foras Talúntais should be there.  I would ask <Col N="1858" /> that in this instance the Minister would give a more recognisable name to his new creation.  I think we are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>The most important part of this Bill is the provision of research and training.  I do not think that the ACOT service has ever recovered from the advice they gave previous to the last bank squeeze.  As soon as farmers got into trouble ACOT not only distanced themselves from them but they charged people for going back for advice to make sure that they would not come near them.  They were quite content to sit and do nothing and blame it on the lack of expenses or whatever excuse came into their heads.  That, I think, has been a great disappointment, and we are suffering from that.  We have a situation now where practically all agricultural product is gone onto quota.  If you are a beet farmer you do not know whether you are going to have a beet contract until a week before you sow, indeed until they come around to sign the contract.  Cereals have escaped, but cereals have been on contract for years so that in the main you wait for the price to see what you will sow.  The whole agricultural industry is in turmoil.  It is unfortunate, yet the Minister for Agriculture does not seem to be coming to grips with the problems.  I do not know if the Minister recognises the problems that beset the agricultural industry, especially those of the smaller farmers at the present time.  They have no one to contact. It would be far more honest if the Minister said &ldquo;Listen, let's go and privatise the education and advisory services.&rdquo; Take the aids to agriculture available in County Laois, one of the few counties where the complete scientific soil survey has been carried out by An Foras Talúntais and which shows clearly that sizeable portions of the county have a land quality much the same as County Leitrim.  Yet for some reason this Government have absolutely no intention of designating those areas as disadvantaged when they clearly are.  Those are the kind of problems farmers, big and small, are being faced with in rural Ireland, and I do not see that my county can be any different from the rest of <Col N="1859" /> them.  There is the outrageous situation in County Offaly where one side of the River Shannon has been designated for the last 12 years; the east bank is supposed to be prime land and yet it floods to the very same height, five feet, for seven months of the year.  The whole thing is a nonsense.  I thought that this Minister for Agriculture would tackle those ongoing problems which have been paid lip service year in and year out.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister has not got this amalgamation idea wrong. Certainly, while I am not against change, I do not see in that anything that would make me very happy.  Indeed, I am absolutely scared stiff at the idea that these important functions of the Minister for Agriculture should be transferred, almost with a cheer, to his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be regretted that this Bill is coming before the House at this time because there is an impression among the urban population, probably emanating from much of the publicity farming has been getting in Europe and here in this country, that farmers are no longer wanted or needed.  This Bill is not going to help that impression or the division between the urban and rural dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen some newspaper reports where it was said farmers have been paid, as one correspondent put it, to stay in bed, or paid to farm three quarters of their farm, and whatever they do with one other quarter is up for speculation.  This is rather puzzling to the urban population and I do not think this Bill will help in that regard.  However, the Bill is before us.  I am not the youngest Senator here. I may be in the autumn of my life but I feel sure that many younger Senators will see the day when we will regret the passing of this Bill.  Everything seems to be geared toward the concept of a large European market.  Many would say that we are being ruled from Europe.  I do not think any of the regulations or rules which come from Europe have ever benefited <Col N="1861" /> the small business person in Ireland, and certainly the small family farm will not benefit in the future.</P>
    <P>I know it can be argued that whatever difficulties we have experienced &mdash; we have had fewer difficulties in farming areas than in other areas &mdash; we would have no hope outside the EC.  We must be members of it; but I do not believe we must go along with all the rules and regulations these dreamers in Brussels come up with.  I am sorry to say that our negotiators in Europe are either pressurised, outvoted or outmanouevred with regard to the many regulations, mostly affecting the farming community.  Here we are gearing ourselves to that large European market and nothing small is to be counted anymore.</P>
    <P>The Minister today gave us much to think about.  He made a fair case generally for what he is trying to do, but he has not been altogether fair in all of his remarks.  I believe agriculture over the years, even when ACOT was brought into existence, suffered in this country; but it will suffer still more.  I am not talking about the large ranches, which they are used to talking about in Europe and in America and other countries where a holding of 500 acres is considered to be a small farm.  I am talking about the small Irish family farm, which one apparently does not want anymore. When we move away from that there are many who will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure what prompted this Bill.  I am inclined to agree with Senator McDonald when he made reference to the Department of Finance.  I see now that every move being made is referred back to the Department of Finance. Many of the other Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, have less power than when I first came into the Oireachtas, and that is not so long ago. There seems to be an over-anxiety to ensure that the books are balanced, that whatever measures have to be taken the money end of it must be right.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Department of Agriculture are gearing themselves to ensure that they do not overstep their expenditure.  That is a great pity, because <Col N="1862" /> agriculture has been described by the Minister and by many of his predecessors as our greatest industry.  How long will that last?  Do we not need our small family farms any longer?  If we are gearing ourselves towards creating farms of 800 acres, 1,000 acres or 2,000 acres, then it is about time the country was told that. We should not be edging towards it, pushing out, and causing suffering on these small family farms in the process.  Of course, there are changes taking place in all aspects of life, but there are far greater changes in agriculture than in most other industries.  Certainly, since we joined the EC, we can see that happening.</P>
    <P>I often think of the time after the last war when we moved towards creating farms that would produce pigs exclusively, fowl exclusively or cattle exclusively. Many of the Senators will not remember that, but I am old enough to remember when we moved away from the couple of cows and the few pigs in the backyard and, indeed, when the cottier had his couple of pigs in the backyard. We thought we were going to flood all of Europe with pigs.  The reverse happened. When we did away with the cottage pig the pig population dropped to figures none of us ever dreamed of.  Instead of doing a better job we were cutting our own throats.  Many of us would gladly go back to the days of great opportunities in the forties and fifties &mdash; opportunities which we missed &mdash; in opening up and supplying extra markets in Europe.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make information and advice services more remote for the farmers who most need them.  Of course, much has been done in research.  I fully agree with the Minister in his remarks regarding An Foras Talúntais.  A great deal has been done in bringing the results of that research and advice to farmers. But the greatest loss of all will be the loss of the county committees of agriculture, because much of the expertise, much of the advice and much of the knowledge that was brought to the farming community has been brought through the county committees of agriculture.  Many farmers would never have accepted the advice that was coming down from the <Col N="1863" /> experts were it not for the presence in the local communities of the county committees of agriculture.  I would appeal to the Minister, when this Bill becomes law, to make some provision for local committees once more.  He has given way in the Dáil to having on the committee people other than his appointees &mdash; outside interests will have the right to nominate persons from which the Minister can choose.  I do not think that is enough. Unless we get back to our county committees we will not be dealing adequately with the needs of the local small family farm.</P>
    <P>A number of people in this State played an important part in the discussion when we were deciding whether we would join the EC.  The biggest objection put forward at that time was that we would lose our sovereignty.  We have a lot more to lose if we are to lose our traditional way of life on the Irish farm.  Many thousands of European visitors come to Ireland each year simply to see how our farming is carried on.  This will bring such a dramatic change in farming methods and farming generally in Ireland that I believe we will lose that.</P>
    <P>The power of the county committees of agriculture have been eroded over the last few years.  When we moved to ACOT it was not a move in the right direction because there were cutbacks.  Gone are the days when the farmer, when building a house for his son, could call on the county committee of agriculture for advice as to how that new farmhouse should be laid out, not only on site but also the interior of the farmhouse.  That might not seem very important; but how the family live on that family farm is extremely important because every member of the family is taking part in the business, unlike most other businesses.  It is important that the house should be laid out in the proper manner.  There is now no advice on that subject.  Perhaps we could have suffered that, but many small farmers had to diversify in the difficult years we have just come through.  I know many who went into poultry &mdash; the few hundred turkeys at Christmas which <Col N="1864" /> saved them from disaster, which saved them from being put out on the roadside. But they had to do it without the advice of county committees of agriculture because the poultry instructors were taken from us some years ago.  Perhaps the Minister by the nod of his head is trying to correct me.  It has been taken from the man with the small flock.  The man with the big flock is required to pay for the service.  I know very many small farmers, particularly in my own area, where the few hundred turkeys at Christmas saved them from disaster.  Anyone producing fewer than 500 turkeys was not entitled to any service whether they were prepared to pay for it or not.  It was only those with the larger flock, over 500, who could get the service provided they paid for it.  One would have thought that it should have been the opposite.  In years gone by such services, not only in this area but in other areas, were given to people who were too small to provide it for themselves and not given to the person who was big enough to provide it for himself.  We did the reverse in agriculture; we looked after the person with the big farm, the big flock or the big herd, and the person with the small farm or the man who wanted to diversify had to diversify with his own knowledge or with what he could pick up from people perhaps serving on county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with an item at page 6 and I believe he was grossly unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Minister did not fully take it, I will expand on it. I quote:</P>
      <P>The position now is that over 70 per cent of committee expenditure has been absorbed in travelling expenses of the members and payment to ACOT for administrative services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister failed to give the expenditure in those areas over the years.  If it is picked up by the press &mdash; we are probably too late tonight for the press to pick <Col N="1865" /> it up, which is just as well, but the Minister was not too late &mdash; it will drive another wedge between the agricultural community and city and town dwellers. Seventy per cent of what figure?  Seventy per cent of 10 per cent of similar expenditure five years ago?  The county committees of agriculture have been starved of finance.  The only expenditure left to them was the travelling expenses.  That was an unfair and an unfortunate sentence for the Minister to put on the record.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is saying that he has less time now to pay attention to this House than he has to Brussels, then perhaps the point is made, the point I was making earlier in my contribution tonight that the Minister is overworked, that the results we are getting at home because of negotiations and decisions at European level are not beneficial to the person who means more to this country than most other communities &mdash; the small farmer on the family farm whom we are forcing out of business.  We are denying <Col N="1866" /> him the service he is entitled to.  I would go far as to say that that person might have a case under the Constitution that we are denying him the right to live in this country, that we are giving him absolutely no assistance while we are prepared to give assistance to foreigners coming in to take a chance at some business and to make off again, leaving many suffering families behind them.  We are grinding to a suffering existence the small Irish farmer.  More than the loss of production on that farm will be felt in this country, because we are losing something which has been of great value from the point of view of tourism and of preparing them &mdash; as indeed more of them will have to be prepared &mdash; for other lands, because, unfortunately, over the next five years I can see more people leaving this country.</P>

I know it will take five years to prove me right or wrong.  I hope I am wrong.  I hope the Minister, or anyone who has heard me make this statement, will be able to say in five years time &ldquo;Larry, you were wrong&rdquo;.  I believe that this Bill will drive more people from the land.  In the past fewer people emigrated from the land than from industries in the towns or countryside.  There is something that keeps an Irish farmer, or a lad or <Col N="1867" /> lassie reared on Irish soil, in Ireland.  I very much regret the introduction of this Bill at this time.</P>

I am long enough on this earth and I have a neck hard enough to be able to withstand any opposition that comes providing I know I am right.  I will give in easily if I am doubtful, but if I am right I will hold on. Many may see the farming industry as having come through a rough time.  Many may see the small Irish farmer as a person who is not needed on the European map today.  We will regret the day we close the shop.</P>
      <P>I believe we are coming to a period when the Irish farmer will need more advice than he got during the forties, fifties or sixties because we are coming to a time of large markets, and huge production.  As I said earlier, there is now a scheme to pay farmers to leave a third or a quarter of their farms uncultivated, but no Irish farmer is going to leave a quarter of his land uncultivated.  This farmer would need advice on what to do when any such scheme is put to him.  Of course, the Minister can say he can grow trees on his farm &mdash; a very good proposition, but no Irish farmer will take advice from forestry instructors to grow trees.  If he is to grow trees on the other quarter or third of his farm it is from the agriculturalists that he will take the advice.  I believe the departure of the county committees of agriculture is a disaster. I believe the Minister will probably see that.  I could join the rosary with the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But they may read them in a year's, two years' time or maybe ten years' time when I have departed from this House, or maybe departed from this earth, for that matter. I am quite sure the Minister has doubts, but he is probably not allowed to put them to us I believe it would be far better if Ministers generally &mdash; I am speaking about Ministers right down along the line; not just a Fianna Fáil Minister but any Minister who may sit up there &mdash; were more frank in their Second Stage speeches in telling us &ldquo;Of course, this is the way I see it.  This is what I have to do, but there are dangers in it&rdquo;.  The Minister has not outlined any dangers in his speech.  Of course, he has to hide his fears, because he must put the point across.  I believe he does not have to do that.  I believe no Minister has to do that in any Department.  I believe they should be franker with people, just like the Department of Finance are being frank with the country now, and they are getting general acceptance of the cutbacks and what they are doing in health, social welfare, education and other areas like that.  There is a general acceptance now of these cutbacks that we would not have got ten years ago, five years ago or perhaps four years ago.</P>
      <P>I do not have to remind the House of the 1977 election &mdash; everything was then quite the reverse &mdash; but we would not have got an acceptance like that.  I believe that, if Ministers were franker and if they outlined to us the dangers in Bills they were presenting and if the Minister said he would keep an eye on the situation, perhaps I could sit down with a little more ease.  I am sitting down now with great fear in my heart of what will happen to agriculture here over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position will be clarified later.  I will continue with my own comments and, when it comes to 12 midnight, we will see what 12 midnight brings.  I intend first to make a few points on the Minister's speech in the House earlier today.  Many people have commented upon the name that has been put on this new amalgamated body.  The Irish name, we are told, means either teaching or instruction &mdash; Teagasc.  It is not a very well-chosen name and, whilst this may not be an extremely important point in the overall context of the Bill, it is a pity that agreement could not have been reached in the other House between the parties to find a more suitable title for the new organisation.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, if the Minister had even organised a competition amongst infants of a school-going age, he would have had a better name proposed by people of that age group.  The Minister informed us earlier that he has reflected on one issue since the Dáil debate concluded, namely the question of the establishment of subsidiary bodies by Teagasc, and he indicated his willingness to place an amendment before the Seanad to allow Teagasc to remove the restriction on the subsidiary bodies being wholly owned by the new organisation.  I would agree with this amendment and, whilst I realise that some of the speakers earlier on expressed some doubt about the benefits of this, it is good that all State bodies are to be allowed to develop their functions in a broader fashion than they have been down through the years.  I hope that, as a result of the decision to allow Teagasc to set up subsidiary bodies which are not fully owned, we will see them branching out into areas which the former AFT and ACOT bodies did not and that we will see some important joint venture bodies set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much mention here in the debate of the importance of research to the whole agricultural industry.  Obviously, we are all aware of agriculture's future dependence on the quality of <Col N="1875" /> research which we make available to it but, when we compare the amount of money being spent in this country in comparison with that being spent by our nearest competitors within the European Community, we have to agree that our efforts and our levels of expenditure are quite questionable.  I have some figures here which show, for instance, how Britain has been spending 3.2 times the rate we spend in Ireland, how Belgium spends at least twice our rate, The Netherlands over one and a half times our rate, and France one and a quarter times the rate in Ireland.  This shows that what has been happening up to now in this country has not been sufficient and that the further cutbacks which will be imposed as a result of this merger on the amount of money being spent on agriculture research will cause a continuing problem and will probably result in us falling further behind in the development of new products in comparison with our European competitors.</P>
    <P>The former AFT body &mdash; which is not fully redundant &mdash; produced some dramatic results in the Irish agricultural field. As one who lives quite adjacent to one of these research stations, namely, the Moorepark dairy research unit in Fermoy, I would have to agree that the present uncertainty surrounding the whole future of the merged AFT &mdash; ACOT body and the undoubted uncertainty which has arisen as a result of the limited expenditure on it has caused a lot of difficulties for these institutes.  If Moorrpark is anything to judge by, there is a great lack of confidence in the institutes at present.  The whole agriculture industry will suffer as a result of this lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>I know that, once this Bill is concluded here in the Oireachtas and once the situation becomes more clear, some of this concern and worry should cease but, at the end of the day, the limited funds which will be available to the research institutes will ensure that they will not be able to develop as they should and, consequently, the dairy industry and, <Col N="1876" /> indeed, all other projects in the agricultural sectors will not be developing as they should and will not be preparing for the future as they should.</P>
    <P>I recall that, when we debated in this House last year the Bill dealing with the decision to allow the ACOT organisation to charge certain moneys and make levies for their services, those of us who warned at the time that it would result in a big fall-off in the number using the services were told by the Government spokespersons that we were trying to create a scare and that large numbers of people would not stop using the research or advisory services.  However, almost a year later, I think even the Minister would have to admit that our assessment of the situation then was most certainly correct.  Unfortunately, whilst the sum of money being charged by ACOT to many of the farmers might have appeared quite small, it proved to be beyond the reach of many of the farmers, particularly the smaller and under-developed farmers, and those people who needed the services most have, unfortunately, in many instances, stopped using the services. That is very regrettable and it is bad news for the agricultural industry as such and for the economy of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We see at present a return of mass migration from the land to the urban areas and this movement of people in search of employment and in search of a better living than they can find on the land is adding to the unemployment figures and adding to the numbers taking the emigration option.  The only way, in the short-term at least, in which we can try to alleviate that situation is by ensuring that people on the land have enough options to get around the present production quotas which face them.  In order to bring this into being, we need to spend more, certainly not less, money on research and development.  Unfortunately, in that report this Bill is going in the very opposite direction.</P>
    <P>One need only look back briefly at the history of the research and advisory services to know that they have been most successful and have brought about <Col N="1877" /> a major increase in agricultural output, an increase in the overall GNP, and has put much spending power into the pockets of people in rural Ireland.  For instance, when we consider the pilot schemes set up in the mid-sixties by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, to develop agriculture, particularly throughout the western areas, we see that they increased real income in five years by over 40 per cent.  This was an amazingly high figure and it showed how successful the advisory and research bodies were.  From 1968 to 1974 we had schemes to help the smaller farmers and this type of small farm scheme produced an income increase of 70 per cent for those it was designed to help.  This was a most laudable figure and it helped to keep people on the land and off the job market which was already overflowing.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme was operated from 1976 to 1982, and was processed by ACOT, increased the real income of those who operated under the scheme by over 35 per cent, again a figure which speaks highly of the type of service being provided and those who were providing the service.  The research, education and advice budget at present is falling very significantly at a time when it is needed most.  I mentioned earlier the figures which we are spending in comparison with our European partners and they are quite insufficient.</P>
    <P>A recent European study on the agricultural situation in the European Community showed that, on issues such as research and developments, countries such as The Netherlands, Belgium, etc. were spending the highest possible percentage, while countries such as Ireland and Italy, who need to be spending the highest, are spending the least.  Consequently, we are falling further behind in the league of agricultural advancement throughout Europe.  One of the gravest problems facing Irish agriculture today and one which certainly needs to be addressed fully by a properly funded, properly formed ACOT-AFT merged body is the problem of the structural difficulties which we face in some of the more western regions.  As someone who <Col N="1878" /> comes from an area which is still considered agriculturally advantageous, I would have to say that we too in our areas see it.</P>
    <P>I am speaking in particular of the huge number of fragmented holdings which are dotted all around the country and which cause quite a number of restrictions as regards development and advancement in farming.  The solution to this problem of fragmented holdings needed not necessarily be the swallowing up of small farmers by the bigger farmers and the creation of larger units.  It could well be the bringing together of many of these farmers to try to sort out some of the boundary differences and difficulties in their areas.  Some sensible discussions which could well be organised by the research agencies would, I think, result in at least partial solutions to these problems. This would be extemely advantageous to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The age profile of the farming community in this country has caused many problems and at present the rate of farm ownership among the over-65 community is one of the highest if not the highest in Europe.  Admittedly, there have been quite a few attempts over the past ten years to try to redress this situation and we have seen special stamp duty exemptions etc., to encourage the earlier transfer of land holdings.  We have seen schemes such as the installation grants system to bring about the earlier transfer of lands into the hands of younger farmers. However, as a result of the decrease in moneys at present available to ACOT, a fall-off will take place in the numbers of these necessary transfers because ACOT will not be able to run the number of courses which they should if farmers are to qualify for the special exemptions. ACOT will not have enough advisers going around the country to promote the transfer of land.  It is regrettable that the consequences of this will continue in view of our difficult age profile situation.</P>
    <P>There is another major structural difficulty in this country caused by what I would describe as inappropriate land use. Some speakers earlier mentioned the lack of afforestation development in areas <Col N="1879" /> where it could take off the ground in a quite dramatic fashion.  Sometimes when we speak of afforestation we think of counties such as Leitrim where the percentage of trees grown could be increased dramatically but there are many acres of land throughout the more developed areas of the country where afforestation should be encouraged and would provide increased economic well-being.  I see farmers in parts of my own territory spending many thousands of pounds on the development of poor land and, after a few years, this poor land unfortunately reverts to its former position.  If they had spent some of this money on a policy of afforestation it would provide much greater longer term benefits.  I welcome the forestry Bill which one of the Minister's colleagues has introduced.  I know the topic of forestry is not relevant to this AFT-ACOT merger Bill, but I am just trying to make the point that, in order to encourage such things as an increased afforestation policy, we need the help of a full and well-financed development agency.  Unfortunately, it would appear that in future years this will not be possible.</P>
    <P>Many speakers and many people in the community who are concerned about the implications of this Bill have spoken of the fall-off this year in the budget of the combined ACOT-AFT body.  We heard about a 43 per cent decrease.  I am not sure whether that is correct to the nearest percentage point but it is fairly accurate. As has been said time and time again, when you consider that 43 per cent reduction in comparison with the far more minor reduction on the administrative side of the Department of Agriculture and Food, it is indeed a scandal. It is almost laughable that a body which had its budget reduced by 43 per cent is to be administered by a Department which had their budget reduced by only 5 per cent.  It does not make any economic sense and it would be laughable but for the fact that for many people it will result in a sad situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I always take my colleague's advice.  I have some figures here which indicate that, in 1987, 5,000 young farmers availed of the different type of agriculture courses which I mentioned earlier, those courses in particular which were designed to help and assist the speedy transfer of land to those young farmers.  Unfortunately, it would appear that, under the present budget structure of the agricultural and research body, those numbers will drop dramatically. Perhaps in his reply the Minister could indicate what figure he feels this 5,000 will have fallen to by 1989.  We have to recognise the fact that the only agricultural education available at present, apart from university degrees in agriculture, is the education available from the different agricultural colleges and the ACOT centres, etc.  There will be less as a result of the reduced budget.  It is a very short-sighted saving and the agricultural industry as a whole will lose as a result in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the formation of the new Teagasc and the restrictions placed upon the groupings who may or may not be members of it.  He mentioned in particular that Members of Seanad Éireann who are supposed, in theory, to represent the different vocational interests will not be allowed to be a member of the Teagasc body and he indicated that he would put down an amendment to rectify this.  I agree with his assessment.  It is ironic that some of us who were elected to the Seanad on the Agricultural Panel would under the present legislation be ineligible to be a member of the new body.  This is something which the Minister should seriously consider.  He should not confine the concession just to Members of the Agricultural Panel of the Seanad but extend it to the whole Seanad membership.</P>

The Minister's comment, as I recall it, was that he was quite used to sitting up all night and he would do it to facilitate anyone who wanted to speak. Senator Bradford was still to come in, if I recall correctly.  I had called Senator Larry McMahon who was on his feet when I left the Chair.  There was great peace and comfort.

      <P>I was here and I was about to take part in the debate and the question was raised as to how long we were to sit.  We had a small debate on that.  I understood the decision to be to sit until 12.  I was not the only person to have understood that.  The Minister has since stated, since that question arose half an hour ago, that he understood we were to finish at 12.  I was not the only one.  I agreed to that reluctantly, because I did raise the point that we had other speakers, and certainly one other speaker from my party approached me about 10 o'clock and we assessed how long it would go on.  We were of the understanding that time that it was to finish at 11.  That speaker went away from this House, <Col N="1889" /> thinking that he could get in wherever the Bill came before the House again. There was a misunderstanding.  To get out of this impasse I would appeal to the Leader of the House to propose that we now adjourn the debate until another day.  We are pulling down the House.</P>

I would appeal to the Leader of the House to put a proposition to you that we end this debate now and let us start it another day.  He can easily do it; the proposition is there.  It cannot be accepted from this side of the House, I understand, but it can be accepted from the other side.  I think it is in the hands of the Leader now to end this whole embarrassment for many of us here, because reluctantly I agreed to sit until 12 o'clock.  I am now being told that I agreed to sit until the debate ends, whatever time that is.  That was not my understanding and it was not the understanding of the Minister who was present at the time.</P>

      <P>Senator McMahon, I have to reiterate what I understood, and I was chairing the session of the House.  I am still quite clear, and I was quite clear then, that what I was putting to the House and to my colleagues at the time was that we would finish Second Stage and that the Minister would conclude and that we would then adjourn.  I honestly and sincerely mean I did not hear 12 o'clock stated but that we would finish, that I would call the speakers and the Minister would conclude.  If the Minister would conclude that meant the end of Second Stage to me.  In fact he made a remark that I recall, I remember the Minister Deputy O'Kennedy, saying that he was used to sitting all night in sessions, or something like that, and if it meant going <Col N="1890" /> on here it did not make any difference to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he said that during the discussion.  I would have to admit that.  He did say that during the discussion, but the Minister has since stated that he understood we were to finish at 12.  It is unfortunate that he is not here now.  That was my understanding and I am accepting what you said and I am accepting that the decision was not as I understood it to be.</P>

Senator O'Toole wants to get in and there may be other speakers here tonight.  It is an extremely important Bill.  On Committee Stage everybody will have an opportunity to ask questions that are relevant to any section of this Bill.  There will be no rushing through of any section. It is basically a Committee Stage Bill.  I can see that many people might want to make broad statements about the implications of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a Chathaoirligh.  I do not want to be too pernickety.  You said the Minister will finish and we can go home.  Unfortunately, when the Minister finishes, neither myself, nor the Minister for Health will be going home for another half hour.  May I inquire, on a point of order, is it now the order of this House that the times we agree in the morning are subject to amendment without reference to more than two or three Members because at 11 p.m. it happens to suit?  I would like to know if in future I must sit in this House indefinitely because I can never be sure at what stage the House will finish, if the time at which it will finish is subject to the foibles or the choices of a number of Members who happen to be here at a particular time, or do we operate in the way I have always known this House to operate, which is on the basis of trust?  I do not suggest for a second that there has been a breach of trust in this case.  If we cannot actually accept what is said in the morning as being true for the entirety of the day, trust will collapse.  It would have suited me better if we finished a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the time at which the House concludes is not a matter on which you can be certain at any stage, the House cannot conduct is business.  I would like to know from the leader of the House if in future when he says in the morning we will finish at 11 p.m. that is the time we will finish, or will it suddenly become an indeterminate time when matters change.  I would like you to rule on the Order of this House as to whether what we decide in the morning is something that is effectively temporary, part time and passive, and can be adjusted by the foibles of whoever happens to be here at 11 p.m.  I find it unsatisfactory.  I do not know what happened here.  I was sitting waiting for the Minister to reply because I wanted to <Col N="1896" /> hear the Minister's reply to the debate and then I wanted to speak myself.  I find now that I do not know when we will finish.  That does not trouble me in particular because I am here and I will stay here, but I would like to know for the future if it is now the case that when the House is supposed to adjourn at 8 p.m. it might be 10 p.m., 12 midnight or 2 a.m. I would like to know what is going to happen for guidance for the future.</P>

It is very unfair of Members of this House to challenge the ruling of the Chair on an issue which was quite unequivocal.  There was no equivocation; it was straightforward.  It is up to the Cathaoirleach to make a decision.

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume this is a case of part two, day two.  Before we had that little difference, I was speaking about the make up of the new body.  I hope that some of the suggestions mentioned by <Col N="1900" /> Senator Brendan Ryan will be taken on board by the Minister on Committee Stage, whenever that will be.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one of the major considerations in this Bill, namely, the decision by the Government to abolish the county committees of agriculture and the General Council of the Committees of Agriculture.  I regret this move very much because I see it as nothing more than a further assault on the powers and functions of the local authorities and local democracy.  All of us who have been privileged to be members of county committees of agriculture know full well the benefits which accrued from them down the years and the dedicated approach taken by the members of those committees. There were major advances in agriculture developments as a result of the work of the county committees of agriculture.  All the committees were of the opinion that the future wellbeing of agriculture was dependent on our involvement in planning, research and development at local level.  Those of us who were on the county committee of agriculture felt that the members of such committees were best placed to know what decision were best for their own communities and environments.</P>
      <P>Some comments have been made in relation to the travelling expenses scenario, as painted in the Minister's document. As Senator McMahon said earlier, we do not want a rehash of what has been said time and again; but, nevertheless, it is startling that 70 per cent of the budget of the county committees af agriculture went on travelling expenses.  We are talking about 70 per cent of virtually nothing. For instance, last year the budget for the committee of agriculture in Cork was £50,000, whereas ten years ago it was £500,000.  When one speaks of reducing balances like that it is very easy to see how this false picture can be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this late stage I join with the many people from all parties, and from many non-political sectors also, who have appealed to the Minister to reconsider his decision.  The county committees of agriculture were not only a forum for <Col N="1901" /> agricultural debates for the elected members of the political parties but they were also an ideal forum whereby rural agricultural organisations, such as the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, the ICA and many more, could present their views on what was, and should have been happening in the field of agriculture. Once this forum is taken from them one is knocking away a layer of the very important fabric of agricultural development and taking away the voice of the rural people.  It is the voices of these people which should be heard, not least when agricultural decisions are being taken.</P>
    <P>We are told in section 17 of the Bill that the new body Teagasc &mdash; a name which I still have difficulty in pronouncing &mdash; may establish committees to assist and advise them in relation to their performance and functions.  I would like that sentence to be worded slightly stronger. We should be saying that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; establish and not that they &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I do not know who will have to make a decision on that but we should be absolutely clear that the new AFT-ACOT body will have a committee system so that the voices of the members of local authorities and of agricultural bodies will be heard.  These voices should not be disregarded because they are the voices of the people who know what is really happening at local level.  We have seen far too much centralisation.  Over the past few years the decision-making process in relation to agriculture was moved from the county committees of agriculture and other related bodies to central Government and now it is moving further afield to Brussels.  That is a very regrettable step, and I am sure all Members of the House would agree with me.  I have heard numerous comments across party lines, that the decision to abolish the county committees of agriculture is a retrograde step and, while I do not intend to delve into it any longer, I again appeal to the Minister to carefully consider the moves he is making in this respect and at least to ensure that local voices will be heard when decisions are to be taken in relation to future developments in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> The Minister concluded his speech by stating that he hoped the new Bill would ensure that the best value for money would be got for the Exchequer from the resources at the disposal of the new Teagasc body.  That idea should be applauded by all of us.  But, because the new body will be working with such limited resources, I believe that in the future their room for expansion, for new ideas and new initiatives, will be almost stifled and that this will be very much a cost containing exercise.  Any organisational group who do not have sufficient funding to operate as they should are certainly on the road to disaster.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes the Bill will deliver the specific services that are crucial to the success of the agricultural and food industry in the environment we face today.  Of course, all of us would agree with him in that respect.  But, as was mentioned by many speakers, part of this hope would entail the adequate funding of the research and development body. With a 43 per cent cut this year, and with certainly no hope of any future increase in the funding in the years ahead, this hope is almost forlorn before it begins. The agricultural industry certainly cannot function properly without sufficient funding for research and development.  The cutbacks over the past year, and the envisaged cutbacks which we know are inevitable under the present regime, will be a false economic factor in agriculture in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes the Bill will bring together the education, training, advisory and research services under a unified management.  It obviously will do that and hopefully provide the greater efficiency which the Minister is seeking. However, one cannot mention that aspiration without again getting back to the funding problem.  I mentioned earlier the 5,000 young farmers who received education two years ago from ACOT and their related bodies.  Unfortunately it now appears that because of the limited funding available this figure will inevitably decrease in the next few years.  That will be felt by the whole agricultural sector in the years ahead and it will mean <Col N="1903" /> that the growth rates in agriculture will not be as high as they should be.</P>
    <P>At this late hour I will leave my comments at that.  I know that much of what I have said here tonight has been said already today, and has most certainly been said by the Members of the other House.  I assure the Minister that, as a member of a local authority and of a county committee of agriculture, I am only restating what I am hearing and have heard time and again from councillors and other people who are working at local level.  Those people are extremely worried about the effects of this merged body.  They are more worried about their make-up and lack of funding than they are about the general principle.</P>
    <P>None of us is opposed in any great fashion to the idea of a merger between ACOT and AFT because we all believe there is room for savings and greater efficiency.  We are confident that this new body, if they are allowed to develop further, can produce the results which are necessary to ensure the future development of agriculture in this country.  We all fear, however, that the lack of funds to Teagasc will hinder their development and growth and also hinder the development of the agricultural industry.  We believe that as a consequence agriculture, while it may not become a lost cause, will certainly not be able to contribute to economic output, the creation of jobs and the stemming of the tide of emigration which it could if it got the funding that it so greatly deserves.</P>

I and the rest of the House should cool down.

      <P>It has been the practice in this House, and I have been here a long time, that the leaders and the Whips have a chat now and again about business.  Earlier on the Whips and the leaders of the Opposition agreed that this Bill would be completed by 11.30 p.m.  I was told by the Leader of the Opposition party the number of speakers on his side but the number he gave me was far exceeded afterwards.  I withdrew three of the speakers on our side to finish by 12 midnight but people who were not expected to speak came in and spoke, and they had the right to do that.  This is not the first time this has happened. When we were in Opposition it happened too.  I remember we had to stay here until 4 p.m. one morning because a certain person insisted that we should stay.  With regard to what Senator O'Toole has suggested I do not know the Minister's commitments for tomorrow but I have arranged that the Intoxicating Bill will be taken tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The Acting Leader of the House has asked a fair question &mdash;<Col N="1907" /> what guarantees can be given?  Certainly the Independent group can give an absolute guarantee that, apart from myself, there will be no further speakers.  I want to say further, a Chathaoirligh, that when I stood up here on the Order of Business &mdash; and as you will recall that we had an alteration, to say the least &mdash; gave certain commitments and reached certain agreements with the Acting Leader of the House on particular issues on the basis of that I would give further commitments to him.  Other people decided not to meet the commitments that were given to me, but I still kept my side of it.  I have been in this House for one year and I have acted honourably and given straight commitments on issues.  My only interest at this point is not to have to stand up here and speak for an hour, two hours or whatever. I am not prepared to be party to either side of the House having a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at each other.  I believe we can sort out this argument very simply and easily and I have given the formula which can deal with that.  The House has established that there are only two further speakers, the Minister and myself.  I will give a guarantee to the Minister that whatever time he needs in the morning he will get it and I will be prepared to defer to him at whatever point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for trying, a Chathaoirligh.  To allow this Bill to become an Act which would make further provisions in relation to agricultural advisory education and research services in something which I could accept because I believe that as a result of this Bill we will have to redefine what was previously regarded as the service sector of the public service.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind about that.</P>
      <P>This Bill comes at a critical time in Irish agriculture.  The major problem we have to deal with is low incomes.  Our lack of wealth, the size of our borrowings and the level of our taxes, which have been diagnosed as problems, are but the symptoms of our low income problem.  This is the problem we have before us now.  We have plenty of natural resources and a surplus of cheap labour and, if our incomes were 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent higher, the servicing of our debt would certainly be far less of a burden for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we joined the European Communities our national herd has been halved, and in a sense the farming community and the agricultural sectors have failed us in the area of the national herd. We have failed to make the progress we were entitled to in the areas of agricultural produce, development and research.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission were got rid of a long time ago, I cannot remember the exact year.  When I was going to school Ireland was regarded as an agricultural country, one-third agriculture, one-third industry and one-third service.  I have listened year after year to the need to cosset, improve and develop our agricultural industry.  In particular, I have listened to the comparisons between this economy and the Danish economy.  I would like to put one statistic before the House in relation to <Col N="1910" /> the processing of pigs, bacon and pork in Denmark as opposed to the position in Ireland.  In Ireland one million pigs per year processed while in Denmark 15 million pigs per year are processed.  Somebody must be held responsible for that deterioration and very poor comparative figure between both countries.</P>
    <P>The only way by which any industry can develop, whether it is agriculture or anything else, is by a system of encouragement through research, development and advice.  We are now in the position where our agricultural sector is disimproving and getting smaller by the year. We have therefore a very definite responsibility to encourage that industry. Those areas, services parts of agriculture which need development must be developed through the application of new technology, the results of research and the development of the results achieved at various enterprises such as those in Kinsealy, Fermoy and many other places. It seems that this is precisely what we are not doing and a prime example of this is the amount of wheat that is grown in this country.  Nobody has ever explained to me why we commit hundreds and thousands of acres to the growth of wheat when our climate is totally unsuitable to that crop.  We continue to do that and we continue to subsidise it.  As Members of the Oireachtas we are circulated on a regular basis with various food research magazines which deal with the results of trying different crops such as beans, peas, pulses and rape.  I would like to see rape developed in a major way.  The failure to do this is a reflection of the conservatism of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Surely somebody should be able to walk up to a farmer and explain to him or her the profitability of investing in different crops the results of growing and planting different crops compared to the conservative old fashioned ones and encourage them to grow them.  Only ten years ago we had the obscenity of banks going around to farmers and talking them into building milking parlours and developing their farming industry and so on.  Ten years later the farmers found themselves in the position of not being <Col N="1911" /> able to pay back the money they borrowed. It should be just as easy nowadays, if we had the proper facility, the proper service and advice areas, to try to get them to invest in other new, more productive and more profitable crops &mdash; and not just for the farmer but in terms of the spin-off in the agricultural-based industries.</P>
    <P>I am bothered when we are told that the amalgamation of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT will in some sense lead to improvement and development.  The kindest word one could say about it is that it is totally unnecessary.  There is no area of development which does not need constant assessment of what it is doing, constant monitoring of the progress it is making, constant in-service education in terms of what it might be doing somewhat better than the farming community.  The reason for that is that developments in various other parts of the world are slow to find implementation here.  I recall just 18 months back that Kinsealy did an in-depth study of the application of hydrophonics to Irish agriculture. It struck me on a visit there at that time: how does one get the farmer in Dingle or the farmer in the Minister's own constituency of North Tipperary to introduce hydrophonics as opposed to the cultivation of rice?  It is so difficult to get the movement from one to the other.</P>
    <P>In the last number of years we have seen a most regrettable decline here in the produce of hothouses.  This has got to do with a number of things.  The main catalyst for the deterioration was the soaring price of oil in the mid-seventies. It happened in the strong market gardening areas.  North Dublin would be a good example.  People invested huge amounts of money in glasshouses and in cultivation based on the growth in those glasshouses.  The repayments on the glasshouses, the cost of the oil and the interest which accrued was far more than what the farmers were getting back for the cucumbers or whatever produce they had under glass, so they went out of business.</P>
    <P>That was five or six years ago.  In the <Col N="1912" /> meantime the price of oil has dropped. Oil has now become a cost effective source of energy and source of heat. Unfortunately, nobody has told the poor farmers.  Nobody has told them they can now reinvest.  We now have the debacle of farmers growing in coldhouses what they could produce more effectively and more economically in hothouses and finding themselves losing out through imports from other countries.  That is going on all the time.  The only way we can change people from that position is to educate them, to give them the confidence and competence to change and to do better and to invest in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Last weekend I thought it would be a treat to have some new potatoes.  The only new potatoes I could get in my local shop were imported produce.  This, you might say, relates purely to the fact that we are in the northern hemisphere, further north than some of our colleagues who are able to import the produce cheaper.  That might well be acceptable except that in a month's time it will be possible to get Dutch tomatoes cheaper on the Irish market than Irish tomatoes. That has got to do with cost effectiveness and efficiency in production.  That is not good enough.  Anything that encourages a deterioration in that area is something that we should guard against &mdash; and what we see here tonight is precisely that.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for advice for farmers.  There is a great need for advice in the production, development and expansion of the agricultural industry. We have really failed in this area.  Why is it that one can walk into the supermarkets of Europe, Germany, Spain, France, the Twelve that we are part of and will be part of in a greater way when the internal market is complete in 1992 and see Irish produce there?  Why is it that we cannot take our place in it?  Why is it that we cannot produce cost effectively in that market?  The infamous article in <i>The Economist</i> described this country and the opening sentence was: &ldquo;Take a small, open post-peasant economy etc....&rdquo;.  That is what we are and that is what we are fighting against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> We will be in a position in 1992 where there will be such changes made in the internal free market of the European countries that we will have difficulty in surviving.  It is important here to look at and compare agriculture with industry. We have changed a lot in the last year because we have become an exporting country.  Exports in the last year have risen by almost 14 per cent.  Therefore, in terms of exporting commodities, we can take on the world.  We are selling now and therefore we can send out people to market our products.  We know that our commodities are good and that our marketing techniques are good if properly applied.  We know that, if our quality control is comparable with the best, we can sell our products.  That is what is happening in industry, but it is not happening in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister an example to encourage his response.  We are working at the moment on the basis of the dairy quota, which is looked upon by some as an advance and by others as regression.  It is irrelevant for the purpose of this argument.  As somebody who would be sitting in the cross-benches &mdash; were there cross-benches &mdash; I think successive Ministers for Agriculture have done their absolute best for this country whatever side of the House they happened to come from.  I am not a party to arguements which put one Minister against another.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister explain to me why a man could come back from Germany two months ago and say: &ldquo;Listen, lads. I have found five new outlets for dairy products, for milk products, for milk in Germany and these are people who will buy your milk ex-quota.  In other words, when you have exceeded your quota locally we have now found an export market for it in Germany&rdquo;.  I investigated that further.  I wanted to find out just how this happened.  What I found out was very simple.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of it, but it was news to me.  There is, in fact, no marketing structure in Ireland really.  There is a centralised marketing structure for our dairy products of <Col N="1914" /> which we are all well aware.  I am not talking about that.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where there are certain companies &mdash; Kerry being the leader &mdash; who have their own market structure.  They are out there in Europe selling their products and they are finding markets but there are dairy co-ops all over the country with excess produce.  They are not selling it.  Why are they not selling it?  There is a market for it in Europe and nobody can identify the market.  Where does this tie into this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated your interruption.  This is a Bill which will make further provision in the area of advisory, educational and research services. At the moment, we are advising our people that there is no further in dairy produce: do not develop your dairy industry; our dairy industry has reached its peak; the European market is saturated; we cannot go any further in selling dairy products.  Now we find that individuals can go to Europe and find new markets.  Recently research took place in Fermoy into the development of the off-spin of dairy products, the development of the new product called Quark.</P>
      <P>Quark, of course, has major potential in the Irish market.  Kids love it; adults love it; and it is healthy in the sense that it is additive free and colour free.  It has the capacity to be a major growth industry. It is made either from curds or whey. I always forget which, I was bad at nursery rhymes when at school.  It is the solid one anyway.  It can be sold as a chocolate bar or in many other ways.  It has enormous potential for growth.  It has only got potential for growth of course, as long as the raw material is available.  The raw material is milk.  We are now telling our farmers not to develop their dairy industry, that it has reached its peak, it is at its zenith, it has achieved its potential.  It has not.  That is just one example.  I could give many more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could look at the general area of forestry.  I am sure it has been touched <Col N="1915" /> on earlier tonight.  At 10.55 p.m. when I looked comfortably at the monitor and thought we had the last speaker for the night and that it would not be necessary for me to speak until the next time, I wondered if Senators had dealt with the area of forestry.  We have the best climate in Europe for the cultivation of biomass &mdash; wood to the rest of us lay people.  Let me put that in some kind of context.  I said we have the worst climate in Europe for the cultivation of grain, wheat in particular, and we should keep away from that.  We do not have enough days of sunshine.  I recall the advertisements Kelloggs had on television years ago &mdash; so many days of sunshine went into the production of the cornflakes which were developed from wheat.  I wondered how we could be growing the same crop when we get only one-third of the number of days sunshine per year.  We encourage that.  Farmers still believe that because wheat seems to sell for a greater value than any other crop they should grow it.</P>
    <P>What is the story about trees and wood?  We can grow timber faster, we can grow it more economically than any other country in Europe.  I do not need to tell you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, of the spin-offs and the by-products and the industry that can be based on the production of wood.  We are not doing it. There is a little bit of it being done, however, and what we are doing about that is selling it off to banks and people and not getting value.  We know what banks and the large financial institutions do &mdash; those people who talk to us about a climate for industry, a climate for investment and the need to make sacrifices, the need to take pay decreases and the need to be patriotic and we see what they do when they have a 20 per cent or a 10 per cent stake in Irish Life. They sell it off when the Government are trying to organise a Buy Irish campaign. These are the same people we are now allowing to cream whatever small development we are doing in the area of forestry.  Thank you for your acceptance of that particular point.  I expected an interruption on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> I will say, however, a Chathaoirligh, in terms of the forestry development, I suppose the most expensive commodity in any industry is resource and energy and there are many ways in which we can do it.  There are natural ways and unnatural ways.  I will not talk about hydro-electrical schemes and I will not talk about the nuclear scheme, but I will certainly point out that the whole area of energy and peat development from the cultivation and the burning and use of biomass &mdash; in other words, growing trees, burning them and replanting ect. &mdash; is an area in which we have failed to make progress, though we are in the best position in Europe to do that.</P>
    <P>There has been a development or experiment in that area down around the Lyreacompane area and it is found to be exceptionally cost-effective.  We are not sending anybody around making an assessment of land and saying to farmers they are not going to grow anything worthwhile in that area so we will ask them to drain it or do somethiang else. We should be advising them to grow trees there &mdash; grow trees and push the very worthwhile scheme the Government presented some years back in terms of payment over a period of years which they have done with banks and many other groups.  This is a scheme which should be developed.  This is not being done because people do not have the confidence and the competence to do it.</P>

      <P>I apologise for becoming slightly diverted there.  I was referring to County Mayo and the development of the turf industry in that area.  People said, and the State claimed also, that it would not be cost-effective or productive to continue with the peat production that was planned around that area of north-west Mayo.  Geesala would be the nearest town to the area.  The former Deputy Staunton is dealing with it there.  That is an example of where somebody can go out and privately develop when we should, in fact, have had our agricultural advisers out there advising farmers to develop.  I use that as an example of the mistakes we can make by not developing this area.</P>
      <P>There is no case whatever for not developing agricultural research and agricultural advice and education.  When I was very young I was a member of Macra na Feirme or Muintir na Tíre, whichever was the one for the young people.  At that stage I learned various basic things about agricultural research, but in a very short time I learned things that plants need, things like oxygen and light and heat, in order to grow.  That is the basic thing. You remember these things and they stay with you.  But I think also somebody needs to come and say: &ldquo;You should not be growing wheat there, you should be growing beans&rdquo; or whatever needs to be developed in that area.  We have failed in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the impact on the Exchequer of the proposals in this Bill? The proposals will lead to layoffs.  The proposals will lead to redundancies.  This is going to cost the State enormously. Indeed, to my mind it has put the State and the Government in a very questionable position.  They are closing down these two areas.  They are amalgamating them into one.  What will the result be? The result will be quite simple.  I can give you some examples of it at the moment. The Government are going to pay them a lump sum and to get out and they are <Col N="1918" /> going to give them a pension after that. There is a major difference between the lump sum and the pension.  The lump sum they are going to pay these people does not exist actually.  It is not money in the sense that it is not shown in the Estimates. It is not too be seen in the end of year records of the Government.  The Government have done a deal with the Central Bank.  It is a very vague area of law.  It is governed by the 1926 Currency Act.  The 1926 Currency Act allows the Central Bank, should it agree to do so, to make an advance to the Minister for Finance of the day.  Any reading of the Act makes it clear that that was an advance on the amount of money which the State was entitled to in that year. However, both the Minister and the Central Bank have chosen to interpret it otherwise and it has not been challenged. The Central Bank is a privatised bank which is now subsidising the operation of this proposed Act.  In what way, you might ask?  It is facilitating the closing down of these two services to be replaced by something else with a loss of jobs.  The Central Bank is a commercial operation.</P>

      <P>In respect of the people being made redundant, which is a clear result of this Bill, the Central Bank this year paid into State funds over £119 million. The Government have now got from the Central Bank an advance close on £100 million.  The agreement is that they will pay that back over the next five years &mdash; four payments of £20 million approximately to £25 million per year.  This money does not appear anywhere, but it is being used to facilitate and support this Bill.  I would maintain that this Bill is dependent on that money being available. In other words, if this money were not available to the State they could not implement what they propose to implement under this Bill.</P>

The Minister will incur expenses.  They are very simple. There will be up to 1,000 people put out of work by the application of this.  Who is going to pay for that?  Are you saying to me that the cost of that should not be discussed on the Second Stage of this Bill?  Are you saying to me that it s irrelevant to the application of it if I say to you that this is going to cost the State millions of pounds, not only in paid out income but also in loss of productivity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that this Bill could not be implemented without the collusion of the Central Bank because there is an agreement under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to which the Government are a party, that there will be no compulsory redundancies in the public service.  This proposed legislation before us will create redundancies.  The Government are party to an agreement which says that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  The only way in which both things can meet is by having voluntary redundancies.  The only way we can have voluntary redundancies is by paying for them.  The Government have told us time and time again that they do not have the money to pay for them. They are getting the money from the Central Bank.  What could be more relevant than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to tease out where they are getting that money.  They are getting that money, over the next five years, from the Central Bank.  They are repaying it over four repayments of £20 million to £25 million per year.  I am saying to you that they are doing that under the provisions of the Currency Act, 1926.  To my mind, that is poor use of money.  It also means that that £20 million per year will not be available to Revenue.  It would mean, in this year for instance, that, instead of getting £119 million from the Central Bank, the Government would only get £99 million.  So the taxpayer has to pay for <Col N="1922" /> that £20 million by the implementation of legislation such as this Bill.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I am sure you would agree with me that, as a legislator and as a Member of the Oireachtas, I have a clear duty to point out the implications of the Bill.  It now seems it is costing us more than we are gaining.  This Bill represents a net loss to the Government. This Bill represents a net loss to the State.  This Bill represents an attempt, by the Government, to put many hardworking, productive public servants out of work who we really need in order to develop our agricultural sector and our agricultural industry.  I believe it is a disgraceful way to do business.</P>
    <P>What worries me also, in terms of the operation of the Bill &mdash; which you will have read, a Leas-Chathaoirligh &mdash; is the appointment of the Authority which the Minister has held very cleverly and very closely in his hands.  You will see that he just barely appoints a majority of the committee.  That worries me.  One does not direct science.  One does not direct the people who should be the leaders in society or the leaders in industry.  You appoint the right people and you let them get on and do the job.  There should be no difficulty for the Government in allowing that to happen.  This is not happening. What we are doing here is both a waste of resources and an attempt to control, for the wrong reasons, the development of the agricultural sector.  Our industry is deterioring and the quantity of the personnel we need in the industry is being reduced.  I defy anybody to justify those two movements at a time when the industry itself is far from developing, but is contracting.  That is where we are going in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The cuts which now have this effect on ACOT and on An Foras Talúntais are not justifiable.  Whoever decided that this direction was the most profitable road to go down gravely under-estimated the contribution agriculture can make to the development of Irish industry, the contribution that agriculture can make to the growth in the economy.  This is home growth.  The multinationals are not interested in agriculture.  They are <Col N="1923" /> interested in coming in here, setting up a factory, bringing in the cheapest of imports, putting them together in a factory which is set up with taxpayers' money and support and subsidy, paying their workers a minimal wage, having the very least value-added to the products and exporting them and, because they are exporting them, getting the full benefit of the tax on exports.  Then they repatriate their profits.</P>
    <P>Despite the figures and the statistics which came out this morning in terms of the major contribution being made by foreign-owned companies, those people have no commitment to this country. Agriculture is a home-based industry. We can develop that industry.  It is an industry which starts and can finish in this country.  We have failed to do that because we lack people with vision to see down the road, to see the direction, and give us the growth we need.  We had the greatest growth of any country in the Community last year.  In real terms it should have been 4 per cent.  In the terms we can judge from statistics, it comes out as a mere 1 per cent &mdash; the 3 per cent being the hole we all hate to speak of but which will continue to be there until we implement tax laws which can control it. However, that is not relevant to this Bill but it raised the problem of where will the agricultural sector and the development of agriculture be in 1992, with the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>People think that 1992 is the start of something.  Farmers all over the country believe it.  I hear people speak about it all the time: &ldquo;Where will be after 1992; cars will be cheaper; food will be cheaper&rdquo;. In terms of agriculture we have failed to let people know that 1992 is not the start of anything.  It is the finish of something.  The start was on 29 April last year, when this House passed the Single European Act.  That was the beginning. The year of 1992 is the end.  This is the transition period.  Agricultural produce and the development of the agricultural industry, envisaged in this Bill, will be open to the big bad world by 1992.  We can no longer operate a protectionist <Col N="1924" /> operation from that point on.  It is time to look at the kind of exports and the kind of development that is part of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I have given the figure for the development of exports last year &mdash; 14 per cent. It would be unfair to read statistics at this hour of the night because I do not think it would impress anybody just now.  The crucial question is: in terms of all the industrial exports, what is the relative contribution of agricultural exports compared to industrial exports?  We have £2.5 billion worth of agricultural exports compared with something over £7 billion of industrial exports.  How does one assess the relative value to the economy?  In assessing the real value of exports to the economy, account must be taken of the import content and also account must be taken of the profits repatriation associated with the exports.  These are the two things which I have referred to.</P>

      <P>I am not questioning the ruling of the Chair.  I accept your ruling and your interpretation of my <Col N="1925" /> words but they reflect the sort of closed mind which has been there in terms of developing the agricultural industry over the years.

Certainly it has implications far beyond that. There is no doubt about it.  That is what we are talking about here.  If this Bill is passed the services which are available to farmers, the services which are available to agriculture and the agricultural industry will be seriously undermined.  If they are undermined, if we are not producing in agriculture, the industry which is dependent on it will suffer.  Is the Cathaoirleach saying to me that industry which is dependent on agriculture is irrelevant to the Bill?  I am not challenging the ruling.  I am asking a rhetorical question.  I am not inviting interruption and I certainly would not wish you to respond to me in any way.  It is a purely rhetorical question.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Leas-Chathaoirleach is quite pleased that it is 2.15 a.m.  I do not intend to repeat myself and I have not repeated myself.  Should I repeat myself, I will immediately stop. In the whole area of services to farming, in terms of support for farming, in terms of advising farmers on what they should do and what they might not do, there has been a serious curtailment.  There has been a privatisation of it in many ways. This is a concern for us.  If we affect farming, if we affect the advice to farmers, we are affecting the lives of many people outside it.  This Bill has implications for a huge proportion of the population of this country.</P>
      <P>I talked about the fact that agriculture might involve one-third of the workforce, services might be another one-third of the workforce, and manufacturing industry might be another one-third.  That has changed and changed radically.  Let us say that it has gone down to 25 per cent for agriculture.  It is fair enough to say that 25 per cent of the population are in some way tangibly affected by the decisions we make here tonight in terms of the cutbacks to the agricultural service industry.  Many of the modern industries with spectacular export performance contribute far less than agriculture. Unfortunately, many people judge agriculture by the number of people employed directly in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall that in my youth farming was a labour-intensive industry.  I am not sure if you know what happens nowadays a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I live in a farming area and that is why I know a little bit about it.  I have seen the changes that have taken place over the years.  There was a time when it would take a farmer one day to plough an acre.  So a 30 acre field took 30 persons days to plough. Nowadays you put in a tractor and the best plough available, and you do it in a <Col N="1927" /> day, or a day and a half.  That is the ploughing part of it.  We have taken the labour out of agriculture.  We did advise our farmers to cut their production costs by doing this.  Farmers no longer actually do that ploughing, but they get in agricultural contractors to do it.  It becomes no labour.  It is now possible to run a farm by remote control just by simply lifting the phone to the agricultural contactor.</P>
    <P>Who is advising people to do this but those people who would look for the most cost-effective method of doing it?  The field is ready for sowing and we then come to reaping the fruits of the labour. Similarly, whether it be a silage harvester or a combine harvester, the farmer again lifts the phone to the agricultural contractor and he can sit at home and have the job done in a couple of hours and then sell his produce.  Therefore, farming has ceased to be a labour-intensive industry. Farming has now become an industry which can be worked with very few people involved in it.  That is why the one-third ratio has changed.  In the meantime, it has to be said that the output from farming has changed and improved over the years.  Whether or not we have identified the productivity and the growth areas &mdash; and I mean that in the economic sense &mdash; of agriculture is not clear to me.</P>
    <P>It is critically important that Ireland should develop her natural resources because an increase in the use of our natural resources means an increase in wealth creation, an increase in the quality of life of people dependent on agriculture which, basically, can spin off to a huge proportion of the population.  We would expect groups like ACOT to give proper advice to farmers and we ask for that service to be developed.  Proper advice to farmers from ACOT or other groups will lead to more productivity, greater development of our natural resources, greater use of our natural resources and to employment and an improvement in the quality of life of our population in general.  That is why I feel that what we are doing here is regressive.  We should be very careful and I counsel caution in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> I spoke earlier about the timber industry and the productivity which could be achieved there but, in terms of our grasslands, we have great competitors.  We can be as competitive as any country in Europe in the utilisation of the produce from our grasslands.  Indeed, it is just one of our natural resources which can be developed through agriculture.  We can exploit and develop this strength and this potential to produce the surpluses and, from there, to have dependent industry and, from there, to produce commodities and export products which again lead to an improvement.  This can only be done with proper advice to farmers and with people monitoring what is happening.</P>
    <P>I know the Department of Agriculture and Food are very good at trying to keep excellent returns at the end of the year on the acreage being attributed to various aspects of agriculture.  When somebody does an assessment of what is the most productive part of that acreage, does someone go along and say: &ldquo;We must tell our advisers to go out there and get the farmers to change their ways, to invest in the new ways, to develop those areas, those lands, those acres which can be most productive in terms of the wealth of the country, in terms of the development of the country's resources?  Even if that were being done, if the Minister were to decide tomorrow morning that is the way to work it, he needs the personnel to do it and the personnel are being lost through the implementation of this Bill. That is regrettable and that is really what we cannot tolerate and cannot support.</P>
    <P>As well as that, because the agriculture and food industries have such a low import content and are groups who do not repatriate profits, they represent a huge gain for our foreign trade.  In other words, all the value is added in this country.  It is from seed to export.  We do the lot.  We grow the grass.  We breed the cows.  We sell the milk.  We process the milk and we export the milk product.  The profit comes back down the line through all those people operating through the coop, through the farmer, to the farm labourer and through all the people in the dependent industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> That is the kind of industry we need to develop.  We do need multinationals coming in here, on our terms, but it is far more profitable, it is far more cost-effective for us, to develop this industry from the grassroots in the greatest sense of that.  It is safely said that, in the agricultural and food industry, a high proportion of the raw material comes form the land, comes from agriculture.  Three times more of that produce comes from natural, national resources than would come from the multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 years we have seen a huge development in the output from agriculture and agricultural-based industries. That output has grown by 50 per cent in that time.  That is an accepted figure.  There has been a 50 per cent improvement and, in the meantime, the output per worker involved in the agricultural industry has increased by 160 per cent.  I just want to put those two figures in contrast and compare them.  The output in agriculture has improved, or gained, or developed by 50 per cent since 1970.  The output per worker working in the agricultural sector has increased by 160 per cent.  In other words, over that period of time workers have become more and more cost-effective.  Some of these workers are people like those involved in ACOT, in the farm services and in the advice services, but these are the people on whom we would be dependent. These are the people who have delivered, who have made these statistics possible: a 50 per cent growth in agricultual output, a 160 per cent growth in the output per worker since 1970.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, regrettably, the increase in salaries or wages for the agricultural worker has not improved by anything like the improvement in their output.  That is probably something which we have become used to.  The whole impact of cuts in agriculture is something which makes us all suffer.  The impact of the dairy cuts, for instance, and those cuts imposed by the imposition of the quota &mdash; and I referred earlier to the fact that imposition of the quota should not have meant a similar restraint in the <Col N="1930" /> development of the dairy aspect of farming because there are other markets out there and over and above the quota &mdash; is that implementing the milk quota in Ireland will involve a reduction by approximately a quarter of a million in the dairy cow herd in this country.  That is regrettable and that is where we are heading.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of my contribution that the national herd had been halved since we joined the Common Market.  We are now talking about a further reduction through the imposition of the dairy quota.  For those reasons, if those cuts are impacting on agriculture, if those cuts mean such a reduction in the dairy herd, in the numbers of cows, surely more than ever before we need research development and advice in the agricultural sector.  What this Bill is doing is cutting back on that area.  This Bill does not do what it sets out to do.  If it did, I certainly would not be standing up here to oppose any attempt to make further provision in relation to the agricultural advisory educational and research services provided by or on behalf of the State.  I would not be objecting to that.  I would be supporting that point of view, but nothing in this Bill does what the Bill sets out to do.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill is a misnomer.  It fails to produce; it fails to do what it sets out to do.  At a time when technology is developing and growing all over the world, more than ever before we need people to see, test, monitor this technology and then advise and ensure the implementation of the results of that technology.  Most of the benefit from increased technology comes to the economy at large.  It does not actually come to the producer.  This is a truism really. People know the technology is there, the research is there in many cases, but we are not implementing it.  Why is it, if the <i>Food and Technology Magazine</i> can put in stark capitals that the use of a particular type of acreage is more productive with product A than with product B, the majority of farmers are still using product A?  Why is that happening?  It is because no one is advising them to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> I think also that the proposed cuts in research and agricultural education could cost the economy dearly.  I cannot work out the costings of that, but I would certainly request the Minister to tell me what is the cost to the State, not in terms of what we are paying for the lump sums &mdash; we have been through that already &mdash; but in terms of loss of production?  It seems to me that, if the advisers were doing anything, they were directing farming to go in a particular direction that would be more profitable and more cost effective. If they cease to do that, there is a cost to the rest of us &mdash; not so much if they cease to do it but if there are not enough of them there to go around to do it, it means then it is not implemented and so, therefore, the agricultural sector becomes less cost-effective, the spin-off industry is reduced and we are doing the State a disservice by implementing, supporting and voting in favour of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that by reducing the number of advisers, which is what this Bill sets out to do, we will also be in a more serious way reducing the number of farmers who will be in contact with the advisory services and will be reducing in many ways not just the quality of advice that is available &mdash; I have also dealt with the effect on produce &mdash; but the number of farmers who would interface with an advisory service.  It is very hard to give figures on that, but I have heard one figure given by a fairly acceptable authority: that it will be reduced by 75 per cent.  In other words, at the moment agricultural advisers are in contact with approximately 80,000 farmers per year and that, with the implementation of this legislation, that figure will be reduced to 20,000.  That is an astonishing figure. How can anybody justify that?  This service is set up as being a necessary one, even this Bill talks about how necessary it is to advise and direct farmers; but the Minister is now asking us to implement something which is going to reduce the effectiveness of the agricultural advisory service.</P>
    <P>I have said that the numbers of farmers who are being advised or who interface <Col N="1932" /> or meet some advisers in the agricultural sector &mdash; and they come under many headings at the moment &mdash; is reduced from 80,000 annually to 20,000 by the implementation of this legislation.  What does that mean in terms of acreage?  In terms of acreage it means that those 80,000 farmers were controlling roughly eight million acres in this country &mdash; in other words, eight million productive acres were influenced in some way by the advisory service provided by the State. With the reduction of that figure now to 20,000 the acreage which will be affected is, in fact, reduced to three million.  We are now talking about a reduction from eight million acres to three million acres. Asking us to support legislation which is clearly so regressive is tantamount to asking us to abrogate our responsibilities to the people who elected us and to the people who, soundly in their sleep tonight, feel that affairs are being well looked after.</P>

      <P>At this stage I must interject and suggest that this debate has been extended out of all proportion.  We did decide that we would finish this Stage of the Bill this evening.  The Senator in possession will have adequate time to address himself to the various questions he has raised on each section of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I would propose that the question be now put: &ldquo;That Second Stage of this Bill be now passed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan wants to raise a matter on the Adjournment of the House, that is, the need for the Minister for Health to respond urgently to the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on the conditions in Our Lady's Hospital, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This may well be entirely out of order, but may I first of all thank a particular representative of the press from my adopted city for her enormous patience in being here until this extraordinary hour of the morning?  It is a reflection of the clear concern among people in my city about the issue I am raising tonight; and I can tell you that, if the issue were not as serious as it is, I would have informed the Cathaoirleach a long time ago that I was quite happy to dispose of the issue and go home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue I have raised is the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on the conditions in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork.  I propose to devote a considerable period of my time to extracts from the <Col N="1934" /> report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals because, even though it is a very late hour and even though I, like everybody else, would like to go home, there are things in that report that need to be put on the record of this House and on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The first thing that needs to be said is that there are about 1,000 patients in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork and almost all of them, with the exception of about 30 or 40, are long-stay patients.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals visited that hospital in February of this year.  I want to put on the record of this House brief extracts about a variety of wards.  For instance, in St. Kevin's 5, a female ward with 28 patients, there was one toilet off the dormitory and five toilets off the dayroom which were dirty.  St. Kevin's 6, a male ward with 18 patients.  Some renovation work was going on in this ward.  The dormitory was locked off during the day. Each patient had a wardrobe.  There was no soap and no towels were available. The toilet area off the dormitory was dirty and there were no curtains on the windows.  We are not talking about prisons or shelters for the homeless; we are talking about a hospital.  St. Kevin's 8, female with 21 patients &mdash; a washing machine on the ward was bought from patients' money, a washing machine to wash the clothes of the patients was bought from patients' money.  The toilet had no seat and there were no curtains.</P>
    <P>The whole report could well be read onto the record, a Chathaoirligh, but I do not propose to do that.  St. Patrick's 1, male, with 22 patients; all windows in the toilet were broken and had been covered by sheets of plywood; it was dirty.  One dormitory had 13 beds and had no curtains.  One patient had gone to bed.  Another dormitory had eight beds with no curtains.  There was no ward programme and the whole ward lacked any visual stimulation.  St. Ita's 1, female with 20 patients; the enclosed courtyard attached to the ward was littered with old clothing, toilet rolls and plastic bottles which had accumulated over several months.  We were informed that patients <Col N="1935" /> do not get out of doors in winter time. The dormitory with seven beds had no curtains.  Many patients were in bed for the night at the time of our visit &mdash; 5.15 p.m.  Another dormitory housed ten patients and was also without curtains. Five beds were placed along one wall while on the opposite wall a structure had been erected in which five patients were separately incarcerated.</P>
    <P>Each unit was roofed in the manner of a stall and each door was closed by three farmyard bolts.  Mattresses were generally on the floor.  These units did not have external windows or fresh air.  There was a padded cell with a mattress on the floor of this ward.  Toilets had no seats and there was no soap available to patients.</P>
    <P>On this particular part the inspector had the following to say: &ldquo;Regrettably the dining arrangements on the wards were equally bad.  Hot food is taken to the wards in containers which are neither heated nor insulated.  On the ward we saw patients' lunches being divided into portions and placed in a heated trolley which was not hot enough to keep them warm.  Potatoes of poor quality had been placed on the table even though patients had not by then begun to take their places.  Almost inevitably patients would be eating cold lunches.  No effort is made to make eating an enjoyable experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first recommendation made on that part is to restore the beds that were taken down in St. Anne's Hospital as a consequence of the cutbacks.  There is a lot more.  On the North Cork area, Ita's 5, female, 18 beds, the reports says: Like many other wards the windows were dirty and many panes of glass were cracked or broken.  The window nearest the entrance on the corridor had 23 broken or cracked panes of glass.  Ita's, 6, female, 18 beds &mdash; two toilets off the dormitory had no seats.  The windows were dirty.  St. Patrick's, 5, 13 patients &mdash; the walls in the dayroom were peeled and blistered. There were no pictures on the walls.  The toilet area was fairly poor.  One of the two toilets had a seat.  There were 12 broken panes of glass in the bathroom <Col N="1936" /> window.  There was no patients' centre for work.  St. Patrick's, 11, 22 beds &mdash; the toilets were generally dirty but they had seats.</P>
    <P>There is more.  General comments on wards in this area: Milk comes to wards in, we were told, open buckets.  This is because the milk is purchased in bulk thereby effecting a saving of about £3,000 than if it were to be bought in cartons.  In some wards there is no adequate facility for storing food.  In one ward we saw bread being stored in dustbins, most of it stale.  Laundry facilities are not satisfactory in that units experience difficulty in getting their own clothes or bed linen back.  We are told that most of the laundry staff were taking voluntary redundancy, that the machinery is antiquated and frequently breaks down and is in urgent need of overhauling.  This would cost £200,000.</P>
    <P>This report goes on and on and on: &ldquo;St. Kevin's, 9, male, 28 patients &mdash; there is no activity in the day room.  The patients sat around in armchairs waiting for bed time, which was somewhere between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  The washhand basin area was used to store all sorts of rubbish.  One window had four broken panes of glass.  Again, in that area it is recommended that the 15 beds taken from the acute unit by the cutbacks be restored.  &ldquo;It goes on and on and on.  West Cork is covered with less detail: Patrick's, 8, 29 male patients &mdash; there are no curtains on the dormitory or on the corridor. General comment on the ward in this area: there is evidence of lack of activity and occupation for patients although some patients do leave the ward to go to occupational therapy.  Again, in that area there is a recommendation for restoration of the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Having catalogued this &ldquo;chapter of horrors&rdquo; as <i>The Cork Examiner</i> described it, the inspector went on to make some general comments about Our Lady's.  I want to put these on the record of the House.  &ldquo;The exterior of Our Lady's Hospital can only be described as filthy.  Rubbish, litter, discarded toilet rolls are to be seen in profusion around the bases of the building, behind the grey <Col N="1937" /> building, behind St. Kevin's and in internal courtyards.  Connecting corridors and walkways, particularly within the old building and leading therefrom to, for example, the industrial therapy centre, are dirty beyond description.  Saucers of milk&rdquo;&mdash; and I am talking now about a psychiatric hospital &mdash;&ldquo;and other food are left out for cats.  However, those cats must fulfil some function as many of the wards are mice-infested.  One of our party saw some mice during the inspection and there may even be rats around&rdquo;.  This is a hospital we are talking about.  &ldquo;We did see one carcase.  Internally, some but not all wards are dirty with windows grimed with opaque matter and walls peeling. These latter states of affairs were particularly evident in the main mentally handicapped ward in the grey building, St. Patrick's 1.  Generally wards, particularly male wards, lacked curtains.  There was a general feeling of crowdedness and a great single open space in some of the dormitories and in none of them was there any satisfactory attempt at dividing sleeping areas into warm, homely comfortable subdivisions.  Lavatories, too, were generally unsatisfactory with lavatory seats missing and in some cases floors dirty and wet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report goes on: &ldquo;Earlier redundancies among nursing staffs were to have coincided with significant ward closures. The redundancies happened but the ward closures did not.  The result is that the remaining staff are spread thinly over too many wards.  It is not possible to establish cogent reasons why the ward closures did not go ahead as planned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then we come to general comments on Cork psychiatric services.  This is the comment of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals: &ldquo;Our impression of the approach to the delivery of mental health care in Cork city and county is that it is seriously deficient from a planning point of view.  No clear objectives appear to have been identified, no priorities delineated and their solutions adopted.  There appears to be a lack of clear lines of command and proper structured consultation. In addition, there seems to be industrial unrest which has never been <Col N="1938" /> adequately dealt with.  This has hindered progress in providing adequate services and bringing about change.  This is most notably evident in the illegal opposition to the transfer of patients from Our Lady's to Sarsfield Court.  This was a disgraceful episode which reflects no credit on anybody and exemplifies management's inability or unwillingness to direct the service in the interests of the patients.&rdquo;  I want to emphasise that.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals clearly identified the responsibility in this matter as a responsibility of management.  It reflects managements inability or unwillingness to direct the service in the interests of patients.</P>
    <P>The report continues: &ldquo;Equally disturbing is the manner in which management has taken, apparently without consultation, decisions to curtail the vital community and acute aspects of the service.&rdquo; I did not say that the management had cut back on the services, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals Services did. &ldquo;The withdrawal of community nurses, the suppression of beds in the Regional Hospital unit in St. Anne's while leaving intact the entire ladies' complex is incomprehensible and can only lead to the transfer of more patients to Our Lady's. Our Lady's costs approximately £10 million to £11 million annually to run.  The service provided by the hospital is extremely poor and for the most part appears to provide the worst form of custodial care.  The majority of patients are unoccupied and no attempt is made to provide appropriate rehabilitative inputs for them on their wards.  It is our view that the board should establish and operate proper management techniques in relation to the whole Cork service.  This should involve as primary objectives the prevention of further admissions to Our Lady's, which cannot provide up-to-date psychiatric care of a standard commensurate with proper human dignity, and an intensive rehabilitation programme for existing in-patients.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals together with those who assisted him on that inspection.  I have frequently talked in this House <Col N="1939" /> about the conditions of the homeless and of travellers and of prisoners.  I know that you, a Chathaoirligh, have a considerable concern about the welfare of the mentally handicapped.  The institution whose appalling record I have just read on to the record of this House does house, if that is the right word &mdash; I would say probably &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is a better description &mdash; many mentally handicapped people. I have talked about this matter in this House.  I have never &mdash; and at 3 o'clock in the morning it is not possible to start acting about things &mdash; in my life been so outraged about something.  To be truthful I have, perhaps, been more outraged about one thing and that was the condition of some children I saw once.  With that exception I have never been so outraged as I have been by this report.  I have known, and most of Cork has known or suspected that that hospital was a disgrace. That was the position until we got this independent, authoritive written document &mdash; and incidentally, I did not say it at the beginning, the fact that I have it in my possession renders me in breach of the Official Secrets Act because it is not a public document but I have it and I am very glad to have it.  It is among the most appalling, distressing, disturbing, offensive documents that I have ever had the misfortune to read.</P>
    <P>The people in Our Lady's Hospital are guilty of nothing.  They are vulnerable, innocent and, in the old Irish phrase, in the area of the country that the Minister comes from and that I have close connections with, they would be described as &ldquo;harmless&rdquo;.  They do not deserve what is being done to them.  They are victims of misfortune; they are victims of illness and indeed, tragically, of abandonment.  They deserve our best. They have got our worst.  Instead we lock them up in a vermin-infested &mdash; not my conclusion, but the inspector's conclusion &mdash; unsanitary &mdash; not my conclusion but the inspector's conclusion &mdash; dirty, dark confinement.  It is a disgrace.  When you consider that we make them all, old age pensioners, pay for it.  We take most of <Col N="1940" /> their income, the best part of £40 a week from them.  They pay for that confinement, that locking up in dirty unsanitary conditions.  We have to and must make very fundamental choices.  It is a disgrace that people have been paid large salaries, salaries twice and three times the average industrial wage to manage such an institution of confinement.  Those people have failed to discharge their duties.  They should resign or be sacked. Messrs. Denis Dudley, Donal O'Sullivan and Pettit should either resign or be sacked.  They are unfit for their job.  They are a disgrace to their profession and they should be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>I regret that my colleague, the Minister for Health, who has a very deep concern about issues of this nature is not here at this hour of the morning to respond to the matter on the Adjournment due to the manner in which the business of the House has been conducted during the course of a long night and early morning.  I hope that the Members of the House and all the staff involved will appreciate that it is no indication of lack of interest on his part that he is not here.</P>
      <P>For my own part, I have been here for almost 12 hours now and, before addressing the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, may I express my appreciation to you, a Chathaoirligh, your staff and the press for their attendance during what has been a protracted debate to no particular purpose.  The business which brought me here is a very serious business, and I regret to have to say at this point that it was used and abused by some Members of the House for a purpose that was not meant to be in the interest of the legislation we were discussing.  I would have wished to have had the opportunity of replying, but circumstances, which I accept as the procedure of the House, did not enable me to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the privilege to reply now at this hour on behalf of my colleague.  I want to indicate to the House that this is the reply of my colleague, who has given a lot of thought and attention to this issue raised by Senator Ryan.  I quote precisely from what my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. O'Hanlon would have said: &ldquo;As the Senator is no doubt <Col N="1942" /> aware, the management and operation of Our Lady's Hospital, Cork, is the concern of the Southern Health Board. Under the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is obliged to make a formal inspection of each district mental hospital every year and to submit a report to me on his inspection.  Earlier this year the inspector visited Our Lady's Hospital and subsequently submitted a report to me.  That report was critical of both the hospital and the psychiatric services in the area.  I sent copies of the report to the chief executive officer of the board for his views.  I understand copies of the relevant sections of the report were sent to the clinical directors concerned and that copies of the report were sent to the members of the psychiatric services committee of the board.</P>
    <P>I have been considering the inspector's comments and his recommendations as to how the shortcoming he reported could be overcome.  I have had detailed discussions with senior officers of my Department, including the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, prior to having discussions with the chairman and the chief executive officer of the health board, which will take place very shortly.  These discussions will have two objectives.  First will be the steps which need to be taken as a matter of urgency to improve the very unsatisfactory conditions described by the inspector.  I would include in that the creation of structures which will ensure not only that improvements are made but also that they are maintained. It is disappointing to find the report critical of the physical conditions in an institution on which my Department spent almost £1 million in recent years under the minor capital scheme, in addition to the board's own maintenance.</P>
    <P>The second objective will be to bring about organisational changes in the psychiatric service in Cork city and county.  The ultimate solution to the problems which exist in Our Lady's Hospital will only be found in the development of a psychiatric service based in the community.  In line with national policy, I feel it is essential to <Col N="1943" /> decentralise the current psychiatric services in Cork and develop a network of community based facilities.  This is in keeping with the policy outlined in <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospital services four catchment areas, each of which should have its own admission and acute care unit, day hospitals, out-patient clinics, day centres, hostels and other smallscale facilities.  In this way admissions to Our Lady's Hospital would cease.  Instead patients could be treated at or near their homes.  Only a small proportion require in-patient care and usually for a short time only.  A psychiatric service based on this model would be of great benefit to patients and would prevent the build up of long stay patients such as we have at present in our psychiatric hospitals.  Part of the reorganisation of the service will be the rehabilitation of existing long stay patients.  A significant proportion of the <Col N="1944" /> 900 patients now in Our Lady's Hospital could and should be enabled to leave the hospital and live in ordinary houses in the community.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the chairman and chief executive officer I expect it will become clear what steps are necessary now to bring about the desired changes. I will be anxious to help in bringing them about.&rdquo;</P>
