      <P>I have notice from Senator Philip Hogan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to intervene immediately to ensure the sanction of national lottery funds to the Graiguenamanagh Elderly Association, County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a pilot scheme for Teilifís na Gaeltachta because £0.5 million has been set aside from the national lottery by the Government since November last for this scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hogan and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hogan's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator O'Toole may give notice another day of the matters he, wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of points on the Order of Business.  Would it be possible at this stage to get some clear indication from the Leader of the House as to the Bills the Government wish to complete before the end of this session?  We want to co-operate in every way in the work of the House but we would need to know fairly precisely which of the Bills the Government want to see finished and those which they do not so that we can order our business?  Secondly, I would like to query the status of Item No. 8 on the Order Paper today &mdash; the Bankruptcy Bill, which appears here at Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I will very quickly talk about the history of this Bill.  It was introduced in 1982 in the last Oireachtas session.  It went through a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  I had the honour to chair that committee, which had Members of this House and the Dáil among its members and debated the full Committee Stage.  It is my understanding that when that Bill had gone through and been completed by the joint committee, it would then come back to the Dáil and Seanad for Report and Final Stages.  That was the situation in the Dáil which yesterday completed the Report and Final Stages of the Bankruptcy Bill.  On our Order Paper here it is ordered for Second Stage. My understanding is that that Bill has already gone through Second Stage in the Seanad.  Is it the intention to bring this Bill right through Second Stage and Committee Stage again?  There are about 200 sections in the Bill.  I am not asking for a definite answer now, but perhaps the Whips could discuss this matter and we could get some definite guidance.  First, the legislation has been in print since 1982 and is urgently needed.  It is the first major review of bankruptcy legislation in 100 years.  It strikes me as strange that we have to go through Second and Committee Stages again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, on the question of the Companies Bill &mdash; the Leader of the House has indicated very forcefully on a number <Col N="1639" /> of occasions and with great determination and vigour that he intends to see this Bill completed in this House this session.  If by the end of this session he also means the end of next week, then we will not co-operate in that.  I believe that the Companies Bill has been very well debated so far in this House.  It is very important.  There is no way we can be rushed through the remaining 70 or 80 sections in one week.</P>
    <P>If, however, it is the intention of the Leader of the House to have this Bill debated in September we will be most anxious to co-operate.  I want to state for the record &mdash; this is not saying one thing in the House and one thing outside it &mdash; we would like to see the Seanad back in early September.  We would like to see it back to discuss in a calm way legislation like the Bankruptcy Bill and I would like to put that firmly on the record at this stage.  We do not want to see it rushed through in one week at the end of this session.  It is far too important for that and it would fly in the face of the excellent discussions we have had so far.</P>
    <P>I understand an all-party motion asking that the Seanad have a debate in honour of the birthday of Nelson Mandela has been submitted.  It is not on the Order Paper yet.  I would ask the Leader of the House if he could see to it that an hour of business next week is made available for that.  Finally, a Chathaoirligh, could we have a report from you before the end of the session as to the progress of the work on the Chamber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to propose that we take the Companies Bill also &mdash; I am very unhappy with the fact that it has not been ordered today.  Whereas we accept the case made by Senator Manning to the Leader of the House about the need to give it a full debate, we believe that we have a clear obligation and responsibility to get this legislation finished before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Leader of the House is nodding his head, as he was nodding this time last year on similar legislation which was not completed before the end of the <Col N="1640" /> session.  We would certainly go for both points.  We agree with the Leader of the House that it should be completed before the end of the session and we agree with the Leader of the Fine Gael group that it should get a full debate and be treated in the same way as it has been so far.  We would like to know when in fact the Leader intends taking that particular legislation?</P>
    <P>We have already indicated our full support for the debate on Sount African affairs to mark the upcoming 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela and we are surprised to see that that has not been ordered so far.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Leader of the House raised the fact of having a debate on Middle Eastern affairs and gave a clear commitment that that would also be taken before the end of the session.  He gave us to understand that this was a matter close to his heart, he was concerned with it and he would look forward to having a debate on it.  We would like to know when it is proposed to take that?</P>
    <P>Finally I am glad to see that the item on Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations has moved up to No. 9, near the top of the agenda one more time.  Again it is in the name of the Leader of the House and I would ask if he intends having that debate before the end of the session?  Guarantees were given also to my colleague, Senator Paddy McGowan, who has raised it on a number of occasions.  There are items on this Order Paper which are lying there and which should be treated, and in his words &ldquo;more business is done at county councils&rdquo; which is quite right really.</P>
    <P>I think we should have a full report from the Leader of the House on when he intends getting through the large number of items which are on the agenda &mdash; we feel that we should make every attempt to clear as far as possible this Order Paper before the end of the session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely that Item No. 9 be taken. We are already on the run in to the review <Col N="1641" /> of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November. By the time we meet again after the summer recess it will be almost on top of us.  It seems to me that no time could be more ideal than now, seeing that we are meeting at least next week and that an hour and a half of business should be set aside this week and next week.  I cannot accept that the Government have any other reason for not putting this on except that they do not want to discuss these vital issues.  I urge the Government therefore to face up to their own motion and I propose that Item No. 9 be added to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>May I just say the Bankruptcy Bill will be coming into the House before the recess and we will be taking all Stages.  I should say it was not 1972 or 1982 but it was 1962 when this Bill was introduced by the Taoiseach.  I should like to send a message of good wishes to him as he had to go into hospital this morning.  That Bill has been in this House and the other House since 1962 and we will take all Stages before the recess.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole asked about the Companies Bill.  We will take a number of sections of that Bill next week.  Before we come back in September or whenever, the House will have had plenty of opportunity to look at the Bill and we will spend maybe two or three weeks on that Bill in September or late August when we come back.</P>

It is doubtful if we can have a debate on Middle East affairs in the next couple of days, but if there is a motion put down on Middle East affairs we could take it in the next week.  We will take a certain number of sections of the Companies Bill next week and then we will come back to it in September.  The Córas Beostoic agus Feola (Amendment) Bill, 1988, Second Stage will be taken; the Data Protection Bill and the Bankruptcy Bill will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the names of Labour Party Senators and of Senator Joe O'Toole.  We are concerned about this section which provides that the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance may set up a private company without having recourse to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is, in other words, an opening to privatisation.  We have already experienced this when we set up companies like this do a specific job. When they become successful, like the most recent ones, and the moment they show a profit after being set up for the benefit of the State, the executive director suggests that the company should be up for sale to the public.  When the Oireachtas in its progressiveness decides to form a private sector company, that company will still be considered by the House to have a major national responsibility, a social responsibility and an <Col N="1644" /> employment responsibility.  We are unhappy about this provision giving the Minister this power.  I am not thinking in this context of the present Minister, a man with whom I have had excellent personal relationships and discussions in this House and in the Dáil since he accepted this portfolio.  I have no doubt about his commitment to forestry and to its development for the betterment of the country and of the national economy.  I am concerned however that at some future date some Minister who has a hang up about privatisation would, with this section, have the power to agree to dispose of this company.  It is a trend I am concerned about.  This amendment, which aims to remove this subsection, would remove that possibility.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the trade union movement is extremely concerned about it.  They had hoped to have lengthy discussions with the Minister before this legislation went through the Dáil.  They have had brief discussions with us.  My colleagues, Senators Brian O'Shea and Jack Harte, will have further comments to make on this section.  Perhaps they might want to hear the Minister's comments on the concern I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is an enabling one.  It is designed to give the company flexibility in regard to its future development.  Some State-sponsored bodies have, in fact, been established as public limited companies in the first instance &mdash; for example, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, B &amp; I and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  The Senator should take that factor into account.  Any company which is established initially as a private company may, subject to the requirements of the Company Acts, re-register as a public limited company.  Coillte Teoranta should have the facility to do likewise. Indeed, even if this subsection were deleted, it could do so within the parameters of existing legislation.  This subsection, however, provides what may be regarded as a safeguard in that it requires Coillte Teoranta to obtain the prior <Col N="1645" /> approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance should it propose to become a public limited company. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>As I have said, a number of companies have been established already over the years as public limited companies.  The very safeguard which the Senator is anxious to put into this Bill would not have the effect he desires.  It would be possible for the company to re-register as a public limited company within existing company law.  We are merely putting in a safeguard to require the company to come back to the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance should they wish to take that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  Under the Companies Act it is available to a State company to privatise.  The Minister is seeking to add a safeguard.  I suggest to the Minister that if a further safeguard were added, whereby any such move towards privatisation would have to be approved by the Dáil, it would go some of the way towards meeting the worries we have on this section.  The Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance would be the Ministers holding the safeguard. I feel that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have at least some say if we are disposing of State assets into the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Shea has made a suggestion which possibly the Minister should seriously consider on Report Stage.  The Minister has the powers and the parliamentary draftsmen available to him.  Certainly, we accept the fact that the Minister is ensuring now, by this additional subsection, that it could not happen under company law without his approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Surely in a democracy, because of the changing attitudes of Ministers of all parties to privatisation as against their commitment to the State sector, it would be appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to debate any proposal made to it by the company we are setting up if <Col N="1646" /> they considered it was appropriate to have the company privatised.</P>
      <P>Extraordinarily enough, when we were discussing the Postal and Telecommunications (Services) Act, 1983, when we established An Post and An Bord Telecom, on page 37 of that Bill, No. 24, section 9 (1) the exact wording in that section was:</P>
      <P>The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, shall cause two limited companies conforming to the conditions laid down in this Act to be formed and registered under the Companies Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 9 says:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by order appoint a day to be the vesting day for each of the two companies as soon as practicable after the companies have been registered.</P>
      <P>This additional third section was put into this piece of legislation.  It was not put into the Postal and Telecommunications (Services) Act, 1983. Perhaps the soundings we have heard recently from one of the executive officers on one of those boards which intimated that it is appropriate now for that particular service to be sold off was because these two restrictive subsections empowered him under the Companies Act to do that.  It was never the wish of the Houses of the Oireachtas that it should happen in that way.  Now there is no recourse to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no Minister with a responsibility in that area.  The only opportunity we have to debate is when we get a copy of their report and accounts lodged before the Houses of the Oireachtas which could trigger off a debate.  Even then we would have to get Government time and the permission of Government to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister reassuring us that this additional provision safeguards against the concern we have in the Labour Party that any company set up like this could, under the Companies Act, make a decision to apply and be considered for privatisation without recourse to the <Col N="1647" /> Minister or the Oireachtas?  If that is the commitment the Minister is giving, we will accept it.  However, would he also take on board the suggestion of Senator O'Shea, that it would be appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas would be included in the consultative process and that an order would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas before that procedure could take place?  Then, at least, the public would be aware of what we would be doing in this area and the reason why new forestry company would suddenly be privatised.  The Minister understands our concern.  We accept his genuine response and that this is a provision to eliminate that possibility, but could he broaden it a little more so that the democratic process would be implemented?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the position is that we have a million acres of land under forestry.  While this represents quite a considerable amount, it is, in fact, the smallest percentage of forested land in Europe with the possible exception of Iceland.  The vast amount of this forest, that is, 85 per cent of it, is State planted, cultivated and State owned.  Fifteen per cent is privately owned.  In fact, attempts to attract farmers and private landowners to invest in forests have been tried on numerous occasions and not been successful. For this reason we in the Labour Party think that the State, which has for the most part pursued a consistent planting programme and taken all the financial risks involved in planting these large forests, are the people who should retain them.  Nobody who feels there is a fast buck to be made now in a shorter period than heretofore, because of the way this company is financed and structured, should be allowed to take advantage of the position.  They would not take the long term risk.  The Minister is talking about 25 to 30 years for the trees to mature.  But, on the basis of the financial arrangements within the company, he could be talking about profits in five years' time.  Consequently, because section 9 provides for the establishment <Col N="1648" /> of a public limited company, the temptation will be there to start talking about privatisation, despite all the work that has been done down the years by the State.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this State commercial enterprise will make itself very attractive to private companies and to pension funds.  The expectancy of making profits before was that it would take a long time.  Banks and institutions, have been expressing interest in the forests.</P>
      <P>Most of us would be advocates of the mixed economy.  Most people see the necessity for State commercial enterprises going into competition with private enterprise, not only in the forestry areas but in other areas also.  The consequence of this is that there is in the company, as it is structured at present, a great temptation to give away a lot of money that has been invested by the State down through the years.  Work, effort and research have gone into this venture. Somebody with a few pounds to spare, such as the financial institutions, who do not manufacture anything and who get their money from us as well, could benefit unfairly.  The little woman with the shawl and black hat is able to contribute to their output by putting a few pounds in the bank.  They are there to make money on the basis of not having anything of their own except the buildings they subsequently buy and keep in their own names.  These are the type of people who are going to get into something that the State has actually done.  This company has a great basis for advancement.  We have to congratulate the Government for bringing in this Bill.  It is a very good idea.  We have to agitate to see that a potentially profitable State commercial enterprise is not going to fall into the hands of a few predators who actually stand back a little, watch a company getting into difficulties and then move in before it goes down too far and gives an artificial value to its shares.  We have seen it all over the place.  The media have expressed that in a number of ways. Quite frankly, it would be a terrible thing for us if section 9 was left the way it is and was not appropriately amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Forest and Wildlife Service has given great service to the State.  They have done tremendous work over past decades in catering not only for the forest lands but also by providing a valuable crop of trees.  It is a very welcome amenity which has been provided down through the years for camping trips. There is a danger in the way the section is set out.  Without amendment, I feel that the opportunity is there for those people who could only be described now as predators.  They had opportunities to invest in forestry down through the years but none of them took the opportunity to do so.  Only 15 per cent of the land was privately held.  It would be sad to think that because of the way it is financially structured somebody could move in and rip off the profits.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to calculate how much has gone into forestry over the years.  They would not just be selling the trees.  If they get into private enterprise they would be selling the land under the trees.  Not only that, they would be sending a lot of the staff down the drain as well.  It is inevitable that that is the way it would end up.  That is the way that things develop.  Naturally I am very concerned about this development.  Private enterprise could get in there at a very high level and get substantial control in a very short time.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill appears to be to establish a commercial company and all the State forests would be transferred to it.  Can you imagine the temptation that that would be to financial institutions, such as banks, if this was to be made a public liability company?  We are on the eve of realising financial gains through a commercial State enterprise. We have something that has been there for 60 years.  We have not made much of a success of it.  The fact is that we are on the verge of making something very good through straight commercial enterprise. We should be in a position, through the State's efforts and money &mdash; and the people's money &mdash; to exploit it.  This section should be amended to protect the people's money.  If we do that the position would be that the people who are running <Col N="1650" /> the enterprise will be well capable of looking after the interests of the community. The community is very often left out of things.  Here is an opportunity to keep the community in, but we are leaving it exposed to the market situation where people who would not take the risk earlier would be prepared to do so now because the risks are limited to about four or five years.  They want to get in there and get a big whack out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Harte has put all our concerns into his contribution on this amendment.  Does the Minister consider this additional subsection as a protection that is put in there to ensure that all the worries are not well founded?  Was the reason he put it in, when it was not in the other Acts setting up similar enterprises, to ensure this does not happen without the Minister's approval or knowledge? May I ask the Minister whether his approval as defined in that section, &ldquo;with his approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, will be given by way of a ministerial order?  If so, is it covered in section 3?  Is our concern covered in section 3, because if it is not, this means the approval of the Minister in his office without recourse to anybody except the Cabinet.  We feel that Senator O'Shea's suggestion that that approval would be by way of a ministerial order, which would then come before us so that we could have a debate on it, would be reasonable.  We could debate the pros and cons.  That is a reasonable approach to what the Minister has said to us by way of building in the safeguard which he has put in this subsection.  In his explanation, and on the point made by Senator Harte, I feel we could have a compromise on this that would meet everybody's concern.</P>

I would like some clarification on what will happen to land bought by the company if there is a particular area which is of scientific interest.  For instance, if there is a piece of important <Col N="1651" /> fenland, or a piece of bogland or oak wood in the middle of a particular area that has been bought by the company, what is to happen?  Will that be given over to the Forest and Wildlife Service, or whatever?  For instance, the Wildlife Service had to buy Clara Bog.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that this subsection is chartered for privatisation and you have a number of choices.  For instance, if we had remained silent I am quite certain that there would be no proposal in relation to the fears the Senators are presently expressing.  By the mere fact of putting in an additional safeguard your attention was attracted and you are seeking to delete a subsection which worsens the position for the points you are making. In your interest I am safeguarding you condoning the question of the company reregistering as a public limited company. Bearing in mind that Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and B &amp; I are presently existing companies in that category, the safeguards that are being provided are acceptable and in the main remove the fears which are being expressed by Senators.  The request is being made to know if it would be possible to have the decision of this nature decided by order of the Dáil.  We have to understand that the Government and the executive functions of the Government are separate.  If we were to move into a position where every decision of this nature was to be a matter for debate in the Dáil we would be facing into a much more cluttered situation than we are in at present.  The subsection is certainly much better than if we had remained silent on it.  Existing State companies are silent and can, within the context of existing company law, re-register as public limited companies without recourse to the Dáil and to the Minister.  We have that additional safeguard of having to consult with the Minister for Finance and Energy before any such decisions are taken.  Bearing all <Col N="1652" /> that in mind the House can be satisfied that it is not a charter for privatisation, It is an enabling section with certain safeguards and a certain flexibility for the company.</P>

      <P>The whole process of this amendment has now clarified for a lot of people the worries they had about this subsection.  It is in the process of dialogue here in this House and a debate on it that those people outside, who have an interest because they are employed in it, can be convinced the Minister is, by this subsection, putting in a safeguard to ensure that what they were worried about cannot happen without the approval of two Ministers, which is a step forward on existing legislation which was set up with regard to Aer Lingus and others.  We are now admitting that, having had the dialogue with you.  Please do not remove from the democratic process because of the cluttering up of decisions by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would not like you to feel that that would be a necessary evil.  Discussions at that level, particularly if there was a proposal before the Minister or the executive arm of Government for a privatisation proposal from the new company, naturally would be in everybody's interest.  Such matters should be debated.  The terms of the proposed take over or of selling off would be known.  You did not address the point I made.  Will this approval of yours and of the Minister for Finance be made by way of an order giving your approval, or do you just write a letter saying it is a great idea and one can sell it off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, you are into the business of selling off.  I will not go over that again because we have limited time. Those fears are generally groundless.  It will not be an order in the Dáil or by the Minister.  It will be done by the normal process for approval of matters of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my earlier comment of cluttering up the Houses of the Oireachtas, everybody here and in the other House appreciates that from time to time very serious legislation can pass <Col N="1653" /> through the House without sufficient debate because of time constraints. Every time we put an extra load into that, however genuinely it is done, it only has the effect of limiting still further the opportunity to discuss and debate here which I welcome very much.  It is in that context that I was saying it.  From time to time I have been worried because the opportunity to really discuss serious matters is restricted and limited to a degree which could and should be changed.  Certainly it would be worse if practically every iota of the decision making process in relation to the powers of the Ministers and the powers of the Executive were matters for debate in the Dáil and the Seanad.  Bearing in mind that the Ministers are democratically elected and have to answer to the people in one way or another, I do not think we are too far removed from the realities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) to acquire land, on a compulsory basis if necessary, to carry on the business of forestry,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an enabling subsection.  We feel that any new company which has an interest in developing forestry should have some powers vested in it so as to be able to acquire land which in their <Col N="1654" /> opinion and in the opinion of experts would be suitable and marginal land for forestry development.  Some person may not necessarily want to surrender it or sell it.  It could be in everybody's interest that particular lands would be developed as forestry lands, having regard to the amenity value of it, the tourist value, the national value, the economic value to the country and the whole concept of what we are doing in the area of forestry.  I know that this is a power that is sparingly used at the moment by local authorities for the acquisition of land in the interests of the common good in order to provide houses for those who are in need of housing, or to provide for road widening in the interests of public safety.  It is not without a lot of consideration that we have suggested that this company should have this power to acquire land in the overall interest.  Naturally, there would be a process of appeal against the compulsory acquisition of land.  There would be proceedings to be followed.  There would be an arbitrator to decide on the value of it.  There is no question of taking land from the people and not compensating them.  That would not arise. The overall interest of the forestry business would be served usefully if this new company had these kinds of powers to compulsorily acquire some land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no problem with the overall thrust of what you are trying to achieve.  There are areas here and there that we have problems with but overall we do not.  Regarding the compulsory acquisition of land this is an area I have had an interest in for quite some time.  I remember coming across information some years ago where it transpired that Irish-based insurance companies had substantial holdings in forestry &mdash; one in Wales and another in Norway.  It seemed from what information I could get at that time &mdash; and correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the major problem was that insurance companies had great difficulty in assembling large enough land holdings which some people would sell and others would not. With this in view, I put down notice of <Col N="1655" /> a motion in Waterford County Council seeking that a feasibility study be conducted into whether the county council should use its compulsory purchase powers to assemble land holdings and whether these land holdings should be passed on to forestry or put up for public tender.  It strikes me that this may be a weakness in what we are trying to achieve, that it may limit Coillte Teoranta from gathering together sufficiently large land holdings and what we are seeking to achieve here will in fact strengthen and speed up the process as the Minister wants to do, and in which we very much support him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems is the amendment accepted in the other House with which I agree totally, that is the amendment which allowed the acquisition and the sale of land.  I was glad, as I said in my Second Stage speech, that that was accepted by the Government at that stage.  There is a knock-on effect now which we need to look at arising out of that.  Not only should they be able to acquire land but they should be able to actually pinpoint the land.  Let me immediately say that I would not agree with the idea of big brother, the State, coming in and buying over small-holdings and almost evicting people.  That is not the idea here.  At an earlier stage of the discussion, and in my Second Stage contribution I referred to the effective, economic and commercially viable use of land and I quoted an extract from the document of the UPTCS, <i>Our Natural Heritage</i>, where it indicated that certain soils were five times more productive than others for the growth of wood for afforestation. I put that in the context of areas of the country where the wetter climate or the type of climate is more suitable.  It would seem to me that, if you got an area of the country where both those factors came together, the soil type and the climate type, this would be the best possible use of land.  Also, the particular use that was being made of it at that time was not economically effective.  I certainly understand that the commitment of this <Col N="1656" /> Government and indeed the last Government, through Europe, has been for the most economic size of holdings and use of land etc.  I would not see that what I am leading with would be against the general policy of Government for the proper and effective use of land.  As Senator Ferris outlined, there would, of course need to be built into this the safety nets, appeals procedure etc.  Given that after due assessment, a particular area or tract of land was most suitable for afforestation and the people who owned it at that time were properly compensated, I believe that there should be an element of compulsory purchase in the authority and the discretion of the new board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point of view advanced by Senator O'Toole, because whilst I was earlier condemning the fact that the farmers and other private people did not enter into planting etc., at the same time I would have to have regard to the question of the acquisition of land. We are not dealing with an urban situation where housing is being developed. Those who are in the farming business, if they want to develop, should not be trodden on by acquisition; we were not talking about that.  We think that they have every right to enter into a full discussion so long as the land would not leave the State.  When we are talking to them about buying land from them or taking it, we have to talk in terms of full compensation.  At the same time there is no way in which you can develop the potential of the company at the moment if you do not have the acquisition provision. What we are really concerned about is the sale and acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a Bill that provides a wonderful opportunity for the State in the commercial end of the industry.  We are going to be in a lucrative marketing situation provided, of course, we get our act together if we look at the potential in Europe and soon.  We will need to acquire land.  We accept that.  We do not accept that the State should ride roughshod over people and treat them unfairly.  We are not talking about the acquisition of land <Col N="1657" /> without compensation.  We want people to be properly compensated.  We want them also to have an opportunity to state the reasons why the land should not be acquired and to have some sort of legal framework within which they can protect themselves.  That is what we want here.</P>
    <P>There is the question of trying to get a balance between the right of the State or company to acquire land and the interests of the people who are going to have the land taken from them.  That is really the concern.</P>

      <P>I have a slight misgiving about the compulsory acquisition of land.  As you are all aware, the part of the country I come from has the proper soil type and the proper climate and indeed that kind of situation could develop.  It would be a dangerous precedent to set.  I have listened to Senator Harte and the previous speakers.  I know they want people genuinely compensated but the principal of compulsory acquisition is a very emotive issue in forestry and I think if the compulsory acquisition of land were written into the Bill it would set a dangerous precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be of the same opinion and I think the new section, as proposed by Senator Ferris, would be unnecessary.  The important thing would be to encourage privatisation of afforestation. The problem heretofore was to compel the Government of the day to acquire land that was being offered to them and it will still be offered to them.  It can be purchased and put to afforestation and that I think is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In all debates in either House the case is made for and against. I could not accept this amendment for a variety of reasons.  Let me say at the outset that I am in the process, as are the staff in my Department and indeed quite a number of people in the private sector, of building bridges over centuries of problems with regard to encouraging people to get involved in forestry.  The last thing, therefore, that we would want is a scenario where any company had the <Col N="1658" /> power to do as Senator Harte said, to ride roughshod over the private individual, rights of farmers or other land owning groups.</P>
      <P>I take the point that we are aiming to have large economic blocks and that should be a feature in the good management of forest development for the future.  We must also have a sensible approach.  First and foremost, this is a new company.  Thankfully there are quite a number of other small private companies involved in forestry over recent years.  If we were to extend to this company the powers of compulsory acquisition, what would the legal position be with regard to other private companies involved in forestry?  We have checked this out with the Attorney General and we are absolutely satisfied that it would not be possible to enshrine in this legislation powers of compulsory acquisition without the difficulties that I have indicated to you.  We have, therefore, decided that these powers will reside with the Minister for his use on a discretionary basis, depending on the situation.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the question of suitable soil types and amassing them together for forestry.  It is not altogether as simple as that.  If you look at the soil analysis carried out by An Foras Talúntais a cursory glance will indicate to you that there is a huge number of soil types.  They can be broken down into about 27 general groups and they exist in every county.  The best and the worst of these exist in every county and in paractically every parish, depending on degrees.  With regard to yield class, &mdash; I take the point that the Senator is interested in getting up into the high yield class &mdash; anywhere from 16 to 30 is an exceptionally good yield class but even that has a very wide variation because 16 is far above the European average and still only half of what is possible on our best land.  We could not confine ourselves exclusively to our very best land so we take that variety on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that overall the residual powers remain in the Department for use at the discretion of the Minister. They could not be given to one <Col N="1659" /> particular company without incurring problems with regard to the rights of other private companies who are involved in forestry.  The company has the power to purchase land.  We are anxious to have the greatest co-operation possible in this area.  The European Community has given a grant to a co-operative in the west, for instance, to encourage groups of farmers to come together.  They could retain their best land for conventional farming and even make swops and exchanges with other farmers in order to put economic blocs of forest parcels together.  That is a better way to go than, at this stage, giving the company powers and rights which would be exclusive to it, which you would be denying to other companies and which would probably create problems also.  The power still resides with the Minister, for his or her use, depending on the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank the Minister for his response.  We were aware the Minister had retained the powers of compulsory acquisition of land under the amended 1946 Act.  We were not doing anything different from what the Minister already has the power to do.  We were concerned that tracts of land could lie unused while this new company would like to have access to them.  In spite of this Government's effort and the previous Government's efforts &mdash; who gave inheritance tax incentives, income tax incentives and other financial packages to the private sector to develop private tracts of land for forestry &mdash; there has not been the kind of movement we would all wish for. There has been some movement.  We are quite aware that there are tracts of land which are marginal, to say the least, and would certainly be suitable for forestry but for some reason, historic or otherwise, the owners may not necessarily want to dispose of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the concept of having to give up some land is a very serious matter. Those of us in the Labour Party are more aware of this than anybody else.  We find, at county council level, that it is extremely difficult at times to get the <Col N="1660" /> manager to use his powers under this section, even when there is a dire necessity to house somebody, particularly in an isolated area.  However, it is a very important function to have, although we rarely use it, because having it gives you some powers in trying to move forward. I think all the Members here who are members of local authorities will know that we have used that power sparingly.</P>
    <P>In case the position might be misrepresented, everybody who owns land in this country is protected under the Constitution from anybody, even the Minister.  So, even if the Minister, a county council, the Land Commission or anybody else had compulsory acquisition powers these could only be used within the framework of the Constitution. People have the right to object, to have a public hearing on the case, produce witnesses and also to appeal the actual process of compensation.  So, it was not some revolutionary nationalisation of land that was proposed.  It was just intended to facilitate the company in the performance of what we consider a very important role, the ability to acquire land for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has admitted he has retained the powers for himself, to be used at his discretion, may we ask him when does he expect these powers to be used and will he, at the request of the company, use them?  What kind of instructions will the Minister give under the powers he has retained for himself? We realise that he has the powers.  Now that he has admitted this publicly, let us talk about when he intends to use them and under what circumstances he will allow them to be used.  If we can get that assurance, we will be happy to withdraw our amendment because obviously the company can apply to the Minister to operate these powers if they have difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been thinking about the compulsory aspect of this legislation. It would be a little inconsistent with my earlier remarks, having regard to the community's rates and the community always being excluded.  I agree with the <Col N="1661" /> general purpose of acquisition, the driving force is to acquire land to develop forestry and there is a need for that.  I think I would have to stop short on the compulsory aspect in this case because of many occasions in this House I have been very hard on the community being excluded.  I am talking about industry in general where the worker's rates are there, management rates are there and board rates are there but the community is very often excluded.  For that reason I feel I would have to go softly on the compulsory aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We would take on board the very valid point made by the Minister regarding sensitivity in this whole area. We are not suggesting that viable holdings be interfered with on the margin. There are certain basic areas where we would see compulsory acquisition as being useful and right &mdash; where tracts of land were totally neglected and a particular piece was needed for access to other land that had been acquired.  The use of compulsory purchase powers can straighten out a situation very quickly where somebody is willing to sell but there are title difficulties.  Is the Minister saying that where such cases come to light he would not stand back from using compulsory powers if it were in the general interest, taking sensitivities on board also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of his Second Stage speech and again this morning Senator Ferris tended to ignore what is actually happening in relation to the accelerated growth in private sector forestry development.  This year we expect private afforestation to reach about 4,000 hectares.  I am confident that that will be significantly increased again next year so that, if you like, private afforestation in the next year will virtually match what the State was doing a couple of years ago and that is a phenomenal increase.  It is a tenfold increase in four to five years.  We expect that to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice I have in relation to this particular section from the Attorney General is that to give this provision to <Col N="1662" /> the private company would transgress the rules of fair trade and also EC regulations. With regard to the question as to whether or when or in what circumstances a Minister might use these powers, I think it would be fair to tell the House that they should be used very sensitively and very sparingly.  In the context of Senator O'Shea's question, in a situation where an isolated block of land interferes with the mainstream development of forestry, obviously, the first stage of that would be to negotiate sensibly and on a commonsense basis with the owners to see if that land could be acquired and the use of compulsory acquisition powers should be a last resort.  I have always found, and I would try to achieve this in my attempt to deal with the questions arising here, that most people in the final analysis are capable of reaching a commonsense solution if the approaches are made properly.  Very often they are not, and we should ensure that we do not ride roughshod over the rights of individuals but that at the same time we can put in place, first, negotiation and in the final analysis compulsory acquisition powers where it is clear that the sensibile course of action is to go in a particular direction and that the balance of opinion is in that way.  I could not possibly tell the House the specific circumstances in which I would use compulsory acquisition.  It would be used very sparingly.  In the context of the amount of land that is available for forestry at the present time which, as Senator Rory Kiely said in the Second Stage speech is in no way in conflict with what is happening in agriculture &mdash; it can develop in tandem with agriculture &mdash; to waste our time or the company's time or any other company's, or the Minister's time on the use of these powers willy-nilly across the country would be absurd and I do not see us travelling that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is naturally worrying to our people because it does appear to be a subtle attempt to undermine the whole ethos of the Bill which purports to take over the management of State forests.  In effect, if this section is passed without amendment, I imagine there could be complete denuding of the State forests within five or ten years. Over the past two years or so there has been considerable speculation about the sale of mature and near-mature forests. We are very concerned about this particular section.  The reference to the sale of timber is perfectly legitimate but we are wondering why the clause about the sale on land could not be explained a little better.  For example, does the Minister intend to sell plots of land with unfelled trees or is it just the unfelled trees?  It certainly seems that it is plots of land. The question of sale is a difficult one in this sense that if the company had the intention of selling a bit of forestry land as well as the timber on it for the purpose of acquiring an area, that is an understandable thing.  It is a different matter if you no longer require something and just want to make a profit and sell it off.  If the intention were otherwise and if it were possible for the State to decide that there was something bigger in the neighbourhood or somewhere else and that it would be brought into the company in a much more beneficial way, then it would <Col N="1664" /> be understandable to think about the question of sale but only under those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The reference to the sale of land does bring us back once again to the issue of privatisation.  I am not against profits but I am certainly a great advocate of &mdash; and I would do as much as I can to protect them &mdash; the interests of the mixed economy and therefore this is why sections like this in the Bill cause us concern.  It says in the Bill that the company shall submit and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale of land and the sale of timber.  That is the worrying part about it the point about sale.  It is worrying for us in the context of banks and other financial institutions with pension funds and so on.  They would not be interested in investing in marginal or unused land.  This is another cause for concern.  They have certainly set their sights on the State lands, especially on those forests which have been carefully cultivated perhaps over 40 years and where they could move into a tidy situation. It seems that under section 14 the company provides such bodies with the possibility of fulfilling their wishes to get in and get the benefits of what has happened over a 40-year period.  There are readymade road networks, a well-run and well-managed wildlife, with habitats well looked after.  Trees have been professionally trimmed and pruned and generally regularly inspected.  Is it any wonder that one has heard the speculation over the last couple of years about institutions of this nature and particularly if they decide to get in on the part that has already been looked after for them. To be quite frank about it, I do not like using the term &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; but if it did ever get to that point, it could only be described as a rip-off.  Where people with big powers want to get their hands on something that has been in State possession through thick and thin, mostly through the thin.  I would be worried if State forests are not developed.  Much attention has been given to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one encouraging aspect &mdash; I do not want this to be taken as a snide remark &mdash;<Col N="1665" /> is that in May 1986 a motion was put on the Order Paper in the names of the Fianna Fáil group of Senators.  It called on the Government to prepare and implement a plan for the maximum exploitation of our foresty resources and for a rejection of any attempt by the Government to dispose of State forests to private banking and financial institutions.  That brought a bright glimmer of hope to the situation. However, it was merely a motion on the Order Paper when another Government was in power.  We are now talking about the power of the Minister here.  It is not a question of mistrusting the Minister but times have changed.  Emphasis on these institutions and their interest in the State forests has grown in the past couple of years.  With a long term operation like forestry where there is great potential finance is needed.  This is a serious matter and I would have a right to be concerned about it.</P>

      <P>The motion Senator Harte referred to was put down because the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned that enough land was not being acquired at that time for the development of forestry. We were also concerned about the sale of land.  This section has safeguards to the effect that the Minister would have to consent to the sale of land and that is very important.  The section was amended in the Dáil to ensure acquisition of land.  That is also very important. Every effort should be made to acquire sufficient land for the development of forestry, especially land that would be suitable for afforestation.  If this amendment were accepted no land could be sold and there might be occasions where the sale of land by Coillte Teoranta to people for the development of forestry might be advantageous.</P>

    <P>I was particularly concerned that certain areas of scientific interest could be planted without consultation with the <Col N="1666" /> Minister with responsibility for wildlife. However, I kept an eye on the Bill as it was going through the Dáil and I had made my concern known to the Minister. I would like to congratulate him and his Department for ensuring that this area of our environment will be safeguarded.  I would ask the Minister what will happen to areas of scientific interest which might be a small part of a much larger area &mdash; for instance, a fen or a piece of bogland that might be surrounded by an area to be planted with trees.  Will that be given over to the wildlife service?</P>
    <P>We have had very sad examples of areas, which were actually listed by the wildlife service, being taken over by the forestry which were totally unsuitable for planting and in which the wrong trees were planted at the wrong time.  These areas are now neither good for forestry nor for the particular scientific interest that was related to them at the time.  They have been ruined.  I would like to ask the Minister if anything can be done or if his Department will be looking after that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>There are also areas where there are national monuments.  Are they to be protected? For instance, if there is a certain area of interest where trees are to be planted, this whole area could be covered over in a very short time.  I know of areas where trees are growing which are almost invisible now.  Does the Minister intend taking any steps to safeguard these areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator de Buitléar for his comments in relation to our acceptance of an amendment in the Dáil which, as I indicated at that stage, perhaps was not fundamentally necessary because the worry and fear with regard to safeguarding areas of scientific interest were already adequately covered.  To remove any shadow of doubt, I accepted an amendment in the Dáil and I thank the Senator for his comments in relation to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small sites of scientific interest which are attached to or in large forests are, on a continual basis, the subject of discussion with the Office of Public Works.  We <Col N="1667" /> would like, as we have done in the past, to encourage the greatest possible sensitivity and indeed the widest range of consultation with the Office of Public Works and interested groups to ensure that these resources are managed in the best possible way.  We have no interest in conflict in this area.  As I indicated earlier, many of these sites are unsuitable for afforestation.  We will be concentrating much more on the better, richer, more high yielding sites.  Where there is a problem of this nature we will deal with it in a very sensitive, open and flexible way.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.  I want to make it clear to Senators that the primary purpose of this section is to prevent the company from selling off large tracts of land to compensate for management deficiencies in conducting their business.  It is entirely reasonable that the Minister, on behalf of the citizens of the State who have invested large sums of money over the years in forestry, should have a role in preventing excessive land sales, together with the timber on the land, by the company. Here again is an instance where the absolute frankness of my officials and myself has been to our disadvantage.  I am quite certain that if we had not included the sale of land, an amendment would not have been put down but we have come up front and have said exactly what we intend to do.  We are doing this as a controlling measure but it also makes economic sense.</P>
    <P>I am at present negotiating the sale of a small patch of land, the value of which for forestry purposes is about £6,000 and for an alternative purpose is about £10,000.  In the interests of the taxpayers, the company and I should have the power to conduct a transaction of that kind. Opportunities like that will emerge again in the future.  The reason behind the provision is to prevent the company from putting forward a plan for the sale of land which would be excessive and from covering up for their own inadequacies. Overall, the House can be quite happy that it is a good safeguard.  In the Dáil The Workers' Party were worried that <Col N="1668" /> the actual mention of land in the context in which it is referred to, would oblige the company to sell land.  We have ascertained, after further consultation with the draftsman, that that would not be the position, that clearly the company could put forward a nil sales any year if they so wished and if that was the desirable course.  In other words, the Minister could not force the company to sell land.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer back to insurance companies.  I learned recently that insurance companies now hold 10.6 per cent of all deposits, a situation which has changed greatly from the beginning of the eighties.  The insurance companies seem to be more interested in mature type forests rather than coming in at the bottom.  Is the Minister saying that these powers would not be used to dispose of fairly mature timber to, say, an insurance company who have a majority State holding, which would be made up of moneys that would have been paid by ordinary people in this country into unit trusts?  If sizeable amounts of money could be made by selling off fairly mature timber and that money could be reinvested by the company to buy, for instance, the more fertile type land which the Minister mentioned when responding to Senator de Buitléar, is this excluded under this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly that kind of situation is not excluded.  This is a commercial company.  They will put forward their programme to the Minister on the basis of commercial criteria.  There may well be cases where the sale of semi-mature forests would be a consideration and I do not think we should limit the company in that regard.  Last year when we proposed to dispose of some semi-mature forests there was a lot of hullabaloo about it.  There were a number of reasons why that course of action was considered.  First and foremost, the sheer reliance on the taxpayer to fund forestry over the years has become quite a burden.  If the Forest Service could, through its own resources, increase its income by the sale of semi-mature lots, <Col N="1669" /> representing a tiny proportion of its total assets, and producing a satisfactory economic result, and these funds were used for extra development, the purchase of better land or whatever, that would be an eminently suitable, commercial, economic proposition for the Forest Service to be involved in.</P>
      <P>It also has a wider dimension which is very often not understood properly.  That is that there has been quite a reluctance over the years &mdash; that is changing now &mdash; on the part of the private sector to become involved.  Very often pension funds and investment companies were going abroad to buy the exact same properties. It is a pity that the pensions of Irish workers, which are being invested in investment companies or insurance companies, would be used to buy properties abroad instead of repatriating them and using them here at home.</P>
      <P>The third dimension is, of course, a much more positive one.  That is that the reluctance on the part of farmers to get involved in forestry is very often because of the slow and long wait for a return. If you could project an image, having developed a market, that there are opportunities abroad to dispose of these properties at an intermediate or younger stage, many people, particularly older farmers who could see themselves realising a profit within ten, 12 or 15 years, would go ahead and make that plantation. We are in the process of creating a new market and that will take time.  As I have said, we will make no sales unless we are satisfied that the price is right. That will apply to the new company but they will have the flexibility to get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, many of the sawmillers in Finland and other parts of Europe, in order to control a part of their raw material, are forced into the market to purchase semi-mature stands.  That is a good development.  Why should we always rely on the taxpayer, the Exchequer, to provide the resources for intensive afforestation? We are talking about increasing our land resources from 6 per cent which is a very low average compared to European standards.  We are not going to <Col N="1670" /> increase that figure to the European average while we are depending on the taxpayer, and we could not expect to do so. We have to create opportunities for the private sector to become involved as much as possible, but on an economic and commercial basis for the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister's expertise in this area.  It is refreshing, to say the least, to have somebody who obviously knows his brief and is operating it effectively.  We also welcome his frankness and openness although, as he has said, it has led to amendments being put down.  The whole purpose of amendments, even if we do not push them to votes, is that in the actual debating procedure, information that we solicit from the Minister in response to those amendments can be reassuring to the people whom we are trying to represent to the best of our ability.  The frankness of the Minister arises first of all from the fact that his group in the Seanad &mdash; Senator Kiely referred to this &mdash; showed a lack of ingenuity in acquiring land.  They rejected any attempt by the then Government to dispose of State forests to private banking and financial institutions.  The Minister was also against it then.  For that reason, we in the Labour Party put down a motion which is on today's Order Paper &mdash;&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to desist from offering for sale State-owned forestry lands&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a section in the Bill which suggests that the company would submit to the Minister a programme for the sale and acquisition of land.  We accept that by amending the wording in the other House the Minister has improved this section.  At least he has accepted that the company will submit to him a programme for buying and selling land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte has been absolutely specific in that we have no objection to the sale of any produce of this land, whether it is mature timber or any other kind of timber that has a commercial value and that can provide an income for the company. We always felt that the State was almost negligent in its selling process and the way it offered forests for tender.  It <Col N="1671" /> was often difficult for the people who wanted timber to be able to purchase it.</P>
    <P>We are now concerned that in the last 12 months a Minister who has gone as far as to offer for sale publicly land that was in public ownership under the Department of Forestry is now suggesting that the company could submit a plan to him for the continuation of that process.  We are concerned that, when the produce of a forest is coming to maturity and it may be in the long-term interest of the company to hold it for a further period in order to add to its value, the company could be prompted by the quick sale philosophy, that of getting money quickly, to offer forests for sale, whether to pension funds or to foreigners.  Foreigners have actually bought forest lands in County Tipperary.  Portions of the Galtee Mountains which were offered by a private owner and which were not bought by the Forest Service, were bought by an Englishman who then discovered that he could not work the land because the farmers had sheep on it for the last 200 years and he did not have vacant possession. He then packed up and went back to England.  That man had visions of owning a mountain and doing all sorts of wonderful things with it but he forgot that occupying tenant farmers had sheep on the land, except when the snow was on the Galtee Mountains.</P>
    <P>However we see no problem &mdash; this was spelled out by Senator Harte and Senator O'Shea &mdash; in respect to the sale of timber, standing or felled, or other produce from forest lands.  Our reservation is that this new company can submit a programme to the Minister to sell all their land for some reason.  Maybe the Minister is trying to be a little bit more careful in that he will now have to grant approval rather than just offer the land.  Perhaps he might, in the national interest, refrain from allowing this private company to sell all the assets which the State, the taxpayer and every PAYE worker has helped to establish.  This land might be of value to the State and an income to the Exchequer and we would not like any company, set up by the <Col N="1672" /> Houses of the Oireachtas, to dispose of it for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>I accept that the programme will have to come before the Minister for his approval but his performance in the past 12 months shows he has no objection to the selling of forest lands.  We have no objection to the sale of forest trees but our philosophy is that the land itself could be used for further forestry development. That has been the case with most forest land.  We want to ensure that because of the involvement of the public sector and the investments of a lot of capital into this area, it will not now be sold just because it is commercially viable to do so or because it may help to balance the books on a certain day.  I am a bit concerned about that.  We want to find out from the Minister how strict he is going to be in this regard and if all proposals that come before him will get his stamp of approval.  I hope that will not be the case and that he will seriously consider the programme.  As members of the Oireachtas, we should discuss this programme. That is the way forward.  The Minister is just being consistent in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the time to go back over the record to sort out a few motions that I remember coming into this House which would be very embarrassing to Senators on the Opposition.  If they put our motion in the context of what this Government have tried to do with regard to forestry since we were elected then they would be entirely happy that the worries which were expressed by the Fianna Fáil group at that time arose mainly because the sales as proposed were understood to be sucked directly into the Exchequer without any real promotion or extension of the forestry arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to more fundamentals and the points made by Senator Ferris in relation to the company selling willy-nilly or wanting to sell a very considerable part of their assets, that is the precise reason this provision is included.  I will not allow the company to dispose of land or timber because very often people confuse land as being the asset which is held by forestry <Col N="1673" /> and that is dangerous in the context of sales.  They fail to realise that you can sell premature timber for harvesting into pulpwood when by waiting a few extra years it would become small saw log or large saw log.</P>
    <P>The reason land and timber are mentioned is because the exact same problems arise with timber but are not so interpreted.  The provision, therefore, is very strong.  It will ensure that the company will not have the powers that Senator Ferris fears they will have.  If we had remained silent on this matter Senators would not be exposing this problem. They have rightly debated the matter and now they can be satisfied that that group of Senators have tried to do for forestry what certainly was not done previously.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much sympathise and to a great extent agree with the points that have been raised on the last amendment.  It is important that the new company should have the facility to dispose of property if they consider it is in their interest or in the national interest to do so.  I have had the greatest difficulty with the Department in the past in an effort to have them dispose of a small piece of land to individual tenant farmers. It took four, five or six years and two or three Ministers to have the Department sell 50 yards of timber to allow the sun to shine on a farmyard down in Stradbally in County Laois.  The Department of Forestry were outrageously thick and stupid about the whole matter.  I hope that the new company will not plant trees within 50 yards of a holding.  It sometimes happens that when an estate or a farm is acquired the boundary goes right up beside a farmyard or a home.  It is a great imposition and it is against natural justice for a semi-State organisation to deprive a family of sunshine.  In the winter time the frost never goes off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister if he is going <Col N="1674" /> to avail of this section to acquire the quarter of a million acres of cutover peat-land in the midlands &mdash; Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and parts of Kildare.  It is time we had a clear indication of the Government's policy on this matter.  The difficulty has arisen that Bord na Móna, in their compliance of the 1936 Act to take every bit of peat for sale that they could possible lay their machines on, have left a very shallow amount of peat over the marl.  A considerable acreage of those cutover bogs will not be able to support mature timber.  What are the Minister's plans for that area?  Is he going to endeavour to plant some of those large cutover areas for the production of Christmas trees which would not need a very deep soil or peat structure?  That is a matter that concerns me.</P>
    <P>The Minister present is the Minister of State at the Department of Energy.  Both Bord na Móna and the ESB have been the two significant industrial employers in the constituency of Laois-Offaly but Bord na Móna are now winding down. They are endeavouring to have the workers accept enhanced redundancy payments.  The ESB policy is to discontinue the inclusion of the peat power stations in their national grid.  That means that about 5,000 industrial jobs will be lost to the midlands.  I want to know what the Minister with responsibility for energy and the new semi-State organisation intend to do with that area?  Is it going to be used for intensive forestry and, if so, what type of forestry?  What consideration have the Department given to this rather vexed question?  It has been put on the long finger, and the problem is growing by the month.  I have known our colleague, the Minister of State, for a long time and I concede that there is no man better qualified to take a decision on this important and difficult subject. We have an opportunity now to write into the Bill the thoughts and the projections. There are thousands of farmers in the midland counties whose lands adjoin cutover bogs.  Some weeks ago we had right across the country Harmattan deposits which blew up from the Sahara Desert.  If the huge track of cutover bogs <Col N="1675" /> in the midlands are left untreated we will find that we are going to have our own Irish Harmattan of peat moss or dust blowing right across the country.  I hope I have not taken the Minister unawares, but I should like to ask him to give some indication of what the Government's plans are for this 250,000 acres of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reject out of hand the assertion that the officials in my Department are thick and stupid, even though that allegation emanated from the very learned and much travelled Senator from Laois-Offaly.  The position with regard to the acquisition or sale of lands was often times difficult but it was based on a fairly sound principle.  Senator McDonald, in all his travels, will be aware that very often the public saw the Government, or a Government arm, as being something which should either concede something for half nothing or always be in a position to accommodate.  If we were to try to get into that position and satisfy the demands of farmers and groups throughout the country with regard to what they wanted, we certainly could not organise a forestry policy.  Over time a fairly strict regime developed but we have softened that in recent times to meet more realistic trends and allowed advisable sales to take place to the public. We will continue down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bord na Móna policy, as the Senator knows, we acquired in 1987, following a Government decision, 1,000 hectares from Bord na Móna for afforestation purposes.  Those lands were acquired in Laois, Offaly, Galway and Donegal.  The decision of the Government was based on the experience of forestry, mainly in research carried out in Clonsast on the development of spruces on bogland, particularly bogland which had a residue of at least half a metre of turf.  I agree with the Senator that not all of the land that has been cut over by Bord na Móna contains that element and, therefore, not all of it is suitable for afforestation.  There are different views as to the percentages. <Col N="1676" /> Bord na Móna have about 80,000 hectares, or 250,000 acres, as the Senator says, and it is estimated that somewhere between 30 per cent and 50 to 60 per cent of that land could be suitable for forestry. It will take a lot of time and discussion between Bord na Móna and the Forest Service to establish the true position there.</P>
    <P>It will be many years before that land becomes available and, therefore, it would be impossible to take a decision in advance of the turf being cut by Bord na Móna.  I have undertaken to meet with the chief executive and the chairman.  I have visited Bord na Móna with a view to establishing a proper basis on which this land can be transferred to the Forest Service where it is suitable and we intend to continue on that road.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise to the Senator that considerable portions of that land will revert to wetland habitats and agriculture. There may, indeed, be new developments for it also.  It is not envisaged, as seemed to be indicated in the Senator's question, that the Forestry Service will be taking over all of the cutaway bog.  Considerable tracts of it are unsuitable for forestry and we are only interested in those tracts of land that are.  We will set up the mechanisms and establish the proper consultative processes so that the relationship between Bord na Móna and the Forest Service will be on a business like basis.  The problems facing both will be adequately considered. All in all, the programme, for the time being at least, is miniscule compared to the amount of land available to Bord na Móna, but that will not become available for some time.  In the meantime we will further research the proper utility and the maximum use for that land, bearing in mind the employment problems that are facing Laois-Offaly as those bogs are cut away.  Members will be aware that the Minister for Energy has set up a consultative group which will report to him before the end of the year on developments for Bord na Móna and setting out their programme for future years.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  I apologise if the Minister understood me to say that I was attributing the words I uttered to the personnel of his Department.  I am talking about the body corporate.  It is very hard to get through either the Department or the previous Department. It is not possible to say that, looking at the assistance the Minister has with him today.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, the Department and Bord na Móna have at their disposal 27 years of research into afforestation on cutover bogs.  It was meticulously carried out in Lullymore, which is adjacent to Clonsast.  The Department may have purchased 2,000 hectares but 5,000 acres have been idle for the last ten or 15 years in the Clonsast region alone.  I am talking about a package of 250,000 acres of land that should be dealt with.  It should be parcelled out to the farmers from whom it was acquired compulsorily at half-a-crown an acre.  It is nonsense to leave all this waste territory lying there.  We have absolutely no policy and we should have one.  I am very glad the Minister for Energy has a task force sitting on this because we need a policy to decide exactly what we are going to do.  I look forward to a report of the task force being made available to the House.</P>

    <P>If we look at the section, between lines 38 and 39, we will see we are talking about the numbers of directors who will be involved in the company.  In our amendment we are suggesting that the number should be changed to at least 12 <Col N="1678" /> to give the Minister, and indeed the new company, the opportunity of having the kind of expertise available to it that we feel it needs.  We are suggesting a figure the Minister might consider as being more appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendments. Section 15 is causing problems for us, because obviously it deals with the articles of association.  We notice that the Minister has not made provision for worker directors on the board.  This is disconcerting to us in the light of the publication of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill.  I do not know whether it has gone through the other House.  In that Bill the Minister for Labour has made arrangements for An Post and Bord Telecom.  He has also dealt with the question of worker directors in Bord na Móna.  The Bill we are dealing with is, to some extent, related in one way or another.  The need to extend the concept should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Labour.  We hope the Minister will do that when the Bill is going through the House.</P>
      <P>The concept of worker participation is a very interesting one.  We are always worried about the number of man-days lost through strikes as we are always worried about industrial relations <i>vis-a-vis</i> other member states.  Yet, when we get an opportunity to set up the machinery to allow us to do that, to take the bull by the horns and appoint worker directors to all State commercial companies we do not take it.  The Minister will agree that what is important beyond all other considerations is the attitude of the parties in industry.  We have to decide if we want harmony.  We do not want antagonism or hostility.  Very often, because people are not in a position to get the right information or to be briefed in a proper way, a lot of unnecessary conflict arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the interests of all that there should be an extension of this concept to this board.  I do not think it matters what policies or methods a Government follow in regard to production.  It does not matter how well founded are their economic policies or social developments. <Col N="1679" /> They will be insecure if the relationship between the parties in industry are not satisfactory.  The best way to remove fear and to have faith, if we are talking about involving workers is to have their representatives at the highest level possible so that they can get first-hand information and make a contribution based on their knowledge of the position on the factory floor.  There may be an absence of expertise from the floor and is essential that the views of workers are heard.</P>
    <P>All industrial relations are interwoven with community activities.  Therefore, it is important that other members of the community from another walk of life should be appointed to this board to join the people appointed by the Minister. When it comes down to the question of attitudes, the whole matter of adjustment is involved.  If there are workers' representatives at board level, then the whole question of adjustment can become that bit more realistic.  The trade unions will have to agree to the procedures but the important point is the question of the attitudes of the board members to each other following the inclusion of workers' representatives at the highest possible level.  They will bring their own expertise to the board and will get the proper information and transmit it accurately.</P>
    <P>Down the years there has been talk about co-ordination of functions with regard to the question of workers or management boards.  If we keep workers separated from this level of representation it will affect co-operation later.  What we are seeking is co-operation by the parties to industry.  It is nothing more than what human intelligence can stand to say that the worker should be represented at sub-board level.  In this day and age when we have much more enlightened workers on the factory floor than ever before they should not get representation at that level.  Since they are part of the community it is only common justice that they should get this representation at board level.  The machinery is in position.  I do not know if the Bill has gone through the Dáil but, certainly, it was passed by the <Col N="1680" /> Seanad.  I cannot see why there would be any opposition to it.</P>
    <P>A lot of complex problems will develop.  Where human effort is involved many complicated problems can develop. As industry develops many complex problems arise.  It is because such difficulties can arise that there should be co-operation and co-ordination of effort. Inevitably, there is a danger that such a process will fail and that the production will be inhibited or confused.  It is a matter that should be given serious consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a question of a social service. The people appointed to the board, or who find themselves on the board through means other than the worker participation scheme should realise that they are there to perform a social service. I admit that it is a social service of the highest order.  I will be the first to say that the people appointed will be quite capable people, the best that can be got. There is no doubt about that.  In the long run, no matter who they are, no matter what degrees they hold, or that type of scientific methods they pursue to advance their careers, the fellow who has gone through the school of life on the factory floor, who mingles with his workmates at different levels, is the guy who will be able to pass on the proper information to the board members.  He can, in fact, bring about greater co-operation and greater effort.  We are in the business of trying to make a success of this.  I do not think that the organisation in itself is a guarantee of success.  It has got to have the right people to help it succeed.  If there are representatives of the workers on the board I have a feeling they will make a good contribution.  It is wrong not to have the concept of worker directors embodied in this Bill.  We cannot hope for success simply by establishing the new company. We have got to work at it.  Workers have to be asked to play their role and so on. Unless the proper attitude is adopted by all parties the right results will not be obtained.</P>
    <P>We have an expert on industrial relations with us, a Senator who has written on the topic.  I am referring to Senator <Col N="1681" /> Hillery.  If Senator Hillery, or anyone else, considered the question of worker directors, would he take time to think about the concept that is in existence in Telecom Éireann, Bord na Móna and so on?  He would have to say that the whole idea should develop in that direction.  If it does develop in that direction we will have a better opportunity to get the mutual confidence and constructive goodwill that is needed.  I hope that the Minister can come to terms with the question of appointing worker directors.  I have no doubt that all aspects of industry must have this co-operation and co-ordination. The best way of getting the interweaving of human relations going is to give everyone equal representation at the right levels.  The case has been made over the past 20 years or so that the appointment of worker directors is the way.  We have had the Act dealing with worker participation in State enterprise and we have had the Minister appointing sub-boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  We want, if at all possible, as is mentioned in amendment No. 5, a procedure to be followed about the appointment of worker directors. There is no provision in the Bill for worker directors in this new company. We have two ways of addressing the problem. We either agree to this amendment which will make it obligatory on the company to appoint worker directors as has been done in other companies set up by the State, or we should ask the Minister to request the Minister for Labour to designate this company in accordance with the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only other way forward. Either we accept the amendment or the Minister should designate the company to the Minister for Labour who gave us a commitment when debating that legislation that we could designate companies at that time or wait until they were formed.  Unfortunately, we fell into that trap in regard to Teagasc.  We were given a commitment by the Minister for Labour but the Minister's colleague from North Tipperary, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, refused to accept an amendment to include them in the legislation. We are now being very cautious about legislation that sets up companies like this if the Minister does not follow through the process or the philosophy <Col N="1683" /> espoused by Senator Harte.  In any company which has a board or a sub-board structure workers play, can play and have played a major role in the development of that company.  That is what we mean in the two amendments.  Will the Minister respond positively to the two suggestions and ignore Senator Kiely's remark about numbers.  I do not think it was relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the concept of worker participation and participative structures.  Employees are key stake-holders in companies.  Echoing what Senator Harte has said, they have a lot of information and expertise which should be employed for the betterment of companies.  Senator Harte mentioned that board membership was probably the place to start.  I do not necessarily share that view, while I strongly favour the concept of worker participation.  If one goes back to the 1977 Act one will see that worker directors were provided to give a legislative impetus to worker participation structures.  That was 11 years ago and a lot of progress has been made since.  As I recall it, the Minister for Labour of the day was concerned that so little was happening in terms of participation that it was necessary to start somewhere on the legislative side. Having said that, it has become very evident through the experience of the last 11 years that one of the real deficiencies of the worker starting at the top is that the infrastructure or sub-board structures have been inadequate to support starting at board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly favour, therefore, the development of participative methods, first below board level, jointly between employee representatives and management so that they can work out, as they can do under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, participative structures jointly suited to the individual company concerned and, therefore, have the flexibility that goes with that.  While obviously favouring the concept of board membership it is preferable, especially in the case of a new body like this, to start below board level <Col N="1684" /> and to jointly work out participative structures suited to the individual needs of this company.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Bill, which I have brought before this House today, has been discussed in some detail in the Dáil and I am glad to say that it received the wholehearted support of all parties in that House.  The Deputies agreed that the Bill represented a vital and progressive piece of health legislation which was necessary to address one of the major preventable causes of ill health which was affecting this country.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a specific legislative initiative designed to tackle the problem of tobacco smoking.  It is designed to complement the legislative controls on the tobacco industry which were introduced by the Taoiseach in the 1978 Tobacco Products Act by providing the necessary statutory framework for the control of smoking in public places and the restriction on the sale of cigarettes to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of tobacco consumption is necessitated by the continued evidence of an ongoing epidemic of illness and premature death in this and other western countries as a result of widespread tobacco smoking over the last 40 years. The overall objective of the Bill which I have brought before the House today is to reduce the toll of preventable smoking-related illnesses by further encouraging a decrease in the consumption of tobacco products.  My growing concern for the health risks of passive smoking by non-smokers is also reflected in the provisions of the Bill.  While I am aware that most people have now become conscious of <Col N="1685" /> the serious health risks that result from tobacco smoking, I feel that the House should be fully aware of the extent of these problems and of their impact in this country.</P>
    <P>Smoking became very common in the western world after the Second World War and it was not until the fifties that the medical profession began to discover the links between smoking and lung cancer.  A vast collection of medical evidence on the variety of serious diseases associated with tobacco smoking has accumulated over the last 30 years and the medical world is now united in its indictment of tobacco smoking as a major cause of ill health.</P>
    <P>It is now accepted that smoking is associated with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, cancer of the bronchus, the lung, the trachea, the mouth, the throat, the pancreas, the bladder and the kidney.  In the face of this conclusive medical indictment of traditional tobacco products, the majority of countries in the developed world have been grappling with the problems of how to reduce the consumption of these widely used and very addictive products.</P>
    <P>Smoking-related illnesses result in high levels of morbidity and mortality in Ireland every year.  There are over 16,000 deaths each year from smoking-related illnesses in this country and it is estimated that as many as 5,000 of these deaths are directly due to smoking.  The annual figures are more striking when expressed on a weekly basis.  They indicate that as many as 100 Irish people each week are experiencing premature and often painful deaths, directly as a result of tobacco smoking.  Many of these people are middle aged, a fact reflected in the statistics which show that 52 per cent of all deaths of those aged 35-64 years in 1982 resulted from smoking-related illnesses. The extent of preventable illness from tobacco smoking is now such that no Minister for Health could fail to take appropriate action to reduce the consumption of these injurious products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> The level of preventable illness resulting from tobacco smoking is such that it also places an enormous strain on the health services.  Smoking-related illnesses account for almost 480,000 days spent in hospital each year and it is estimated that the yearly hospital costs associated with these smoking-related illnesses are in excess of £50 million.</P>
    <P>To these costs must be added the costs of out-patient services, general medical services, disability payments and days lost at work.  Together these costs are likely to impact on the Exchequer at least as heavily as the hospital costs.  Finally, the costs associated with the pain and suffering experienced by so many families as a result of these high levels of preventable illnesses are incalculable.</P>
    <P>The problem of reducing tobacco consumption is a complex one, and the Government have considered all aspects of the issue.  On balance, they decided that the public health considerations are of such magnitude that they far outweigh the marginal economic impacts which a gradual reduction in tobacco consumption over a number of years will effect.</P>
    <P>The evidence in relation to the injurious impact of smoking on smokers has been supplemented in recent years by growing medical evidence that smoking also impacts on non-smokers through breathing in air which contains other people's smoke.  This phenomenon is now known as passive smoking and it raises significant public health issues with regard to the protection of the health of non-smokers.</P>
    <P>The inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke was, until the late seventies, simply regarded as an unpleasant social nuisance.  Medical research has now shown that it poses significant public health risks.  Passive smokers breathe in the smoke that comes from the end of the burning cigarette as well as the smoke exhaled by the smoker.  Research has now shown that the unfiltered smoke of the smouldering cigarette is more dangerous than that inhaled by the smoker.  People with bronchitis, emphysema, asthma and chronic lung disease are now all known <Col N="1687" /> to be adversely affected when forced to remain in smoking atmospheres.  Also people suffering from certain forms of heart disease are vulnerable when forced to breathe in a smokey atmosphere and people with angina suffer attacks more readily when exposed to tobacco smoke.</P>
    <P>The most worrying finding to date in relation to passive smoking is that there is emerging evidence that there is an increased risk of lung cancer for non-smokers who are exposed to passive smoking for many years.  The weight of available evidence indicates that about a quarter of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers in general may result from passive smoking.</P>
    <P>Growing awareness of the health risks of smoking have now reduced it to being a minority habit in this country.  Two-thirds of the Irish adult population choose not to smoke.  However, it is not easy to stop smoking once you have become addicted.  Research has shown that almost half of smokers cannot break their addiction despite having negative attitudes to smoking and being aware of its harmful effects.  Seventy five per cent of smokers interviewed have indicated that they would like to smoke less and over half of all current smokers expressed a moderate to strong wish to give up smoking. The research, therefore, shows that the majority of smokers want to cut down or give up but find it hard to kick this highly addictive habit.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in this Bill, which are designed to encourage non-smoking, therefore represent the wishes of the majority of smokers and non-smokers.  The research shows that most smokers and non-smokers are anti-smoking. The tobacco industry and the pro-smoking vested interests have no factual basis when they present themselves as the protectors of the rights and wishes of the smoking population.  The findings show that over half of all smokers have indicated a desire to overcome their addiction.</P>
    <P>In addition to their overall desire to give up smoking, it has been indicated in recent research that 56 per cent of Irish <Col N="1688" /> smokers &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; that smoking should be confined to special smoking areas.  The provisions of this Bill which are intended to restrict smoking in public places are therefore a reflection of the majority wish of smokers as well as non-smokers and there is no majority of public opinion to support the argument that smokers should be free to smoke everywhere.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are also in line with international developments, both within and outside the European Community.  The European Community has as part of its overall &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer&rdquo; programme, targeted the reduction of tobacco consumption as the main priority in reducing the high levels of morbidity and mortality from cancer in the Community.  This programme was discussed by a European Council of Health Ministers which I attended in May of this year.  The majority of member states expressed strong support for a number of specific initiatives designed to reduce tobacco consumption within the Community.</P>
    <P>As part of the &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer&rdquo; programme the European Commission will be submitting to the Council by the end of this year a proposal for the control of tobacco smoking in public places.  In addition, the European Parliament, on 11 February of this year, adopted a resolution which welcomed the measures taken by various member states to introduce a ban on smoking in public places and called on other countries to follow suit with a view to the complete prohibition of smoking, both in public buildings and in enclosed spaces which are open to the public.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 2 of this Bill are, therefore, fully in line with developments within the European Community and internationally.  By 1982, 31 countries had enacted legislation restricting smoking in public places.  This number has increased continually since then.</P>
    <P>Within this country, public opinion has in recent years encouraged greater restrictions on smoking in public places. The DART train services and Dublin bus services have both introduced voluntary <Col N="1689" /> prohibitions on smoking and the success of these initiatives has shown that control on public smoking are both highly popular and well respected by the general public.  While these voluntary initiatives have been most encouraging, there is a limit to voluntary action in this area and the statutory provisions contained in this Bill will give the necessary support to owners and managers who are anxious to restrict smoking on their premises.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, the Government have taken a number of initiatives to ensure that health promotion is given a central position in health policy and the health services.  I have established a health promotion unit within my Department and an overall advisory council on health promotion made up of a broad representation of experts in appropriate sectors.  The increased emphasis which I have placed on health promotion is an attempt to create, through public policy, an environment which is protection of, and conducive to, healthy living.</P>
    <P>The Bill which I have brought before the House today is a classic piece of health promotion legislation in that it will, when enacted, make the healthy choice the easy choice for the smoker while simultaneously improving the quality of the environment for the non-smoker. I believe that it is this type of initiative which will become increasingly necessary if we are to reduce the enormous burden of preventable illness in this country and switch the emphasis of health policy away from expensive acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted is an enabling piece of legislation which gives the Minister for Health power to make regulations to prohibit or restrict smoking in a variety of public places.  The places which are designated in the Bill are those in which there is a high level of public support for smoking control.  They are all enclosed public places which smokers and non-smokers are forced to share.  The discretionary power to prohibit or restrict smoking will allow me to consider the nature of the areas concerned and the duration of stay in them, before drafting <Col N="1690" /> my specific controls.  In view of the growing evidence of the health risks of passive smoking, it is imperative that the Minister for Health should retain the power to prohibit smoking totally in any area where he feels the public health risks are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the Committee Stage debate on these provisions in the Dáil a number of Deputies asked that I outline the specific areas in which I intended to control smoking. Sections 2 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) highlight the specific public areas which I would regard as priority areas for the enactment of these controls.  However, it is not possible to indicate the extent to which restriction or prohibitions will be introduced in specific areas at this stage and I will consult with all interested parties before drawing up the detailed regulations.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill the owner, manager or person in charge of the public places in question has the primary responsibility for enforcing the controls on smoking.  In the event that individual smokers fail to comply with the restrictions they can be fined a sum not exceeding £100.  However, I would expect, on the basis of existing controls on smoking that there will not be any great difficulty in getting public co-operation with regard to these controls.  In the event that prosecutions are necessary regarding the enforcement of these controls, I have made it an express provision of the Bill that it will be a defence for the owner or manager of the public place to show that they have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the prohibitions or restrictions were enforced.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach that will ensure that these important public health provisions are adequately enforced.</P>
    <P>As well as the provisions of the Bill in relation to smoking in public places, I have included a number of other provisions which are necessary to update the law in relation to tobacco and particularly in relation to its sale to young people. Under section 3 of the Bill I have updated the law on the sale of cigarettes to children. At present, it is an offence to sell cigarettes to persons under 16, under the <Col N="1691" /> Children Act, 1908.  However, the provisions of that Act, allowing for a maximum fine of £2 are well out of date. Research has shown that smoking among schoolchildren is a significant problem.</P>
    <P>One study of Irish adolescents between 11 and 13 years of age found that 49 per cent experimented with smoking.  The earlier a person begins smoking the greater the damage to health.  The evidence indicates that if people had not started smoking in their adolescent and teenage years they are very unlikely to begin in adult life.  I believe that we must now take a strong stand against teenage smoking and provisions in section 3 are designed to significantly reduce the access of young people to these injurious products.  The provisions of section 6 which I will be referring to later are also primarily intended to discourage tobacco consumption among younger people.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 any person who sells or makes available tobacco products to children in relation to the sale of any other product, will be liable to a fine not exceeding £500.  This section is designed to ensure that tobacco products cannot be supplied to children in any form of commercial transaction.  As young people often purchase cigarettes from automatic vending machines, section 3 (2) of the Bill is drafted to ensure that these machines are properly supervised. This is a common international response to this problem.  In Canada, a legal duty is imposed on the person in charge of a vending machine to make sure it is not used by children.  Similarly, in Finland the sale of tobacco products from vending machines is permitted only where the machine is under supervision.  Cyprus has banned vending machines altogether.  I am sure that Senators will agree that it is only reasonable that the people in charge of vending machines make sure that they are not used by children as an easy way of obtaining cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill also deals with restricting the access of children to cigarettes. Under the Old Maximum Prices Orders for cigarettes it was illegal to sell cigarettes singly.  However, the previous <Col N="1692" /> Government removed this provision when they abolished the relevant Maximum Prices Order.  My Department consistently receive complaints about unscrupulous shopkeepers who break packages of cigarettes and sell them singly.  Single cigarettes are a particular attraction to children with limited money and a desire to experiment with cigarettes. The provisions of section 4 of the Bill will outlaw this undesirable practice and together with the other provisions of the Bill should go some way towards reducing teenage smoking.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill gives to the Minister for Health the power to determine what additives are used in tobacco products and to prohibit specific additives which he thinks are particularly injurious to health.  At present, a voluntary agreement exists between my Department and the Irish tobacco manufacturers which achieves the objectives of section 5 of the Bill.  However, this agreement does not extend to importers of tobacco products and the statutory provisions set out in section 5 will ensure that the Minister can treat imported and Irish manufactured products similarly.  With a general movement by both smokers and the tobacco industry towards low tar cigarettes and the general development of tobacco technology, an ever growing list of additives and tobacco substitutes are being used in tobacco products.  It is imperative that the Minister for Health should have statutory power to control these additives in the interest of public health.  Just as statutory powers exist in relation to the use of additives in foodstuffs, it is necessary that the use of additives in tobacco products should also be controlled.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with the ever growing range of products know as oral smokeless tobacco products.  These are a range of tobacco products largely developed in the USA and Scandinavia which are designed to be used by being placed in the mouth and sucked or chewed.  These products contain high levels of nicotine and this is absorbed through the mouth.  They are highly addictive and are often marketed at people who wish to give up smoking but who <Col N="1693" /> cannot break their addiction.  The section is thus preventative in this context and further strengthens our controls over under-age smoking contained in section 3.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of these oral smokeless tobacco products have been developed and promoted in North America, Scandinavia and more recently within the European Community.  These products are being promoted to young people as an alternative way to enjoy tobacco and it is estimated by the World Health Organisation that about 10 million people, most of them teenagers, in the United States of America are now using these products.</P>
    <P>These products cause serious health problems.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, has determined that there is sufficient evidence that these products cause oral cancer. The use of these products also causes serious dental damage.  Continual use can cause white patches, known as leukoplakia, to appear on the gums.  Some of these white patches may subsequently become cancerous.  The use of these products can also cause dental damage due to a receding of the gums where the tobacco regularly comes in contact with the mouth.  In June 1987 a World Health Organisation Study Group on smokeless tobacco control recommended a &ldquo;preemptive&rdquo; total ban on the importation, production and sale of all types of smokeless tobacco.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I am deeply concerned at the potential availability in this country of the type of chewing tobaccos which are being promoted in other countries at young people as safe alternatives to smoking.  The scientific and medical evidence relating to the range of oral smokeless tobaccos, including chewing tobaccos, is such that it would be remiss of me as Minister for Health not to provide comprehensive legislation protecting the public against these products. A number of other countries where these products were recently introduced have taken similar action to protect public health.  The use of certain forms of <Col N="1694" /> smokeless tobacco has been prohibited in Hong Kong, Israel and New Zealand. The UK Government have now announced their intention to ban certain smokeless tobacco products under their Consumer Protection Act.  The Federal Government in Australia have also announced a similar intention.</P>
    <P>In 1985, when it was first proposed to import some of the new smokeless tobacco products into this country, the then Minister for Health made an order prohibiting their importation under the Health Act, 1947.  This order was subsequently challenged in the High Court and in a judgment delivered in September 1987, Mr. Justice Hamilton found the order to be <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister under the Health Act, 1947.  The public health basis for the Order was not an issue in the judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill currently before the House is intended to restore the effect and intention of the previous Order and to ensure that no other smokeless tobacco products can be promoted in this country. To allow forms of nicotine addiction which are not yet established in the country to be promoted, particularly to our young people, would be irresponsible of me as Minister for Health.  To allow new products and products not widely used, which are known carcinogens, to be marketed would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>While this provision received cross party support in the Dáil a number of Deputies sought to have the existing brand of domestically produced chewing tobacco exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  However, I indicated that the exemption of any specific oral smokeless tobacco could not be justifed on health grounds and an exemption of a specific class of an oral smokeless product would leave the legislation wide open for exploitation. Given the current developments by the tobacco industry internationally of new forms of tobacco consumption I have no doubt that any gaps in the law would encourage the development and promotion of the products exempted.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a more technical and routine nature, providing for the enforcement of <Col N="1695" /> the Bill.  Section 9 of the Bill is included to amend the procedures whereby summary proceedings may be brought under the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978.  The revised section will make it easier to take summary proceedings under that Act.  Sections 10, 12 and 13 are standard provisions and section 11 simply repeals the relevant sections of the Children Act, 1908, which will be replaced by section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would reiterate that I am bringing this smoking control legislation before the House as a major piece of public health legislation.  The smoking controls proposed in the Bill are designed to minimise the risks of passive or involuntary smoking and to provide a healthier smoke-free environment.</P>
    <P>They will also help to deter young people from smoking by conveying the idea that non-smoking is the normal majority behaviour.  They will provide support to the majority of smokers who wish to give up smoking and who want smoking to be confined to special smoking areas.  The provisions of the Bill will introduce a type of smoking control which has broad public support among smokers and non-smokers alike.</P>
    <P>This broad public support was well reflected in the general welcome which all parties gave to the Bill in the Dáil. Indeed the debate in that House was most constructive and supportive.  I look forward to similar broad based support for the Bill in this House and commend the Bill to you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome this Bill to the Seanad and I assure you that it will get the same broad and constructive response that it got in the other House.  Its aim is to reduce the number of smokers in our society and to eliminate so far as possible the health risks to which non-smokers and smokers are subjected.  It is a commendable primary prevention move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be a useful tool to encourage healthier habits and a cleaner environment for all.  In the past 30 years we <Col N="1696" /> have learned a great deal about the effects of smoking, drinking and indeed of the illeffects on our health of taking tea and coffee.  Nowadays anyone who smokes must know full well that they are damaging their health and very likely bringing forward the date of their deaths. It is an awesome thought and as a life time non-smoker I am baffled at how smokers can continually rationalise this to themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Second Stage speech gives us very good background statistics and creates, so far as I am concerned, a terrific back-drop for the measures he is taking and justifies them.  We learn that deaths from smoking related illnesses accounted for 52 per cent of all deaths between the ages of 35 and 60 in 1982, we learn that smoking is associated with a very broad range of diseases from coronary artery disease to cancers in the mouth, trachea, throat, pancreas, bladder and kidney.  We learn that smoking is the single most important cause of death in middle age.  Each year about 480,000 days are spent in hospital as a result of smoking related illnesses and the cost of this hospitalisation is in excess of £50 million.</P>
    <P>Smoking, therefore, has vast negative effects.  Section 2 spells out fairly clearly the places likely to be the subject of the prohibition subsequent on this legislation. They include theatres, cinemas, concert halls as well as public transport. As there are already some restrictions in these places I think it should cause no great problem to extend them even further. It was interesting to note that 56 per cent of Irish smokers agree that smoking should be confined in public places and I am quite sure that non-smokers &mdash; and they represent two third of the Irish adult population &mdash; would all wish to have a total ban on smoking.  This wish is not motivated by anything other than self preservation.</P>
    <P>We know, as the Minister has again said, that non-smokers can become ill through breathing in air which contains other people's smoke.  This passive smoking is damaging.  Indeed we, the non-smokers, breathe in unfiltered smoke <Col N="1697" /> which comes from the end of a lit cigarette without the filter barrier and it is more dangerous than that which is inhaled by the smoker.  Evidence shows that about a third of the cases of lung cancer in non smokers who live with smokers is attributable to passive smoking.  It seems to me that more young people from 13 upwards are smoking than there were years ago.  In my youth smoking by young people was severely criticised by our elders.  In fact it was a taboo habit. They forbade it because it was improper and infringed the code of conduct at that time.  This attitude by adults has changed but it was an attitude that warned off young people.  They were afraid of the sanctions that would be imposed if they were caught smoking.  That code of conduct has changed in more recent years with the more liberal concept that young people should make the choices for their behaviour with all the facts and information available to them.  Unfortunately, I think the health factor will not be a strong deterrent to these young people. A much more potent deterrent will be when smoking becomes thoroughly antisocial. It is moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>In any gathering or group nowadays smokers are a very small minority.  They can feel very ostracised by their lack of numbers and, indeed, it encourages them to abstain temporarily from smoking. What happened in Australia in their anti-smoking campaign is interesting.  Every public place is subject to a prohibition order.  If anybody breaks it they are fined. There are no arguments, no excuses or appeals.  The penalty is applied.  My son who is a smoker was there on holiday this year.  He said that when he adapted to the Australian situation he realised that almost the only place he could smoke without such guilt was in the lavatory.  He maintains that the almost total ban on smoking made him think very seriously about it and took away normal enjoyment sensations.  He realised fully that he was smoking only to feed his habit.  When he returned to Ireland he gave up cigarettes and battled on for two weeks without them.  He was so disorientated and so distressed from withdrawal symptoms I <Col N="1698" /> am afraid he had to take them up again because he is studying very intensely and it did not help his concentration.  He is now a reluctant smoker and like many others he loathes the habit and resents the fact that he cannot give them up.</P>
    <P>This is an area that needs much more thought and action to help chronic smokers to kick the habit.  The Department of Health should give a lead and initiate programmes based on the best possible international evidence of success.  The campaign against smoking has to be two-pronged, first, to prevent new smokers &mdash; and here we are almost exclusively focussing on young people &mdash; and secondly, to wean smokers off the habit. Prohibiting the chewing of tobacco is going to cut off one source of therapy used by a lot of people who want to give up smoking.  We need to begin to think in terms of getting programmes under way, using advertising and every form possible to try to help people who are trying to give up smoking.  We now have good cause to again regret the abolition of the Health Education Bureau.  In all their operations they were nowhere as successful as they were in their anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the new health promotion unit in your Department is active and involved.  I am afraid there is no visibility of that.  We neither hear nor see anything of them.  It is very regrettable that the high public awareness created by the &ldquo;knot&rdquo; programme has been lost.  I feel it is vitally important to be consistent in such campaigns.  Cigarette advertising is, I feel, still seductive. Anti-smoking advertisements are needed to counter their effects.  It should have a high priority.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would pose the question: how do we get more people in leadership or decision making roles to abstain in public or give up smoking altogether?  Doctors in huge numbers are one profession that toed the anti-smoking line as soon as evidence of health risk emerged.  Sports people are another group.  I know that this is very effective.  If a sports champion or an achiever says, directly or even indirectly, that he does not recommend <Col N="1699" /> smoking and that he would advise people not to smoke if they want to achieve in sport, this is hugely effective and influences young people.  Teachers have a very important role.  Can some incentive be given to encourage teachers to give up smoking or, alternatively, can smoking be banned in all schools and college premises?  I particularly condemn those schools which have so called smoking rooms in them.  I would see this as giving a clear message to young people that, &ldquo;it is all right to smoke so long as you are doing it in this particular space, room or building&rdquo;.  There should be no such thing as smoking rooms.  Smoking should be outlawed in schools.  Every effort should be made to make schools and colleges smoke free zones.  I wonder if, when the Minister is replying, he would indicate if this is his line of thinking, whether he is going to make colleges smoke free and ban smoking during the school day.</P>
    <P>Finally, this is a very good measure.  It is long overdue and I trust that it will be properly implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  The Bill deals with one of the great public health problems of our time.  Medical evidence has proved beyond doubt that smoking is causing serious health problems.  Statistics prove that over 100 people die each week in Ireland from smoking-related illnesses. Between the ages of 35 and 64, 52 per cent of deaths are caused by smoking-related illnesses.  The cost in financial terms to the Exchequer is in excess of £50 million.  This is not to mention the hardship and sufferings caused to many individuals and families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is particularly welcome and does not only deal with direct smoking but with passive smoking.  Passive smoking is now an area of major concern to the general public.  Many people are extremely worried about the implications of people smoking in their company.  Dr. Risteárd Mulcahy, one of the most respected cardiologists in this country, has stated &ldquo;that smoking is the single <Col N="1700" /> greatest evil affecting the Irish people. When we think of the problems we have in this country such as unemployment, the Northern situation, the national debt and when we see a man like Dr. Mulcahy saying that this is one of the greatest problems that this country faces, it surely brings home to us that something has to be done in this area.  I would like to see a ban imposed on smoking in all public places &mdash; in pubs, restaurants and on public transport.  Results collected from the surgeon general in the US prove beyond doubt that smoking is now associated with lung cancer, cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the bladder, bronchitis and spontaneous abortion.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with supervision of automatic vending machines. The owner of a machine for the sale of tobacco who permits the machine to be used by persons under the age of 16, shall be guilty of an offence.  I welcome this provision but it may be very difficult to enforce.  Section 4 of the Bill deals with persons who illegally sell cigarettes singly.  Many of us started smoking because of the availability of single cigarettes. The removal of this provision by the previous Government brought many complaints from parents and constituents to politicians.  It is very wrong that youngsters should have access to single cigarettes which makes it so easy for them to develop this terrible habit of smoking. Section 6 of the Bill deals with the ever-growing range of products known as oral smokers tobacco products.  These tobacco products are used by being placed in the mouth and chewed and they are highly addictive.  I believe that they are even a greater danger to people than smoking cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Many people are concerned about pollution in the atmosphere.  Many people are concerned today about people smoking in public places.  Let me ask the Minister to consider extending the ban to all public places.  The degree of cancer from smoking is certainly related to tar content. Let me ask the Minister to consider making a provision in the legislation to compel cigarette companies to reduce the tar content in cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> In conclusion I would like to compliment the Minister again and wish this Bill a speedy and effective passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to welcome the Bill.  A few weeks ago in the House we dealt with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  On that occasion I spoke as an expert on the subject having devoted, and continue to devote, quite a large amount of my time and leisure to the consumption of spirituous liquors.  I speak also as an expert on this matter; unfortunately, I have acquired an expertise that enables me to talk with some authority about smoking.</P>
      <P>I belong to a generation for whom smoking was almost inevitable, it being regarded as the grown-up and smart thing to do.  I smoked continuously from the age of 16 or 17 until eight years ago when I succeeded, after an heroic struggle, in quitting tobacco smoking immediately.  I take credit in this case.  Senator Fennell is perfectly right.  It is enormously and indescribably difficult to give up cigarette smoking.  In fact, I was consoled by reading somewhere that the psychological and physical hurdles to be overcome in giving up cigarette smoking are no less than in kicking a hard drug addiction.  That is the dimension of the problem.</P>
      <P>I count myself fortunate that I have been able to kick the habit.  I am fortuante that I seem to have escaped the major consequences of long years of addiction and even more fortunate that I can now enjoy the delights of country walking. Indeed, last weekend I tramped the length and breadth of Oileán Cléire.  I would not have experienced that exhilaration, I am quite convinced, if I continued to smoke cigarettes.  If I had continued to smoke cigarettes I would not be here today.  For that some of my colleagues would be profoundly grateful, but that is another story.  I may confess that I still hanker after the odd cigarette: it is an addiction which you never quite get rid of.  Therefore, I speak from experience.  I can exhort smokers that it is possible and that there is a life after cigarette smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> To some extent I speak with the fanaticism of a convert and certainly with that peculiar revulsion which the ex-smoker feels in an atmosphere of cigarette smoking. It is one of the peculiarities that those who have never smoked cigarettes do not find a smokey atmosphere quite as objectionable as those who have smoked cigarettes and have given them up.  Even if I were still smoking cigarettes I would be totally in favour of this Bill.  The Minister is right.  I am sure the statistics are right, that smokers as well as non-smokers are in favour of the principles underlying this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our smoking is part of a temperament which has a low awareness of the environment, which is very strong on individual rights, which is even part of a communal generosity and fraternity.  I have been offered cigarettes late at night by total strangers on the strength of our common nationality: &ldquo;here take one, aren't we all Irish&rdquo;.  It is a communal habit.  It is also great company.  We must not underrate the attractiveness of tobacco and cigarette smoking.  We have a very large task on our hands here.</P>
    <P>The lack of awareness of the environment, pollution, and so on, are part of our temperament.  The reluctance we have in public in confronting unpleasant situations is more of our national temperament. It has good sides and bad sides.  In other countries people have no hesitation whatsoever in confronting someone who is violating a law against smoking in a public place.  Other Senators and the Minister have spelled out the dimensions of the scourge.  I do not want to go over that ground again, except to say that perhaps there are even more dramatic ways of putting it.</P>
    <P>The most recent issue of a journal called <i>World Health and Smoking</i> puts the hazards of cigarette smoking in the following quite startling ways.  For example, it cites the fact that 1,000 people per day died from the consequences of tobacco smoking.  That is the same as if two Jumbo planes carrying 500 passengers each collided in mid-air and there were 1,000 fatalities every single day.  It has that dramatic dimension. <Col N="1703" /> Death from tobacco-related diseases outnumbers all other causes of death from the following sources: road accidents, heroin, cocaine, fires, suicides and AIDS.  A mother who smokes exposes her small baby to much greater risks than if she did not smoke, not simply from the normal passive smoking risks but the risk of cot death, that most tragic hazard of young infant life, is two and a half times more probable in the case of mothers who smoke.  That is another startling statistic from this recent journal <i>World Health Smoking.</i></P>
    <P>These are the kind of lurid statistics which should be projected before the public.  We must also take another matter into account.  It is not considered a right thing to refer to differences of class and education but the fact is that heavy smoking is related to categories of class and educational levels.  Any anti-smoking campaign should take proper note of that fact as well.  There should be a new publicity campaign on radio and television.  I also deplore the passing of the old Health Education Bureau campaign.  Some of this, however, was rather innocuous. Looking back at it now and in the light of the horrors that we have just been talking about, it seems it was a bit genteel to be saying &ldquo;if you smoke cigarettes you might not get a place on the Kerry team&rdquo; or &ldquo;your girlfriend might not find your kisses just as winey as they would be if you were not smoking&rdquo;, although, come to think of it, this is not a field on which I am an expert.  That might be a very material consideration to put before the public.  What I do regret is the passing or phasing out of these.  We must introduce a new series of anti-smoking slogans.</P>
    <P>Also, I have to say in this place that I congratulate &mdash; I am sure it is all right to mention him by name &mdash; Mr. John Bowman, the radio and television personality, for his courage in turning down an award which was sponsored by a tobacco company.  In fact, I find the whole idea of a tobacco company sponsoring awards for journalistic excellence to be a bit sick because of course they have no real interest in the standards of <Col N="1704" /> journalism.  What they are really interested in is gaining a spurious respectability for themselves and in circumventing the advertising ban on tobacco.</P>
    <P>We have seen in recent times in the United States the power of the smoking lobby and of the tobacco-vested interests and the withdrawal of hefty advertising moneys from those who were involved in the ban of tobacco by airlines.  The tobacco companies can exercise their muscle where it really hurts when it comes to advertising.  Like all great vested interests, they are totally ruthless. In our case let us hope the Minister will be able to resist the blandishments and pressures of tobacco companies when it comes to implementing the regulations under the new Bill.</P>
    <P>The main principle behind this Bill and behind our whole approach to smoking cigarettes in public is that the non-smoker has an absolute right to enjoy a non-smoking atmosphere subject to no conditions whatsoever.  A smoker has no right to smoke in public.  He has every right to do what damage he or she wants to do to himself, but not at the expense of others.  I hope this is the principle that will be in the front of the Minister's mind when he comes to make the regulations under this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill I must say I would much prefer more specific provisions by way of definite mandatory and statutory provisions for the prohibition of smoking in specified areas.  The Bill is a bit vague in that regard.  The Minister may make such regulations as he sees fit under the Bill.  We can only wait and hope that the regulations will be effective.  I also would like to see a total ban on smoking in schools as has been suggested by Senator Fennell.  I see no reason that there should not be a ban in primary and secondary schools and, indeed, to a large extent in third level institutions as well. Are they not also largely funded by public money?  Certainly, the real problem is with the young people and the teenagers. Senator Fennell is perfectly correct to note the alarming increase in smoking <Col N="1705" /> among young people again in recent years.</P>
    <P>In this country it may have to do with levels of frustration arising from the malaise of unemployment and, perhaps, even the running sore of the North and the general sense of frustration.  For whatever reason, anybody with eyes in their heads can see the remarkable and regrettable increase in smoking among young people.  I know young people, for example, who only five years ago were railing against their elders for smoking and who are now hooked themselves. This is the area that we have to contend with.  It is the most important area. Therefore, I agree with Senator Fennell that the teacher is of enormous influence here.  The good example and the bad example are paramount.  I see no reason that schools should not be totally non-smoking areas.  It would have a massive impact, I am convinced, on young people to have this kind of spectacular example in front of them.</P>
    <P>As for hospitals, it seems to me to be a total nonsense to permit smoking in any part of any hospital.  An institution which is devoted to the restoration to health of its patients surely cannot condone the presence of smoking anywhere within the hospital environment particularly, I would suggest, in kitchens and canteens where hygiene alone should be a consideration. I hope the Minister will have the courage to make regulations enforcing these dramatic &mdash; and they would be dramatic &mdash; prohibitions on tobacco smoking.</P>
    <P>I was interested that Senator Cullimore felt that public houses should come under the general rubric.  I agree in theory, but in practice we can hardly attempt the impossible.  I see no reason why sections of public houses should not be reserved for non-smokers.  Certainly, sections of restaurants are so reserved.  This is becoming a practice anyway, but I think it should be made more universal.</P>
    <P>In the Bill also vehicles are mentioned such as trains, aircraft and buses.  All we can say here is that we hope there will be a new and determined campaign to give non-smokers their rights in these areas <Col N="1706" /> of transport.  The present position about trains, for example, is that although smokers constitute only perhaps 35 per cent of the adult population, frequently you will find that only one-third, if that, of a train on a mainline service is reserved for non-smokers so the proportion seems to be perverse.  This should be settled.  The way to go about it is to bring about a situation where, on a railway platform, travellers should have to look for the smoking carriage instead of, as at the moment, having to look for the non-smoking carriage.  It is the smoking carriage that should be the &ldquo;aberrational carriage&rdquo;, and that is not so at the moment.</P>
    <P>The first reservation I have about this Bill is that I find it vague.  I am not happy that we are allowing it to the discretion and power of the Minister to make these new changes in public behaviour, as it were.  I would much prefer to see it spelled out.  Secondly, how can we be sure that these new regulations will be enforced?  The Minister in his speech talked about existing practice and he says &ldquo;I would expect on the basis of existing controls on smoking that there will be not be any great difficulty in getting public cooperation with regard to these controls&rdquo;. He is talking about the fine not exceeding £100.  I cannot see what grounds he has for this extremely optimistic statement.  I have to say in my experience in recent years that there is an increasing awareness in the public at large about public smoking.  It is becoming increasingly infrequent now to see people knowingly violating the smoking prohibitions on trains.  I am talking about a situation of maybe five or ten years ago.  I find even when people light up in non-smoking compartments and if you point it out to them, your risks of being subjected to verbal and physical abuse have been diminished in recent times.  There is an improvement in that regard.  I am still not happy about who is going to enforce the new regulations.  Will there be notices affixed to the windows of train carriages saying, there is a fine of £100 &ldquo;if you smoke&rdquo;?  What guarantee does that give us?  In this Oireachtas we passed a law <Col N="1707" /> some years ago providing for a fine of £800 under the Litter Act.  As far as I am aware, that is mostly a dead letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it has not brought about the kind of anti-litter situation we hoped it would.  Has the law on tighter control of dogs brought about any improvement in the number of dogs running wild and the fouling of footpaths? It seems one of the major problems we have in this country is enforcing our laws.  I mentioned some weeks ago the phrase used in a particular circular sent to Deputies and Senators hoping that in a certain situation there would not be over-reliance on enforcement of the law.  We have to get away from that attitude. On a train, for example, who is going to enforce the new laws?  Will it be the ticket collector?  Will he have the time?  It should not be left to individuals to draw attention to the fact that the laws are being violated.  No single person should have to risk that kind of invidious position.  When the Minister is replying could he say what grounds he has for being so optimistic, and how he proposes to have these new laws enforced.  I would prefer a Bill with more specific provisions so that when the law was violated we could point to the offender and say: &ldquo;you are breaking that particular law&rdquo;, instead of talking about regulations which the Minister may or may not make.  With these reservations, I warmly support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>By mhaith liomsa, chomh maith leis na Seanadóirí eile, fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an Bille a chur os ár gcomhair.  Like other Senators, I give a very warm welcome to this Bill.  As outlined in the Minister's speech, the statistics are absolutely frightening in relation to smoking related illnesses.  I share the same experience as Senator Murphy because I am a reformed smoker also and it is said that there is nobody as stringent in applying the law <Col N="1708" /> and objecting to other people smoking cigarettes as one who smoked and now does not smoke any more.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in trying to highlight diseases and illnesses arising from smoking is that people, for one reason or another, and because they just do not want to think that much about it never think that what is said refers to themselves; illnesses can affect other people but not them.  I wonder if it would be feasible to do a survey in relation to &mdash; are there any statistics available?  &mdash; the number of people who tried to give up smoking at a particular time and failed? I would imagine that the numbers who did try and failed are very, very great indeed.  That is the huge difficulty in relation to smoking.</P>
      <P>One could go on <i>ad infinitum</i> in relation to the problems that are associated with passive smoking and other Senators have mentioned public places, planes, trains and buses.  What always amazes me in relation to planes in particular is that you have non-smoking areas and smoking areas and statistics have proved, in fact, that passive smoking is far more dangerous to people than actual smoking itself.  If you happen to be in the area that divides the non-smoking and smoking areas, you are in actual fact in a far worse situation than if you were in the smoking area.  That always gives me cause for concern.  I feel very strongly that in any public transport or in any public places smoking should be banned totally because passive smoking is detrimental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy and Senator Fennell about children smoking and the banning of smoking in schools. However, I feel we will have to do a little bit more than that.  We will have to have a positive attitude in trying to prevent children smoking in schools because the one thing I have learned as a teacher of some years is that you very rarely succeed when you tell children: &ldquo;Do not do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do not do that&rdquo;.  You have to encourage them and point out to them in a very positive way why they should not continue to smoke.  I am sure Senator <Col N="1709" /> Murphy would very readily agree with me that banning smoking will not get rid of the problem in schools.  I would find it extremely difficult at third level &mdash; I am not familiar with the workings of third level &mdash; to implement the regulation in relation to the banning of smoking in those areas because students, both at second level and third level, would find ways around smoking if they wished to do so.  We will have to create an environment in which those students will be encouraged not to smoke and at all times point out the illnesses and the difficulties associated with smoking.</P>
    <P>I disagree somewhat with Senator Murphy in relation to trains and the fact that ten or 15 years ago you could suggest to somebody who was smoking in a non-smoking carriage in a train that there was a non-smoking sign there and that they should not be smoking.  Only last week coming up on a train I had occasion to point out to a person that it was a non-smoking carriage and I was told in no uncertain terms what to do with myself. Ignorance is involved also.  We have to educate the people to the fact that, if they want to injure themselves in a certain way, they are not entitled to injure other people's health.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about fines and the regulations imposing fines on people who are found smoking in non-smoking areas. I agree totally with Senator Murphy in regard to the application of the regulations. It is a lack of consideration for others that encourages people to do things like smoking in areas where the signs say they are not entitled to do so. The fines suggested should be imposed in a very effective way.  I wonder exactly what system will be used to implement those regulations because it is extremely important that we should be seen to do that.</P>
    <P>This brings me on to the question of serving cigarettes to children.  I find there is a difficulty there also in implementing the regulations.  Although there is a fine of £2 for people who serve cigarettes to children under 16 years of age, very rarely have I found that regulation enforced. I do not know of any case where that <Col N="1710" /> regulation was implemented.  It is important that, when a fine is being increased to £500 for shopkeepers or others found serving cigarettes to children under the age of 16, that regulation should be very effectively implemented and people should be made quite aware that they cannot serve cigarettes to children under 16 years of age.  In many cases children of that age and younger collect the groceries and buy the groceries on behalf of grandparents or parents and so on, and invariably on the grocery list will be cigarettes. I wonder how exactly you get around that difficulty.  I am anxious to know how the Minister will try to get around that problem.</P>
    <P>As other Senators said smoking is very addictive and it is very difficult to overcome. No matter what type of regulations are in force and no matter what type of statistics are put forward to show the serious effects on health of people smoking, there will always be people who will smoke.  However, it is extremely important that those who do not wish to smoke are not put at risk by the people who want to smoke.  I do know if anybody in the House has ever heard of or listened to a record by an American comedian about Sir Walter Raleigh ringing up the British to say that he had made this fantastic discovery of the tobacco leaf.  He was explaining, supposedly over a bush telegraph to a British official about this fantastic discovery he had made: you get this leaf, roll it up, put it into your mouth and set fire to it.  To a community of people who had never heard of smoking before, it must have been absolutely unbelievable that someone would get a leaf, roll it up, put it into their mouth, set fire to it and set fire to themselves as well in the process.</P>
    <P>There was a little bit more thought in that send-up of Sir Walter Raleigh than many would have appreciated because, if you just think about it, that is exactly what we are doing to a very large extent. Smoking over a period of time affects us in a terrible way, perhaps in a more serious way than that individual had anticipated in his send&mdash;up of Sir Walter Raleigh.  I would have imagined that, if <Col N="1711" /> you set fire to the tobacco leaf, and it burnt you you would never do it again but the unfortunate thing about the cigarette is that it does not affect you so quickly in that way.</P>
    <P>I think this incident has a message for us and what we have got to do is try to encourage as many people, particularly young people not to smoke.  I agree with Senator Murphy when he says that whereas five or six years ago many young people had turned against smoking, now for whatever reason, whether it is pressure in relation to examinations, the pressures in relation to the points system and so on, I do not know, but many of these young people are now smoking again. That is a tragedy.  What we have got to do is encourage those people to see exactly the very harmful effects that smoking has on them.  It is in those formative years, between 11 and 13, as the Minister mentioned in his speech and even a little bit later that people become addicted and once you become addicted it is extremely difficult to get off the habit.</P>
    <P>I agree that what we have to do is launch another very forceful campaign of anti-smoking slogans.  It is extremely important that we create the environment where people are left in no doubt whatsoever of the harmful effects of smoking.  I hope that our schools, particularly, will be absolutely inundated with slogans to create an anti-smoking environment in all of them.  Mention was made about banning cigarettes in schools and I will just refer to that again.  Quite a number of second-level schools do ban smoking but I think it should be a policy, and I would ask the Minister to consult with the Department of Education in creating a policy, whereby cigarette smoking would be banned in all schools, particularly in all second level schools.</P>
    <P>Hand-in-hand with that we should have a campaign of very strong anti-smoking slogans so that the pupils and students would be made quite aware of the very harmful effects of smoking.  I sincerely hope that if that type of campaign was implemented it would bear fruitful results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> Again, I commend the Minister on bringing forward this very essential piece of legislation.  It is more overdue and I cannot imagine anyone who would not be in favour of that legislation except people with vested interests.  I commend the Minister and I give the Bill my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators who have spoken I am particularly pleased to welcome what is a major piece of public health legislation.  I commend the Minister on his initiative on following through what was clearly established thinking in the Department of Health and in bringing forward this piece of legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister's speech was quite simply a superb one and I would compliment those involved in its preparation.  It clearly and succinctly gives us the very latest statistics in research and in analysis of the problems. One could not quarrel with any aspect of it.</P>
      <P>I have noticed, listening to other Senators, that there is a tendency here to make certain declaratory statements about one's own habits in the area of smoking.  To be fair, at the outset, I should do the same.  I am somebody who, through force of circumstances or for whatever reason, has never put a lighted cigarette to my lips and I have always had an aesthetic disinclination for cigarette smoking, long before there was any information or evidence of the health outcome and negative effects of smoking.  Aesthetically, I find the whole thing absolutely displeasing and I am quite intolerant about cigarette smoking.  As somebody who is normally speaking as a tolerant person, I must admit to an feeling of absolute intolerance <i>vis-á-vis</i> cigarette smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People should not be equivocal about cigarette smoking.  It is time they nailed their colours to the mast on this one, come out and stop being polite.  If someone asks, &ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke?&rdquo; People should be prepared to say &ldquo;Yes, I do, actually&rdquo;.  I would encourage more and more people to have the courage of their convictions and come out with it <Col N="1713" /> and not to say &ldquo;Ah, sure it's all right; it does not matter&rdquo; in the usual sort of polite way in which we deal with things here.</P>
    <P>I think there is a disease called tobaccoism. Cancer, emphysema, chronic obstructive airway disease, cardiograph killer disease, all of these are sequent to tobaccoism which is the disease.  Frequently in health care politics we tend to focus on the wrong target but in today's debate and with this piece of legislation we are, for once, focussing on the correct target.  As a society, we have not really woken up to the seriousness of the tobacco health hazard.  It is quite simply a deadly drug addiction and one that has gained a certain acceptability in our society.  We are slowly coming around to the realisation of its deadly effect and of the urgent necessity to take steps to ameliorate its effects and in time to eradicate it totally.  As other Senators have said in the context of their contributions to this debate, cigarette smoking exerts a heavier toll in terms of lives and resources than do cocaine, heroin, AIDS, traffic accidents, murder and terrorists attacks combined.  That is an American statistic and I have no reason to believe that it is any different in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have yet mounted a national campaign to combat this, appropriate to the size of the problem.  We have had campaigns; we have had quite a good campaign in the &ldquo;knot&rdquo; series which Senator Fennell referred to, but appropriate to the size and scale and the effects of cigarette smoking, I do not think we have had a national campaign of sufficient significance, impact or strength and I hope that this legislation and the regulations accompanying it will perhaps be the necessary spur to the Minister, to the health educational promotions section of the Department to launch yet another campaign.</P>
    <P>Hundreds and thousands are devoted in this country and throughout the world to cancer research.  What is needed is a parallel war on the causes of cancer.  I praise the work of the society for the prevention of cancer, the Irish Cancer <Col N="1714" /> Society.  I would love to see them combining with the Department in this parallel war on the causes of cancer.  I feel strongly that we have to declare an all-out war and I would love this measure to be even more comprehensive.  I shall be very interested indeed in seeing the regulations and note that they must come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expect we will have a continuing debate when they do come before us.  I hope the Minister, when replying to Second Stage debate, will indicate how soon he thinks the regulations will come into the House.</P>
    <P>I am speaking personally here because of my own prejudice and my own bias which I feel has been reinforced by the information, statistics, research and the analysis, we should increase tax on all tobacco products.  Every budget should hike those taxes and hike them to a considerable extent.  It would be a very interesting exercise to determine how much every packet of cigarettes smoked costs our economy in disease and deaths.  I believe the smoker should pay whatever that amount is.  We are filling our hospital beds with diseases which are a direct outcome of cigarette smoking.  The smoker should pay for the cost of it.  The revenue from tobacco taxation should be earmarked for the prevention and treatment of chronic tobaccoism.  There should be a direct relationship between the revenue yield from tobacco and the money expended on prevention and treatment of the tobacco-related diseases so that in the public mind there is a very clear correlation between the two.  That is part of the battle against cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in one respect in relation to this Bill and that is that it does not refer to what I believe is tobacco advertising on television.  I know that technically and actually speaking, we do not appear to have tobacco advertising on television.  Nobody comes along with a ciagrette in hand extolling the advantages and delights of a particular cigarette but in practice the massive tobacco industry sponsorship of sport means that virtually every day the public are exposed to such products, for example, Embassy snooker, Marlboro motor racing, Benson <Col N="1715" /> and Hedges tennis and Carrolls' golf. This is called subliminal advertising and the message is coming across.  The tobacco industry has succeeded in circumventing the rules and regulations which have been brought in.</P>
    <P>I would urge RTE to change its attitude to the televising of sporting events sponsored by the tobacco industry.  They should be part and parcel of this campaign. They should not in any way collude with it and to my mind there is a certain collusion.  By moving into sports sponsorship, the tobacco industry has used such broadcasts as a massive marketing opportunity.  We should be alert to that and aware of it.  We should try at all times to point it out and let people see what is actually happening.</P>
    <P>I commended John Bowman for his disinclination to accept a Benson and Hedges award when I spoke on the Finance Bill in the area of taxation on tobacco.  I do so here again.  It is important that people of his stature in our community are unafraid and unashamed and unequivocal and that they voice their displeasure when they see the sneaky way in which the tobacco industry seeks to inveigle itself into the public forum and to give itself a certain spurious respectability.</P>
    <P>Research in the United Kingdom and in this country indicates that while smoking overall among adults has declined, some 41 per cent and in the case of Ireland some 49 per cent, of school leavers are smoking.  That is absolutely horrifying. The beautiful young bodies of our boys and girls are being polluted by smoke.  It is abhorrent and distasteful and I would do anything to stop that from happening.  It is almost like a death wish and it is done in a thoughtless, careless, unthinking way.  We cannot do enough to put the facts before people and to explain.</P>
    <P>I see a certain difficulty in coming out with a total prohibition and a certain negative attitude.  Young people like facts, information and argument.  We have to give them that.  The adult population, the Minister for Health and the <Col N="1716" /> Department of Health owe the young people of this country at least that much. Recent research has indicated that 75 per cent of secondary school children see cigarette advertising on television, and children make up a large part of the audience for televised sport which relates back to my earlier point.  The Government should put restrictions on tobacco advertising in sport.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell spoke about the importance of example in all of this.  She indicated that major sporting figures should be encouraged or invited to be upfront about their either having kicked the habit or their disinclination to smoke or dislike of it and to link their sporting achievement with their smoke-free habits.  The same is true of high achievers in all areas.  Politicians, too, should be prepared to be open and to crusade a little in favour of no cigarette smoking. They should give example in all of this. Teachers, too, have been referred to in this debate.  They would be important exemplars before young people.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to smoking rooms in certain schools.  It is a rotten, cowardly capitulation on the part of school authorities to allow smoking rooms in schools.  I do not approve of it and I think it is weakness.  I hope that more and more schools that have such a nasty little corner will consider closing it and insist that the pupils should at least have sufficient discipline not to smoke in the school.  Perhaps coming out of the school they may be seen lighting up as they are waiting for the buses and walking down the roads but at least within the school premises certain standards should be expected of them and adhered to.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed Senator John Murphy's contribution. I thought what he had to say was telling, open, honest and courageous. It is rather poignant to hear him talk about how he himself kicked the habit.  Again, I commend him for being so upfront and forthright.  Reference has been made to passive smoking.  So many of us have to endure that.  As Senator Murphy says, we who do not smoke have an absolute right to have a smoke-free <Col N="1717" /> condition.  The quality of the environment for the non-smoker is of tremendous importance.</P>
    <P>It would be very difficult to eradicate smoking in third level establishments. Perhaps one could make a case there for common rooms, smoking rooms or recreation centres so that smoking would be confined to certain areas of the institution. There should never be any smoking in hospitals.  I can remember a time when people leaned over the cribs of new-born babies with cigarettes in their hands and in their mouths.  That was just simply totally unacceptable and quite appalling.  Health premises are referred to in the legislation and I am very pleased about that.</P>
    <P>We do need a new series of anti-smoking slogans.  I hope the Minister will go after the brightest and the best and seek to get a new campaign on the road in tandem with this legislation and the regulations which will flow from it.  One slogan I particularly like because it is a positive one is: &ldquo;Thank you for not smoking&rdquo;. There is an inbuilt assumption that, of course, you are not going to smoke.  It is so much better than &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo;.  It is clever and it has a certain sort of politeness that I find appealing.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a detailed discussion of this Bill on Committee Stage.  Once again, I would just express my total and wholehearted support for this Bill and say how very glad I am to hear it debated here today.  I wish it a speedy passage through the House and an even speedier enactment and enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not really a lot remaining to be said because everybody here was quite supportive of the content of this Bill.  I merely rise to endorse everything that has been said and to say that we should recognise that this is merely a mechanism on the ground whereby the Minister will launch a further assault on the people who continue to assault us, the non-smoking population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Murphy highlighted the main thrust of what I would like to say.  Having put this Bill before us today it is important <Col N="1718" /> that the Department would again go on the defensive because despite the statistics and despite what cigarette companies would have us believe, that there has been a reduction in income from the consumption of cigarettes, I still think that cigarette companies are winning this war.  Statistics will prove quite definitely that young people still continue to take up this habit at an early age.  On the other side of the coin young people are also acutely aware of the necessity to improve their lifestyles.  There has been a big surge of interest in health food, for example, among young people, quite often the same people who are smoking.  This highlights the type of double standard that exists and the effectiveness of the insidious onslaught that multi-national cigarette companies still make on the population of practically every country in the world.  It is not enough to just put legislation on the Statute Book, we must go on the defensive as well.  There are definitely areas from which we should seek assistance and support.</P>
    <P>Last evening in the course of the lottery debate reference was made to the unique interest which the people have in sporting activities.  This was illustrated in recent weeks with the huge success of our soccer team in Germany.  There was national support for that team, even from people who have never in their lives been at a soccer match or who have never supported that game.  The mere fact that we had a successful sporting team representing this country abroad was a shot in the arm for the entire State.  That is an indication of the type of interest the people of this country have in sport.  This is the one area that the Department should focus much more significantly on and they should harness the support of sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>Recently a youth club in my own area carried out a survey on smoking and what absolutely astounded me, although I had a sneaking suspicion that it was the case, was that the incidence of smoking among young girls is much higher than among young men.  I suspect that this stems primarily from the fact that there is a great lack of adequate sporting facilities for <Col N="1719" /> young girls in most parts of rural Ireland, in the rural towns and villages.  The concentration on sporting activities tends to be on the main field sports for boys or young men.  As a consequence the energies of young girls quite often are not harnessed by sports clubs.  One of the reasons why the level of smoking by young people is much higher for girls than for boys is that boys have become aware of the fact that if you want to be a successful athlete or field player you must not smoke.  That message is certainly getting through quite significantly.  The lack of organised sporting facilities for girls is reflected in the fact that they do not have a great interest in being fit because they are not involved in team games.  This is something that sporting organisations need to examine.  Many national sporting organisations in Ireland purport to represent the entire population but they do not organise facilities for girls.  There is a great imbalance in this and I suspect it is reflected in the higher incidence of smoking among the female population.</P>
    <P>There is also a lot of cultism attached to smoking.  There is a nonchalant, indifferent, passive attitude to smoking. Advertising in this area is no longer allowed.  Senator Bulbulia referred to this matter.  In other forms of advertising the cool clean hero, as it were, always smokes.  I have no doubt that this is a form of insidious advertising.  We should remember that, particularly in the huge film-making conglomerates in the United States, large shareholdings are held by the multi-national cigarette companies. Reynolds in particular are very big in the film-making industry simply because it gives them an entré &mdash; obviously they are in the business of making profits &mdash; to an international audience, whether on television or on film.  They create the scenario whereby it is permissible to smoke and it is the in-thing to do.  The fact that up-market, suave people always smoke creates a certain cult.  One only has to look at the drink advertising to realise that the focus is also on those types of people.  We have seen, particularly in recent times, advertising for a large range <Col N="1720" /> of ciders, for example, which have been introduced on the Irish market.  The person in the advertisement is always of a laid back disposition, immaculately dressed and smoking.  This undermines everything we are trying to achieve here. The nettle must be grasped.  It is not enough just to put legislation like this on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to travel in the States recently and I was astounded to find that Pan American airlines allow no smoking on their aeroplanes on any internal flight in the United States.  They advise you at the airport that if you want to fly with Pam Am you may not smoke.  That is innovative and courageous.  I am quite sure they will lose custom over it but in time this gradual evolution will take its toll.  Announcements are made, as part of the ritual regarding safety regulations on airlines that there is an automatic $500 fine for anybody who interferes with the smoke alarms in the toilets, that is an indication of the lengths to which the smoker will go to have his &ldquo;drag&rdquo;&mdash; he will go into the toilet and dismantle the smoke alarm.</P>
    <P>The smokers in our midst should be on notice that there are people in this world who are starting to take the initiative and are going on the offensive.  That is a classic case in point and there is need for more such action of that.  Senator Murphy was absolutely correct when he said that smokers are not entitled to invade the airspace of non-smokers.  They should not be allowed to do so.  I am in the pub business and one only has to clean up a pub after closing time to see the disarray that is created by smokers, apart from the pollution of the airspace. It is quite extraordinary.  One never realises when the pub is full at night the extent of the take-over by the smoking population.  This is something that will have to be addressed.  With the evidence that is coming to hand of the impact that smoking has on the non-smoking population, employees in public houses or unions, on behalf of their members, will be seeking protection in these places. They are constantly subjected to this danger to their health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> An extraordinary case has been highlighted in the United States recently where a husband is suing one of the multi-national cigarette companies for the loss of his wife 11 years ago because it has been proven that she died from cigarette cancer.  That case has not been resolved yet but it is an indication of the awareness in the world of the effects of smoke on the health of non-smokers.  In spite of that, there is evidence that young people are smoking cigarettes in increasing numbers. We are not necessarily winning this war despite this great awareness that cigarette smoking is the most serious health hazard at present.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on recognising the obvious dangers that are inherent in the development of chewing tobaccos.  It is not a new phenomenon in other parts of the world but is relatively new here.  I have no doubt that this is another obvious area into which cigarette companies will divert their activities.  In parts of the United States, particularly in the mid-west and places like Wyoming and Colorado, it is very much the in-thing for men, young men in particular, to chew tobacco.  It was also practised by the troops during the Vietnam war.  It became a kind of cult to chew as a cow might chew.  It is most welcome that the Minister is taking the initiative in this regard and is not going to allow it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, everything that I had intended to say was substantially covered by the other speakers here this morning.  Everybody has welcomed the Bill.  However, I agree with the point made by Professor Murphy that it is a little vague.  It is important that we are satisfied and convinced at the regulation stage, that we are going to go to war on this matter.  Some of the recent surveys indicate that young people are starting to turn back to smoking.  It would be tragic if we were to fail to grasp that nettle.  I would subscribe to the proposal that it is inconceivable that any school would consciously allow children to smoke, especially second level schools.</P>
    <P>I recollect that during my own boarding school days you had to get written permission from your parents in order to be <Col N="1722" /> allowed to smoke.  The people charged with the responsibility of running first and second level schools at least have a responsibility to stop children from killing each other and yet they will not stop them from killing themselves.  The initiative must be taken in that area.  If young people want to smoke outside the school gate that is up to them, but at least we could prevent it in schools.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should examine this and, if necessary, legislate to ensure that smoking in schools is not allowed.  That is being done in the area of hospitals.  Obviously that is very welcome. I welcome the content of this Bill. I can only hope that it is the first phase in a new assault in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the comments of the previous speaker make me think of the problems in this whole area.  He mentioned the efforts of Pan Am in this regard.  It is interesting to note that they have now announced that they are going out of business.  If one was to link that with the prevention of smoking one would wonder as to whether you can be too restrictive in this area.  The only place where we can be sure that there is no smoking is in Heaven.  I understand it is allowed in Hell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the Seanad Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No smoking is allowed in the Seanad Chamber but outside the door it is allowed.  However, if this legislation is enacted as it is the Minister could restrict smoking outside the door.  I wonder how that would be accepted.  As a person who smoked originally but who has managed to &ldquo;kick&rdquo; the habit, I must recognise that people who smoke have rights.  That does not mean, though, that they have the right to infringe on other people's rights to be in a non-smoking area.  We must realise, as legislators, that we are living and legislating in a society which likes a certain amount of freedom. The more you legislate for the curtailment of that freedom, the more you defeat the purpose of what you are trying <Col N="1723" /> to do.  The Irish people love to live dangerously and if we legislate to stop them doing so, they will defy it.  That has been proved in every area in which we tried to interfere in their rights.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the prohibition and restriction on the consumption of tobacco products in designated areas and facilities and for the restriction on the sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 16.  It makes provisions in relation to the importation, manufacture and sale of certain tobacco products. First, it is already illegal to sell cigarettes to people under a certain age.  It is understood and accepted that we have failed to enforce that prohibition; children have been able to buy cigarettes.  Much as we all like to condemn children for smoking &mdash; we would all, as parents, like to take very restrictive action against our children who smoke in school &mdash; the reality is that they do smoke and will continue to do so.  If we think we can stop them, we are living in cloud-cuckooland.  We are living in an illusory world if we think that by legislation we can restrict all these undesirable things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is taking onto himself powers to designate certain areas in which it will be an offence to smoke.  I do not think anybody would object to that, provided that at all times there is a balance. Some people are either addicted to or like to smoke and they are entitled to dispose of their own lives in that way if they want to.  A number of years passed before we became aware that there was a problem.  Now, 38 years after the discovery that smoking is a health hazard, we expect everybody to suddenly stop smoking.  Some of the evidence documented here is irrefutable.  It shows that almost 100 people per week die from smoking or smoking-related diseases. Nobody would refute that but we would find it hard to relate it to some of the 100 or 110 year olds who say that they smoked and chewed tobacco all their lives and it never did them any harm.  They probably drank very strong liquor in the process, including poteen.  All these things are supposed to be bad for you but there are <Col N="1724" /> examples which make it impossible to reconcile the statistics with what happens in some cases.  Having said that, we must realise that smoking is a major health hazard but not necessarily for everybody because some people seem to have survived everything except the addiction.</P>
    <P>Drink is condoned in some way as being socially acceptable in this country. In another debate Senator Ryan said that all the time we complain about our drinking habits while we spend most of our time participating in the pleasure of having a drink.  We introduce legislation to allow extended drinking hours and we complain about people when they get drunk.  The reality is that cigarette smoking is considered to be an addictive drug but it is possible for people to give it up.  Drinking does not necessarily affect everybody in an addictive way.  Not everybody becomes an alcoholic and many people enjoy having a drink.  We cannot prohibit the sale of drink.  The Americans tried that but failed.  People turned to illicit and secret drinking because there was a certain element of danger and glamour to it.</P>
    <P>We all know that hard drugs are addictive and should not be condoned in any way.  There is now the added risk to health of AIDS.  I wish the Department would be vigilant, too, in the prohibition of hard drugs and in cracking down on drug pushers in this city and throughout the country.  Drug abuse is a major risk to health.  I merely want to bring some sort of balance to the debate.  The companies involved in the manufacture of cigarettes are major employers still in this country.  Possibly 1,000 people are involved in the tobacco industry and that cannot be closed down overnight because we want to legislate for a beautiful, perfect society.  We cannot expect that all the areas that we frequent should be smokeless areas because we do not smoke.  From the limited knowledge I have of this industry and from speaking with people involved in the industry such as Carrolls, I know that tobacco companies have been conscious of the drop in demand for their products and the changing attitudes in society to smoking. <Col N="1725" /> That company have been for a number of years diversifying into other areas of job creation and re-employment of their workforce.  They became involved in the Fieldcrest product in Kilkenny, the textile industry which, unfortunately, was a failure.  They put approximately £10 million into that project as a diversification of their products, and their assets.  They are to this day involved in mariculture in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta and indeed with CTT in the promotion and sale of products.  The company are conscious that the time will come when the number of people smoking will be significantly reduced from what it is now.  It is becoming more unacceptable to just pull out a packet of cigarettes and smoke without as much as saying: &ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke?&rdquo;  The situation is improving and I think the Department have played a role in this.</P>
    <P>We have set a headline in restrictions on advertisements on radio and television and on the actual tobacco carton itself.  If people are any way conscious of their health they will see that it is definitely a health hazard to smoke.  Other countries have not achieved that kind of standard. Because this health warning was not displayed in America a husband considered that the manufacturer of the product was negligent in not advising his wife that her health was at risk from smoking.  One part of that claim has been successful.  It has been determined by a judicial process that there was negligence because the tobacco company did not display the appropriate warning.</P>
    <P>We have advanced from that.  We have put restrictions on advertising and products must be identified as being dangerous. We have made a major breakthrough in this area.  I hope that in the actual operation of this legislation there will be a balance because otherwise we will lose the battle.  The Irish, by their very nature, object to restrictions being placed on what was once considered a freedom of choice.  We can all pontificate as to what is good for everybody but sensible adults should have the freedom to make up their own minds.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House would condone <Col N="1726" /> widespread smoking in hospitals but what is going to happen in the area of acute psychiatric hospitals where the vast majority of patients are handed cigarettes everyday by nursing staff on the understanding by the hospital boards, administrators and psychiatrists that they are in some way helpful to the patients?  As a result of this legislation will there be a total restriction on smoking in psychiatric institutions?  If that is the case, other more severe drugs would have to be given to these unfortunate people to pacify them and help them get through the day. We should realise that that is what is happening in psychiatric hospitals today.</P>
    <P>People from all walks of life smoke &mdash; politicians, church people, medics, nurses and all sorts of advisers.  They smoke because they get some element of enjoyment or peace from it.  Otherwise they would not be wasting money on cigarettes. As Sir Walter Raleigh said, you roll a weed, put it in your mouth and light it.  It is the actual drug, the nicotine, which creates some of the addictiveness to smoking.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House knows that smoking is quite dangerous.  What we are saying is that there will have to be a balance.  First, we should set out an educational programme on smoking.  The Department should highlight the risks involved and they should convince parents, students and teachers alike of those risks.  If we prohibit smoking we will find that people will want to break the law.  The imposition of fines is not an acceptable way of dealing with this matter.  We want to ensure that the legislation we pass is accepted and complied with.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point made by Senator Murphy that if we bring in new regulations the question will arise as to who will implement them.  If we just put up a sign we do not know that people will take heed of it.  How many people honour a &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; sign?  One is almost tempted to park in front of a &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; sign because there will probably be a vacancy there.  There should be facilities in all public places for non-smokers. The balance should be redressed.  As <Col N="1727" /> Senator Murphy said, at present there seem to be many facilities available for smokers.  If you cannot find a seat in a non smoking area of a train, for example, you realise how unpleasant it is to be in a smoking area, particularly if you have given up smoking and you want to try to avoid it.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing an amendment to section 2 to enable people who want to have a cigarette to do so without intefering with other people.  If we legislate in any other way we are heading for trouble. The question of chewing tobacco was mentioned.  The only association the vast majority of us have with chewing tobacco is when we see the cowboys chewing it, whether they be from Colorado, Texas or wherever.  Fortunately, it is not a very popular pastime with Irish people.</P>

      <P>They may not but they still smoke.  I will deal with this section of the Bill that refers to this matter.  I have no objection to the prohibition of the importation of some of these special smokeless chewing tobaccos, particularly the one known as Gold Band.  I do not think anybody could defend the widespread use of importation of these tobaccos. Their banning was desirable.  This section, in addition to banning their importation, also bans the actual manufacture in Ireland of a chewing tobacco which is exported.  As Senator Norris has said, it is obviously used in some form or other by some people.  This section actually prohibits its manufacture.  I understand that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, said in the other House that he was not going to exclude the manufacture of pipe tobacco.  I am talking particularly about chewing tobacco.  I do not use either of the two products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me if there is a <Col N="1728" /> difference between chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco?  If there is, will the persent manufactures of chewing tobacco, which is not Gold Band and there is all this talk about, be allowed to continue manufacturing and exporting it? Quite a number of people are manufacturing it and there are quite a lot of people involved in the company employing them.  I want to have a balance in the legislation.  That is why I am looking for a definition and the Minister might, in his Second Stage reply, confirm whether my interpretation of chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco is wrong or if there is a definite difference.  Will this section preclude the manufacturers from making it? If so, at least the manufacturers should be warned.  They are already conscious of the drop in demand for some of their products and have been taking action to redistribute their workers into other areas and redistribute some of their assets.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I have no objection to areas being designated non-smoking areas in theatres or other places that we like to go to and where we want to be free of being contaminated provided that there are facilities to those places for smokers, no matter how small or restricted it might be.  That is important because if we do not have something like that we will have a lot of suicides on our hands. Many people could not go for several hours of the day without a cigarette.  If we do not accept that we are not living. One needs to have a drag on a cigarette if one is getting on a Pan-Am plane.  It may be that because passengers could not have a cigarette on Pan-Am plane that they want out of business.  Nobody has any objection to restricted areas.</P>

      <P>I will be interested to hear Senator Norris's contribution on this legislation. I do not think we should be too restrictive in areas in which there is already an acceptance of people's rights. If it was a sin to smoke it would be different. It would be much easier to legislate for something that is sinful but because it is not sinful but is considered to be bad for one's health it is going to be extremely difficult to legislate in this area.  I say that with all due respects to everybody in the House.</P>
      <P>As a person who has managed to give up smoking, it is my view that people who cannot give it up should not be crucified. They should have some opportunity in some building, or in some part of a public building which the Minister is now taking upon himself to designate, to smoke.  If they do not have their facility then we will have inoperable legislation on our hands.  It could not be put into force and, certainly, could not be patrolled by the staff we have in the public sector in view of the Government's total commitment to decimate the public sector.  There will not be any officials left to implement any legislation unless people will abide by the provisions as a gesture to mankind.  I would be doubtful about that, too.  We are all right when it is ourselves we are talking about but if there is anybody else involved we do not care.  It is a pity that that is the sort of society we are now living in.  Let us try to legislate for that kind of society and not be too restrictive. I hope the Minister will be responsive in his reply to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sensitive of the dangers of talking on this subject which has, indeed, as Senator Ferris indicated, quasi-religious overtones.  In particular, I am reminded of the great dramatist, Christopher Marlowe, who was done to death by the agents of Queen Elizabeth's secret service for saying, among other things, that &ldquo;they who love not tobacco and boyes be fools&rdquo; and that the holy communion should be administered in a pipe.  For those irreverent blasphemous remarks he was actually done to death.  I will confine myself within a much less <Col N="1730" /> controversial area.  However, I should like to take up first of all some of the things that were said, in a descending order of seriousness.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of chewing tobacco, I am slightly shocked that many Senators from both sides of the House appear to be unaware that this is, in fact, a traditional Irish pastime.  If they were unaware of it they should turn to the pages of James Joyce's great novel <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> where in the scene, reflecting very accurately the political turmoil in the period of the Parnell controversy, a Mr. Casey explains how down in Arklow one day, having addressed a meeting at which Parnell was present, a middle-aged harridan bounced along in the dirt shouting abuse at them and eventually this was more than Mr. Casey could take.  He told the assembled company at the Christmas dinner that he held his peace until that woman called Mrs. O'Shea a name that he would not sully the Christmas board nor his hostess's ears with.  He said he leaned down to her and having:</P>
      <P>(saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth... I bent down to her and Phth!  says I to her like that.  Phth!  says I to her like that, right into her eye.</P>
      <P>The response was:</P>
      <P>O Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I'm blinded!  I'm blinded and drownded! I'm blinded entirely.</P>
      <P>That little ancedote indicates, at least among the politicos of the last century, that the chewing of tobacco was indeed something that was fairly well known.  It also extended to Cork where it was among the sins recounted by Frank O'Connor against his grandmother.  That is just a lighthearted interlude but it shows that chewing of tobacco existed in this country.  I certainly was unaware of its dangers and I am not fully convinced of them.  It does not seem to me to be as dangerous as smoking which clearly has a correlation with cancer of the lung.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the most important factor here, with regard to the chewing of <Col N="1731" /> tobacco, is one that I am extremely pleased to see that the Minister is addressing, the really serious situation with regard to passive smoking.  While I respect very much the views of Senator Ferris with regard to the right to freedom of individual choice, and the right of citizens to damage themselves by pursuing ill-advised courses if they so wish, at the same time when it comes to smoking we have of recent years become keenly aware of the dangers of passive smoking.</P>
    <P>I note that in his speech the Minister draws the attention of the House to the fact that of those non-smokers who contract cancer of the lung, 25 per cent have contracted it as a result of passive smoking. That draws the distinction very clearly and allows the State to intervene on behalf of those citizens who do not wish willy-nilly to be condemned to a slow, painful and horrible death by virtue of the selfishness of other citizens.  It seems there is a very clear reason for that, even taking into account the sensitivity to people's individual human rights.  I am very glad indeed that the Minister has taken this on board.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Minister has established a unit within the Department of Health and an overall advisory council on health promotion made up of a broad representation of experts in appropriate sectors.  He said the increased emphasis which he has placed on health promotion is an attempt to create, through public policy, an environment which is protective of, and conducive to, healthy living.  Again, I welcome this but I welcome it having condemned the abolition of the Health Education Bureau.  It seems to me that this would be a prime area in which the HEB could and should have been involved, particularly alerting people to the dangers of passive smoking. I will return to this because a great deal was made about the possibility of having smoke-free areas in restaurants and aeroplanes. Whatever about restaurants, it is completely impractical to have a smoke-free zone in a little cigar shaped metallic funnel that flies in the air because the amount of air that is being polluted is so <Col N="1732" /> limited.  I fly quite a lot and I am an occasional smoker but I dislike smoking intensely when I am not doing it myself and I object strongly to other people doing it.</P>
    <P>When I am in one of my non-smoking phases and I am in an Aer Lingus or any other aeroplane and the non-smoking seat that I am in is directly behind the smoking section, the existence of the non-smoker area is demonstrated to be a complete and utter nonsense because you are then clearly a prime target of passive smoking.  The only thing to do in these circumstances is to ban smoking altogether. It does come as a bit of a shock to the smoker.  The first time I came across it was about a year ago when I was flying from New York to Montreal.  I asked to be seated in the smoking area and I was told there was no smoking area because it was a domestic flight lasting under two hours and smoking was banned.  I survived that although I was addicted to nicotine.</P>
    <P>In the interests of other passengers on the plane it is no harm to put people through this slight discomfort so that their health will not be damaged in this particularly unpleasant manner.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Bulbulia about the need for courtesy, however, with regard to smoking.  One of the most effective ways of inhibiting people from smoking is the kind of notice that I have also seen in taxis, first in North America but now increasingly in Dublin, that says, &ldquo;Thank you for not smoking&rdquo;.  It draws the venom of the smoker.  It is important, as Senator Bulbulia said, to be honest if one is asked the question: &ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke?&rdquo;  and to say, &ldquo;Yes I do&rdquo; if indeed you do.</P>
    <P>I was reminded &mdash; and I will tidy up this story slightly in the interests of decency &mdash; very clearly of the immortal retort of Stephen Behan at the funeral of his mother in Dublin many years ago when a passenger in the funeral coach leaned across and said: &ldquo;Stephen, do you mind if I smoke?&rdquo;  and he said: &ldquo;Mind if you smoke?, I dont gave an &lsquo;expletive&rsquo; deleted if you burst into flames&rdquo;.  That <Col N="1733" /> was not a particularly polite way of dealing with it.  It was not perhaps the appropriate response.  The appropriate response is: &ldquo;Yes I do&rdquo; and I say this as a tutor in university.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about smoking in educational institutions.  In my folly as a civil libertarian &mdash; even when I was not smoking myself &mdash; I used to allow students to smoke in tutorials until I noticed on one occasion, having asked the perfunctory question: &ldquo;Does anybody mind if Miss X smokes?&rdquo;  that Miss Y was rapidly turning green.  It emerged tha she was a rather shy student and she did not like to say that she objected to smoking but she had chronic asthma and she suffered quite a serious attack as a result of passive smoking.  From then on, I made an absolute rule that in my classes people are not allowed to smoke.  Once this is clearly established and once the person taking the class does not smoke, then everything is perfectly all right.</P>
    <P>I would, however, say that there has to be some degree of equality in these matters.  It is absolutely absurd for somebody taking a class in an enclosed space to say the students must not smoke but that he or she will because he or she happens to be the figure in authority. It is much worse in terms of setting an example if the person in charge of a class or a responsible situation smokes.  Mention was also made of a case in America which is currently being processed through the legal procedures of that country in which the husband of a woman who had died of cancer of the lung has sued for damages as a result of her death. Although part of the significance of this was drawn out by previous speakers, one of the most significant elements was missed.  It is an element that indicates the deep cynicism of the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>The element that was not drawn to the attention of the House was the fact that it was not just that they did not put warnings on the cigarette packages, it was the fact that very early on in the fifties the particular tobacco company being prosecuted in the courts became aware of the dangers to health.  This was made clear by the disclosure of documents which <Col N="1734" /> indicated that the company had started a process of diversification.  It was not just that they did not put a warning on the cigarette packages; it was the fact that they deliberately concealed information, made financial provision to diversify out of what was a dangerous industry and, at the same time, continued actively to promote the consumption of this dangerous and additictive drug.  That seems to be an utterly cynical attitude with regard to health.</P>
    <P>Cancer of the lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the most horrible diseases because the patient is left gasping painfully for breath and yet this industry went on actively promoting the consumption of these products and they promoted them in particularly insidious ways.  I will go on at length about the manipulation nowadays of advertising through sports promotion except to say that it is the utmost cynicism to promote something that damages health, that has been demonstrated to have the most seriously damaging impact on health and to promote to the young, through sports and health, is really the nadir of cynicism.</P>
    <P>When Senator Bulbulia says that smokers should be made to pay, that the piper should pay the tune so to speak, it is not sufficient to say that smokers should pay through increased tax.  There should be a levy on the profits of the tobacco companies.  I hope the Minister will consider this because it is absolutely obscene that there should be profiteering on illness. That is basically what it is.  If the Minister was capable of catching those people who are promoting hard drugs in the inner cities, I am quite sure he would do more than impose a levy on them. The Government have seen it &mdash; and I welcome this absolutely 100 per cent &mdash; to put a levy on the banks.  If you can levy the banks, which I suppose from one point of view are a relatively clean operation, I do not see why the tobacco industry should not be levied in the same way.  It seems that this is the kind of measure that would add even greater teeth to excellent legislation which I completely welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be other tidying up <Col N="1735" /> exercises as well because the consumption of tobacco is so deeply built into our civilisation that we sometimes do not realise the way in which it has inveigled its way into our midst.  I can sympathise as a piece of folklore with quite a lot of what Senator Ferris was saying about having a gasp on an old fag before you get onto a plane and so on, that there is in our culture this whole notion of smoking and so on, to such an extent in fact that I understand &mdash; and I am prepared to be corrected on this if I am wrong &mdash; that in the calculation of the cost of living index the price of cigarettes is included.  This seems to be extraordinary because, in other words, we accept that it is a kind of staple item, a necessary element of our consumption.</P>
    <P>The perception of cigarette smoking has changed so radically during my lifetime that this is no longer acceptable. When I was growing up it was a manly thing to do; it was part of peer group pressure to smoke cigarettes.  At the age of six I not only smoked cigarettes; I smoked several of my uncle's cigars and I was not punished.  I developed a considerable taste for cigars and my mother pleaded that I should not be punished because she said: &ldquo;He will have his own punishment in about 20 minutes when he is violently ill.&rdquo;  In fact, I relished the experience and continued until recently to smoke cigars.  It was part of our culture. People were unaware of the dangers in terms of health but we are aware of them now.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the cynicism of the tobacco companies.  I would like to hammer this home because it not only affects humans; there have been a series of the most disgusting experiments on animals conducted by the tobacco industry in attempts to find less harmful mixtures of tobacco and so on.  These unfortunate animals have been strapped down and forced to consume and inhale huge quantities of cigarette smoke to find out the rate at which they will contract cancer.  I hope Ireland will never again be used for this kind of obscene experimentation by tobacco companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> I would also like to make a point about the response of tobacco companies internationally when their operations are curtailed. It is like the drug problem in Dublin: when the concerned parents make one area of the city inhospitable for the pushers it has a kind of displacement effect and they move off into another area.  I understand that many of the international tobacco conglomerates who have been finding that their market is diminishing in the more advanced, sophisticated and the more mature consumer societies have commenced a process of dumping their tobacco products in less privileged Third World societies.  They also make use of the fact that there is, not just no restriction on tobacco promotion through advertising in those countries but actually an encouragement because it brings in revenue.  This is utterly cynical.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question that was raised about the manufacture for export of certain tobacco products which might be banned here &mdash; I think Members were talking of particular kinds of chewing tobacco; I was not quite aware of this but it was stated in a previous speech &mdash; I would welcome the principle of this very much because it is a principle that has also underlain our attitude towards Sellafield. I would like to think that this whole international concern about the effect of exports, whether they are radioactive materials through discharge or nicotine products being manufactured in a jurisdiction where it is illegal to consume them or to market them, would extend &mdash; I hope the Minister will communicate this to his colleagues because it is not directly his jurisdiction &mdash; to the matter of mercury soap.  I will not go into that in detail except to say &mdash; my colleague Senator Brendan Ryan indicated to me that he intended to raise this on the Order of Business today &mdash; that the export of mercury soap from England has been made illegal.  It is not illegal here and we are actively manufacturing it in County Wicklow.  I hope the principle that is apparently contained in a certain clause in this legislation will extend honourably to this other matter.</P>
    <P>The confining of smoking in urban <Col N="1737" /> public transport, which is a feature of this Bill, is something that is very much to be welcomed, I, in particular, welcome it because it seemed to me always in the past to be most unfortunate that people were allowed to smoke on the tops of buses and the non-smoking compartment was the lower deck of buses.  Everybody knows, particularly in the city of Dublin, that the principal pleasure of travelling by bus is to be afforded the privilege of looking into other people's bedrooms, backgardens, side passages and so on.  I consider it a noxious discrimination that non-smokers were debarred from this very considerable privilege.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an excellent piece of legislation.  Despite the reservations that were conscientiously entered by Senator Ferris with regard to the control of people's choice and option in the matter, cigarette smoking is dangerous.  The Minister's speech has been well prepared and its argument is cogent with regard to the risks to health. The numbers are so horrifying and at the moment it does represent a more serious immediate threat to health even than AIDS, for example, about which we read so much in the newspapers, although I believe that we will eventually reap the whirlwind there too, as the Minister knows.  In the light of all those things it seems to be only rational in the interests of the general community good that the right of the individual in this case should no longer be seen to be paramount and should suffer some diminution so that the rest of the community may not suffer from the ill-effects of this unfortunate habit which is highly addictive as not only James Joyce, to whom I referred earlier, knew.  His friend, Italo Svevo, the author of &ldquo;The Confessions of Zeno,&rdquo; a novel which, to even James Joyce's astonishment, concerned itself entirely with the travails and problems of a man attempting to give up smoking.  When Italo Svevo, or under his real name Ettore Schmitz, was seriously injured in an automobile accident in 1930 &mdash; he was Jewish &mdash; his wife, who was Roman Catholic asked him if he would like her to get him a priest and he said, &ldquo;no, I would like a <Col N="1738" /> cigarette and this time it really will be the last cigarette&rdquo;.  That indicates the degree of addiction that is involved.  I may say that I am now five days, 13 hours and 26 minutes off the weed for the umpteenth time.  I hope the strain of participation in Leinster House will not drive me back to them.  I would like to end by congratulating the Minister on an excellent piece of legislation which, with very few reservations which have been generally rebutted, has been welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>It is always very difficult to follow Senator Norris.  Having been at some racetracks recently in Dublin and listened to what the Senator said, I believe that some of the greyhounds I saw running must have gone through the terrible smoking experiment.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed the air pollution Bill.  We did so because we were of the view that pollution in the air was causing certain health risks to people. Now local authorities are empowered to create smokeless zones and that is being done in the Ballyfermot area of Dublin. If we were told that air pollution was causing ten deaths per week I am sure we would have enacted that legislation years ago.  The most frightening aspect of the Minister's speech is that 16,000 deaths per year are related to smoking and 5,000 deaths which are directly due to smoking, that is, 100 per week.  The legislation which we are debating today is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My father who used smoke more than 80 cigarettes a day died at a very early age.  Certainly, that had a very profound effect on me and I never had a wish to smoke.  It is very important to encourage young people at an early age not to smoke and to give them good reasons why they should not smoke.  I must congratulate teachers on the way that they can educate children on the dangers of smoking.  It is at the formative ages, between five and nine years of age, that one can have the <Col N="1739" /> most profound effect on children.  If children get the right message at that early age there is the possibility that they will not smoke during their lifetime.  I am glad the Minister has included in the Bill provisions in relation to the sale of cigarettes to children.  I must confess that I was not aware that it was an offence to sell cigarettes to children under 16 years of age.  I am sure many people who sell cigarettes are not aware of that.  The Minister is making that clear in the Bill and I hope it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>In the past shopkeepers have allowed children to buy cigarettes singly, opening packets and selling them one by one.  I note that the Minister is proposing to end that terrible practice because children do not have very much money and would not have the price of a packet of ten or 20 but might have the price of one or two cigarettes.  They are encouraged to start smoking at that early age if they can avail of that facility.  I am glad to see that that loophole will be closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the sale of cigarettes through vending machines will have to be supervised.  I have grave reservations about that section.  How does the Minister hope to operate that? If the sale of cigarettes through a vending machine has to be supervised why not have the cigarettes sold by the person who is supervising the vending machine? We should do away with the vending machine altogether, and make it totally illegal to sell cigarettes in this way.  Then we would have real control.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the ever growing range of oral smokeless products which are designed to be sucked or chewed. They are highly addictive, and I understand they have serious effects and can cause mouth cancer.  Other Senators have said that this has been an old tradition in the past in Ireland, but a new product came on the market &mdash; I think it was called Gold Band &mdash; and it is a great credit to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond that he moved immediately to see that this product would never be on sale in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was watching that very entertaining <Col N="1740" /> show &ldquo;That's Life&rdquo; one night which deals with variety and serious subjects, and the presenter was dealing with this problem. This product was on sale quite openly in England to young children.  There was a media campaign to encourage young children to avail of this product.  The programme was trying to prevent the sale of this product and the presenter mentioned that its sale was prohibited in the Republic of Ireland.  I understand also that there was a challenge to the ruling of the Minister in the High Court and it was found to be <i>ultra vires</i> to the Health Act, 1947, but the Minister under this section of the Bill restores the effect of that order, which was made by the then Minister and I am glad to see that has happened.</P>
    <P>A new dimension of smoking is passive smoking.  I do not think people were aware in the past of the danger of passive smoking.  We have figures not to show that people who are involved in passive smoking &mdash; people working in offices, or in public places with people who smoke heavily &mdash; can be more seriously affected than the people smoking because smokers have the advantage of having the filter to reduce the impact, but people in that vicinity have to accept the full impact of the smoke, which can be very upsetting and cause serious health risks.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to designate public areas where people cannot smoke.  It is very encouraging that this should be in the Bill at this time, because the public are anxious for this kind of legislation, indeed, they have prohibited smoking on a voluntary basis themselves.  I do not drive.  I travel by bus and while in the past I was not anti-smoking, while not smoking myself, recently I found it very difficult to board the top of a double deck bus due to the heavy smoke.  Recently, as we are all aware, CIE made the gesture and asked the public not to smoke on the top of double deck buses.  I felt at the time it would not work, people would not comply with the request, but to my great surprise people have, and you very seldom find anyone smoking on the top of a bus now.  That also applies to taxis <Col N="1741" /> and other means of public transport.  As I said, the public wish to have smoking areas controlled.</P>
    <P>What has been mentioned in the House here today by a number of speakers &mdash; I have been conscious of it very much myself, too, of recent times &mdash; is the increase in smoking by teenagers.  I do not know what the reason for this is, but the extraordinary thing is that I find there is a higher increase in teenage girls smoking. I feel the dangers of smoking should be pointed out to them.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of the Department of Health to promote programmes that show the effects smoking can have on the public because, as we know, we have to deal with the medical problems that smoking causes and this is surely a heavy drain on the Department of Health's budget.  Some of that money could be spent on a programme to educate the public about the dangers of smoking.  This is a very appropriate time to do it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure before the House.  I accept what Senator Ferris said, that it is important that we allow people to smoke.  There is no way of totally prohibiting people from smoking and what we must do in our legislation is to encourage people as far as possible not to smoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad principle the Labour Party support the Bill.  To digress slightly from what I meant to say, my colleague.  Senator Ferris earlier introduced the moral dimension into this question. It put me thinking back to my schooldays when we had the green and red catechisms.  I recall that the fifth commandment in the old catechism went something like this: we should take reasonable care to protect our own life and health and reasonable care to protect the life and health of others.  I think my memory is fairly all right there, and as a smoker I stand indicted on both counts because I am not taking proper care of my own life and health and those who breathe the smoke that I let into the atmosphere when they are in close proximity are passive smokers and I am <Col N="1742" /> offending against the other side of the commandment.</P>
      <P>As a teacher who smokes, it presented a certain problem to me as to how I would present my smoking habit to children. Like all areas, honesty is the best policy. I pointed out to the children under my care that I was addicted to a drug and that I found it very difficult to get off that drug.  I told them often the story about Mark Twain who, when somebody said to him that the hardest thing in the world to do was to give up smoking, said: &ldquo;nonsense, I have done it hundreds of times&rdquo;. I found myself in that position as well.  It is important with children to go back to the origins of one's own smoking when one is teaching in school and I must say I welcome very much the provision in the Bill that cigarettes can only be sold in units of ten or over.  My introduction to smoking in a lot of ways was the corner shop where you could pick up one cigarette for one and a half old pence in those days.</P>
      <P>It was very important for me anyway to underline to children that the smoking I was involved in for quite a number of years was the result of peer pressure. Senator Norris referred to this earlier. For a long time my schoolfriends and I did not inhale the smoke, we were sucking it into our mouths and blowing it out without inhaling it.  But as time goes on one becomes more adept at inhaling cigarettes and the time is reached when one has become addicted and as years go by it becomes more and more difficult to break the habit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Ferris, dealt with the rights of smokers.  This is an area that we should approach with a certain sense of pragmatism and common sense because, in essence, a smoker except for the effects of passive smoking, is the person who is basically affected, but addiction to alcohol causes suffering for a great number of people who surround the person who is addicted.  Families go short and so on.  I believe that if the Minister is too rigid in the way he implements the powers available to him under this Bill, it may in essence prove counter productive.  One of the reasons <Col N="1743" /> we have not solved the drug problem in this country is that it is extremely difficult for the Garda go get to the actual source &mdash; Godfathers of the drug scene.</P>
    <P>Like every forbidden fruit, it tends to go underground and in that situation, like what happened during prohibition in the United States, an industry grows up around it.  I suppose in many ways, the emergence of the Mafia as the strong organisation it remains today in the United States, owes a lot to the time of prohibition and the vast amounts of money that was available in those days to those who were prepared to supply what was then illicit alcohol.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Ferris mentioned the situation in Dundalk.  I was speaking this morning to Deputy Michael Bell who comes from the constituency in which Carrolls operate.  He pointed out, and I am sure the Minister lives a lot nearer to Dundalk than I do and would be very much aware of this because of the proximity to the Border, that Dundalk in many ways has suffered very badly commercially.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell has had discussions with the unions there.  He pointed out that the workforce at Carrolls has decreased from 500 to 250, and the workforce is presently in decline.  My colleague, Senator Ferris, and I would like to reiterate it, referred to the chewing of tobacco.  Certain types are becoming more popular in this country, the ones the Minister mentioned in his speech coming in from Scandinavia and the USA, but I understand that the traditional product produced by Carrolls in Dundalk is not one in great demand in this country, the bulk of it goes overseas. As Senator Ferris said, the industry here in Ireland has accepted the fact that the Minister is going to succeed in what he is aspiring to do, that is to work towards the eventual elimination of the smoking habit.  The company I referred to invested, I believe, £10 million in a textiles project in the south east which unfortunately became unstuck.  They are involved in Bradán Mara with Údarás na Gaeltachta which provides 100 jobs.  I believe that plant is among the most <Col N="1744" /> modern there is, probably the most modern in the world.  They are also involved with Córas Tráchtála in the developing of a direct marketing or mail order type operation in the USA.  The bottom line is that of the products they will be offering, half will be manufactured in this country and these will be high priced products.</P>
    <P>I am a smoker and accept that I should not be smoking.  Many people over the years have given me all the arguments and these arguments were excellently underlined today in the Minster's introductory speech.  I know I should not smoke.  I believe there are two things I should ask the Minister to do.  Let us not be too draconian in how this legislation is implemented.  We will have an amendment down on Committee Stage regarding the rights of the smoking fraternity. The other relates to the industry; I think it is fair to say, and the Minister would agree, that there are honest and real efforts being made by that industry to provide alternative jobs and I would ask that he would give the industry sufficient breathing space to wind down the production of tobacco products and allow them to diversify into other products to make good the jobs that are being lost.</P>
    <P>Finally I ask him once again to reconsider the position regarding the traditional chewing tobacco produced by the firm in Dundalk which, in the greater part, is exported from the country.  The Bill would preclude or make illegal the manufacture of it but the export would be going to countries where the legislation of these countries allows the import of that product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not often do I take issue with my colleagues in the Labour Party but I am astonished at the use of the phrase &ldquo;the rights of the smoking fraternity&rdquo;.  I do not accept that they have any rights, I must say, except to smoke in private, away from me as far as possible, and incidentally my wife is a heavy smoker and I would not concede any rights on that issue because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that people can insist on imposing on me large quantities of smoke <Col N="1745" /> which is liable to do me probably even more harm than it will do them.  One of the most frightening discoveries that the Minister has alluded to about passive smoking is that the non-inhaled part of the smoke from a cigarette is more lethal than the inhaled component.  I want to make it clear that any more than I think people who sell hard drugs have rights, people who smoke cigarettes have no rights other than the fact that those of us who do not smoke are going to at least allow them to smoke somewhere in a transition period until we manage to get rid of this obnoxious habit once and for all.</P>
    <P>I think there are a number of things that could be said about smoking.  If I can start by saying that one of the things I have always associated with vice is that whatever is wrong with it, at least it is attractive and pleasant.  Most of the classic vices of humanity to do with the sins of the flesh or to do with drink at least have the one thing in common, that they were at least enjoyable, people actually enjoyed doing them.  I cannot even associate that much with the vice of cigarette smoking.  It seems to me to be inherently self-destructive.  It is only beneficial because people are actually addicted to nicotine.  It contributes nothing to human health, happiness or social activity and indeed does quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>I am utterly and totally intolerant of cigarette smoking.  I see no argument in its favour.  I utterly reject the argument that we must somehow protect the tobacco industry.  The tobacco industry has contributed nothing but damage and harm to humanity, and as Senator Norris said earlier, it is currently endeavouring to transfer that harm away from those of us who have been educated about the damages of cigarette smoking to those who at an earlier stage of their economic development are not as aware.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of well documented evidence about the intensity of the lobbying of the tobacco industry, the intensity of their determination to attempt to persuade people that the medical evidence is not as damaging as it actually is, to persuade people in less sophisticated <Col N="1746" /> countries to take up the habit that many of us are fortunately learning to do without. There is so much that could be said about smoking and all of it is negative.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have of this Bill is that it does not go half far enough. Smoking is something that should be restricted to consenting adults in private. I do not think that smoking should be seen anywhere anybody else has to be. People who smoke should be left to smoke and do themselves harm only in places where nobody else has to be. Where anybody else has any reason to be present, smoking should not be permissible. It should be unacceptable.  Part of this is a question of legislation, part of it is a question of those of us who do not smoke, and do not want to smoke, becoming somewhat more vocal.  I do not want to give the impression that I go around demanding that people stop smoking, I am talking in terms of a general value of society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>You would have some trouble at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of trouble at home on that account but that is part of life, I have to live with it.  If someone told us that somebody was going to introduce something for sale that was going to do the devastation that cigarette smoking does in terms of the number of deaths, illnesses, damage to life expectancy, all of that not only would the product not be allowed in the marketplace but the person who tried to sell it would probably be locked up, because of the enormity of the crime that he or she was attempting to perpetrate against society.  It would be regarded as a serious social crime to try to get people to consume something which was such a guarantee of so much harm and so much illness to them.  We have been conditiond to put up with something that the objective evidence, our own experience and everything else says is utterly and totally unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaints of the tobacco industry need to be taken with a substantial grain of salt.  Since the Health Education <Col N="1747" /> Bureau began its campaign against smoking a number of years ago there has been a drop in cigarette consumption which has been reduced from 40 per cent of the adult population to about 33 per cent. In that period they have not made an enormous effort to accept the reality. They have spent a considerable amount of time trying to prevent those of us in the Oireachtas from taking action against cigarette smoking.  We were lobbied about the levies on advertising and were told why these inhibitions on the freedom of comment and the freedom of the individual, etc.  Every step of the way, the tobacco industry have resisted attempts to actually get through to the population just how damaging, how unhealthy and how life threatening cigarette smoking is. I cannot think of anything in our society that is so utterly negative in what it does to people.  I cannot think of any redeeming virtue of cigarette smoking other than the fact that people who are addicted to tobacco have to keep on satisfying that addiction.</P>
    <P>People lobby about the quality of our environment and about air pollution but the single greatest air pollutant that most of us have to put up with is tobacco smoke.  If we are prepared to talk about stringent regulations on the ESB in terms of emissions from Moneypoint or stringent regulations about car emissions, as we all think these are very fashionable things, we should all think this through and think about the sort of stringent control we should put on human emissions which are equally life threatening, equally damaging and equally offensive to the environment.</P>
    <P>The whole question of why people smoke is something we do not understand. I do not think anybody fully understands why so many people can be so well aware of the threat to their health and still continue smoking; is a matter of addiction and how they actually begin to smoke.  The Minister mentioned a figure of close to 50 per cent of young people who admitted to having at least tried cigarettes.  It is a matter that we ought to <Col N="1748" /> pursue further because it raised interesting questions about whether people actually make free choices in terms of purchasing items such as cigarettes, or whether all sorts of insecurities are stimulated, challenged or are brought into people's experience by the sort of advertising that is used.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that where advertising is permitted and where it still exists, themes of virility, feminine attractiveness and sophistication and all that, is used to persuade people.  I cannot think of anything more hostile to the image of a fit, virile man than a cigarette anymore than I can think of anything more at variance with the image of an attractive woman than a cigarette.  Both are the direct antithesis of that which they claim to actually emphasise.  My own feeling is that cigarette advertising should be banned completely.  I do not believe in banning the product because that would give a certain romanticism to it.  Banning cigarette advertising would need to be done on a European rather than on a national scale because of the fact that so many of our publications, magazines, are imported into the country.  The first small quibble I would have with the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  I have a number of quibbles like that.</P>
    <P>What is the position of restaurants? One of the most offensive things for somebody who is in a restaurant is to have somebody or a half a dozen people at another table breathing clouds of offensive smoke in one's direction.  It is both offensive in terms of a meal and in terms of one's health.  I know some people like to smoke at a meal and some people do not.  I happen to believe that those who do not smoke have the right not to have that sort of noxious substance imposed upon them against their wishes. Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that the whole question of smoking in restaurants and public houses needs to be addressed.  To go into a crowded pub on a fine summer's evening and to be suddenly confronted with a cloud of smoke that pervades most public houses is a real challenge to any feeling of good health that one has.  Therefore, I think a <Col N="1749" /> question should arise where people who do and do not smoke congregate and like to congregate as to whether smoking should be tolerated there, or whether people who want to smoke should be given a little room on their own and let them smoke themselves to death if they wish.  I do not think they should be allowed to impose it on anybody else.</P>
    <P>There is a question about where cigarettes are sold.  I do not know the present position but there used to be a sign that a place was licensed to sell tobacco.  I do not know if people still need licences to sell tobacco.  If they do, first of all we should make people pay a fairly substantial sum for the right to sell tobacco. The question of a licence to sell tobacco ought to be addressed in a similar way as the licence to sell alcohol.  I do not think, for instance, that shops near schools should be allowed a licence to sell tobacco because of the fact that a large number of young people frequent them.  I know that the Bill makes it illegal to sell cigarettes singly but I think this could be supplemented by removing cigarettes from the places where young people congregate. If the licence is not there it should be introduced.  If it is there it should be enforced and should be enforced in a much more restrictive way.</P>
    <P>There is the serious question regarding cigarette vending machines.  The Minister in his speech said they have been banned in Cyprus.  I think we should announce that in ten years' time, so that those who are involved in that business get the time to get out of it, that we are going to ban cigarette vending machines.  I know the Minister intends to make it compulsory that these should be regulated but I wonder how feasible it is to regulate cigarette vending machines?  The reason in another more controversial area why vending machines for contraceptives were never accepted in this country was precisely because nobody believed they could be supervised and that any regulation about who would have access to them could not be enforced.  If it was true about contraceptives, it is true about cigarettes.  Cigarette vending machines <Col N="1750" /> are almost the regular way in which cigarettes are sold in many places.  It is a much easier way for the proprietors of premises to sell them.  I think there is a good case for banning cigarette vending machines.</P>
    <P>We should also consider in the context of the EC, a decision that no form of State aid, no form of State subsidy either explicit or implicit should be available for investment in the tobacco industry but I would be quite positive about investment in alternative areas of activity.  The EC as a Community should decide that we will not by any implicit or explicit incentive encourage new investment or reinvestment in the tobacco industry.  We have to clarify our minds on this fully and there can be no argument for continuing to support an industry which does such enormous harm.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that we talk so much about the problem of alcohol in this country &mdash; it is quite right that we should &mdash; but far more people die directly or indirectly as a result of tobacco than as a result of the consumption of alcohol.  It needs to be said that alcohol, of itself, is something pleasurable and enjoyable when consumed in reasonable quantities. Tobacco, of itself, is life threatening and unhealthy however small the quantities that are consumed.  It is also a fact that those of us who do not choose to drink do not have to have drink imposed upon us by anybody else who drinks whereas those of us who choose not to smoke have to live with the prospect of having cigarette smoke imposed on us by others. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference and the difference is that tobacco is inherently unhealthy and destructive. My only quibbles with this Bill, and I will qualify them, are that not necessarily everything I want to be done should be done now, but that I suspect that some of the things I would like the Minister to contemplate doing would require additional legislation.  Perhaps it is a pity that he did not take the powers to himself to do all the things that need to be done. Perhaps I misunderstood the Bill.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.  That would be my only quibble with him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> There has been a lot of equivocation about cigarette smoking, just because it exists.  If it did not exist it would be made illegal before it even started but because it exists we tend to be equivocal about it.  Probably the single greatest thing we could do to improve the health of a community would be to get rid of cigarette smoking.  If we could persuade people to take exercise and to stop smoking that, more than any investment in hospitals, medical care or anything else, would transform the quality of health of large numbers of people.  They are inexpensive things to do.</P>
    <P>The tobacco industry has launched a campaign and is continuing to launch it. Members of this House were still being lobbied as late as this morning by agents of the tobacco industry about the alleged damage to jobs that could be caused by this legislation.  I do not think there is any point in equivocating.  Of course, if we are successful every factory that produces cigarettes is going to close down.  I think that is an inevitable and a necessary consequence of the evil that is cigarettes. We must accept it but we must do our best to ensure that those workers are provided with alternative employment. We must do nothing in response to the attempted blackmail which would perpetuate or lengthen the period over which people will see smoking as an acceptable activity.</P>
    <P>I would hope, though it is probably optimistic, that by the time I come to retirement cigarette smoking will be something my grandchildren will ask me about with some amazement and wonder how people could ever have done it, given how inherently evil and unhealthy it was We look back 100 years ago at the sort of insanitary practices that people took for granted and we wonder how they could ever have done those things.  I hope that in another 30 or 40 years people will look back and wonder how it is that grown adults, allegedly in the full possession of their faculties, could do something so offensive and so utterly self-destructive. That will be the view I have. <Col N="1752" /> I hope the Bill will enable the Minister to do everything that is possible to achieve that and, if not, I hope he will introduce another Bill quickly to allow him to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief in what I have to say this evening.  I am not going to regale the House with my own particular experiences with tobacco.  As somebody who has not smoked a cigarette since I was 18 or 19 years of age, my bona fides will be reasonably clear on this matter.</P>
      <P>May I say at the beginning that Senator Ryan made the point about the lobbying by various groups.  Surely he would accept, as we all accept, that every interest group and every group of people in the country have the right to lobby and to put their case.  Because one group does so and one may not agree with the objectives of the group, that does not undermine or in any way mitigate their right to do so.  On that question, I think that the success of this particular lobby can be gauged from the fact that there is virtually no support in either House for their objectives.  What I have seen of the lobbying has been well done and professionally done, but it certainly seems to be out of tune with the majority opinion as expressed in both the Dáil and in this House.</P>
      <P>I find myself very much out of tune with this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to my liberal colleagues from my own party and on the Indepentent benches.  I find coming from them cries for greater regulations, more control, more sanctions, more prohibition, more State interference and more interference in the rights of the individual.  Listening to my good friend Senator Ryan, I felt I could have been back with Cromwell's Puritans, such were the moral sanctions thundering from him and his overwhelming and passionate desire to make us all good, whether we want to be good or not.  The sort of heaven Senator Ryan would have <Col N="1753" /> us all inhabit would be one in which we were sanctioned and regulated and where, in fact, we did not have the opportunity to do what was wrong or deviant, if that word can be used here any more. I find myself speaking on this Bill somewhat as an old-fashioned but incorrigible liberal.</P>
      <P>I do not like this legislation.  I applaud very much the objectives of the Minister. I recognise his concern and his sincerity. I recognise the very humane set of values he brings to bear on the discharge of his duties in the Department of Health.  I also recognise the scale of the problem. I recognise the extent of medical and scientific evidence upon which this legislation is based.  I recognise all of that and I accept it.  What I do not like are the methods in parts of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Ryan, I think this Bill goes too far.  I, personally, prefer a régime of education, persuasion, of cajoling and of reason.  I prefer that to a régime of coercion and prohibition.  My big quibble with this Bill is that in certain areas only the element of prohibition, rather than the element of restriction, is introduced. As I say, it is this almost philosophical point which lies at the root of my personal feeling of unease about this Bill.  I often wonder what the great parliamentary liberals of this State &mdash; and I am including people like Seán McEntee and James Dillion &mdash; who believed that the role of the State should be a restricted one and that the State should not over-interfere, would feel about this legislation. I feel they would see it as a dangerous set of powers to give to any Minister or to any set of officials.  It is on that point that my opposition to this legislation rests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I am in a minority in taking up this particular point.  I certainly can accept large sections of this Bill which are designed to remove the discomfort which non-smokers feel in the presence of smokers.  I can applaud every single step that is taken to ensure that non-smokers are protected as far as possible, <Col N="1754" /> but I believe that smokers, too, have rights.  I would share Senator Ryan's objective.  I would like to see a situation where our grandchildren would talk about smoking as if it was something which was some sort of historical curiosity. Indeed, we may well be moving somewhat in that direction if one looks back at the old advertisements for the 1920s and the 1930s and at one in particular where a lady is seen with a cigarette saying that she can smoke 40 Craven A a day and does not have the trace of a cough as a result of it, and where the people in top hats and so forth were always seen with cigarettes.</P>
    <P>If we look back at the so-called society photographs, or photographs of politicians there was a difference in the twenties, thirties and the forties.  Invariably, large numbers of them were seen smoking cigarettes.  They were photographed with cigarettes.  Today very few politicians want to be seen smoking cigarettes. Certainly at functions and so forth, the people who are smoking will put the cigarette in one hand and the glass of gin and tonic in the other behind their backs while the cameraman is hovering about.  Apparently it is not good to be seen with these things.  There has been a great change in public attitudes and public opinion.</P>
    <P>I would share Senator Ryan's objective that we would reach a stage where smoking would be very much a thing of the past and would be roughly at the same stage that snuff taking is at the present. I do not believe we are going to get that way by the type of blanket prohibitions which are included in part of this Bill.  I am saying to the Minister to have restrictions by all means and to have education and heavier taxes.  He could double the taxes on cigarettes and on tobacco.  I do not care if he does that.  It is all to the good.  If the Minister wants to have smokers wearing some sort of an armband, fair enough.  Let them wear the armband so that people can be warned of their presence.  It is prohibition which I do not <Col N="1755" /> like.  There is an element in this which allows for total prohibition in certain areas.  It is that which I worry about.</P>
    <P>I am also a bit concerned about the rights of those who chew tobacco.  I have not met a person for many years who chews tobacco, but I am told there is a small, hardy minority of people who still chew tobacco, under this draconian legislation their rights are being infringed.  Perhaps their aim might be a little bit uncertain at times when there is not a spittoon handy but I do not see these people infringing the rights, even of Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again to look at the rights of the tobacco chewers and to think a little bit that perhaps this legislation may go a little bit too far.  I have put down a number of amendments which I will be discussing on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Yesterday when I spoke on the Forestry Bill I expressed the view that the fact that there seemed to be such amazing all-party consensus of approval for it made me very, very suspicious of the Bill.  In fact, I was using the same standards for looking at this Bill until Senator Manning got up to speak.  I now feel reasonably happy that the Bill is satisfactory and we should all be able to welcome it with open arms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It was refreshing to hear that the only vice Senator Manning does not indulge in is cigarettes.  He can correct me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give this Bill a general, principal welcome but not a particularly detailed welcome.  The sort of welcome it has got in both Houses of the Oireachtas is indicative of a very significant shift in public opinion about smoking.  The tobacco companies, despite all their lobbying, the articles they have commissioned and all the research <Col N="1756" /> they have done, have probably lost the propaganda war about smoking.  They put up a pretty good fight.  They were probably on a losing wicket anyway. Some of the interesting figures which the Minister quoted in his speech this afternoon would indicate that the tide has turned against smokers.  Fewer people are smoking.  Fewer young people want to smoke.  More significantly, smokers themselves express a very strong desire not to smoke.  In that way we are certainly moving in the right direction.  Legislation is necessary, but I believe what successive Governments have done, what individual people have done, has pushed back the demand for cigarettes.  That does not mean that this Bill is unnecessary.  It is absolutely necessary.  It is a very good Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on the principle which all good, old-fashioned or new fangled Liberals believe in, which is that you have the right to do what you like to damage yourself but not to damage other people. That is a basically sound principle. People's private behaviour is something with which the Government should not interfere, but if what they are doing is harmful to others the Government have a right, on behalf of those other people, to interfere.</P>
    <P>I know about the problems of cigarettes. I was a very heavy smoker.  I was smoking up to 100 cigarettes a day for a very long time.  I fully understand the real problems which smokers have.  It is a serious and difficult addiction.  It is as hard an addiction to dispose of as any other addiction.  Many doctors will tell you that smoking is harder to give up than heroin or any other hard drug.  It may not be as harmful, but it is certainly a very serious problem.  Those who continue to smoke do not deserve to be ostracised, or to be looked down on, or to be disapproved of.  It is a matter of great sympathy.  They have developed a habit which they will find it very difficult to give up.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill is very relevant.  I <Col N="1757" /> remember quite simply, as a heavy smoker, that it certainly affects your life. I felt a great reluctance to go to the theatre because I could not smoke at the theatre.  Quite often I felt a great reluctance to go to dinner in other people's houses, simply because it was bad manners to smoke in their houses without permission and they did not want to give it.  I felt a great reluctance to go to formal dinners where you were not meant to smoke.  Indeed, it could be given as an explanation for my non-attendance in this House in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly a deterrent and it was an incentive to get out on certain occasions because smoking was not allowed in this House.  I want to underline the fact that smokers have a real problem about prohibition and about where they smoke and where they do not smoke.  If these regulations, which are not very specific, are enforced by the Minister here today, they will create more problems for those people who smoke.  There will be plenty of areas and plenty of activities in which they will no longer be allowed to indulge.  On balance, I think that is fair because they are harming their fellow citizens by smoking.  We should realise that his Bill will discriminate against smokers in a fairly heavy way.  They will feel the effect of it because they will be deprived of doing things and going to places to which they would normally go.  So long as the House is aware of the fact that it is discriminating against these people, I think the Bill should be passed.</P>
      <P>From some of the speeches one might not think that the House was totally aware that there was very scant sympathy for smokers and that they were people who were, to a certain extent, outside the Pale.  I do not think we should regard it as that.  This Bill is a measure which is here to protect those who do not smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> The House concentrated a good deal on the ministerial regulations during the past two or three days.  Instinctively, I do not like ministerial regulations because they give the Minister involved too much discretionary power.  I do not see why this Bill should not put down, in black and white, exactly what is intended.  Section 2 gives certain categories of places where the Minister may use the powers in this Bill.  They are very wide categories.  If we give the Minister these powers we will put him, first, in a too powerful situation and, secondly, into an invidious situation. The whole principle of ministerial regulations, where we can put down specific rules in black and white in legislation is fair enough.  We could quite easily ban cigarette smoking in specific areas, make it law and make it amendable only by law.</P>
    <P>I am objecting to the principle of giving the Minister or any other Minister these powers.  It makes this Minister and any other Ministers in the future subject to unfair pressures.  It means that the Minister has discretionary powers which he can use, subject to further lobbying and further discretion.  It would be far easier if this Bill were passed in this House with all that is going to be embodied in those regulations in it.  Then there would be no further discussion.  There would be no further lobbying.  There would be no further pressures brought to bear.  I think specifically of the tobacco industry, not because I have any axe to grind with it because if I was involved in the tobacco industry &mdash; if I was a shareholder, which I am not, or in any way involved as a businessman &mdash; I would see these regulations and I would continue to lobby after these regulations are passed by this House, because it gives me that scope to do so.  It is a pity the Minister has done this, because he leaves that opening for those sorts of pressures.</P>
    <P>The Bill also leaves openings &mdash; I underline the fact that it does not apply to this Minister in particular &mdash; for politicians from all sides of this House, now <Col N="1759" /> and in the future, to lobby for specific exclusions in theirs area or in their business. By the very nature of things politicians from all sides are constantly involved in lobbying for specific, identifiable causes.  As a result of these regulations, we will have an opening left for politicians to lobby for favours and Ministers coming under pressures which, in some cases, could be irresistible.  That is a danger which is of a more general sort in fact than what is specifically attached to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have seen a large number of Bills going through the House which are subject to ministerial regulations.  In all cases this is open to the sort of pressure and corruption which I would prefer not to see and which would not be there if as much as possible was encompassed in the legislation itself.  This Bill will be here for many years to come probably.  Those regulations will be there.  Future Ministers will be subject to that sort of pressure for maybe 20 or 25 years.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of humbug about the introduction of a Bill of this sort in the Houses.  Whereas the Minister's speech, and nearly all the speeches involved, welcome this Bill which is there to protect the health of non-smokers &mdash; and we all welcome it for that reason &mdash; little has been said in this debate about the amount of revenue which actually comes to the Exchequer from cigarettes. That other side of the balance sheet has not been mentioned.  It is imperative that we recognise the real power of the cigarette industry.  The amount of revenue which comes to the Exchequer from cigarettes is probably indispensable to the Government at this stage.  It would be very difficult for the Government, even if we wanted to, to dispense with that revenue.</P>
    <P>What Senator Ryan was saying &mdash; and I think many of us are in sympathy with it &mdash; is that he would like to see cigarettes phased out and that the ultimate objective of this country, European countries <Col N="1760" /> and of the international world should be that the whole tobacco industry would really be a thing of the past.  The tobacco industry, as far as we know, is something which is harmful to human beings and harmful to their health.  The honest answer to that is that the tobacco industry has got such a grip on our society and on people and on Governments that nobody can really give it up.  The Government are just as addicted to tobacco as are individual smokers.  It would be brave and courageous and enlightened if the Government had a future plan for the cigarette industry, to phase it out.  It is all very well to say that the Government will take as many preventative measures as possible.</P>
    <P>What the Government, I suspect, are doing is accepting cigarette smoking as a fact of life, but reducing it to an acceptable level which does not really affect its revenue too much.  It would be a brave decision for the Government to say: &ldquo;We disapprove of cigarettes and we want to see them phased out completely and utterly&rdquo;.  There are several ways of doing it, but it involves a fundamental rethink to do that.  It also involves a fundamental moral rethink as well because it may also infringe on the liberties of the individual. What Senator Ryan was saying was correct in that we should aim towards that objective.  We should aim towards that objective in a fairly concrete way without expecting it to happen overnight.  We should look at the revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the revenue is from tobacco and I should know having come to this House.  It is far heavier than the estimated £50 million that it costs to treat those affected by it, and maybe the extra £50 million for ancillary reasons.  It is far heavier than that.  If we go too far in this we would start phasing out anything that is unhealthy for people such as eating cream.  We would be infringing the rights of the individual to an excessive extent. One very eminent member of a former Government advocated to me quite <Col N="1761" /> recently that it was an appalling infringement of the rights of the individual.  He also went on to say that he believes that heroin and other hard drugs should be allowed freely to circulate on the streets.</P>
    <P>There were two reasons for that: one, because of the infringement of the individual and, second, because he thought less damage would be done if it was on the ground.  This area is something that we should think about.  I would be in favour of phasing it out.  I see the real dangers in not allowing people to do the damage to themselves that they want to. I see the real virtue in the argument that all of these particularly harmful drugs should, as a principle, be allowed on the streets.  This is something we should look at.  It is certainly not the attitude we see in this Bill and I approve of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while it is laudable in its objectives and while its particular impositions are probably too light in some ways, has what appear to be some very basic flaws.  The first basic flaw is the element of enforcement and detection.  I really do not see any provision in the Bill for the enforcement of these particular rules.  It is a bad law which is made which cannot be enforced.  We have in the area of drink and tobacco a lot of laws which traditionally have not been and cannot be enforced.  Everybody remembers, if they are honest, as a child buying cigarettes in ones and twos which is now outlawed in this Bill.  Shopkeepers openly and universally are allowing children to buy cigarettes.  It is going to be very difficult to prevent this sort of behaviour in the near future.  It is all very well legislating and expressing official disaproval of smoking in certain places or of young people smoking, but I do not see too many signs of the likelihood of this legislation being enforced.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; that all Departments are understaffed at this time and that there is no money left in the Exchequer to police this sort of Act.  We have a real <Col N="1762" /> difficulty here, but it should be recognised. Take a particular area, which is the area of children not being allowed to use vending machines.  That will be impossible to enforce.  Vending machines would be something that most young children would find interesting and experimental. That Bill will not be enforced unless it is carefully and thoroughly policed by the Minister, his Department or by the Department of Justice.  What may happen in this case is that if these rules are not enforced a gradual abuse will grow up with these rules.  I would hate to see that sort of development.  It will set back the sort of thinking on cigarettes and abuse of this sort in the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome, not like Senator Manning, the ban on oral smokeless products.  I welcome them quite simply because as the Minister says in his speech, that they are proven, as far we can prove, to cause cancer.  I cannot see any reason whatsoever why you can possibly encourage these types of things to come into the country when they are as harmful as that. I can see the liberal thinking about old fashioned freedoms, but I see very little point in exposing people to something new which is proved by those who know more about it than ourselves to be harmful. It seems that these particular oral smokeless products are recognised by many medical researchers to be cancer-producing. That is the final and only argument about whether they should be allowed.  I would have thought that it was quite simple that there is no point in allowing them in, if they are going to do nothing but damage.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said earlier this afternoon that cigarette smoking itself would have been banned if we had known what its effects were when it came into existence. It is since about 1945-1950 that we really realised the appalling damage it can do in terms of multiple human diseases. Had that been know in advance, before cigarettes had been invented and come on the market, the extraordinary damage that smoking would do to human <Col N="1763" /> health they would have been banned.  I suppose a cynical Government, had they known they would have collected so much revenue, might have been in two minds about it.  On balance Governments have been responsible about this and would, in fact, have banned cigarettes had they known what their effects were going to be.  That is not the case, will not be the case and that cannot be the case now.  To introduce new and highly damaging products would be foolhardy when we have the chance to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I resent the arguments put forward by the tobacco companies that a great deal of employment is involved and that to scale down in any way will involve unemployment.  That is a highly emotional, very seductive argument which is very difficult to counter.  It is especially difficult for politicians in different areas to counter it.  It is a form of political and emotional blackmail to say this because politicians must react to that sort of argument.  We have to ask, if we are going to take note of that argument: at what price can we have employment? We cannot have employment at the price of other people's health.  Otherwise, if we take that principle to its logical conclusion, we could have an opium or a heroin factory just outside the door here giving massive employment to many people.  It is a spurious argument and one which I would urge my fellow politicians to stand up to.  I know it is difficult for them.  I do not have that sort of problem in my constituency but I recognise that it is much harder for them to stand up to it if the tobacco industry is operating in their constituency.</P>
    <P>In general and principle I would like to welcome this Bill.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to look at amendments on Committee Stage.  That may involve going back to the Dáil, which Ministers seem to be somewhat reluctant to do for some reasons.  It has been a constructive debate.  In general the Bill is a good Bill <Col N="1764" /> and one more stage towards a more healthy country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that, in referring to the problems of job creation associated with the tobacco industry, this kind of legislation creates a problem for somebody who might be representing somewhere like Dundalk where there are many jobs dependent on the tobacco industry.  Apart from that, most people take a very clear and simple view that tobacco smoking damages the health of the nation in general and therefore we should legislate against it.  I do not know if anybody referred to it earlier, but there is a very interesting comic record of somebody who is supposedly Sir Walter Raleigh on the phone from Virginia in the Middle Ages or in the 17th century, phoning back to base in London.  The conversation is sort of one-sided but it is like this: &ldquo;What are you up to now, Walter?  You want to send us back some particular product or some particular commodity?&rdquo;  The story at this stage is that poor old Walter is not feeling well, maybe overtired, or emotional, or whatever because he cannot be serious with his next suggestion.  He wants to send back a cargo of leaves.  They put down the telephone at the other end and say: &ldquo;Poor old Walter is not too well, obviously. The sunshine in the colonies is getting to him.  He wants to send us back a cargo of leaves and we should indulge him somewhat&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that point they say: &ldquo;Walter, what do you think we should do with a cargo of leaves?&rdquo;  He says &ldquo;You take each leaf and dry it and roll it up and then you stick it...&rdquo; and somebody interrupts and says: &ldquo;Do not tell us, Walter; let us guess this one.  You stick it in your ear?  No, better again, you stick it in your mouth.  OK Walter, but what do you do with it when you stick it in your mouth?&rdquo;  He says &ldquo;Then you light it&rdquo;.  At this stage the general view is that poor old Walter has lost his marbles.  Eventually he tells them that not only do you light it but that you <Col N="1765" /> inhale the smoke and take it into your body.  Unfortunately they tell him to send back a cargo and they will have a look at it.</P>
    <P>It sounds so incredible, but if you think back only ten years ago, the idea of somebody ringing up and saying: &ldquo;Would you send me over a tanker ship full of Irish water?&rdquo;  it would probably have sounded just as unimaginable.  Somebody saying ten years ago that within a decade we would have a public company whose sole objective would be the sale of Irish water abroad would seem incredible.  Nowadays, if somebody said: &ldquo;We can sell bottles of Irish air&rdquo; it would probably sound just as incredible.  Who knows what might happen next?  I have heard a proposal that square footage of the old sod might be sold abroad.  The power of advertising is everything.</P>
    <P>In regard to this legislation, there has been confusion on some of the points made about interference with personal rights, etc., particularly Senators Manning's presentation where he said that as an old-fashioned Liberal he found that this smacked too much of State interference. I certainly know his party's view on a sort of hands-on status thing he would find very difficult.  We should look in more detail at this legislation which has to do with the common good.  It certainly is quite clear to me that we have to have this type of legislation.  I will deal, as I go along, with how effective I think it might be.</P>
    <P>At a recent conference I attended in the Council of Europe on the question of drugs abuse, the question came up about the effects of smoking in public places. While the Irish, English, German and particularly the southern Europeans who must be the world's greatest smokers were talking about the effects or otherwise of public smoking and whether or not it might be banned or legislated against, the people from the Scandinavian countries, particularly from Sweden, found it totally incomprehensible that in this day and age <Col N="1766" /> people would even consider smoking in public.  They have reached that level of maturity where, not only do they not need to legislate against smoking in public places in some of the Scandinavian countries but, in fact, it would be unthinkable for anybody to light up a cigarette in a public place.  Really that should be the objective.  The objective should be to get the results of this legislation without having to legislate for them.  I do not know whether that is possible but that must be the objective in the long term.  In other words, our objective must be to make this legislation redundant as quickly as possible when there is no longer any need for it.</P>
    <P>Times do change.  It is correct and as responsible to consider legislation in this area as it is in many others.  The Minister gave some quite appalling statistics on the effects on general health and mortality rates of smoking.  I will not repeat them but that is the kind of information not enough people have.  The facts speak for themselves.  If the number of deaths on the road each year were at the same level or range as those associated with smoking and tobacco, there would be outrage in the community.  We would probably almost consider banning cars from the roads if that was what it took.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths on the road is very small compared with those which are associated with, arise from or develop from smoking.  Still, I do not think Senator Manning would say that, by encouraging speed limits, or setting up stop signs, or by asking people to drive on the left hand side of the road, we were interfering excessively with the rights of the individual.  We would consider it to be commonsense.  This legislation is an attempt to apply commensense to the regulation of our lives.  I can go down through aspects of it and say I disagree with that, or this, or another part of it. In general the legislation has to be welcomed. More than that, the proposal to have the legislation is to be welcomed; the initiative that brought forward the <Col N="1767" /> legislation is to be welcomed.  For that, I congratulate the Minister.  Even if I were to find fault with every section of the Bill, I would certainly support his right to bring it before us.  Not only that but there is need to have such legislation before us.</P>
    <P>I have in my office an advertisement for the public sale of heroin, an advertisement dated 1914, by a company which is one of the major international drugs companies to this day.  It was advertised as a cure for various minor ailments like influenza and depression.  The argument that we should never legislate for passive smoking and tobacco is just as relevant as saying we should never have criminalised or regulated the supply of heroin.  I know that there are some lunatics &mdash; and I would call them nothing else &mdash; in Europe and apparently in Ireland in the last couple of weeks who have talked about the decriminalisation of drugs.  They are people who have no understanding whatsoever of the effects of hard drugs and their availability etc. One of the proposals in the European Parliament is that heroin should be on sale on street corners and street corner shops, with tobacconists and newsagents selling it.  Making it freely available would in the long term decriminalise it and there would be fewer people dying from it, it was suggested.  That is absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>In the same way as we regulate for the movement of dangerous substances, this in what we are talking about here.  We are talking about the effects of a dangerous substance in the same way as we would legislate against air pollution or to control the cleanliness of the air &mdash; and I would ask for that.  Similarly, we would make certain demands in order to prevent contagious or infectious illnesses I think this is what we are talking about here.  If somebody is smoking in a room or a number of persons are smoking in a room and this leads to the passive inhalation of the smoke and consequently creates damage to the health of people who are not smoking, it seems to me there is no <Col N="1768" /> conflict of rights there.  We are not saying to the smoker: &ldquo;You may not smoke&rdquo;. We are saying to the smoker: &ldquo;You may not smoke where it can damage the health of other people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have already tried in previous legislation by the stamping on each package of cigarettes, &ldquo;This is damaging to health&rdquo; or whatever the slogan is, to protect smokers from themselves.  Now what we are trying to do is protect the non-smoker. We are trying to do it in such a way as not to interfere with the rights of the smoker.  Talking about smokers' rights is almost like saying people have the right to suicide or the right to control their own lives or the right to regulate whether they live or die.  There is another huge area there and I do not propose to get into that.  I think it is important to see this legislation in the context in which it is presented.  It is not presented in the sense of restricting those people who indulge in smoking.  It is meant to protect those people who do not smoke.  That is really what it sets out to do.  Going through the Bill we find there are efforts made particularly to control the supply of tobacco to young people, to non-smokers. I think that is a wasted effort.  I do not think it will get anywhere: my views on this kind of thing are well known.  I do not believe, and I say it <i>ad nauseum,</i> that we will solve in any way drugs abuse or misuse by trying to control the supply. We have a certain duty to control it at a general level but there is no way we can say we will take every person in Ireland under the age of 14 and we will now start off on a project to ensure that they can never get their hands on a cigarette and therefore they will never smoke.  That is utter nonsense.  It does no work.  It is the weakest part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A recent report from the European Parliament in the same area of the control of drugs, talked about asking the farmers of Bolivia and Peru and places like that not to grow the coca leaf but to grow vegetables and everything else and they would be guaranteed a market for those <Col N="1769" /> vegetables in Europe.  It has no chance of working, of course.  Nobody is going to do that because there is no demand for those vegetables in Europe.  They only give one-twentieth of the income that the coca leaf would give to them.  It just does not work.</P>
    <P>Even if you stop the supply of drugs people will find another drug.  There are plenty of them.  One example &mdash; about alcohol rather than tobacco but it is relevant &mdash; I saw a situation within the last two years where the supply of alcohol to young primary school children was stopped. The source of supply was stopped and it was stopped successfully for a month or two but now the same children in the same area are drinking happily every night.  They are drinking now because the drink is being supplied to them by their older brothers or sisters who, over age 18 go in and buy it and sell it of a profit to the younger ones.  Young people will get around legislation like that.  I see the good intention of it but it is purely a good intention and it will not work.</P>
    <P>Trying to control the supply of a substance and in that way, hoping that the people will not abuse it, does not work. It is not the supply we need to look at; it is the demand.  We need to ask why are people smoking.  Why are they approaching cigarettes and how do we go about preventing it?  What this Bill approaches is to try to get them out of the ambience of smoking, to try to get smoking away from the places where they are likely to be, such as schools, and I will make a passing reference to that in a few minutes.  It seems to me that instead of trying to control the supply we should address ourselves to the demand.  We should ask why do young people smoke or why does any person smoke and what are we doing about it.  Instead of trying to restrict access to tobacco we should educate people away from the use of tobacco.  Instead of trying to criminalise in certain ways passive or other smoking we should try to educate people away <Col N="1770" /> from inflicting the results of their bad habit on other people.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister could stand up and say he agrees totally with what I am saying and I have no doubt about that.  That would be his own personal view.  I suppose this legislation for that reason represents a certain fatalism.  I have no doubt that, were I sitting where he is sitting, I would talking in similar terms because I am talking about a Utopian concept, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, working to make this legislation, however good it is, redundant, unnecessary, something that we can take off the Statute Book at some stage. That can only be done by a massive programme of preventive education.</P>
    <P>There is &mdash; and Senator Ross touched on this &mdash; a mass of conflict for Government in this.  The Minister will deny this, I have no doubt.  It we were to lose tomorrow morning the income we get through the imposition of taxation or duty on cigarettes we would certainly be in a fair mess financially next year in trying to balance the books of the State.  We are now in a situation where, as a community in the sense that the Government represent the will of the community, we are opposed to the use of cigarettes.  We think they are bad for the health of the nation, if such a thing exists, and that we are therefore trying in every sense possible to stop the use of cigarettes, to stop people from smoking.  On the other hand, we are dependent on the revenue which derives to the Exchequer from people smoking.  The more successful we are in this effort to stop people smoking the less our income will be.  In trying to justify that, we do things like organise major programmes of preventive health education.</P>
    <P>This is an absolutely &ldquo;no win&rdquo; situation. I think the money we spend on advertising to tell people to stop smoking is wasted.  I do not think it works at all because the tobacco companies have about 100 times &mdash; I could not put my finger on the precise figures today but <Col N="1771" /> they are easily enough found &mdash; the amount of money available for advertising their product that the Minister will have at his disposal to organise campaigns against smoking.  We are in a totally &ldquo;no win&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that we should put an end to advertising for smoking.  It should be forbidden.  The advertising of cigarettes should be forbidden.  I do not believe drink should be advertised on RTE or on television.  That is something that we cannot live with any longer.  It should just be taken off despite the regulations that are there.  It certainly is to me important that we would look down the road and, in looking down the road, say that we can no longer tolerate a situation where it is quite legal to push and promote an activity which is so seriously damaging to the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>We look at the potential damage of Sellafield.  There was unanimous agreement in this House that we oppose it. Smoking is potentially as damaging to the health of the nation.  I do not think, therefore, that we should be allowed to place advertisements in publications in order to get people more involved in such a negative habit.  I could develop that at some length.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the question of the regulations in schools.  I was interviewed about two years ago on Ash Wednesday at the beginning of the campaigns against smoking.  I thought they were excellent campaigns because they directed the nation's attention to the problem.  That kind of prevention campaign is better than the long-term placing of advertisements.  That is my personal view in terms of the impact on people.  I was interviewed in my capacity as school principal about my view on the campaign against cigarette smoking, trying to make Ash Wednesday a no-smoking day.  I gave my views on it fairly trenchantly but towards the end of the interview John Bowman asked: &ldquo;What would your view be on smoking in schools for instance? <Col N="1772" /> You are in charge of a school with 300 pupils in it.  What would your view be? Would you insist that smoking would only taken place in the staff-room of your school?&rdquo;.  My answer to him was in a sense rather jocular but there was a lot of commitment in what I was saying.  My answer to him was: &ldquo;John, if I had my way, they could smoke everywhere in the school except in the staff-room because those of us who do not smoke are there, and must put up with the effects of the smoking&rdquo;.  The worst time of the day for non-smoking teachers &mdash; because teachers do not smoke in classrooms; neither would I be recommending that they should smoke in classrooms &mdash; is when they come into the staff-room for their break times and those who smoke feel this great, intense need for a cigarette and those who do not smoke have to suffer during that period.  I often wonder whose rights are infringed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea of regulating tobacco in schools.  Because there are adults, teachers, involved, you will note that this would also put extra pressure on those in control, the teachers etc. to see that this legislation was implemented. The response of teachers will be: &ldquo;I wish the Government would take as much care to make schools a little bit less stressful and a little bit less difficult so that there would not be as great a demand, certainly by the teaching staff, for cigarettes or some form of drugs in order to calm them down at the end of the day's work or during the breaks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the various restrictions that are in the proposed legislation I do not believe that they are restrictions on personal rights.  I do not think anybody would say that they put such demands on the smoker as to be an interference with him or her going about their normal day-to-day work.  I think, however, that in terms of what this is likely to achieve, it will raise by one more notch the awareness of ordinary citizens to the dangers of smoking.  If it did nothing more than that it would be very useful and very <Col N="1773" /> welcome legislation.  There are sections here and there that I would not be completely happy with.  I certainly compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation and seeking to address a problem within the constraints that any Minister for Health will work under at any particular time.  It is long overdue legislation.  As a non-smoker I welcome the fact that the Government sets out to protect my space as well from those people who seek to pollute the air around me.  It will be seen in general as progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Senators for what has been a very constructive debate on this legislation here this afternoon.  I would like at this stage to go through some of the points that were raised and to respond to them.  Perhaps I can take them in order.  Senator Fennell mentioned the experience of her son in Australia recently and the point she made underlines the fact that when you do apply certain conditions you achieve the results which you wish to achieve.  We have seen the example here in our own country where, voluntarily, both on the DART and on Dublin Bus there is now no smoking. That is in advance of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fennell also mentioned that the functions of the Health Education Bureau had been transferred to the Department of Health.  I was surprised when she said that she was unaware of the new Health Promotion Unit and what they had been doing, because in the short period of six months they have taken the intitiatve in three major campaigns. There is the Cleanwatch campaign aimed at improving the standard of food hygiene, one that is looking for co-operation between the vendor and the customer and has the support of all the various interest groups in the country including Bord Fáilte, the vintners, the grocers and hotels federation.  I would have thought that particular programme did get a lot of publicity at the time and <Col N="1774" /> I am glad to say it is working very effectively, which is evidenced by the number of cleanwatch stickers that one sees in the food outlets.  Hopefully, in that campaign people will look for those stickers when they go to a food outlets to ensure that the vendor is supportive in looking for better food hygiene.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit were involved along with the Commission of the European Community and the Irish Cancer Society in the Information Week against Cancer in May and would be very much involved in the programme for the European Year against Cancer in 1989.  A third project that the Health Promotion Unit have been involved in is the provision of a major programme for those involved with drug abusers and those who abuse alcohol and it is hoped to have 200 convenors trained by the various health boards by the end of this year.  At the present time the Health Promotion Unit are planning a major campagn aimed at tobacco consumption which it is hoped to run later this year and they are researching the best nature for that campaign.  In relation to the role models such as sports persons in the fight against tobacco consumption, the current tobacco legislation is such that the use of role models in advertising is prohibited.  The Health Promotion Unit is considering all possible approaches such as the use of role models in the anti-smoking campaign but for the promotion of tobacco they are prohibited. As regards smoking in schools, section 2 (c) of the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations to ban or restrict smoking in any part of the school. I agree entirely with Sentors Murphy and Fennell that teachers should be encouraged not to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore mentioned the possible difficulties in enforcing section 3 of the Bill relating to vending machines.  Senator Ross also referred to vending machines, as I said in my opening address, the section is drafted to ensure that vending machines are properly <Col N="1775" /> supervised in relation to the sale of cigarettes to young persons.  When drafting the Bill there were three options open to me: to do nothing, to ban the use of vending machines altogether or to provide for the proper supervision of the machines..</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity of raising the matter of the allocation of national lottery funds to a project in my area, namely, the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly.  Graiguenamanagh, as the Minister is aware, is a town in County Kilkenny, on the banks of the River Barrow and in the shade of Brandon Hill.  Today Graiguenamanagh is very conscious and proud of its history and traditions and is seeking to pay due regard to the welfare of its senior citizens.  Through their hard work the parishioners enjoy a way of life and an ambience that is unique to Graiguenamanagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 a group of concerned parishioners in Graiguenamanagh and the surrounding area came together with the idea of building a home where the senior citizens of the parish, including Skeaghvasteen and Tinahinch, could live out their lives happily within their own community. A committee was formed to explore ways and means to realise this dream and despite formidable obstacles it was decided to undertake the task.  A survey was carried out to establish the need within the parish and it was found that a development of eight self-contained houses, coupled with a residential home for 12 people, would satisfy the requirements, where 20 elderly people, not in need of hospital care, could live in Graiguenamanagh independently.  Visits were made to various centres of a similar <Col N="1777" /> nature which catered for the elderly throughout Kilkenny and other countries.</P>
    <P>A series of meetings were held with officials of Kilkenny County Council and the South Eastern Health Board, first to inform them of the intention to go ahead with this project and later to establish the amount of grant-aid that would be available from those statutory bodies to assist the project.  A commitment was given by both the health board and Kilkenny County Council to back this project.  Percentages were agreed and the green light was given to proceed with the development.</P>
    <P>A major fund-raising drive was launched by the community which included members' draws, auctions, field days and a myriad of other activities resulting in a total of £100,000 being raised locally by that committee.  Thanks to a generous benefactor, Michael Gahan of Coolyhune, Graiguenamanagh, a site was donated to the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly at High Street, Graiguenamanagh.  Kilkenny County Council are funding 80 per cent of the development cost of the self-contained sheltered housing and the South Eastern Health Board are funding 50 per cent of the residential home, both on a start-up and on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Architects, Tritschler, Tritschler and Associates were appointed in 1987.  Plans were prepared and the contract was signed on 11 April 1988 with the builders, Byrne and Byrne of Bunclody, County Wexford.  Work on the project was started shortly after that date and is proceeding according to plan.  Requests were made to the Minister for Health to receive a delegation from the association. In November 1987 he received three members of the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly at his home in County Monaghan, following which he undertook to examine the situation regarding funding for this health project from the national lottery.  Requests were made for a further delegation to be <Col N="1778" /> allowed to meet the Minister but to date that request has not been granted and the necessary funds that are essential for this project have not been made available to Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the financial figures involved in this project is as follows.  The overall cost of the project is £450,000. Local fund-raising, including the site value and the sheltered housing grant from Kilkenny County Council, amounts to £280,000 and therefore the amount due from the South Eastern Health Board is £170,000.  I understand that in the last few days an interim payment from the national lottery to the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly has been sanctioned by the Minister's Department.  Although the committee have been informing various individuals over a period of time that money would be available from the lottery, to date no cheque has been lodged to their account.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that unless the cheque is lodged to the account the people will not be satisfied.  Seeing is actually believing, particularly in relation to finance, in the context of the times in which we are living.</P>
    <P>We fully appreciate that there will be many demands on the Minister's Department to provide lottery funds to many health projects throughout the country but the South Eastern Health Board consider this project of such importance that they have placed it on top of the list of their health project funding from the national lottery in 1988.  I am taking this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to intervene in order to ensure that the interim payment he has sanctioned will be paid immediately to the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly and that future amounts of money which will be required to complete the project will be made available by him without any delay.  The Minister will <Col N="1779" /> appreciate that the real essence of community care is enshrined in this development.</P>
    <P>A home for the elderly, in a community like Graiguenamanagh, can be provided at a low cost in comparison to a State-run geriatric unit under the hospital system. Taking this fact into account, coupled with the fact that the development is totally in line with Government policy relating to community care and it is within seven months of becoming a reality, I am taking the opportunity of urgently requesting that the Minister takes this action to allow the South Eastern Health Board to fund their section of the project as soon as possible so that stop will not be put to what is seen as probably the greatest development in the Graiguenamanagh area since the restoration of the Cistercian Abbey, known locally as Duaisc Abbey.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous community spirit in the area and this was exemplified by the enormous amount of money that was collected locally to restore that abbey.  The target the people have set <Col N="1780" /> themselves in order to provide proper facilities for the elderly in that area is a further example of the spirit in the community in Graiguenamanagh.  I hope, and I know, that the Minister will not let these people down on this occasion and I look forward to his reply on the matter.</P>

      <P>The project as outlined by Senator Hogan, undertaken by the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly, was one of a number of projects submitted by the South Eastern Health Board for consideration for funding from the national lottery.  I am glad to be able to tell Senator Hogan that I have recently approved an allocation of £30,000 from the lottery funds for the project.  The money, as is normal, will not be paid directly to the association but will be paid in the very near future to the health board, to whom the Graiguenamanagh Association for the Elderly should apply.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 July 1988.</P>
