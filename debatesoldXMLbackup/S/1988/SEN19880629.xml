    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, and to come back to 4 and 5, and we will take item No. 7 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and resume business ordered from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the debate on item No. 1 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 11 a.m. by putting the necessary question from the Chair.</P>

      <P>Is the Order of Business agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>No. First, I do not think the Order of Business as given to us this morning is in any sense realistic.  There are six to seven major items proposed to be taken today and there is no way we can agree to that.  I do not know why the Leader of the House insists on giving us these as part of the day's work when there is no realistic way they can be got through.  Secondly, I will oppose the putting of the question on item No. 1 at 11 a.m.  This is thoroughly bad legislation and only last night in the debate did it emerge what a bad piece of work it is.  It is an entirely restrictive set of regulations which will ensure that virtually nobody will be in a position to apply for and get the special restaurant licence, so not <Col N="1374" /> alone will we be opposing its conclusion at 11 a.m., we will be opposing the regulations also.  Furthermore, I would like the Leader of the House to give us some indication in regard to what business it is intended to take between now and the recess so that the Opposition parties can plan their programme in an orderly way and so that we will not be faced with an avalanche of legislation pushed through at great speed at the end of the session. There is no reason for us to adjourn this week or next week; we want to do our duty properly; we want to see that the legislation is treated properly; we will fully co-operate in that, but we are not going to have things rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification from the Leader of the House.  I have no objection to all the items being listed.  It is being very optimistic but provided we have set the time to adjourn at 10 p.m. we will adjourn at 10 p.m., even if we have not reached all the items that have been listed.  There is nothing wrong with listing them for safety, because there is a lot of work to be done.  However, I object to the closure motion on item No. 1, particularly as the Minister promised, when he brought this legislation before the House, that both Houses would have the fullest facility to discuss these regulations and that they would not come into force until the Members had had an opportunity to discuss them.  Any one who wants to may check, but that is exactly what the Minister said.  Perhaps we might be finished but I would be loath to have a guillotine motion on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent group are very concerned about the restaurant licence legislation.  I certainly feel that it would be inappropriate to guillotine that motion.  It is a very complicated and bad piece of legislation and we will be saying why during the debate. <Col N="1375" /> We would certainly ask the Leader of the House to reconsider his proposal to finish the discussion on it.  We also feel that it will be impossible to cover those seven items today before 10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said from this side of the House.  It does seem to be unrealistic, but one would not wish to curb the optimism of the Leader of the House.  However, there is a much more serious objection and that is that there appears to be an attempt to impose a guillotine on the first item because we will have only about 20 minutes if he closes at 11 a.m.  I think it is very bad procedure to announce a guillotine in advance of a debate when we were promised a full debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say could possibly be irrelevant, if the Leader of the House has changed his mind about item No. 1.  As the person in possession on item No. 1, I feel extremely guilty about this because I spoke for about 40 minutes last night on this motion, having no idea that the guillotine was going to be imposed.  I am in possession and I am only half way through my speech; I am only half way through the regulations.  It is appalling legislation and I only realised this last night.  It would be quite ridiculous to let this go through on the &ldquo;nod&rdquo; and I would ask the Leader of the House &mdash; I know there are more Senators who wish to speak &mdash; to allow this to take its natural course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with my colleague's remarks.  As a legislator, I do not think I have seen anything so embarrassing come before this House as these draft regulations.  The idea that it will be nodded through on a rushed vote would compound that embarrassment. These regulations are an embarrassment to everybody in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They need to <Col N="1376" /> be substantially re-thought.  We need the time at least to put on the record our objections to these embarrasments.  It would be very offensive and very wrong to attempt to curtail the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is the division bell for the other House and we had trouble with this last night.  We are not even going to get started if the Minister is not here, because he will have to go to the division.  Perhaps the Leader of the House would take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take responsibility for suggesting that we finish this at 11 a.m. today.  Last night I listened to Senator Ross for 40 minutes talking about saucepans and frying pans.  I do not know why they should be brought into this debate and I hope that if he is going to speak today for 40 minutes he will talk about something else.  We have listed seven items for today.  There is no question of them being rushed through.  We may have time in between Bills and that is why we have seven items.  There is no question of rushing anything through but if we are going to continue for a very long time on item No. 1, it means that it is going to completely upset the Order of Business. I am sorry if I suggested that last night. It is all very fine for people to come here and say they do not mind if we sit next week or the week after, but that is not what they tell me outside.  Everyone wants to get finished as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whip, Senator Ryan, has put the situation regarding item No. 1 in perspective.  These are draft regulations that are coming before us and I appeal to speakers to be relevant to the Order and not spend, as Senator Ross did, 40 minutes speaking on matters not totally relevant to the Order.  The draft regulations are not an embarrassment to this House, the Orders are relevant to the restaurant licence regulations and I do not feel they are unrealistic or that we should worry too much about an embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no suggestion that we are <Col N="1377" /> going to rush anything through today.  I have listed a number of items.  There is no suggestion that we are going to finish any of these items today, but they are listed.  As far as the sitting is concerned, some of the Senators, as Senator Willie Ryan has said, who suggest that we are rushing business through here might not be here the week after next, or in two or three weeks time when we will still be sitting.  Senator Bulbulia asked yesterday about the Bankruptcy Bill.  The Bankruptcy Bill will be before us before we conclude business for this session.  The Tobacco Bill and the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Bill will also be taken.  We will be taking the Tobacco Bill tomorrow.  The Companies Bill and the Bankruptcy Bill will be concluded before this session finishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I suggest to the Leader of the House that people want the legislation to be taken properly.  This is the third or fourth time in this session that a comment has been made &ldquo;that they will not be here later on, tonight&rdquo;, or whatever.  This side of the House provided a fair share of the speakers yesterday &mdash; most of them, in fact.  It is unfair to make that comment.  It is untrue.  Secondly, a regulation which will not allow vegetarian restaurants to apply for this licence is an embarrassment to this House because one of the requirements is that meat be served.</P>

      <P>Senators last night observed that the situation, where they lost an hour of business due to voting in the Dáil was untenable.  The same thing is likely to happen this morning.  In support of what the Senators said, I spoke to the Chief Whip this morning.  He accepted that the matter will be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and this has my support.  As a measure of the indication by the Chief Whip and by all of us that the situation as it exists is no longer acceptable, he has agreed to pair me for this debate this morning.  That is the first indication of correcting a situation that is unacceptable to both Ministers and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like sincerely to thank the Minister for that very prompt response to the points which Senator Manning and I raised last night about that incident involving the loss of an hour. I am very grateful to the Minister for facilitating the House so quickly this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, having discussed these regulations at some length, I slept on <Col N="1379" /> them.  Sometimes a good night's sleep clears the mind and produces more rational thought.  I must say that having slept on them I can only conclude that they are no better than I thought they were last night &mdash; they are actually worse. Senator Brendan Ryan was quite right when on the Order of Business this morning he said that these regulations are an embarrassment to us.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I, like many other Members of the House very nearly let these regulations through on the nod. I did not pay an enormous amount of attention to them because they are what some of us would regard as being mere regulations and they are not in the form of a Bill.  These regulations are in some ways more important than a Bill.  As we established last night, it is impossible to amend these regulations in any form. One of the great difficulties about these things &mdash; these absolutely absurd regulations &mdash; is that they have to go through all together or be rejected all together.  I appeal to the Minister now, before we go any further, that maybe he could take on board some of the suggestions which have been made about these regulations &mdash; amend some of these regulations and delete some of the more absurd and deplorable parts of these regulations before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is reluctant to go back to the Dáil with these regulations but I would remind him that it would be easier now than it will be next week.  Just to underline the fact that they are an embarrassment, I would point out that this morning <i>The Irish Times</i> on its front page did a skit, or what is almost a skit, on these particular things.  They wrote a rather frivolous article on these regulations because they seem to the journalist involved like a good but rather silly story.  They are very silly regulations, in fact.  I appeal to the Minister to consider amending them in some form because this House is incapable of amending them in some form.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the result of regulations of this sort will be to write into legislation particular clauses which <Col N="1380" /> cannot be changed piecemeal.  In fact they have a more permanent and more solid effect than legislation itself.  I would appeal to the Minister on that point.  I would also like to say that the more I read these regulations the more convinced I become that quite simply they are the result of a lobby from the vintners and the publicans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is completely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator Bohan, how appropriate that you should be in the House at the moment.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which was the result of a lobby on the other side, has obviously been balanced by a very strong publicans' lobby which, by some means, has induced the Minister and the Government to produce regulations which will be impossible to enforce.  They are unrealistic, silly and impossible to enforce.  This is the general view of those in this House who are taking any sort of objective view of the regulations.</P>
      <P>We established last night some of the more absurd requirements of these regulations. The first and most ridiculous one is that the legislation as a principle and as a fact regulates for people's tastes and design.  It regulates the design in restaurants and bars.  This is absurd.  It regulates for the condition in which the grounds of a restaurant should be kept. This is also absurd.  I cannot see what this has to do with special licences.  It regulates about odours from the kitchen. It regulates about padded chairs.  In one of the more absurd clauses, it regulates about highchairs for children in restaurants. What on earth are we doing? We will not give restaurants special intoxicating liquor licences if they do not have highchairs for children?  Is it the idea that the children could get drunk on highchairs rather than on low chairs, or get high on highchairs?  This is the absurdity of these regulations.  I simply do not understand them.  I do not understand what relevance these regulations have with the licences being given out.  I am not trying to be funny.  I am only being funny by accident, if I am being funny.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross said he slept on these regulations last night. What he is doing now is repeating all he said last night, having slept in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned children, high chairs, or padded chairs.  I am making completely different points.  The same principle may be emerging and I am very glad that the message is getting through, but I am actually drawing different points out of the syllabus all the time. I want to know why those of us who enjoy frying and poaching are being discriminated against in these regulations. It is quite all right to require boiling, roasting, grilling and steaming pans, but there is no requirement that there should be frying or poaching equipment.  Why is that?  Anybody who does not have a grilling pan will be allowed to serve this intoxicating liquor &mdash; it does not matter if they do not have a frying pan, they can serve this liquor.  This is the sort of crazy situation we are going into.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go back into the matter of lavatories &mdash; I went into that last night &mdash; but I would like to ask why the staff have to have different toilets?  I do not understand that.  As a customer in a restaurant, I do not mind the staff using the same toilet as myself.  If the ratio in a restaurant is right, if it is 30 or fewer, whatever the rational requirement by the Minister is, it does not matter who uses the toilet and who does not.  I do not understand why these are requirements to have special facilities for the staff in this case.</P>
      <P>The eighth requirement, which I think is absurd, is that no restaurant will be allowed this licence if there is not a member of the staff specially required to usher people to the tables.  Quite honestly, I do not know how else people are supposed to find their way to the tables. Of course, they are going to be shown the way to the tables but this is another pernickety, silly detail in the regulations which apparently is to be the basis for not allowing people to have a licence.  The more I look at them, the more absurd I see they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations in a most peculiar way <Col N="1382" />&mdash; and this is one of the most extraordinary things in them &mdash; regulate for good manners.  I have never come across legislation which legislates for people's good manners and politeness, but there is a requirement here that friendly and courteous service must be provided.  In other words, if any of the waiters are judged by a member of Bord Fáilte to be rude to the customers the place will not get a licence for serving intoxicating liquor.  This is becoming absolutely bizarre. I will be very interested to hear the Minister's reply to this in a specific and not a general way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be more serious, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help being frivolous if you require by legislation that the staff be courteous and polite.  I do not see how you can legislate for that but that is what you are attempting to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning dealt with menus. It seems to me that the menus have a particular obsession with soup.  Apparently &mdash; and I am talking from memory &mdash; the <i>table d'hôte</i> menu has to have four hors-d'oeuvres but this must include fresh soups &mdash; tinned soups, apparently, are out.  I do not see what is wrong with tinned soups.  It has to include fresh soups or else they do not get the licence to serve drink.  It sounds silly and it is silly.  It is absolutely crazy.  This is what is written down in front of me.  We have already come across the crazy discrimination against vegetarians where there is a requirement for meat &mdash; which, of course, discriminates against three of the best restaurants in Dublin.  I think I can name them.  The King Sitric, Restaurant na Mara and the Lord Edward all serve fish, and only fish.  They do very well and satisfy their customers by serving fish because they are special restaurants. Apparently there is to be a requirement on them now to serve meat.  This is absolutely crazy.  I am trying to get through this as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the <i>a la carte</i> menu. The <i>a la carte</i> menu, for some reason, is <Col N="1383" /> only required to serve three hors-d'oeuvres &mdash; there are four hors-d'oeuvres on the <i>table d'hôte</i> but I am sure there is a very good reason for that.  Again, the <i>a la carte</i> menu has to serve a choice of soups.  Soup keeps rearing its ugly head. I do not know why soup is so important to the national appetite or the national stomach, but apparently if we do not serve enough soup to people we simply will not give them a licence to serve drink. This is what is here.  This is what Senator Lydon is supporting.  I can quite understand why he is supporting it.  He is told to support it and that is why he is supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must comment on the level of debate.  A Senator is responsible for creating this kind of atmosphere in the Chamber.  I think in fairness the Senator could leave the soup alone and go on to the main course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been presented with these absolutely absurd resolutions and I can only treat them, I am afraid, in the way they are presented to me.  If it happens that this debate turns out to be frivolous and light hearted, fair enough, and I am sorry.  But they are quite extraordinary regulations.  It is impossible to treat them without being facetious to a certain extent because they are so absurd. If people find it funny, I am very sorry because I am not trying to be funny.  I am sorry that Members on the Government side are laughing at me.  I am going to draw my remarks to a close now because it would be only fair to let some of my colleagues in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out some of the most absurd parts of these regulations and there are very silly principles running through them.  The really absurd principle is that the Government are making regulations which should be left completely and utterly to the owner or the <Col N="1384" /> manager of the restaurant.  Nearly all the regulations are regulations which would be in the interests of a prudent and sensible owner and manager to keep because they are in the business simply and solely of making money.  I do not see why the Government should tell them how to run their business, how many staff they should have, whether their staff should have good manners or qualities like that or what their standards should be in any area other than hygiene and the disabled. It seems to me that we have really got into a dangerous area and that the strength of the publicans lobby has actually induced the Government to impose regulations which will be impossible for any restaurant to keep.  As a result, it will be possible for restaurants of very high quality, because they break one or two of these rules, to have a licence of this sort withheld from them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these regulations need to be taken back and thought about again and that only two main principles should be applied.  One is hygiene, which I think is already catered for by legislation anyway, and the second one, in regard to which I make a special plea to the Minister, is quite simply that all new restaurants should provide facilities for the disabled.  I think that is important.  That is the point I made yesterday.  I think it is dishonestly put in this schedule because it says this should be done where feasible. This is lip service and it is the only case in this schedule where lip service is actually paid.  The rest are silly regulations.  The provisions for the disabled are thrown in as lip service with absolutely no teeth to enforce them.  I shall be calling a vote on this because this is quite patently the most ridiculous set of regulations I have come across in the seven or eight years I have been here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these special restaurant licence regulations. They regulate the standards required for the issue of special restaurant licences to restaurateurs.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for having brought in these regulations before the summer <Col N="1385" /> recess, because it will afford an opportunity to restaurateurs in the country to apply for these licences.  Possibly, many of them will qualify for the liquor licence before the summer is over.</P>
      <P>These regulations will enable very good quality restaurants to qualify for a liquor licence.  They will enable them to have a choice of liquor in their restaurants. It is very important that the regulations that govern the granting of a liquor licence should be handled very carefully; if not, every restaurant in the country could apply and possibly might qualify for one.  We have enough pubs and places that sell liquor without adding many more.  When the Liquor Bill was going through the Seanad, the Minister for Justice did say, when he mentioned the special restaurant licences, that he thought only about 100 restaurants would qualify for the liquor licence.  Tourists who come to our country and, indeed, the Irish people, deserve to have good qualify restaurants which have liquor licences.  This is something that we should all welcome.  When we had a discussion in the Seanad on the Liquor Bill, which the Minister for Justice piloted through the House, nearly everyone who spoke on the special restaurant licences said that the regulations should be very stringent and that only good quality restaurants should qualify.</P>
      <P>The Act clearly specifies that the standards prescribed in the regulations made by the Minister will have to be complied with before a restaurant will be considered for a special licence.  We have had a lot of talk this morning about the special regulations that good class restaurants will have to have to comply with in order to get a liquor licence.  Every good class hotel must observe the same regulations as those that apply to restaurants that qualify for a liquor licence.</P>

    <P>Bord Fáilte have been selected as the authority that will do the inspection.  I feel that Bord Fáilte are the proper body to do this inspection because they have plenty of experience.  They have been grading hotels and guest-houses and in general they have been looking at tourist <Col N="1386" /> accommodation.  They are a very competent body to make sure that the regulations will apply to each restaurant that makes an application for a liquor licence. I am quite sure that no restaurant will qualify unless it complies with all the regulations.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted to find that those restaurants will be inspected once a year. Restaurants can deteriorate and may not qualify after 12 months, or after a number of years, and it is important that they should be inspected annually and that the licence can be withdrawn from them if they do not adhere to the regulations. In the past, our European visitors and, indeed, all our visitors, were very surprised that in some of the best restaurants liquor was not available to them when they were having a meal.  I am quite sure that in future all our visitors and our own people, will be delighted with this move. There was a demand that good restaurants should have a liquor licence.</P>
    <P>It is important that this legislation get through both Houses of the Oireachtas so as to enable restaurant owners to apply straight away.  Any restaurant could comply with the regulations so that possibly in a month's time we could see licensed restaurants operating here.  I come from County Kerry which is a great tourist county.  I think I can claim that some of our restaurants are as good if not better than even the best restaurants in the rest of the country due to the tourist business we have.</P>
    <P>Having had a good look at the regulations, despite all the criticism there is of them I know a few restaurants in my own county that will qualify for a liquor licence.  I did think that being required to have five main courses on the menu was a little bit much and maybe the Minister would explain that when replying.  Could the Minister also let us know if a restaurant owner applies for a special licence and is turned down, will he be informed by Bord Fáilte why he has been turned down?  This is important because the reasons for being turned down could be rectified and maybe the owner could apply a second time.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism <Col N="1387" /> about the regulations this morning.  I accept that the regulations are pretty tough, pretty stiff, but the majority of hotels have to comply with those regulations. If we did not make those regulations we would have too many licensed restaurants in the country.  We have enough licensed premises &mdash; I think too many&mdash;without adding to them.  At least when we have good quality licensed restaurants it will be a welcome development and will help our own people to go out and have a good meal and a drink in very good surroundings.  Our tourist industry will benefit considerably also.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having brought these regulations before the House before the summer recess to enable restaurant owners to apply for this special restaurant licence and, hopefully, before 1 August we may see some of the better restaurants in our country having a liquor licence.  I am very hopeful that some of the better restaurants in my own county will have liquor licences in a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought these regulations into the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was a promise given to us when we went through the legislation with a fine-tooth comb, arising from the concern of Members on both sides of the House about how specific we were going to be about these regulations.  The Minister promised that the application of regulations would not be left to Bord Fáilte but would be set down by the Houses of the Oireachtas as a directive to Bord Fáilte as to how these licences would be allocated and operated throughout the country.  We wanted to ensure that there would be a uniformity about the regulations, that it would not be left to the discretion of investigating officers to make a decision based on the application before them.  For that reason I welcome the fact that we have set down here in detail what all of us feel are the standards that should be observed by the special restaurants that are now being licensed to sell intoxicating liquor at hours beyond <Col N="1388" /> the normal hours of restaurant licences to sell liquor.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this House would discuss in detail the standards that we all call for every day and complain about if they are not there.  We are also subjected to criticism by visitors from abroad if the standards are lower than what are set down here.  I do not know what the fuss is over these regulations because basically they are in line with the thinking of the Members of this House.  I was here for most, if not all, of the debate on the actual legislation when we were talking about how important it was that these special restaurants would serve what is, in fact, a proper meal.  An amendment was put down by the Opposition to specify that there would have to be a certain number of courses in the meal; otherwise the law would be flouted in that people would be having chips and chicken and that would be considered to be a substantial meal.  It was intended to overcome the existing flouting of the law regarding the provision of what was defined as a substantial meal because we all wanted to know what was a substantial meal.  The Minister gave his interpretation and also indicated that this would be set down by way of regulation to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas and set before the board of Bord Fáilte as the standard required.</P>
      <P>I do not have a problem about indicating that there should be so many courses because this was specified by people who are professionals in this area, like Senator Cregan and others who debated at length with the Minister for Justice the requirements that were indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas who is also privileged to be a member of a local authority will realise that some people would probably drop dead if they saw some of the requirements that we write into planning permissions. We write in extraordinary conditions such as the colour of the slates on the roof because in an orderly society where you have a new project or development it is appropriate that environmentally it should match and blend in <Col N="1389" /> with an area; otherwise you would have chaos throughout the country.  We can and do lay down extraordinary regulations. As regards the very first one here, which refers to the area to be involved, it is appropriate that if you are going to have a special restaurant licence for a restaurant catering particularly for continental visitors, you have the standard at least that they expect of us and expect to have in their own countries.  Unless we are going to be subjected to widespread criticisms it is appropriate that we have specific areas laid down as waiting areas, as kitchen and service areas, as stairways, cloakroom facilities and toilet facilities. These are minimum requirements if we are going to meet the challenge of the future and be serious about the tourist industry that we all aspire to build up as a major revenue-generating activity.</P>
    <P>I see nothing at all wrong with laying down conditions which will specify that such facilities must be provided in the one building.  Perhaps the Minister, in replying will define &ldquo;one building&rdquo; because to comply with this regulation many people might have to build additional facilities within the grounds of their existing premises.  Does it mean that all the buildings on the ground will have to be linked in some way by passage-ways or additional facilities, so that technically they will be one building?  Or, is it possible to have two separate buildings in the one &ldquo;grounds&rdquo;?  That might lend the place a character of its own.  I have no problem whatsoever in providing that where you have restaurants like this, particularly in busy cities or in busy towns with traffic congestion, facilities should be available in the grounds for car-parking and other such requirements.  Those are minimum requirements that we normally set down in planning.  As a matter of fact, if a developer is himself unable to provide parking he has to contribute to the local authority which in turn must provide off-street car-parking facilities, otherwise all the streets in our towns and cities would be clogged up with parking at night while people are out enjoying themselves.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we should make it clear that it is a requirement by Bord <Col N="1390" /> Fáilte &mdash; we are stating it for them &mdash; that applicants for a special restaurant licence must have the other ancillary facilities available, such as car-parking and nice grounds.  What is wrong with setting down standards?  If people do not achieve the standards, they should not be seeking this very special licence, which is special and is a change from everything we have been used to.  In fairness to the Minister for Justice, he did say that in his opinion only about 100 or 120 of these licences are likely to be granted because he was setting very strict standards.  We all concurred in that and we asked him to ensure that these very strict standards were laid down because of the very special area that we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is appropriate to lay down standards for the quality of seating and otherwise, but if so, is it not appropriate that if we have a proper restaurant there should be proper seating for the customers?  We are now laying down regulations for ourselves and our guests and visitors.  It is appropriate that restaurateurs should not have a slipshod way of doing things, that they should devote some of the capital expenditure involved to ensuring that there is comfort for the customer.  If we provide that people may come in with children, what is wrong with ensuring that there are proper chairs for children?  We cannot assume that people will not take their children out in the evening, particularly tourists.  It is nice to go into a hotel that has a high chair for your child or has a cot or sleeping facilities. If we did not lay down those regulations, perhaps proprietors would not bother and then you would be inconvenienced if you were a customer.  We are all potential customers in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We might not need high chairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a requirement that a certain number of high chairs be available, I see nothing wrong with that. They may never be used, but if they are wanted they should be there.  If the regulations specify that some high chairs be provided, even if they are never used, <Col N="1391" /> the cost of such a chair is not going to break a restaurateur who is going to be serious about dealing with tourists and other customers.  That would be my interpretation of that regulation.</P>
      <P>Regulation 7.4 requests that all meals shall be ordered from and served at tables by waiting staff.  I would like some clarification here because we have talked about a waiting area from which people would generally order their meals.  Is it now required that in that restricted and defined waiting area there will also have to be tables at or near everybody who orders a meal?  I presume that by having this waiting area for a drink before the meal, we are now stipulating that there should be a table in that waiting area? That is how I read that particular regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is appropriate that we set down standards also for cutlery, tables and napkins because this is the business. We are serious now about what we are trying to do.  We are also serious about ensuring that staff, who are suitably qualified and suitably dressed, are themselves entitled to facilities and the regulations here provide that there shall be facilities for the staff, toilet facilities, a rest area and, indeed, a dining area for them.  I think it is appropriate that staff who are involved in late night work should also have these facilities.  It is appropriate that Bord Fáilte would require the restaurateur to ensure that his staff are also looked after properly and have a proper environment to work in.  There was a claim made about section 8 (3) (d) that one particular process of cooking was excluded.  As I read it, it says &ldquo;cooking equipment for boiling, roasting, baking, grilling, steaming...&rdquo; and although frying is not mentioned, in my opinion &ldquo;any other means for preparation&rdquo; covers anything you want it to cover.  You can have it raw if you want to, under that regulation, fry it or do anything else.  I do not know why we have to have frying mentioned.  Just for the record, frying is supposed to be bad for you anyway.  Here we have a situation <Col N="1392" /> where &ldquo;other means of preparation&rdquo; are available.</P>
    <P>We also talked about the fact that these regulations excluded people from serving vegetarian dishes.  I have read the regulations in every way possible and I see nothing to exclude a vegetarian from having meals, whether he wants to have soup or not to have soup.  We would all love to know that the soup we were having is fresh soup.  Perhaps the Minister might define what fresh soup is.  Is it freshly cooked?  Perhaps out of a tin it could be freshly cooked.  We would want to know that the soup we are talking about was not old soup made a week ago for the All-Ireland and not used because we beat the Cork team and they went home without the soup and it was left over and reheated &mdash; I did not realise Senator Cregan had come in &mdash; and I am presuming that the words &ldquo;fresh soup&rdquo; mean soup cooked that day in whatever is the appropriate process.</P>
    <P>I see regulations here about the number of toilet facilities and urinals that are required, based on the number of dining areas.  Is that not appropriate? You will have chaos in a dining room if you do not have facilities.  God knows, most of us look for them, demand them and complain when they are not there. Here we have an opportunity to lay down regulations about how these special restaurants should be organised.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate also, that people serving in these areas would be suitably attired so that visitors would recognise a particular member of the staff where he or she is serving at tables, in the bar area or wherever.  I saw nothing wrong with being able to identify staff. As a matter of fact, I am a great believer in staff members having little names on their uniform so that you can address them if you have a problem or, if some of them are discourteous to you, you can actually make a formal complaint and identify the staff member.  I see nothing wrong with being expected to be brought to a table.  Naturally enough, everyone would want to walk in the door and sit down wherever he or she liked.  People who understand the situation normally <Col N="1393" /> wait to be asked where they wish to sit. That is normal.  It is happening every day unless you walk into a take-away.  In this area we are trying to ensure that take-aways will not get licences.  We are setting down certain standards.  It is appropriate that if there is wine it should be identified, where it comes from, so that people would know the price of it and could buy it in any quantity.  I think it is recognised that there are regulations we should lay down.  I am disappointed that people feel, although we requested these regulations, now that they are before us, they are too strict.  I honestly do not think so and I hope that people who avail of these special restaurants licences will attain the standard that we all feel they should achieve. If they are limited well, so be it, because it is appropriate that these special facilities should not apply generally. If that was the case, people who are in the existing restaurant business, fully licensed, or publicans with restricted licences would feel that others could in a slipshod way be in an unfairly competitive situation, particularly regarding the serving of drinks.  It is appropriate to have special regulations and I welcome them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long and enjoyable debate on the Bill when it was brought before us by the Minister for Justice two weeks ago.  He said that both houses would be well informed of the regulations that would be laid down as regards special licences for restaurants. Looking at the regulations that are being brought before us here today, it is encouraging to see that they are so detailed.  I admit that I myself argued in favour of making sure that people would not be allowed to sell drink, or be allowed to have a place to sell drink in areas without proper consent, no proper regulations or no proper supervision, to make sure that people who are not entitled to have drink would not get drink.  The regulations are bringing about a situation where it will be very difficult for these restaurants to get licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have to admit, from a Senator's point of view that the regulations are too stringent.  Are we bringing about a <Col N="1394" /> situation where only a certain few can get a restaurant licence?  Are we bringing about a situation such that a person who would be able to say: &ldquo;I would like, and I am able, to do this sort of thing but, unfortunately, because of the stringent regulations, and because of the strictness involved here I cannot do it.&rdquo;  I am worried about that and I have to admit it.</P>
    <P>The ideas we are talking about in theory are excellent and I mentioned this several times to the Minister, Deputy Collins, on the last occasion.  I can understand what he is trying to do and I can well understand, in particular as regards the licence for drink, he is saying that these special restaurant licences are going to be restricted.  He admitted that.  He did say that there would be no more than probably 100 or 124 in the country.  I can see in the regulations before us that is generally his opinion.  But when you see how stringent the regulations are, perhaps we are bringing about a situation where we might be admitting to other people who have other interests: &ldquo;We are going to make sure that you are protected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From a restaurant point of view the facilities are well described, well pointed out, WC's and so on.  We are going too far I think.  Any person who wants to set up business knows that he has to have proper facilities and that if he does not have them, people may only come once and not again.</P>
    <P>I will expand on that a little.  The Minister, Deputy Collins, did say that there was a wrong.  He said that there are restaurants which will not now have the required facilities.  The owners will have put a lot of money into their businesses and into the purchase of their properties. They will not have the same facilities unless they go through the courts every so often to get them.  These are publicans who have already set up restaurants.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well informed and he knows that many people have purchased property for £150,000 or £200,000 and have spent another £100,000 to set up a restaurant.  Now they will not have the required facilities. Throughout the country there are many <Col N="1395" /> publicans who have restaurants with A.1 facilities.  Three weeks ago the Minister said that he was prepared to consider, within nine or 12 months the restaurant licences that these publicans have.</P>
    <P>I always like to simplify things.  I know the Minister is one who says that if a thing cannot be done in an illogical way there is no reason why it should not be done. Are we prepared to say that the regulations should be operated in such a way that each person doing the same thing should be seen as equals?  Why is it that we have regulations which say that one person must do it one way and the other person must do it another way?  When the Intoxicating Liquor Bill came before us the Minister said there was a need for a tightening up in particular areas and a loosening up of the laws in other areas.  We now have a situation where one particular group say that they are already involved with Bord Fáilte.  They say that they will open restaurants and fulfil these regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations are long and tedious but only cover the facilities that should be available in any restaurant which wants to do business in a proper manner.  In the Blarney area many publicans have spent a great deal of money on their restaurants and yet they will not have the required facilities.  The Department officials will point out that they are quite entitled to have one hour's drinking time after the official closing time, which will be 11 p.m. in winter time and 11.30 in summer time, and that after that the same regulations will apply to them as to restaurants but legislation provides that they must always apply through the courts and must make sure that certain facilities are provided. The new restaurants that will get these licences will not be in the same category.</P>
    <P>Why can all the people who already have these restaurants and who are serving food and drink not be considered equally under these regulations?  If a person who already has a restaurant does not comply with the regulations Bord Fáilte may tell him that he is not entitled to serve drink, to have a restaurant or to serve meals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> The standards of health authorities and of Bord Fáilte are very questionable.  I make no apologies for saying that.  I am very encouraged by the way people in the health authorities &mdash; the Southern Health Board in my area &mdash; make sure that food preparation areas are always up to required standards.  In the regulations before us comparisons are made between the publican and the restaurateur.  Are we bringing about a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation? We must not bring about a situation where only certain groups may be entitled to have these types of restaurants.</P>
    <P>We claim to have probably the best educated youth in Europe who go to other countries to give of their services. CERT train people in this business. Those people have the ability to set up businesses of their own but because of these regulations they will not be able to do so.  There is no way they can do so if Board Fáilte insist that they must have certain facilities.</P>
    <P>The regulations and the licensing laws relating to liquor are very serious matters. In the regulations before us there is not a very strong emphasis on the question of the licensing laws or on the sale of drink to underage people but rather on the high quality restaurant that must be involved.  I am not for a moment saying that every person or restaurant should be entitled to this licence.  I am a publican but I do not want to see the licence given to a certain few only and Bord Fáilte should not represent only a certain few. It would not be acceptable that people could be appointed by one political group or other and could decide who should or should not get a restaurant licence.  That would be very serious.</P>
    <P>I wonder if anybody in this House would be able to name five members of Bord Fáilte.  I know I could not.  It would be very serious if these people could decide who should or should not get a licence.  That decision should be left to the courts who are best qualified to do so.  The courts or the local superintendent may object if a recommendation comes before them from a particular group or person for one of these special restaurant <Col N="1397" /> licences &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;.  The group who make the decision can be replaced at any time with a change of Government.  They could favour one group or person over another.</P>
    <P>Nobody can object legally except the chief superintendent of the particular area or the judge who would hear the argument put to him.  Could they make a decision if Bord Fáilte say that a person may have a licence?  I would like that clarified.  There should be a guarantee that there will not be discrimination between one person and another.  It is quite obvious from the regulations that there will be discrimination.  If a person who has been trained in the country gets married, has children, and after four or five years decides to set up in business, there is no way he can get involved in this area unless he goes to great expense. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Let us take the comparison with the person who owns a public house and who decides that he wants to provide meals, as indeed many people have done over the years.  The same conditions would not apply to him.  He could purchase a property in a particular area and build it up accordingly, as people have done.  If the business in one area is not doing as well as it should be, he might decide that he would do better elsewhere.  He would not be included under these regulations. The same regulations which apply to restaurants should also apply to publicans. I would have no objections to that.  If we are going to simplify the matter let us simplify it for everyone.  That is the main point I am trying to make.  Why should there be discrimination between these people and the people who are already set up in business?</P>
    <P>I hope times are getting better.  We are very emotive at the moment about which way business is going to go.  The people, and in particular publicans, who are already involved in this business and who have put thousands of pounds into their businesses throughout the country, particularly in tourist areas, should have an equal opportunity of operating under these regulations.  We can simplify the <Col N="1398" /> matter.  We should not lay down regulations in favour of a certain few.  These regulations are very stringent and could operate against people who may not have a vast amount of money.  They stipulate that a particular body that is set up here by Government may decide who is going to get these licences.  These regulations are so stringent that they will not be on great value.  As a result of them, the price of drinks in restaurants will be so high that the ordinary person will not be able to afford them.  I would be very much afraid of that happening.</P>
    <P>I would have to protect the interests of the people involved and I make no apologies for saying that.  Indeed they have been well protected, thanks to the arguments that have been made in this House and the other House and the arguments that were made before the Bill was introduced.  Strong arguments have been made by representatives from all sides &mdash; publicans, restaurants, hotels and so on. Each body has indeed been well protected. I do not want to give the impression that I would like to see legislation introduced that would suit a certain few.  That would be irresponsible thinking and logic if I was to say that.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are not a body of great thinking or great logic.  Indeed, we might question whether or not they have been very good in comparison with other bodies.  We can do good work ourselves without these bodies.  The board of Bord Fáilte can bring about a situation where certain groups of people will have all the power and that is not acceptable.  I would like to know who can decide on these matters, other than a superintendent.  We will have to be very stringent if he receives a recommendation from a particular body or person for a licence.</P>
    <P>I understand the purpose of the regulations. They will indicate what kind of meals must be served and so on and I welcome them.  The regulations in regard to drink in particular must be stringent. That is very important and the person who is more aware of that than anybody else is the publican, the person who holds the licence.  You may get a bad egg but you certainly will not get four out of ten, <Col N="1399" /> two out of ten or even one out of ten but you might get two in 100, which is 2 per cent.  It is not necessary to define in every detail whether or not tea or coffee should be served, or whether it should be part of a four course meal.</P>
    <P>Many of the people in the business have been excellently trained by CERT. Better meals have been served in our restaurants over the last ten years and we cannot deny that.  I have been in many countries in Europe but the finest restaurants are in Ireland and meals are very reasonably priced.  Excellent restaurant facilities have been laid on by publicans. The town of Kinsale, for instance, is one of the finest in Europe from the point of view of eating out.  The little village of Blarney provides great meals, mostly in public houses and in hotels.</P>

      <P>We have to be realistic.  I would be very much against Bord Fáilte deciding on these matters, no matter what type of board they are or who sets them up, because they could favour certain people and this concerns me.  I would like to see everybody treated fairly. These regulations are frightening because they favour the well-off people.  The person who is less well-off may have a better ability but because he does not have the money he cannot set up in business. This is why there should be legislation and regulations under which everybody is treated the same.  The same regulations and legislation should apply to the publican as to the person who gets his licence through Bord Fáilte.  If a <Col N="1400" /> person wants to take over a business he should be able to do so at a fair price and then perhaps improve on it.</P>
      <P>I want to make sure that the 52 per cent of people who are under 25 will be motivated to set up their own businesses but these regulations will not enable them to do so.  They are aimed at the people with the money and that is just a certain few &mdash; only 100 or 120.  The ordinary person who might have better ability will not have the same opportunity.  I would like to be able to give a person who has the ability the opportunity of setting up a business at a fair cost.  How can we do that?  By treating everybody equally under the regulations.  I would appreciate a comment from the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the regulations are stringent.  They favour a certain few, the people who have the money in their back pocket.  They can go into the business even though they may not have the ability. The busiest areas in our country at this time are our airports and our shipping ports because hundreds of people are leaving the country every week.  We have an opportunity to say to some of them: &ldquo;Stay, the opportunity is here, avail of it&rdquo;, but we are not doing that in these regulations.</P>

      <P>I welcome these regulations. I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in proposing them.  They have to be stringent but not too stringent.  I do not fully share Senator Cregan's fears about Bord Fáilte.  They do a very good job generally and they will probably do a good job in this case also.  The regulations are necessary.  For too long some of the standards in this country have been very slack and these regulations will help to improve them.  If you travel abroad you will find that almost inevitably regulations like these apply in other countries. I have eaten in Blarney and Kinsale and also in the Cashel Palace and I know there are many places around the country were good meals are served and where the standards are good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to raise one or two points with the Minister.  In regard to the waiting <Col N="1401" /> area, the regulations state that &ldquo;the furnishings and fittings shall be in keeping, with the furnishing and fittings&rdquo;.  I would like some clarification on that.  I do not see why that should have to be so.  They could be much different and still fulfil the purpose.  The second point is about the dining area.  The regulations state no odours shall emanate from the kitchen. In a Greek restaurant it is traditional to walk straight into the kitchen and look at your food.  It is impossible to keep the door closed.  This might prove unfair to those running a Greek restaurant.  Also in the Japanese restaurant &mdash; I am thinking of the one in Newtownpark Avenue, Blackrock &mdash; where food is prepared in front of you, part of the whole ambience is the fact that this odour emanates from the cooking area.  I doubt if this could be achieved in the Dáil restaurant, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7. (7) refers to seating and a padded cushion.  I know of a very good restaurant where the chairs are made of wickerwork.  They do not have padded cushions but that does not detract from the restaurant, the food or the general ambience.  Paragraph 7. (9) states that appointments shall be of uniform design of and in keeping with the overall design of the dining area.  I do not see the reason for the emphasis on uniformity.  I think it is going a little too fair, but perhaps there is a reason for it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9. (4) states that for up to 25 persons there should be a WC and a urinal in a male toilet.  Again, I know of very good restaurants where fewer than 25 people are served and there is only a W.C.  This seems to be sufficient. Bentleys' is one such restaurant.  Paragraph 10. (6) states that the waiting staff shall be dressed uniformly and readily identifiable.  I agree that they should be readily identifiable.  I agree with the point raised by Senator Ferris that you may want to contact the waiting staff to make a complaint but I do not necessarily agree that they should be dressed &ldquo;uniformly&rdquo;. I have been in restaurants where there have been more than 30 diners and where all the waitresses wore different uniforms. They are distinctive.  I agree that <Col N="1402" /> they should be distinctive and identifiable but not necessarily uniformly.</P>

      <P>As I said on the Order of Business these regulations are an embarrassment, not in their intent but in their practical application.  Since the Minister is from the same part of the country &mdash; I should not claim Cork parentage because I might be corrected &mdash; as I am now happily living in, I suggest to him that most of the restaurants currently in County Cork which do not have licences will not have licences under these regulations.  That is a matter for legislation, for public policy.  The clear intent of these regulations is to restrict these special licences to about 100 to 150 restaurants. This reflects something of the peculiar Irish attitude to drink, where on the one hand most of us drink substantial quantities but at the same time we feel obliged to make long speeches about the evils of drink.  The peculiar guilt within the Irish psyche about a number of the good things of life has probably generated some of the best literature the world has ever known, but it is not a good basis for a tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I had the good fortune to be in Frankfurt, West Germany, recently &mdash; before the European football championship &mdash; and I was astonished at the range, quality and price of food that was available in that city which is about half the size of Dublin.  I was particularly astonished at the price.  It is also astonishing to an Irish person to find that everywhere you eat you can drink and everywhere you drink you can eat.  This artificial separation by the Irish people of eating and drinking is such a defiance of nature and of the natural order of things as to defy description. It is human, natural and understandable that people wish to eat where they drink and drink where they eat and we should be facilitating them.  We are actually facilitating a guarantee that most people in most restaurants will not be able to drink any alcoholic drink that is produced in this country.  I find that quite astonishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the slogan the restaurant owners used when they started their campaign for licences, &ldquo;No Irish served <Col N="1403" /> here&rdquo;, was very effective and very true. I know a number of the restaurant owners who started that campaign.  The restaurants I know of would not possibly be able to meet some of the standards laid down here.  If it was simply a matter of public policy not to allow drink to be served in restaurants I would not mind but I resent the sort of regulations, drawn up under an Act, which effectively undermine the intent of the Act.  There is a constitutional question there and hopefully some restaurant owner will challenge it.  On the question of the kitchen odour, the actual word put down is &ldquo;ardour&rdquo;.  I was not sure if the drafters were trying to avoid the smells or the ardour from the kitchen.  I presume the word that has been misspelled, should be &ldquo;odour&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ardour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon &mdash; it is not often that I agree with him &mdash; indicated some of the problems of trying to regulate the unregulatable.  I said to one of my colleagues here, after I had the chance to read these regulations, that if Mikhail Gorbachev, speaking yesterday in Moscow, had wanted a classic example of how not to run central regulations he could have produced these regulations.  There are many aspects in these regulations which are simply not regulatable.  I will give a contrast. I happened to be involved in a debate on this matter.  The Statutory Instrument SI/317/1985, deals with regulations regarding incapacitated persons. It deals with many matters.  For instance, it states that in every home there shall be suitable and sufficient lighting, heating and ventilation.  In regulations which deal with the care of elderly, incapacitated people we can use words like &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.  In this sort of regulations we have to put in specific details. In regulations dealing with hygiene we use words like &ldquo;that the home is maintained in a proper state of repair and a clean and hygienic condition&rdquo;.  We talk about reasonable standards of hygiene and comfort when we are dealing with <Col N="1404" /> homes for the elderly and the incapacitated. I tried to have these regulations rejected because of that, but I was told that it was impossible to regulate in detail for things like concern for the elderly, handicapped or incapacitated people, that it had to be done on a basis of what reasonable people thought to be reasonable under the circumstances. That is what runs through the regulations for that accommodation &mdash; reasonable standards and a reasonable degree of comfort.</P>
    <P>For instance, they specify a particular temperature that must be maintained. These regulations maintain that the temperature must be produced by a suitable form of heating and specify the type of space heating.  Why is it necessary to refer to space heating?  The regulations are awash with this and, perhaps, the most ludicrous of the regulations has to do with the menus.  I notice that under paragraphs 11. (4) and 11. (5) there is detail about the <i>table d'hôte</i> menu.  I share, incidentally, all of Senator Ross's amusement at the emphasis on soups and, in particular, on fresh soups.  Is it implied that there are many restaurants that currently serve unfresh soups, or is it just somebody with a predilection for soup or what?  What amuses me is that in paragraph 11. (4) there is a choice of five main courses, a choice of vegetables for <i>table d'hôte</i> menus, but when the <i>a la carte</i> menu comes up we have main courses dishes including such items as fish, meat, a variety of vegetables and potatoes.  So, apparently, if one is trying to get a licence and has an <i>á la carte</i> menu one must serve potatoes, but if one has a <i>table d'hôte</i> menu one need not serve potatoes.  That is why I find these regulations embarrassing. They were drawn up in a hurry and the intent of them is to make sure that not many restaurants get licences.</P>
    <P>Everything that anybody could think of was cobbled together, thrown into these regulations, with the result that it is very easy to make fun of them.  I simply want to say, and I am not going to spend long on this, that many of them are obviously thought up to put as many hurdles as possible in the way of people who want <Col N="1405" /> to get restaurant licences.  It seems to me to be an utter and total <i>de facto</i> capitulation to the vintners' lobby, the lobby by those who would tell us that there are too many licences in the country.</P>
    <P>I have never seen anybody drunk in any of the few licensed restaurants I have been in that have a full licence.  I have never in my life seen anybody seriously intoxicated in a restaurant where they were actually eating and drinking.  I associate extreme intoxication with places where people can do nothing except drink.  The idea that we are going to have thousands of people descending on newly licensed restaurants eating a plate of chips and consuming 15 pints is at variance with the facts.  It is perfectly feasible to regulate for reasonable accommodation, reasonable quality meals, reasonable standards and ensure that the sort of excesses that some people seem to believe the rest of the world are capable of &mdash; not themselves &mdash; do not descend upon us.  What these regulations will actually mean is that most of our tourists who are not that well off, do not stay in the top class four star hotels and who try to live on a reasonable budget will not be able to sit down in most Irish restaurants and have a reasonable meal and drink any alcoholic drink that is produced here.  These regulations, as the Minister apparently said on Second Stage, are going to be restricted to about 150 restaurants.</P>
    <P>In the part of the country I spend my holidays, in West Kerry, there are a number of restaurants that have something close to an international reputation. From what I know of them none of them would currently qualify for a licence for one reason or another.  None of them would be eligible.  In truth, the regulations about menus are easy to get around because one can create a menu. How are Bord Fáilte going to know what is actually available as distinct from what is theoretically available?</P>
    <P>The regulations about the menus are not the nub of the issue, but what they are the nub of is the ridiculous nature of these regulations.  It is easy to get around menus, but built into this is a succession <Col N="1406" /> of obstacles and hindrances.  I do not object to reasonable standards of hygiene but what I find extraordinary is the possibility that up to now not every restaurant had to meet reasonable standards of hygiene.  If these standards are already being met under the health regulations there should be no need to have them in these regulations If they are not being met then the restaurants that are not meeting them should have been closed down a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Are we actually trying to impose artificially high standards in order to minimise the number of restaurants that can get these licences?  Let us not be kidding ourselves that the reason for restricting licences for restaurants has anything to do with the fear that people will get drunk in the restaurants.  It has to do with the fear that many people actually prefer the idea of sitting down and having something to eat and having a few drinks with the meal.  Most Irish publicans refuse to facilitate those people and most Irish restaurants will not be permitted to facilitate them.  What is at the nub of these regulations is that we will not let the ordinary customer eat an ordinary reasonably priced meal in an ordinary place and have the choice of drinks that he or she prefers to drink.  They will not have that provided in most pubs and will not be able to have it provided in most restaurants.  Apparently, a powerful vested interest &mdash; the publicans' lobby &mdash; is going to prevent that simple customer choice.  What astonishes me is that somebody like me, who is accused of being against people being allowed to make their free choices in a free market, has to stand up and say this when most of those who would most passionately defend the right of the customer to choose the sort of goods and services that he wants, sit down and allow through this sort of ludicrous regulation that would do justice to Albania, not to mention the Stalinist Soviet Union.  The idea of a central bureaucracy trying to tell people what should be on the menu of every restaurant in the country strikes me, if it was not a fact that it is going to become law here, as being something that a satirist could do a wonderful job on. <Col N="1407" /> There must be people writing in the Soviet Union who could write a magnificent satirical piece about this as an image of Stalinist bureaucracy, not in the sense of repression but in the sense of bureaucracy gone absolutely berserk.</P>
    <P>There can be no rational justification for central regulations passed by the Oireachtas which tell people what should or should not be on a menu.  I am not sure if my colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole, is right about the vegetarian menus; but I do think that the emphasis on meat seems to reflect a remarkably narrow perception of the joys of eating out on the part of the drafters of the regulations. There is a kind of escape clause.  It is a bit like the Soviet Constitution and the way it tolerates religion, that one is let practice it.  There is a kind of an escape clause in paragraph 11 (6) about speciality restaurants.  The glorious thing about these regulations is that they lurch from extreme detail to extreme vagueness. God help the Bord Fáilte inspectors who will have to go around.  There are enough physical details in them to ensure that most restaurants will not have licences much before, God bless the mark, 1992.</P>
    <P>The idea that any restaurant will be able to meet all those regulations immediately seems to be entirely ludicrous. There are so many litle things in them that one could poke fun at.  I do not want to poke fun unnecessarily at them because people have been landed in an invidious position.  In particular, the last people I would blame for any of this are the officials of any Government Department. They were landed with an impossible political promise to give restaurants licences to serve Irish alcoholic drinks. Then they were told to make sure the regulations prevented most restaurants from doing so.  That is not the sort of job people should be asked to do and that is what is being done in the regulations. Why, in God's name, should the reception area contain furnishings, fittings and equipment of good quality and in good condition and be of a design which is in keeping with that of the remainder of the restaurant?  One could keep the whole <Col N="1408" /> architectural profession going for 20 years arguing about whether a particular design of one part of a building is in keeping with another part of a building. That sort of controversy rages on forever in the design profession, in the architectural profession and in the whole profession of interior decorating.  What is something that is in keeping with something else?  One could go on forever about this.  There are fashions when things are in keeping and there are fashions when the same things are not in keeping.  The whole thing is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The regulations state that crockery shall be adequate to serve the maximum number capable of being seated in the dining area, be in good condition and good quality and of uniform design.  Does that mean that if half the restaurant have Stephen Pearce's crockery and the other half has his father's crockery, both of whom are among the most qualified and brilliant potters in this country, they will be refused a licence?  If a restaurant has the product of a deceased potter and decides to replace breakages by the products of a now living potter, has it to dump all the other crockery and replace it with new crockery?  The whole thing is absolutely ludicrous.  What should be written in is, reasonable quality, hygenic standards in areas like crockery and cutlery and so on.</P>
    <P>The regulations state that &ldquo;appointments shall be of uniform design (not mixed)&rdquo;.  If one looks at the range of products available in the Kilkenny Design Shops or the Blarney Woollen Mills shops, one will see that the whole question of diversity of imagination in setting up a restaurant is challenged by this.  If this was a debate about standards in restaurants I would not mind, but these are regulations that are purporting to become the law of the land.  These are regulations which will tell people that if they want to have a licence they must throw out all their cutlery because it is not of a uniform design.  They may be told to throw out half the pottery or half the ware because it is not of a uniform design.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon already referred to the <Col N="1409" /> need to have cushion seats.  I remember a time when one superb craftsman in Tuam, who is now out of business, called Al O'Dea, was supplying furniture to half the restaurants in the country.  He did not supply padded seats, but what he supplied was elegant furniture of a high quality and a high standard.  Somebody decided that it was a good idea to put cushions under people's backsides and, therefore, make it a regulation.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is quite ludicrous. These regulations ought to be withdrawn and simple regulations drawn up which specify the following: that restaurant licences should be granted to any restaurant where Bord Fáilte inspectors are satisfied that the business of the restaurant was to serve substantial meals to be consumed on the premises and where standards of hygiene and fire safety specified by the local authorities are met.  It appears to me that we are going to have the usual Irish procedure, four different groups inspecting the same premises.  We are going to have the fire regulation inspectors, the planning authorities, the health inspector for hygiene and then Bord Fáilte looking for another standard of hygiene.  It would have been quite simple to do what is badly needed here, that is, to enable ordinary Irish people &mdash; not those who want to spend £25 or £30 on a meal, but those who want to spend the sort of prices that I was able to spend in high cost West Germany of £5, £6 or £10 on a meal and a few drinks &mdash; to do what most Irish people actually like doing, which is to eat and drink together. When they do that they eat the sort of food they like to eat and drink the sort of drinks they like to drink.  That should be the intent of these regulations.</P>
    <P>That ought also to be the intention of those in this House, and the other House, who are so intent on proclaiming the values of the free market and the right of the customer to choose but who, instead, have chosen in my view, to capitulate shamelessly to an effective and very virulent lobby which, when it is offered the opportunity, fails to produce anything for its customers except poor standards and high prices, that is the publicans' lobby. <Col N="1410" /> If the standards of accommodation, of seating and so on, that are specified for these restaurants were to be specified for Irish public houses, 95 per cent of them would be closed down in the morning because they would not dream of producing that sort of physical accommodation for their customers.  I find the whole intent behind these regulations quite ludicrous.  I find them amusing and embarrassing in turn, and I have to say that I think it will be doing the name of the Oireachtas a very great disservice if these regulations are passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the belief that all our restaurants should uphold the highest hygiene standards.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  I fully support two aspects of the regulations, those which pertain to kitchens in restaurants and to toilets. They are the most important areas in any restaurant.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we do not keep the highest standards in our kitchens or toilets.  It used to be a practice in Dublin restaurants, and hotels, that customers could visit the kitchen to see their meals being prepared.  That practice has long since been dispensed with. Indeed, it has been very embarrassing for some establishments to find themselves in breach of the ordinary hygiene regulations in recent years.  We have high hygiene standards for our restaurants and hotels.  However, the regulations in question go too far in relation to cutlery, as Senator Ryan said, furnishings and so on. They are far too particular and unnecessary in those areas.  The regulations before the House will eliminate a number of very good restaurants who want to qualify for this special licence.  They are very hygienic restaurants and this is a little unfair on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some very good restaurants here in the city of Dublin and I feel obliged to mention them because restaurants in other areas have been mentioned. Many restaurants have sprung up over the last ten years which seat 15, 20, 25 or 30 people.  They are off-street restaurants in the city and suburbs and they would not have the car parking facilities the regulations require &mdash; outdoor <Col N="1411" /> areas, grounds, driveways and car parking areas.  I do not know whether the regulations are saying that every restaurant that qualifies for the special licence has to have those facilities for their customers, because that would be most unfair to a number of very good restaurants which have sprung up in Dublin over the years.</P>
    <P>I am a bit concerned about the definition of a waiting area.  I listened to Senator Ferris, who made one of the best speeches this morning, saying it appeared that the waiting area was an area where drink would be served.  I understand from the regulations that drink shall only be served in the restaurant with a meal.</P>
    <P>There are one or two amusing items in relation to the menu.  I see from the <i>table d'hôte</i> menu that fresh soup has to be served but the <i>á la carte</i> menu it is just soups.  Why make the distinction?  Why have fresh soups on one menu and soups on the other?  We have that going right through the regulations.  Senator Ross made the valid point this morning that there are restaurants which cater for vegetarians and it is only right to recognise them.  Many people frequent those restaurants and enjoy the food served.  The serving of meat in restaurants should be an option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with most of my colleagues who have spoken today and pointed out some of the ludicrous elements involved in this set of regulations.  A particular point to be made is that, where these are acceptable as some kind of optimal guidelines, when they become legally binding, as do regulations which become part of an Act, they only underline the ludicrous element that they contain.  They are, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, on the one hand absurdly specific in their particularity and, on the other hand, also open to very wide interpretation. The conclusion that has been drawn by many Senators from this &mdash; and it is one that I am also forced to draw &mdash; is that this is an attempt to frustrate the intent of the Bill by the way they are drawn up at the behest of a lobby from <Col N="1412" /> the publicans' interests.  This is most unfortunate and regrettable.  I notice that the Minister in his speech introducing these regulations said that tourists will now be able to enjoy our internationally known national drinks along with their meals in the confines of good quality Irish restaurants.  That is something that one, obviously, would welcome.  However, as an aside I would like to say that I very much hope that we will continue to have our internationally known Irish drinks because if what is contemplated by the take-over of Irish Distillers goes ahead we are not going to have any, particularly in the field where we are justly internationally famous, the field of Irish malt whiskey.  We are simply not going to have those drinks; they are going to be brand names owned and operated by international concerns from outside this country. Let us not fool ourselves on this particular aspect.  I hope the Minister, and every person concerned in this area, will add to the lobby to make sure that this attempt to take-over an identifiable part of our industry will not be allowed to go ahead.</P>
      <P>There is also a considerable vagueness with regard to much of the drafting.  It is all intended to set a kind of headline and it varies between being very detailed and very vague.  I am a little concerned that the Minister also appears to reflect this dichotomy in his own speech.  For example, he says that he will assure the House that the regulations will be both rigidly and fairly enforced.  I believe there is a contradiction there.  I do not think it is possible to enforce those kind of regulations whose manifest absurdities have been brilliantly demonstrated by Senator Ross in a speech that would have done justice to Jonathan Swift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help thinking of the colossal warfare that Swift pictures between those who open their eggs at the big end and those who open their eggs at the little end.  It is this kind of absurdity that is gone into the regulations.  It is simply impossible to administer, and implement, these regulations both rigidly and fairly.  I hope that if they are carried <Col N="1413" /> into law and are given the force of legislation we will not be treated to imbecility; that they will be operated fairly and flexibly.  Flexibility is extremely important although the objectives, I must say, I agree with.  There is a great deal of sanity in the objectives behind these but the minute particularity makes the whole thing absurd.  If they are implemented inflexibly and rigidly they will not, and cannot, be implemented fairly.</P>
    <P>I am also somewhat concerned that there may be what another Senator described as a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation developing; a kind of elitism and snobbism. This may, however, be a paranoia on my part.  I did travel downstairs and got the menus from the Oireachtas restaurant and I will not embarrass the House publicly by reading them out in any great detail but, certainly, the Members' restaurant would qualify.  It is of the very highest standard, as the Minister knows, and there are no less than seven or eight appetisers.  Senator Ross need not worry that we will be disqualified for having less than four.  This led me to consider the restaurant which all staff and Members of the House have access to &mdash; not just limited to Members of the Oireachtas and our guests &mdash; and that is the self-service restaurant.  I was a little concerned lest there should be some kind of class discrimination but I am glad to be able to tell the Minister that on the basis of its menu it too would qualify.</P>
    <P>My suspicions of class discrimination within the House proved to be unjustified although I am sorry to think that there may well be some discrimination outside this House.  I see absolutely no reason, if we are talking as the Minister does about national drinks and so on, for this kind of snobbery.  I do not see why, for example, a fish and chip shop should not serve a bottle of stout with fish and chips. I do not see any reason whatever.  Perhaps, there is one but it has never been drawn to my attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fees, I think they are quite high.  In addition to the price of the licence there are some concealed fees.  For example, the cost of a survey, particularly if it is an appropriate and <Col N="1414" /> detailed survey, is very high indeed, as I am sure the Minister will know.  If one commissions an architect or a surveyor to do a proper survey that is expensive. One then has a fee of £325 for an inspection. How long is an inspection going to take?  Is it going to take an hour?  I know from my own experience in these areas that inspections rarely take very much longer than an hour and £325 an hour is a very good rate for any job.  If this is to be the rate I will certainly apply for the job as a private inspector at £325 an hour and I think I would be doing pretty well. Certification at £75 is another absurdly high fee.  We are really talking about the printing of a piece of paper and the affixing of a stamp to it.  I think this is a form of taxation.  I do not think it reflects a kind of parallel between the services required and what the actual certificate at the end of the day is.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to some of the regulations and make some comments on them.  Again, once one gets into definitions the point made fairly strongly by Senator Ryan applies, that the minutiae of definitions make the whole thing rather absurd.  The definition, for example, of a waiting area is an area that is set aside as a waiting area in a restaurant for the purposes only of accommodating persons waiting to enter the dining area of the restaurant for the purpose of consuming a meal, and whose floor area does not exceed 20 per cent of the floor area of the dining area of the restaurant.  That is slightly absurd.  Why 20 per cent?  Why not 15 per cent or 25 per cent?  I am not just making a facetious point because another form of discrimination can unwittingly creep in here.  A number of restaurants might well apply, and might be appropriate to apply, as this kind of restaurant although they were not purpose built as restaurants. Some of the best restaurants in the country are converted churches, barns, old country houses, cottages and so on.  One cannot make this kind of regulation and apply it rigidly and at the same time be fair to the standard of service and the quality of food that is being given.  Again, I worry a little bit about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> It is also slightly absurd to put down &mdash; there may be a good reason for it &mdash; in Part III, paragraph 5 (3) that the restaurant shall be of substantial and durable construction, structurally safe and in good repair throughout.  We are dealing with reasonably intelligent citizens and one hopes that the intellectual, moral and spiritual effort involved in tourists arriving here, transcending all the difficulties of travel, means that they must be of certain intelligence.  They are scarcely likely to enter voluntarily a restaurant that is of insubstantial, transitory construction, that is structurally unsafe and in bad repair.  We are not dealing, one hopes, with a class of native or imported amadán although there may be, I suppose, some technical reason for this. I will be interested to hear from the Minister if it is intended to try to advance the situation where restaurant standards are improved.  The particularity, the minuteness with which this is spelled out, is absurd.</P>
    <P>Regulation No. 5 (5) is an example of the same thing.  Perhaps I am wrong.  It states that all public areas of the restaurant should have the means of space heating capable of maintaining a room temperature of at least 18.5 degrees centigrade.  That is very particular.  I know one likes to think that people would be comfortable and soon but, again, what about old country houses?  How was this temperature arrived at?  It is extremely specific.  In particular, I would have to say that I do not know even about places like Bunratty Castle but certainly in some of the old houses with stone-construction it might be quite difficult to maintain that temperature.  In our excellent column my predecessor, and successor, who is an authority on this area, Helen Lucy Burke, pointed out that in a place where she enjoyed an exceedingly good meal the temperature was particularly low which she felt was appropriate because the proprietors were Protestants and she said that it is well known that Irish Protestants are impervious to cold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with the fact that the regulations are absurdly specific in certain areas and then they allow wide latitude.  When one takes that, together with the fact that in his introductory speech the Minister said that these regulations would be applied both &ldquo;rigidly and fairly&rdquo;, I am trying to draw out the fact that the regulations are capable of an absurd interpretation and that it is actually impossible to be both rigid and fair.  If you insist on 18.5ºC as a kind of controlled temperature you are just simply making a nonsense out of the situation.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, to welcome paragraph 5 (6) which states that: &ldquo;Where feasible, accessibility to all public areas of the restaurant shall be provided for disabled persons&rdquo;.  This is absolutely to be welcomed.  The Minister is to be congratulated for including this-regulation. I hope it will be implemented. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, despite the fact that during the Year of the Disabled we did absolutely nothing whatever for the disabled, we do have the names of Senator Ross, Senator Ryan and myself on an item on the Order Paper which covers this very area and which says:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in deploring the lack of awareness of successive Governments of the difficulties of disabled people, calls upon the Government to introduce legislation ensuring the availability of visible accessibility to all public buildings, facilities of public transport and the removal of obstructions in all public places for disabled people.</P>
      <P>This motion of Senator Ross, Senator Ryan and myself appears to have been taken on board and that is very much indeed to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the dining area, paragraph (7 (1) reads: &ldquo;Every dining area of the restaurant shall be so ventilated at all times that no odour from the kitchen is perceptible&rdquo;&mdash; the word is spelled right <Col N="1417" /> in my copy, although it was not correct in Senator Ryan's.  Again, this is so pettifogging. I would have to say to the Minister that in some of the best restaurants on the Continent it is part of the particular pleasure of the diner that you can smell the superb culinary process going on behind doors; what you do not want is a smell of boiled cabbage and stale cheese.  But, you are in an excellent restaurant, it is part of the titillation of the appetite to have these odours passing in front of your nostrils.  I am surprised, however, that if the Minister is into odours and this sort of business he did not include what would be far more logical: a regulation outlawing the penetration of odours from the lavatories, on which he spends several pages, which would be far more practical than preventing us from having the pleasure of smelling the food in preparation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7. (7) details the seating accommodation: &ldquo;Seating in the dining area shall normally be either an immovable and padded banquette or a strongly constructed chair with a padded cushion.&rdquo;  Again, I will not go into this in too great detail, because again the nonsense has been pointed out.  It is a question of style.  It is extraordinarily arrogant to impose a style particularly in relation to good farmhouse restaurants. One of the things that we have in this country that we can be proud of is the fact that we have some excellent farmhouse restaurants.  It looks just silly, an attempt at ridiculous over-sophistication, to put cushions on these sort of chairs.  I think it is a mistake.  I would be far more impressed, for example, if the real importance of this kind of seating had been underlined in these regulations, because it is not so much this fussy area of style; it is a question of safety, because these very banquettes that we are being encouraged to put in are among the most dangerous things if the materials used in their construction are not specified as complying with the fire safety regulations. Perhaps that is covered by another regulation, but it is this kind of thing that has caused disasters because of noxious fumes.  That would be far more <Col N="1418" /> practical than specifying the availability of cushions and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 7 (9), the detailing of cutlery, condiments and so on, that they should be of good quality and in good condition, that napkins, linen or good quality paper should be provided, appointments &ldquo;shall be of uniform design (not mixed) and in keeping with the overall design of the dining area&rdquo;&mdash; again you are into an area of taste.  It is extemely difficult and dangerous, and also rather patronising, to dictate with regard to taste.  I am all for the variousness of life.  Part of the absurdity has already been pointed out.  If, for example, a service was commissioned and some of this was lost or destroyed, why should it not be replaced by others? If you are into a really high class restaurant where they are using Irish silver of the 18th century you are simply not going to be able to achieve uniformity, and part of the joy of eating is in the variety of design.  There should, we hope be excellence of craftsmanship; but to specify that everything has got to be uniform exposes the fallacy that lay behind Sir Thomas Moore's <i>Utopia</i> where he reduced his ideal to a condition of total inhumanity by laying down all these arbitrary and uniform regulations removing any delight in human individuality and personality.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7. (10) says: &ldquo;Crockery shall be adequate to serve the maximum number of diners capable of being seated in dining area, be in good condition, of good quality and uniform design.&rdquo;  Again, I am rather inclined to laugh at that.  Is the Minister seriously supposing that we are going to have people all seated on these luxury banquettes with uniform tables, waiters all in these different uniforms which are specified, all behaving in the most well-bred courteous and welcoming fashion, but we have not got enough plates so that the people at table seven have to wait until the people at table five have finished and then go around and try to borrow plates from <Col N="1419" /> them?  It really is absurd.  The real world does not operate like that at all.</P>

      <P>It is all laid down here.  I am being very detailed and very particular.</P>
      <P>With regard to cloakroom facilities and toilets, I am very glad to see these kind of regulations coming in.  It is most important that we have good standards here.  It is possible, of course, to mock and guy these sort of things; but they are the kind of thing that gives a very bad impression to tourists if they are not properly serviced and properly looked after.  I would, however, have to echo what some other Senators have said and that is that, if this material has come at the behest of the Licensed Vintners Association, they should really look to the beam in their own eye.  I welcome it, as I welcome the intention of everything that is in this Bill, as an ambition, as something to be wished for.  This is a counsel of perfection in some ways.  It is a counsel of absurd uniformity and minute particularity, but the main thrust of it I would welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 10.(7) states: &ldquo;Waiting staff shall provide friendly and courteous service and be fully conversant with all food and beverages on offer.&rdquo;  That really is a truism.  We all know that should be the case, but how can it be implemented? How can it be policed?  Is a restaurant owner, for example, going to lose a licence, going to be penalised by the loss of his livelihood, simply because one of his employees has had a bad night and gives a piece of impertinence to an inspector?  Although I agree with the Minister's thinking, or the civil servant's thinking, or Bord Fáilte's thinking on this matter, I am not sure how it could be <Col N="1420" /> policed.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay compliment to the people who were engaged in this area of our tourist industry and say that I think in world terms we stand remarkably high.  I have just come back from abroad where the service I received in some of the best restaurants was churlish, patronising, unpleasant and inefficient.  I said to myself, &ldquo;Thank God, I will be going back home to Ireland&rdquo;.  I am glad to say that many people who visited me in the last year or so have said, regardless of the weather, that the kind of courtesy and efficiency you get in this country is simply marvellous.  I would like to place on the record that I think we already have very good standards and they should be encouraged.  I am not sure how they can be policed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is this, a Chathaoirligh, I do not believe it is possible to legislate for good behaviour.  It is possible to encourage, and I think Bord Fáilte are doing a very good job.  If I may say, with regard to a lot of these things, I am on a committee called The Faces of Dublin Business Awards.  I think we will have a very major impact on the appearance of this city because it is encouraging people over a period of years, modelled on the Tidy Towns competition.  But there is no attempt to penalise shop owners for having plastic facias and all this kind of stuff, which is the same kind of thinking as is behind the regulations. People can be exhorted and encouraged; by penalising them I do not think it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not try the patience of the House too much.  The points I have made are reasonably serious.  I certainly believe that there is some degree of importance behind them and I am glad that the courteasy of a full and adequate and proper debate was given to the House.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider one other matter &mdash; and I mean this very, very seriously indeed &mdash; that is, to consider <Col N="1421" /> including in these regulations a requirement with regard to the billing method at the end of a meal, because this is a thing which causes great annoyance.  I feel it should be a requirement that every diner, or the person paying the bill, should receive an itemised account, including the food and the drinks.</P>
    <P>There is a variation of practice in the Irish restaurant trade at the moment.  I must say some restaurants do give you &mdash; it is possible with modern computerised tills &mdash; an itemised account of practically everything you have had, down to a lump of sugar.  Some restaurants, however, go completely to the other extreme and, having paid a bill of about £120, you just get a piece of paper which says &ldquo;Thank you very much £124.  Do come again&rdquo;.  It is very important that we should get an itemised account, particularly when drink is involved, because after a bottle of wine with a meal or an aperitif and a liqueur at the end of the meal and so on, you night like to know exactly what you have spent your money on and exactly how the bill is calculated.  It is of great help.  So I would urge the Minister to try to ensure, if at all possible, that itemised and detailed bills are provided for the customer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ní mór dom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadoírí uile a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht seo.  I have listened with interest, and sometimes apologetically joined in the frivolity, frivolity I did not welcome. Nevertheless, I suppose some levity is welcome in long hours of debate.  It is not appropriate when we are dealing with serious business, as we are in the Seanad or the Dáil; but I suppose it is unavoidable, and I can join in the fun and frolics just as good as anybody else.  I have a feeling that some of the levity introduced by some of the Senators was for the very good reason of playing to the gallery. Reading some of the newspapers this morning we find the lighter side reflected more in the reporting rather than the serious business we are about in these <Col N="1422" /> regulations.  Of course, we find that customary, because legislation of itself does not make for good reading; if we have something lighthearted, frivolous or offbeat, it makes for better reading in the media and it makes for better selling of papers.  However, I suppose it helps lift the boredom of legislative procedures now and then.</P>
      <P>Some of the comments have described these regulations as being fuzzy and too detailed; others have been described as too vague and too general.  Like everything else in life, you cannot possibly please everybody, particularly in a matter such as this.  However, the Minister and I are satisfied that these regulations are fair and well balanced.  They provide the kind of detail which the restaurateurs and Bord Fáilte will welcome as they go about their task of implementation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the request made by some Senators to amend these regulations, I can say now quite categorically that we do not intend to amend these regulations.  A great deal of time and effort have been put into their preparation. Somebody mentioned somewhere &mdash; Senator Ryan, I think it was &mdash; that they were drawn up in a hurry.  I can assure the Seanad, and Senator Ryan in particular, that they were not drawn up in a hurry; they were drawn up after many hours of consultation and debate, mainly in response to all the requests made here and elsewhere in regard to the type of regulations that Members and the trade felt were required.  It is incorrect to say that they were drawn up in a hurry.  In fact, much midnight oil has been burnt in the preparation of these regulations, and I compliment the people who put so much time and effort into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that these regulations are stringent, and I make no apology for this. They are designed to ensure that only restaurants of good quality and high standards are eligible to apply for these licences.  I do not agree with Senator Ross's statement, that no restaurant can meet with all the standards laid down in these regulations.  I have good reason for saying that.  In my view, any good quality restaurant should be capable of meeting <Col N="1423" /> the requirements.  These requirements in draft form are not unknown to the people concerned.  That is my main basis for saying that restaurants will not have the sort of difficulty outlined by Senator Ross.  I would add that Bord Fáilte are not, of course, the arbiters of good taste; but we cannot afford to ignore the importance of such matters as the standard of design and general layout to the overall physical standard of a restaurant. We are treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves, despite the frivolity which I mentioned occurred earlier during the debate.  I make allowances for a certain amount of it.  Nevertheless, it is a very serious matter and I would hope that it would be treated like that in the broadest sense.</P>
    <P>As this House is aware, Bord Fáilte for decades have been involved in the inspection and grading of tourist accommodation. Over this time they have developed an expertise in assessing the quality and standards of such areas as kitchens and dining rooms and the various sectors of the industry.  I can assure the House that the board will use this experience to apply the restaurant regulations in a practical and reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that the provision of these regulations would impose a strain on personnel numbers in Bord Fáilte. I can say with all sincerity that in my experience since coming to this post in the Department is that the personnel of Bord Fáilte have proven in the past 15 months that they will accept any challenge given to them; and we in Government gave them some challenges for the industry and they came up trumps.  I do not doubt their ability to achieve what is required under these regulations: to ensure that they are carried out without let or hindrance and that they are capable of doing it in the manner in which they are prepared and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Requirements such as those relating to the menu content and the maximum capacity of air are to ensure that the primary business of licensed restaurants continues to be the <Col N="1424" /> provision of substantial meals to the public.</P>
    <P>The provision of drink must be ancillary to this business.  We do not wish to create a situation where, by virtue of the size and scale of the operations, people could be tempted into developing cabaret-style establishments.  I was generalising in my reply when the question was asked about the number of 250 that we have set in the regulations.  This would mean that they would run the risk of breaching the basic requirements of the Act, which is that the restaurant's main business is the supply of substantial meals.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some Senators are worried about imposing &mdash; they did not use the term but I will use it &mdash; a straitjacket on restaurant cuisine.  However, it is for this reason that regulation No. 11 (6) has been included.  It is evident that some Senators just read through the sections because, while some Senators found parts of the regulations repugnant and confining in regard to types of meals, we had other Senators who obviously read on a bit further, even quoting No. 11 (6), which broadens the scope for meals.  It specifically allows speciality restaurants to substitute for main courses their own special dishes or, as the Senator brought up last night, to provide for vegetarians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of Senators raised the question of toilets.  I would like to remind the House that, as they known, this is an area where Ireland does not enjoy a particularly good reputation internationally.  The requirements in the regulations are specific and are based on a number of factors, including the different needs of males and females, the need for personal hygiene, comfort for the diner and, finally, what Bord Fáilte feel are the kind of standards to which most of our international tourists are accustomed.  I think it is very important also that there should be changing and toilet facilities for staff.  The staff <Col N="1425" /> need this degree of privacy and should not be asked to change clothing and clean up in public facilities.  The latter would also, of course, hardly be in keeping with normal expectations of high standard restaurant facilities.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Doyle and others mentioned the stringency of the standards. Of course, I should like to make it clear to the House that the standards we are insisting on are high and are stringent. However, they do not supersede the food hygiene regulations, which continue to apply to all food establishments, licensed or unlicensed.  Non-compliance with these regulations before us will merely mean that a restaurant will not be able to sell liquor.  It does constitute a reason for becoming a non-hygienic restaurant.  I can assure the House that the health boards, who have the responsibilities in that area, will ensure that that element is looked after.</P>
      <P>Another point raised was &mdash; I have already mentioned it briefly &mdash; Bord Fáilte's capacity to undertake the role provided for them in the Act.  Coupled with that was the mention of fees.  The fees under the regulations are set to ensure that they cover the full cost of maintaining a full and vigorous inspection system.  Fees income will allow Bord Fáilte to retain the staffing levels, despite any reductions there may be in funding. I would particularly like to refer to a section of my opening address last night. Senator Norris might be interested in this, because he is of the opinion that he would do well to get a job with Bord Fáilte inspecting premises at £325 an hour.  I would like to put him straight on that part of it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote again from the contribution I made last night: &ldquo;Inspection and application procedures for a Bord Fáilte certificate are set out in Part II of the regulations.  Applications must be accompanied by an application and inspection fee of £325 stipulated in that schedule.  This fee and the £75 certification fee are pitched at these levels to cover the cost to Bord Fáilte of processing applications, verifying entries, carrying out inspections, preparing <Col N="1426" /> reports, issuing certificates, maintaining a register and enforcing the regulations throughout the year.&rdquo;  That is a different thing altogether to what the Senator was indicating: that for inspecting for an hour he would get £325.  I want to correct that. Fees at a lower level than those required by the regulations would effectively mean that the State would have to subsidise the restaurant Sector to ensure that they satisfy the statutory requirements for liquor licensing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I would be permitted to develop some other points raised that I have not covered in the general reply. At the outset I should acknowledge the contributions made by Seanadóirí as Gaeilge.  For the record, I want to thank Senators Manning, Bohan, Ross, McEllistrim, Ferris, Cregan, Lydon, Ryan, Doyle and Norris for their wide-ranging contributions to this debate.  I suppose I should take them in the order in which they spoke; I will do the best I can.  Many of the items raised by Senators I have already generally covered.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom McEllistrim talked about the regulations we have before us.  This point came up on a few occasions.  These regulations have come about from the debates that were held on the Bill going through both Houses of the Oireachtas, and they were drawn up and put together after much consultation.  It was refreshing to hear someone like Senator Ferris.  His obvious experience and positive approach was the sort of contribution that I personally welcome, the kind of contribution that, I am sure, this Seanad welcomes and that the nation as a whole welcomes.  We have had sufficient negative thinking and bashing at ourselves. However, Senator Ferris, first of all, thanked us for honouring the commitment given by the Minister &mdash; and I would say we are getting very good in this Government at fulfilling promises &mdash; and the regulations are here for discussion.</P>

      <P>Better late than ever.  Más maith is mithid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> I appreciate the Senator's obvious understanding of what is required and what is being done.  It is very welcome indeed and I am sure that positive note is being taken of it.  The Senator raised the question of the ancillary buildings and so forth.  The core of the restaurant is what we are talking about.  Ancillary services like stores and staff requirements may be located separately.  I say to Senator Cregan that these regulations are provided for only in the 1988 liquor licensing laws and relate only to the special restaurant licences.  Senator Cregan developed the point and I agree with him, that serving food with drink is not the same as serving drink with food.  He made that distinction.  These regulations govern the latter part of his sentence, the special restaurant licences.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Senator and everybody else that Bord Fáilte will enforce these regulations as approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The standards are set; and if a restaurant complies with them it will get a certificate; if it does not comply it will not get a certificate. Nothing could be simpler than that.  That is the point raised by Senator Cregan.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate we had doubts expressed about the type and number of licences and who would get them.  The only thing I have to say is that some of us have very short memories if we now find that the regulations the Government have introduced are as some Members have said.  Were we not requested to do all of these things?  Were not all these doubts expressed in the debates in this House, in the Dáil, in the media and anywhere else one cares to mention?  These doubts are covered by the various items that are now embodied in the regulations.  We have, in my view, set high standards in these regulations and that is as it should be.  Why should we have anything less than the best?  We are availing of this opportunity to set high standards for an industry which we hope in the future and in the short term will provide wealth and jobs.  Why not set ourselves high standards?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The regulations are no more detailed than the current regulations for hotels, guesthouses and other forms of accommodation. Restaurants will welcome the detail and will know quite clearly in advance what is required of them if they wish to be licensed.  It is important for the House to remember that these regulations are for restaurants and therefore could only be expected to appear technical and detailed to lay people like us. Senators referred to the provision in the regulations of facilities for the disabled. I can assure the House that these regulations mean what they say.  Where possible, Bord Fáilte will be insisting on providing facilities for the disabled.  At the moment there are good restaurants who will meet all other requirements, but because they are located at basement or second floor level they could not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, these regulations say &ldquo;where feasible&rdquo;, but I am saying where physically possible.  Now who stands corrected?  Thank you for the interjection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is: where physically possible. I am trying to explain to the Senator that there are restaurants at various levels, such as basement and second floor, and there is no way we could insist in that case that provision would be made to accommodate disabled people.  That is why we say &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; in the regulations. What I am saying now, as an extension of that point and an explanation of it, is <Col N="1429" />&ldquo;where physically possible&rdquo;.  It should not be construed, as was said by some people, as a sop or some similar reference. It is disgraceful to have Senators referring in that manner to our efforts to ensure that facilities would be provided where feasible for disabled people.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Senator Lydon's worldwide experience of restaurants.  I cannot say that I have the same experience.  It is rather limited to a little of North America and the Continent.  I suggest, in all honesty and perhaps with some touch of frivolity, that we are legislating for Ireland and not Japan, Greece or any of those exotic places the Senator mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about the regulations requiring the provision of car parks.  That is not quite so.  We are saying that where car parks exist we require that they be kept tidy and clean and meet the high standard we are aiming at.  We are not suggesting that car parks must be provided.</P>
    <P>I will reply to Senator Norris's question about the billing.  I think he will find that is satisfactorily covered in paragraph 11(2) of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I meant to say this to Senator Lydon when I was speaking about his experience of restaurants.  The regulation that the reception and waiting areas are in keeping with the dining area relates to good condition and good quality, a precondition of paragraph 7 (2) of that the dining area should be in keeping with the overall design of the restaurant.  The regulations do not insist on any particular <Col N="1430" /> style or design; nor, I am sure, will Bord Fáilte.</P>

    <Title>Insurance (Export Guarantees) Bill, 1988  [  Certified Money Bill ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £300 million to £500 million the aggregate amount of liabilities which I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, may assume at any one time in respect of export guarantees under the Insurance Act, 1953, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance Act, 1953, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make arrangements for the giving of guarantees for the purposes of encouraging exports.  This is the legislative basis for the export credit insurance <Col N="1433" /> and finance scheme.  The principal aims of the scheme are to help maintain the competitiveness of Irish exports, to stimulate export growth and to encourage diversification into new markets.  The scheme assists and supports Irish exporters by providing them with protection against non-payment for either commercial or political reasons by foreign buyers.  It also provides access to export credit finance from the banks at preferential interest rates.</P>
    <P>The existing ceiling on liabilities of £300 million was set in 1981.  However, demand for export credit insurance has increased considerably over the past year or two and as a result aggregate liabilities are now approximately £298 million.</P>
    <P>This is a positive development because it comes as a direct consequence of the growth in Irish exports generally.  This House will be well aware that export growth is central to the Government's programme of economic recovery.  Last year Irish exports reached an all time high of £10.7 billion and the indications are that export performance in 1988 will be even better than 1987.  We now expect total exports to reach a record £12 billion this year.  In order that we might continue to facilitiate this growth, the Government consider it necessary to increase the statutory limit on liabilities from £330 million to £500 million.  Growth in demand for export credit not only reflects the growth in our exports but also the diversification of exports into non-traditional markets.</P>
    <P>The export credit scheme is intended to run on a self-financing basis over time. Any costs borne by the Exchequer should be made good by premium income and recoveries on outstanding claims.  This is a very desirable policy objective which this Government and previous Governments have pursued.  However, it is impossible to eliminate the risks associated with international trade.  Changing political situations and the emergence of severe debt servicing problems in many Third World and developing countries are factors which are outside of our control. Such factors greatly compound the commercial and political risks in selling <Col N="1434" /> abroad.  Consequently, there has been a rise in the level of claims over the past few years to the extent that there is a cumulative deficit on the scheme of approximately £12.8 million as at 31 December 1987.  This deficit must be seen in its proper context, however.  It is very small when compared with the £4.5 billion worth of goods insured under the scheme in the same period.  A significant amount of this £4.5 billion worth of exports would not have taken place without the support of the export credit scheme.  With the deficit representing less than 0.3 per cent of total insured exports, there has clearly been considerable economic benefits derived from the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I am still anxious that our commercial objective of ensuring a break-even situation in the scheme be achieved through careful management of both premium levels and debt recovery practices.</P>
    <P>Every effort shall continue to be made to ensure a maximum recovery of outstanding debts.  Export credit claims arise from either commercial default or political default.  Typical examples of commercial default would be where the overseas buyer becomes insolvent, gets into financial trouble or simply refuses to pay.  A typical example of political default would be where the buyer has the local currency to pay for the goods or services, but due to foreign exchange shortages in the buyer country, the Central Bank in that country is not able to release the equivalent foreign exchange. Up to end 1987, commercial claims amounted to approximately 62 per cent of total net claims, whereas political claims amounted to 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>Approximately £9 million of the current deficit is made up of political claims arising from foreign exchange shortages in debtor countries.  The main countries involved are Nigeria, Argentina, Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone.  These debts are really sovereign or Government debts of the countries concerned.  While it would be unrealistic to expect a 100 per cent recovery of such debts, there is a reasonable chance of securing some <Col N="1435" /> recoveries but probably over a fairly lengthy period of time.  Prospects of recovering moneys from Nigeria have been enhanced by the signing of a Bilateral Debt Rescheduling Agreement with the country in December 1987.  This agreement provides for repayment of insured trade debts over the next six years.  Progress has also been made in Argentina with interest payments on outstanding debts received in the past few months. In addition promissory notes have been received in respect of these debts and some money should be recovered on these promissory notes later this year. The prospects of recovering outstanding debts in Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone are less favourable, although it is hoped to conclude a debt rescheduling agreement with Tanzania later in 1988.</P>
    <P>As regards commercial claims, I anticipate that some recoveries will be obtained on claims incurred and I can assure the House that every effort is being made in this regard.  We have had some progress already.  A full recovery was made in March of this year in respect of an Irish export order for China where a claim of some £1.7 million was paid in September 1987.  Two large claims of approximately £6 million arose from defaults by two US companies.  Negotiations in regard to recovery of these debts, which have been both difficult and complex, are reaching a critical stage. While I am unable to give the House today an indication of how much we are likely to recover, I do however expect that some recoveries will be made.</P>
    <P>I am also confident that a proportion of the deficit can be offset through increased premium income.  I anticipate that the increase in premium income will arise in two ways.  First, the growth in demand for export insurance is likely to be sustained, and this in itself will give rise to higher receipts.  Secondly, and more important, premium rates for the vast bulk of policy holders were increased by an average of 10 per cent at the beginning of this year, the previous increase having occurred in 1986.  Premium rates for certain medium term credit policies were increased by <Col N="1436" /> over 50 per cent from January 1988, but this was the first increase in these rates since 1971.  New charges for the provision of guarantees in respect of export credit finance took effect from 1 April 1988. Notwithstanding all these higher charges, premium rates charged for export credit insurance in Ireland compare favourably with other countries.  A recent survey carried out by the OECD showed that Ireland was ranked sixth lowest out of 20 countries in terms of premium rates for export credit insurance.  I am confident that we have managed to strike a reasonable balance between the need to operate the scheme according to commercial criteria on the one hand and the need to provide a competitive and attractive product for the exporter on the other.</P>
    <P>I commented earlier on the fact that the need for this legislation arises from the growth in our exports generally.  In terms of providing insurance against non-payment, I think it is quite clear how the scheme facilitates this growth in exports.</P>
    <P>Many companies, particularly small indigenous companies endeavouring to break into new and unfamiliar markets, simply would not be able to carry the risk of non-payment and would not even contemplate quoting for export contracts if it were not for the services provided through the scheme.  However, export credit insurance also provides access to finance from the banks at preferential interest rates.  Access to such finance is made possible either by means of assignment of the exporter's insurance policy or the provision of a State guarantee to a bank.  For Irish pound financing the exporter can borrow at AAA interest rates.  Many small to medium sized exporters would not otherwise be able to obtain finance at such competitive rates. Small or medium sized exporters are often charged A or AA interest rates which involve significant additional interest costs.  Export credit insurance therefore has the added attraction of opening the door to otherwise unaffordable working capital to finance exports.  More important, this export credit finance should not normally interfere with other credit facilities or limits <Col N="1437" /> which may be available to exporters from the banks.</P>
    <P>There are two finance schemes in operation at present, the short term finance scheme which relates to exports sold on credit terms of up to one year and the medium term finance scheme which relates to exports of capital goods and credits of up to five years.  The short term finance scheme has not been used by exporters as much as I would have liked. I believe that there must be scope for getting more exporters to use this facility. With this in mind I have asked my Department and ICI to carry out a detailed review of the short term finance scheme to see where the problems lie. However, the review will have to take into account the requirement that the scheme should not make a loss.</P>
    <P>I have also asked officials of my Department and ICI to discuss the operation of the scheme with the banks.  The banks have a major role to play in this area and I would like to see them taking on a more active and supportive approach to financing exports, particularly in the area of risk sharing.  They have made a number of suggestions as to how the scheme might be improved and these are being considered at present by my department and ICI.</P>
    <P>At present the export credit scheme is covering about £750 million worth of exports annually.  This is actually quite small relative to our total exports, which amounted to £10.7 billion in 1987.  One of the reasons for this is that the bulk of our exports are to OECD countries, which many exporters consider to be reasonably safe markets and where they have often built up long-term relationships with buyers.  Another is the fact that inter-company sales are not insurable. The facilities available under the export credit scheme are relatively straightforward. If exporters are concerned about devoting too much time and resources in attending to details of export insurance cover, they can employ a suitable insurance broker to handle such matters at no extra cost to themselves.  I would encourage exporters to think about using the facilities under the <Col N="1438" /> scheme.  They may find that it opens up a whole new range of business opportunities for them which they might not otherwise be in a position to exploit. However, the availability of this service does not mean, of course, that a company can do away with its own credit control department.</P>
    <P>Since 1971 the export credit scheme has been administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc as agent for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Exporters considering availing of the scheme should in the first instance make their approach to ICI.  In November 1987 a new comprehensive agreement was concluded by my Department with ICI. The agreement provides for close cooperation between the Department and ICI in the day-to-day operation of the export credit scheme.  This new agreement should enhance the administration of the scheme and will enable my Department and its agents to continue to provide valuable service to exporters.  At my request ICI are installing computerised facilities to enable detailed buyer information to be stored in a readily available format.  This should improve the speed of response within ICI to the benefit of the exporter.  Of course, while I recognise fully the need for a fast, efficient export credit service, this need must be balanced against the need for careful, judicious underwriting to minimise the risk to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>All our major trading competitors provide Government-supported export credit insurance and finance schemes to assist their exporters in winning valuable contracts abroad.  If the Irish Government did not operate a similar scheme it would mean that our trading competitors would have a competitive edge over Irish industry, particularly in certain international markets.  We simply cannot allow this to happen.  I do not see the scheme as some sort of expensive luxury. It is a vital tool in encouraging continued growth in exports, particularly in more non-traditional markets, and generating industrial prosperity with, hopefully, more jobs for the future.  For example, as a result of the development of new <Col N="1439" /> business opportunities in Iraq and in the context of the Irish-Iraqi Joint Commission, it was decided to provide export credit facilities in respect of that country. This is a positive development in terms of sustaining export growth in the long term.</P>
    <P>When comparison is made with other OECD countries, our scheme has performed quite well.  Other export credit agencies have suffered massive losses in recent years mainly because of the severe debt crisis affecting developing and Third World countries.  Fortunately, because most of our exports are directed to OECD countries, we have not suffered losses to the same degree as other credit agencies.  A recent survey of export credit facilities on OECD countries showed that for 1986 Ireland was ranked fifth out of 20 in terms of profitability, that is in terms of premium income relative to claims paid.  I believe that the availability of export credit insurance and finance can in very many cases be the deciding factor in whether or not a company will proceed with an export contract.  It can eliminate the risk which might otherwise be unacceptable and provide access to valuable working capital which might not otherwise be within the compny's limited resources.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, by increasing the statutory limit on export guarantee liabilities to £500 million, this Bill will make a valuable contribution to the further growth of Irish exports.  I therefore recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a very positive step basically.  The increasing of the limit from £300 million to £500 million for the purpose of guaranteeing payment for goods by foreign countries through the export credit insurance system is a very forward looking approach.  I am also glad to note that the Minister outlined the problems that can be created in international trade and that he will try to minimise the risk to the Exchequer which is very important.  It gives greater incentives to the exporter <Col N="1440" /> to find that £200 million more is guaranteed. It will make clear to business entreprenuers who have been quite slow to try to get into the export market that this increase could be very beneficial to them.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of us to speak on the Bill without paying tribute to the people who have already been in the export trade in this country for quite a number of years, people who have gone to developing countries and Third World countries and who have got markets for themselves no doubt with the help of State-sponsored bodies.  They have, however, taken the initiative themselves and gone out and worked in conditions that were not very good; they have been away from their families for quite a long time, under a lot of pressure to make deals, especially when they are not sure of the market.  They should be congratulated on the work they have done, especially in the last number of years when exports increased dramatically. They have made great personal sacrifices and they have been very beneficial to our country.</P>
      <P>The internal market in 1992 seems to be on everybody's lips.  This is another positive step forward that manufacturers should be made aware of.  It should help them be more competitive coming up to 1992 and the internal market.  There is a great opportunity for Irish industry to be ready to grab.  They have to be made aware of the need to export.  That is a very important part of the Government's job and I have no doubt that the Minister will undertake it with a lot of enthusiasm and I believe he will get help from all political parties in that task.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of it is that Irish industry should be far more aware of the potential that there is in marketing their goods. I know it can be very expensive but in marketing the goods &mdash; obviously in other countries &mdash; the awareness should be there.  Irish exporters should be encouraged to spend more money on marketing. It is very beneficial for the expansion of their businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going through a newsletter from the Confederation of Irish Industry and they made one particular suggestion <Col N="1441" /> about an Export Marketing Services Association which, I think, would have a lot of recommendations for Irish industry. They state that:</P>
    <P>The confederation plans to establish an Export Marketing Services Association with the following objectives and structures.</P>
    <P>Objectives</P>
    <P>To provide representation on policy issues specific to international trade</P>
    <P>To provide a forum for co-ordinating representation on issues affecting export trade in goods and services</P>
    <P>To promote specific action to increase exports</P>
    <P>To promote development of firms engaged in the provision of export marketing services</P>
    <P>To promote public and political awareness of the strategic importance of expanding exports.</P>
    <P>Structure</P>
    <P>Members of the Association would be confined to firms who provide direct marketing services to manufacturing and traded services industries in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That could be a very worthwhile system to take on board and whatever help the Minister's Department could give in the creation of it would be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>Another positive step in this Bill&mdash;and the Minister mentioned it in his speech &mdash; is job creation.  There can be quite a lot of job creation in the export trade.  Local communities and small businesses could become involved.  There are prohibitive costs in public and employers' liability insurance and many small industries are afraid to start up because of this.  I know the Minister is quite aware of this and I would be grateful if he would consider taking action on it as soon as possible. Many local communities in my own county, and certainly in rural Ireland, would quite willingly try to go into small developments in manufacturing industries but for the prohibitive costs which <Col N="1442" /> are sometimes frightening.  Better deals from finance agencies, more venture capital, etc., would also be worth looking at.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the Bill.  It is very positive legislation and I hope it will be very successful in benefiting our exporters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is non-contentious and it should have the support of all parties.  I believe it will.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £300 million to £500 million the aggregate amount of liabilities which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may assume at any one time in respect of export guarantees under the Insurance Act, 1953, as amended.  The fact that there is a need to increase these levels is a logical outcome of recent growth in the economy. In 1987 the country's exports reached an all-time high, amounting to £10.7 billion, and it is anticipated that 1988 will be another record year with exports exceeding the 12 billion mark.</P>
      <P>As an island country, of necessity we must be export-orientated and so the availability of export credit insurance is essential to Irish companies who are endeavouring to compete on the world market.  The principal aim of the scheme is to help maintain the competitiveness of Irish exports and to encourage and assist export companies to diversify into new markets which will in itself stimulate export growth.  The scheme gives Irish companies guarantees of payment if, for whatever reason, be it commercial or political, a buyer fails to honour the terms of payment.  This guarantee also provides access to export credit finance from banks at preferential interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that until the Minister's address I was not aware that the Irish pound financing exporter can borrow at AAA interest rate by the assignment of the exporter's insurance policy or by the provision of a State guarantee to the bank.  The majority of small businesses are usually charged the A or the AA interest rate which involves additional interest charges.  Let me ask the Minister is it mandatory for the banks to extend <Col N="1443" /> the AAA facility to all companies when they use export credit collateral or do they have to ask specifically for this special rate of interest?  The problem for most medium to small companies when they win a large export order is to finance the manufacture and delivery of the goods.</P>
    <P>In the early seventies it was possible when dealing with companies in developing countries to negotiate advance payments with the order or, alternatively, you could obtain a letter of credit confirmed by an international bank which would in itself give you a guarantee of payment.  However, with increased international competition such conditions are no longer readily available.  I believe more and more companies will take out export credit insurance to cover their risks and will need to be in a position to offer extended credit to their customers which this insurance allows.</P>
    <P>Also, under this scheme the export credit insurance has the added facility which allows the exporters to obtain working capital from the banks at competive interest rates.  These additional facilities do not interfere with the company's standard agreed credit terms or limits.  The scheme in itself is not unique to Ireland, as other Governments have similar facilities such as the ECGD in the UK, Coface in France and Hermes Credit in Germany.  In fact, all our major trading competitors provide similar Government-supported credit insurance and finance schemes to assist their exporters.  It is essential that the Irish Government provide such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the level of usage by exporters has been disappointingly low and he believes that there is scope for getting more exporters to use this facility and he has promised to carry out a detailed review of the scheme. He also said that he hopes that the banks will play a more active role in supporting the exporter and that he will also share the risk with the Government.  I believe that the majority of people in the country would agree that the banks should be more supportive and that any advances <Col N="1444" /> that the Minister makes in getting the banks more actively involved in giving unsecured credit to exporters would be a very welcome initiative.  Also, I would add that exporters would be a very welcome initiative.  Also, I would add that export credit insurance should be widely advertised because I believe that there are small companies who are not aware of its existence.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government's special trading house scheme, which was approved by the European Commission last February and which is designed to promote the growth of exports of Irish-manufactured goods, will qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation profit tax as well as benefiting from investments under the business expansion scheme. The trading houses can also avail of the full range of facilities under the export credit insurance and finance schemes.  I believe that this is very necessary and it will be a tremendous asset to the licensed trading houses in achieving their set objectives.</P>
    <P>The scheme is administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland as agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and is intended to be self-financing. However, despite the best efforts of the Insurance Corporation there is a cumulative deficit on the scheme of £12.8 million.  I am aware that this is a small fraction of the total exports which have been insured since the scheme was started in 1971 and I am pleased that the Minister is committed to reducing and to eventually eliminating this deficit.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the commercial risks in selling to Third World and developing countries are substantial. However, it must also be recognised that these countries can provide a very lucrative market for our exporters.  I would like to ask the Minister what alternative methods of payment are available.  For example, is it possible for the Government to procure, say, oil from Nigeria in exchange for Irish-manufactured products? I refer to Nigeria specifically because I am aware of one multi-national company operating in Ireland and employing several hundred people who <Col N="1445" /> are currently reviewing their sales policy to Nigeria and to other such countries because of the financial risks involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the export performance of small indigenous companies, the important role that they would need to play in the Government's strategy of export-led growth and how the availability of export credit insurance and finance will assist them in fulfilling their role.  I would ask the Minister has he considered setting up a similar type insurance scheme to protect manufacturers supplying goods on the home market and in particular supplying goods under Government contracts.  I am aware that there is an insurance scheme available but it is very, very expensive.  I believe there is a need for such a scheme or such a Government initiative.  In the last five or six years, due to the recession in the building industry and increased competition among contractors, many companies are submitting tenders at well below cost and they are hoping that variations and extras and the expenditure of prime cost and provisional sums will make up the shortfall.  Subsequently, many of these companies are getting into financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I accept it is only fair that in a competitive situation, all things being equal, the lowest tender should be accepted. However, design teams, I believe, such as architects, engineers and quantity surveyors, have a grave responsibility to ensure that the tender accepted is not below the actual cost required to carry out a contract in full compliance with the drawings and specification.  I believe that the design team have a responsibility to advise the Government Department, when making a recommendation in appointing a contractor or a subcontractor, that the tender complies with the cost plan and is sufficient to complete that contract.  It is a known fact that tenders are being accepted for Government contracts which are well below cost and subsequently manufacturers and small businesses and suppliers have been caught by what can only be described as fly-by-night operators, they have been caught for goods supplied and installed <Col N="1446" /> by these contractors and they have not been paid for them.  I believe that a nominated supplier in such an instance should be compensated by the Government for any loss incurred by him and in turn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. J. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not relevant to the Bill before us. This is an enabling Bill to increase the liabilities that may be incurred on the export market and you are talking about internal matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the home market is the important market for the manufacturer and unless the home market is secured it is very difficult for that exporter to develop an export market as such.  If the Chair will let me finish, briefly, I may get the point across a little more clearly.  As I said earlier, I believe that a nominated supplier in such an instance should be compensated for any loss incurred and that in turn the Government should be indemnified by the professional team if it can be proved that they recommended the below-cost tender which resulted in the contractor incurring a substantial loss and subsequently going into liquidation.  This may not be relevant but it is all part of insurance which is necessary for the small manufacturer.  A situation now exists whereby a nominated manufacturer supplying goods to a subcontractor on a Government contract must sign a vesting certificate relinquishing all title to the goods as soon as they are delivered.  This is unfair and inequitable.  I would be pleased if the Minister could look into this matter and maybe take some corrective action on it. It is most important that small indigenous manufacturing companies are given a fair and level playing field, at least on the home market, if we are to expect them to go abroad and win valuable contracts.</P>

    <P>In conclusion, I fully agree with the Minister that increasing the statutory limit on export credit guarantee liabilities to £500 million will make a valuable contribution to the further growth of Irish exports.  It will prove very helpful, particularly to small indigenous companies.  I <Col N="1447" /> understand that a total of 350 companies employing 40,000 people are using this scheme and that 80 per cent of these companies are Irish.  I am confident that this export insurance credit facility will continue to be a valuable instrument in protecting jobs, generating new export orders, and, in turn, creating further employment.  I am pleased to support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be the first person who has been accused of being irrelevant in the first sentence he spoke.  I accept that it may well be necessary to have export guarantee insurance.  I wonder what are our banks doing?  They claim that the reason for their profits is because of the risks they take.  The justification, at least in Central Bank terms, for fairly substantial profits by our major banks is because of the risk-taking involved, that they are using other people's money, lending it and taking considerable risks and that there should be a proportion between the profitability and the risk. The extreme example is the oil exploration industry where high risks are taken, in some cases with justification, to justify quite substantial profits in those companies that are successful.  There has to be a proportion between risk and profitability. When you read the Minister's speech &mdash; this is not a criticism of the Minister, although I am quite capable of being critical &mdash; you discover that what this really is about is guaranteeing credit to many exporters from the banks so that the banks do not have to feel that they <Col N="1448" /> are overly-exposed by funding exports. Among other things mentioned is the fact that it enables people to be given a triple A rating rather than a single A rating of interest for borrowings incurred in financing exports.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact among small business people with whom I am acquainted, some of them successful in the high tech area, that the one thing a bank will not lend money on is orders.  You can own substantial property which is totally unrelated to your business and they will lend you money but if you happen to have a full order book, whether it be for domestic or export purposes, you will not persuade most Irish banks to lend on it.  This is by way of contrast with the experience of the same business people in dealing with American companies.  They will tell you that the one thing a bank in the United States will be impressed with and will lend money against, where people actually take risks and operate as unprotected commercial entities, is a full order book.  That ought to be the criterion a bank uses to determine whether it will lend to a company or not, rather than the property and the buildings they own or have a chargeable interest in. It should be based on the actual success of the company of doing what they are good at.  We end up with banks encouraging everybody who has a company to become a property developer in order to facilitate them instead of encouraging people to do what they are good at, which is to produce goods or indeed services that can be sold on the international market at a profit for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of all this is yet another guarantee to the Irish banks that whatever they do they take no risk and they will be protected.  The Minister's speech does not address some of the more serious questions about Irish exports. What we are actually doing is copperfastening the banks yet again.  This exposes the myth that there is a thing called Irish enterprise which is out there competing in the market place, deserving of high reward because of the high achievement and the high risks involved. It appears that the risks involved in <Col N="1449" /> exporting are far less than perhaps the risks of actually selling on the home market.  Anybody who sells on the home market cannot, unfortunately, have access to similar guarantees against loss, as the Minister said, if somebody simply refuses to pay.  It appears that the sort of image of Irish enterprise that we are asked to accept is totally at variance with the facts.  As the chief executive of the ESB said on one occasion, there is no such thing as a private sector in this country. There are those who are protected directly by the State, which are the State organisations, and those who are indirectly protected by the State, the so-called private sector.  This is the classic example here.</P>
    <P>A couple of interesting questions arise from this.  This will perhaps sound strange coming from me but I think the State ought not to be involved in guaranteeing the interest of a private sector who claim the right to generate the profitability as an index of the risks they take.  Why does this have to be done by the State?  Why can the banks, who are major sources of funds, not take on the risk of setting up an export credit insurance scheme such as this instead of it being left to the State to take the risk?  The only reason I can think of is that with the banks, in spite of the rhetoric they go on with, the last thing they want to do is take on a risk of any kind.  Therefore, the State is left with all the serious risks while the banks manage to sidle in and generate most of the profits from the risks.  There is a serious and consistent case for arguing that the whole Irish financial sector ought to be able to develop a scheme like this and get this potential liability &mdash; I know it is not real &mdash; of £500 million off the back of the State.</P>
    <P>At a time when the State is allegedly strapped for money even the actual deficit mentioned by the Minister of over £12 million is a significant sum of money.  It is a sum of money that could bail out one of our health boards, for instance; it could build a considerable number of schools or it could extend a considerable number of hospitals.  Many things could be done with £12 million rather than simply bail <Col N="1450" /> out Irish exporters who should be borrowing money from banks who should ultimately be taking the risk for it.  We are yet again cosseting a largely unproductive Irish sector which seems to be prepared to do everything except take a risk.  Once they take a risk they expect the State to protect them from it.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arise from this, particularly the illusory nature of Irish exports.  There are an increasing number of economists who would raise serious questions about the idea of using GNP growth as an index of economic well-being.  There are also a number of economists who would raise serious questions about using financial services as an instrument of growth.  Many of them would feel that the job creation potential in that area is both illusory and temporary. The figure of £10.7 billion worth of exports for last year and the estimated figure of £12 billion for next year are among the most imaginative figures that this country has ever seen.  Nobody could really believe that we are generating the sort of growth rates in exports in real terms which would leave us ahead of the Japanese, for instance, and still look around at the state of unemployment in the country, the levels of investment, and the deteriorating quality of our public services and believe we are a country with exports growing faster than virtually every other country in the OECD and doing that consistently over the past seven or eight years.  Because we are talking about insurance against risk for exporters, we ought to also look at whether we are actually really measuring our exports or whether we are actually measuring the figures supplied to us by people who have a particular interest in putting a particular figure on the exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably knows more than I do about how multinationals can alter their prices to suit the tax conditions in various countries.  In a country which has problems of such a fundamental nature, the most fundamental one of all being the lack of enterprise in the Irish private sector, to generate illusory numbers which suggest that there is an export boom which this country is benefiting <Col N="1451" /> from does nothing other than to distract our attention from the fundamental reality, which is that our manufacturing industry is largely antiquated.  A considerable proportion of it outside the high tech areas has hardly expanded in the last seven or eight years.  I am referring, from memory, to the Department of Finance's briefing document on the budget which clearly indicated the difference in the levels of growth of the high tech and the other areas of manufacturing industry. Of course, the figures in the high tech industry are, to my mind, as much fiction as they are fact, because they are the products of companies who choose transfer pricing policies which suit those companies. It is an unfortunate basis for any industrial policy that we have to use numbers which are largely mythological and which bear no relationship to the economic realities.</P>
    <P>It would be advisable for politicians of all political persuasions to take a few steps back from the numbers that are waved around by economists and actually ask themselves do they really believe that what is being said about Irish exports reflect's anybody's experience in this country.  The truth is that they do not, because most of our exports are not really Irish exports.  They pass through an almost insulated, independent economy, which is unrelated to the realities of the Irish economy.  Therefore, to suggest that the continual growth of exports will somehow generate extra wealth or, more importantly, extra employment here is nothing less than an illusion.</P>
    <P>A Bill like this, while it is simply an enabling Bill to enable the level of guarantees to be extended and expanded, needs to be addressed for two reasons. First of all, it refers to the illusion of Irish exports.  The one thing which this Bill identifies is perhaps the one part of Irish export achievement which is real, that is, the contribution of indigenous Irish manufacturing industry to our exports.  I accept that the exports to the value of £750 million or so a year by indigenous manufacturers selling Irish products to an international market are real exports.  To <Col N="1452" /> that extent that is to be welcomed, but to presume that we would get the same economic benefit from what I would regard as the mythological figure of £10.7 billion is nothing more than an illusion which can cost us dearly if we build our future plans for economic growth upon it.</P>
    <P>The second issue which needs to be addressed is whether this is something that the State should be accepting the risk for.  Our two biggest banks now see themselves as international banks with an interest in the international marketplace. If that interest in the international market-place cannot take them to the stage where they can assess risk for a client or a customer in a new market, then serious questions arise about their actual expertise.  If they cannot give customers reliable advice about the extent of the risk a customer is undertaking either in political or commercial terms in doing business with a particular country or with a particular customer, then I am not sure they have the expertise that they claim to have and that goes with their alleged participation in the international market-place.  It seems that what underlines this is yet another protection in another area of life for the Irish banks.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Minister, on the Companies Bill, to make it an offence for lending institution to look for personal guarantees from the members of limited companies.  The idea of financial institutions looking for such guarantees is totally at variance with the whole idea of a limited company and puts the banks at a profound advantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> all other creditors of a limited company.  It is typical of our banks that in that area they take no risks while all other customers of a limited company have to accept the risks involved in dealing with the limited company.  It is similar here.  The banks will finance exports as long as they are guaranteed against risk.</P>
    <P>I would like somebody to tell me where in the Irish marketplace, other than in the small area of personal lending for consumer goods, do the banks take any risk.  It seems that there has to be copperfastened security available to <Col N="1453" /> them, often unrelated to the enterprise they are claiming to aid, before they will condescend to lend any money.</P>
    <P>I know, as I have said at the beginning, that they are unwilling to lend on the basis of order books, which is as much a reflection on their extraordinary conservatism as it is on anything else.  I know that they probably would not guarantee or lend money for exports to any country other than to half a dozen of the most secure in the world if they did not have this scheme to protect them.  I would like to know where do they actually take any risks.  The risks they take are very often the risks that their own incompetence does not make them aware of &mdash; for instance, the attempt by AIB to take over ICI.  The irony there is that, while many innocent people who have done their best will lose their jobs when companies go bust, when AIB make a mess like that nobody loses his job.  It shows how unreal the idea is that these banks are actually entities competing in the marketplace, subject to the rewards and penalties of the marketplace.  The one great argument for the market economy is that it both rewards success and penalises failure and, in that process, encourages efficiency. Once you claim to operate a market economy and protect those who are most culpable from a commercial failure, you are actually guaranteeing inefficiency and incompetence.  Underlying legislation such as this and underlying the philosophy behind it is one more demand by the Irish financial sector to be protected from the risks they ought to be taking if they really were what they claim to be: vigorous commercial entities operating in the real world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I would like to welcome this Bill.  As the Minister has indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to increase from £300 million to £500 million the aggregate amount of liabilities which the Minister may assume at any one time in respect of export guarantees under the Insurance Act, 1953.  Like other speakers, I feel that this is a very important scheme for many companies who are exporting at present.  There are not <Col N="1454" /> enough companies participating in the scheme and indeed this has been referred to briefly by the Minister in his address.</P>
      <P>Exporters to non-OECD countries are to be congratulated.  It is a well known fact that they export at great risk.  Great credit is due to them for being what I would regard as the pioneers, paying the way into these new countries, hoping that they will make a profit and in the process creating jobs.  Clearly, there is a great link between the creation of jobs and the scheme in question.  Obviously, if a company incur debts and are unable to collect what is due to them, it could result in very serious problems in terms of loss of jobs, liquidation and so on.  The risk is far greater for those companies than for the companies exporting to the countries of the EC or the other OECD countries.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-OECD countries there are problems with political upheavals and foreign currency and that is all the more reason why companies operating in this new area should get involved in this scheme.  It is a good and effective scheme.  In particular, it should prove effective for a company who are breaking into these new markets for the first time and should help them until they get a proper track record and until they get used to the trading conditions.  The scheme is almost essential for beginners in this kind of situation and for the initial years they must take part in it.  It is vital for Irish exporters to have a guarantee of protection against non-payment for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>The role of the banks has been referred to by a number of speakers and also by the Minister.  Their role is important in this area.  There is no question about that. We are dealing with jobs and the more we export the more jobs will be created. The banks have a role in the financing of exports.  As the previous speaker said, they tend to resort to what appears to be non-risk areas of banking.  Because the creation of jobs is part and parcel of the activity, the banks should take the extra risk involved.  They ought to be big enough now to accept that they have a major role to play in the financing of this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The question of the export scheme has been referred to by the Minister.  He said that not enough companies are involved in this scheme.  He indicated that annually about £750 million worth of exports are covered under the export credit scheme.  That is quite a small figure when one considers that the overall figure for 1987 was £10.7 billion.  The principal aim of the Bill is to help Irish companies exporting to those countries that have been referred to to maintain the competitive aspect of the Irish export industry, to increase export growth and to diversify into new markets.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>The premiums involved have been referred to by the Minister.  He indicated that in this regard we are the sixth cheapest of 20 countries that were surveyed. I know from my own experience that premiums are quite reasonable compared to the risk involved.  I hope that more exporting companies will become involved in the scheme.  It is vital if they are to survive.  Certainly my wish would be that the new measures which the Minister is now introducing will result in more companies becoming active in this area. It goes without saying that this is a Bill that I welcome and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome this Bill, not so much in its detail but because of the reasons why it is necessary to bring it before the House.  It is very refreshing to see that there is a necessity to increase from £300 million to £500 million the aggregate amount of liabilities which the Government have to guarantee. It is indicative of what many are becoming convinced is an upturn in confidence in this economy and in the basic and fundamental pointers in the economy, one of which is exports.  I do not congratulate the Government because I do not think they should take all the credit for the increase in exports, just as I do not think Governments should take credits or debits for everything that happens. They have played a part in the upturn of exports and as a result it is necessary to bring this Bill before the <Col N="1456" /> House.  It is very welcome and it is encouraging to see such a pointer.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech with a great deal of interest.  I was not convinced, before I read it, of the need for a scheme of this sort.  Philosophically, it is difficult to justify the continuous pampering of Irish industry, Irish banks and Irish exporters.  I can see from what the Minister says that if everybody else is at it then we better be at it too, to put it simply.  The OECD countries are practising such a scheme, as are all our competitors. It would appear that we would be at a competitive disadvantage if we did not have a scheme of this sort.  We shall have to accept this scheme.  There is all-party support for it in this House.</P>
      <P>We should examine this scheme as it stands to see why it is not more profitable and if it can be improved in any way. The Minister said that he hopes that this scheme will be self-financing over time. The first problem that arises is that it is not self-financing now.  I would have thought that a scheme like this should operate on a profitable, self-financing basis from day one.  It should be possible not only for the Government to give these guarantees but to run this as a normal insurance operation.  The Minister would say to that &mdash; I will be interested to hear what he says in his reply &mdash; that the premiums would be too high if this were to be the case.  I would have thought that if the income to the scheme would have to be increased then there is something fundamentally wrong with the scheme.  I would like to see this scheme being run on a commercial basis and if it means an increase in premiums then that should be done.  It also means that the debt recovery, which is such an important part of this scheme, would undoubtedly be pursued with a great deal more vigour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the debt owed to foreign countries.  He outlined very frankly and honestly where he thought recovery was possible and where he thought it was not possible.  There are lessons to be learned from this Bill.  One of the lessons is that where debt is considered to be irrecoverable, something should be done in the near future about <Col N="1457" /> not trading with those countries who cannot pay us.  I do not see anything in his speech about that, but the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  I do not particularly want to pick out the countries involved but the Minister has named them.  I would have thought that the lesson from that is that with countries like Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone, it would be right that we consider very carefully before exporting to those countries in future.  We should not only organise a debt rescheduling arrangement with countries who have not paid us in the past but also put up the premiums enormously for anyone who wants to be part of this scheme and still exports to those countries. I do not see any signs of that.  Alternatively we could ensure that anybody who exports to those countries would not join the scheme but rather would export completely at their own risk.  I would have thought that that would be the principal lesson to be learned from this.  If this scheme is to be self-financing over time, the premiums will, unfortunately, have to be increased.  The countries who have registered the bad debts should be barred from the scheme or very special precautions should be taken about trading with them.</P>
    <P>Another point of interest in this scheme is whether there are any limits on the cost to the Exchequer.  There is a cost of £500 million but what would happen if we were hit by an absolute disaster in this scheme?  The Minister said we have been rather successful in this scheme, we have only a deficit of £12.8 million while other countries have hit disasters.  I suggest that that is just because we are lucky and that sooner or later we will be hit by a major disaster.  I would have thought that what is necessary is that very strict ground rules be laid down about the operation of the scheme in the future so that we can, if possible, prevent such a disaster, the sort which other countries suffered.  It is all very well going to the Houses of the Oireachtas and saying we want to be able to guarantee these liabilities, that it is not really going to happen.  There is always <Col N="1458" /> the possibility that exactly that will happen.  That is why the Minister is here.</P>
    <P>This is a sort of doomsday Bill in some ways.  It is most unlikely, but it is just possible that at some stage we will have to pay out £40 million, £50 million or £100 million.  It would be interesting to hear what the Government have in mind for preventing this and for taking precautions against this in the future and for seeing that we do not suffer the same fate as other countries.</P>
    <P>In summary, I welcome the Bill although I think we should be reluctant to give industry or exporters any great preferential treatment in trading.  It is a pity if they feel they are protected to a greater extent than any other traders. Certainly, let us encourage exports.  It is part of the philosophy of every country that any recovery should be export-led.  I would welcome in that area the trading houses set up by the Government as an initiative which shows a great deal of enthusiasm.  It shows that they know the direction in which they are going.  Will the Minister give us an indication of how they got off the ground?  I welcome that initiative.  We could look at other areas where exports could be encouraged. The export sales relief dividends were a great success in their time, and perhaps something could be renewed on a basis like that to encourage people to invest in export-led companies.  The danger in this Bill is that exporters will just feel too readily and too easily protected. It is a one-way bet.  They are obviously getting very cheap insurance, otherwise the Government would not be making a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the contributions by the various Senators and the concluding remarks of Senator Ross.  I concur with him that our future lies in the further developing of exports.  We will do what we can in the form of new initiatives, in addition to moves we have already taken.  The House can be assured that we are continually seeking out new initiatives to try to increase our exports, because we all know that our economic <Col N="1459" /> future depends on the development of our exports.  Two out of every three jobs in this economy depend on exports. Senator Ryan may have certain question marks in relation to export figures but in general terms we will have to continue to pursue and develop our exports.</P>
      <P>I am only too well aware of the new ground rules Senator Ross mentioned, having reviewed this scheme in 1987.  We have taken off cover the countries mentioned in my address to the House, countries where we have incurred bad debts except for one, the United States.  It is interesting to note that of the £12 million deficit on this scheme £6 million represents one single bad debt in the United States, a case that one could say was probably bordering on fraud.  That case is being pursued through different channels. The United States of America is not a country one would expect to run into those problems.  One could expect such a problem in the developing countries. Those developing countries mentioned are off cover and will remain off cover until the position improves.  That is one aspect.  The other aspect is that, as I have mentioned in my speech, we have rescheduled some of those debts to recover them over a period of time.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Senators Ross and Brendan Ryan that the Government do not carry the 100 per cent risk in relation to these exports.  There are different ground rules for different countries, depending on the risk taken.  We do not carry a 100 per cent risk.  In some cases we carry a 90 per cent risk while in others it is 80 per cent of the risk and in others it is 70 per cent of the risk.  At all times the exporter is carrying a share of that risk, depending on the judgment we make of the risk involved and the country to which we are exporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if the Government should be carrying any part of the risk.  It is precisely to help the smaller exporters that this scheme is in being.  We are not concerned about the big multi-national exporters.  They are capable of looking after their own business.  There are schemes in existence in the private sector <Col N="1460" /> that carry those types of risks; but this scheme is specifically to help small exporters get into new markets.  They would not be able to carry the risk.  The most fundamental point that was missed by many contributors was that this scheme is basically to fund the credit period required in those foreign markets. In some cases it is six months, in others it is 12 months and in others it is 18 months.  It is wrong to suggest that some of our smaller indigenous Irish companies would be able to carry that sort of risk on their own.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy pointed out that when the Government give the guarantee behind the export insurance scheme the company covered could then go to the bank and get a triple &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate.  That is there to be got and that is what should be got by an exporter who is a participant in this scheme, who has his credit insurance policy and a guarantee from the State.  He is entitled to the triple &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate and he is very foolish if he takes anything less.  That is not to say that the bank would not try to pawn him off with a lesser rate.  But he is entitled to the triple &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate and he should go and get it.</P>
    <P>We should all join with Senator Gerry Reynolds in complimenting the people in the export field, those who are abroad for maybe six months of the year, who leave their families and have to live in foreign lands.  I have seen them working abroad.  They have a tough job to do in very uncomfortable circumstances from time to time in some of the developing countries.  We should all salute them on their achievements and wish them success in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised a question about overall export performance and the economic benfits to the country.  It is not an area I can get into too deeply but I can say that this country loses out to a large extent in relation to our export performance. I have to agree that after a lot of raw materials are brought in here a certain amount of value is added before the product is sent out again.  This country, and this economy, is losing out to a <Col N="1461" /> large extent by not taking up the opportunities that exist in the large companies that have set up here.  We are only suppliers of goods and services to the tune of about 26 per cent or 27 per cent to all the large companies in Ireland.  It is not their fault.  It is because we have not grasped the opportunities that are there in import substitution and in goods and services.  That is why the economy is not benefiting to the extent that it should benefit by a GNP rate of 5 per cent or by £10.7 billion in exports.  We cannot blame multi-national companies for that.</P>
    <P>There are 900 foreign companies operating here employing 80,000 people. They brought new management and new technology here.  It is up to us to ensure that we grasp the full opportunities that exist both in import substitution and in the supply of goods and services.  It is not that we do not have the ability and the technical expertise to do that.  It is for that reason that I looked at the whole linkage scheme and decided to involve the Irish Goods Council more in it, to adopt a more marketing approach to grasp the opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>The Irish market, in relation to our partners in the EC, is 57 per cent supplied by outsiders.  In other words, 57 per cent of the requirements of the Irish economy come from imports and we supply only 43 per cent of the home market.  If we could lift that 43 per cent to 50 per cent, which is not a major objective to set ourselves, we could create an extra £1 billion worth of business and many thousands of jobs.  In the case of our partners in Europe, only 25 per cent of their home requirements are imported.  A gap has opened up here and it is a matter for ourselves to get our act together.</P>
    <P>A Senator said that these small exporters, for whom the scheme is tailored, should be able to do everything on their own; but I cannot accept that argument.  They are basically indigenous companies.  The scheme is not availed of by multinational companies who are capable of looking after themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy mentioned an insurance scheme for the home market. <Col N="1462" /> Under the scheme, run by ICI, and various other companies, Irish manufacturers and suppliers to the home market can insure their debts.  It is a matter for themselves to work out their own terms with ICI or any of the insurance companies that run it.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Ross that the countries I mentioned in my speech, with the exception of the United States of America, were taken off cover.  I reviewed this scheme in 1987 and those countries were taken off cover, except the United States of America.  For his information I should like to say that half of the £12 million was incurred by one bad debt in the United States of America, £6 million out of the £12 million.  It is true that when one looks at the performance of this scheme since 1971 one will see that less than .3 per cent represents the deficit on the scheme.  It should be a proposition for the private sector.  Indeed, I am looking at the possibility of having it operate in the private sector, because with a low deficit of .3 per cent it should be possible to put a package together.  As far as I am concerned I will take any burden I can off the State but I have to ensure that small exporters get the opportunity, especially indigenous exporters, to cover the credit period more so than the risk. The entire risk is not carried by the Government, not 100 per cent in any case, but 90 per cent, 80 per cent or 70 per cent, depending on the country, depending on the risk.</P>
    <P>More exports leads to more jobs, as Senator Reynolds said.  He raised a question CII have raised, about an export marketing service.  We have in recent times set up a marketing group and I am putting together a company &mdash; it should come to fruition very shortly &mdash; with 25 per cent each held by the IDA, CTT, SFADCo and ICC.  I want them to sell a package to developing countries on international services.  The four bodies will be in one company rather than the four of them going in different directions. Deputy Seamus Brennan, Minister for Trade and Marketing, has also set up a marketing group to sell international consultancy services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> A question has been raised in regard to trading houses.  We have already approved three or four and there are many others on line.  This is another area that can help our small indigenous companies to market their goods abroad, companies that would not have either the financial strength or the marketing expertise or be able to sustain a presence in an international market-place if they got themselves in.  Now they can do what they are good at, the production of goods, and let the experts in international trade and marketing feed back the information to them on the changes in the market and the goods that are required.</P>
    <P>Disasters were mentioned by Senator Ross.  The ground rules are being continuously tightened but, despite our best efforts, and in the most unlikely countries we did incur a bad debt.  We have to watch other OECD countries from a competitive angle.  When there is talk about pushing premiums up through the roof there is no point in having an uncompetitive scheme because it is not going to do the job.  We want to strike that balance all the time.  It is true that premiums were not increased in one specific part of the scheme for quite a long time; but, as I said in my speech, we have increased it. We will continue to watch the scheme and, if I can unload it, I will certainly do so.  However, I want to see it retained so that exporters, smaller exporters in particular, can avail of it.</P>
    <P>Lack of enterprise in the country was referred to by Senator Ryan.  I do not accept that good, bad or indifferent. There is a great air and mood of confidence building up in the country.  As to why it was not there up to now I would certainly put down the marker and say that no investor is going to invest, or think of investing, in a country that had such a perspective as we had.  That was the position whether one was talking about international investment or local investment.  Interest rates were so high that there was little chance of people getting return on investment.  One cannot go out and borrow money if one cannot hope to repay it.  It is as simple as that, <Col N="1464" /> they are the ground rules, the foundation that has to be laid for investment to start. We have been doing that since we came into Government and the country is beginning to see the benefits of it.</P>
    <P>The question of banks is a thorny one. I would agree with certain sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan that the Irish banking system is too much orientated towards bricks and mortar, plant and machinery.  We have already started to make the switch away from buildings, plant and machinery in the budget by reducing capital allowances and slanting it more towards employment because one could not sustain accelerated capital allowances while unemployment was at such a high level.  That is a welcome shift.</P>
    <P>In relation to security, I agree with him that the Irish banking system seem to look for the kitchen sink, and everything else.  The more enterprising economies in the United States, Hong Kong and other countries, take a different approach to banking than we do in Ireland.  They tend to back the idea and the person rather than the building in which a business is situated.  I would certainly welcome any change along those lines.  Personal guarantees I abhor and always did.  It is up to a bank to make a prudent judgment on whether a loan should be granted and having made that judgment I do not think they are entitled to everything thrown in such as personal guarantees. I am not so sure about the Senator's suggestion.  I have looked at it and we will come back to it on a different Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Irish banks doing more in taking risks on exporters and in the other areas where knowledge-based industries are finding it very difficult to get finance.  It is not a building one can stick a security on; nevertheless, it is a very valuable product and ways and means of financing it are going to have to be found.</P>
    <P>The scheme is not really a risk against getting paid but is as much to cover the credit terms as anything else.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy raised a question about dealing with counter trade or barter, or what have you.  I should like to tell him that I am aware that some <Col N="1465" /> countries dealing with certain African states, and other countries, make specific arrangements in relation to counter trade.  I have taken an initiative recently in relation to counter trade and I will certainly look at any possibility of helping an Irish company in that regard.  We are beginning to show some successes on the initiative.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senators who welcome the Bill.  It does reflect the growing confidence that is in the country and the great increase in exports with a consequent demand for more export credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As Henry VIII said to his last wife, I shall not keep you too <Col N="1466" /> long.  I will make a short contribution and it is more of a critical nature than anything else.  Firstly, I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.  I am disappointed that over the last number of years the Department did not make a better effort to purchase more land for afforestation, as I am led to believe that our soil is the most suitable in Europe for tree planting or tree growing.  At present land prices are at their lowest for 25 years.  Much land has come on the market but the Forestry Division are reluctant to purchase it.  There is also land coming on the market in rural and remote areas of the country which is not suitable for agricultural purposes but is very suitable for afforestation.</P>
      <P>About 2 per cent of our land goes on the market every year and the Forestry Division purchase about 0.1 per cent. Most land of that quality would be bought for £300, £400 or £500 per acre.  Much of it is waterlogged and many of the people who own it are reaching an age when they can no longer work the land.  I appeal to the Forestry Division to co-operate more with the Land Commission, as they have had quite an amount of land on their books for many years that has fallen into a state of infertility and decay.  Congests in the areas where it is being sold are refusing to accept it at the price they gave for it.  Some of the land was compulsorily acquired and more of it by agreement.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Division and the Land Commission have never worked together.  The amount of land the Land Commission sold or bequeathed is very small.  I know what I am talking about because I have been an auctioneer for many years and I deal mainly with the land market.  I know that a lot of land could and would be sold if the Department were anxious to purchase it.  I should like to ask the Minister to see to it that we purchase more of this land.  Do the Department think there is a good future market for timber?  If so, we should put a real effort into the reafforestation of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of my contribution will be somewhat parochial.  It relates to nurseries. <Col N="1467" /> They were not referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum.  This is the only opportunity I can find to bring this problem before the House.  I come from Ballinalee and a forest nursery was opened in that townland in 1950, consisting of a 20-acre estate.  This gave great hope to an area which had no employment and high emigration.  This nursery was extended 20 years ago to become one of the biggest producers of trees in the country.  Employment rose to 50 in those years, which was a big curb on rampant emigration.  Millions of the best forest trees were produced yearly for planting on new forest sites of the midlands and the west, thus giving promise of timber for our needs in the future.</P>
    <P>This nursery, though still in production, is scheduled for closure and 23 jobs, which depend on it, are threatened. I understand that the decision to close the nursery is based on the idea of centralised large scale production of forest trees. Nursery work is very intensive, from the stage where the seed is sown right up to the movement of the young trees to the planting sites.  I understand that production at the Ballinalee nursery at present is around two million trees annually. This nursery must be the most ideally located of all the State forest nurseries, being almost in the centre of the country.</P>
    <P>The new policy, from what I can see, means longer transport of plants from one end of the country to the other.  The Ballinalee nursery was very central for the despatch of young trees, both for care and for economic transport.  Long distance haulage of young trees means large quantities are delivered in bulk. This is to the detriment of young trees, which are a perishible product and have no tolerance for heavy loading or stacking. The result is, at worst, dead transplants or, at best, a half-dead plant from heating.  This gives rise to poor or no plantations at all to look forward to.</P>
    <P>My knowledge is based on personal experience of tree production at Ballinalee. In my younger days, when I was <Col N="1468" /> physically fitter, I was an agricultural contractor. I used to do much of the ploughing, rotavating, cultivating and haulage for this nursery.  I took trees through most of the west of Ireland and through most of the south-east.  The tree production of Ballinalee was of top quality.  Driving around the midlands and the west one gets full and final proof of that.  If the present policy of closing this nursery is implemented I wonder what the forestry horizons of those areas will be like in the future.  The forestry staff in this area are all very concerned at this ruthless decision, coming at a time when jobs are very scarce and when job prospects in this area are nil.</P>
    <P>The Ballinalee Forest is over 2,000 acres and will contain only a fraction of this staff.  The staff employed are all men in their late twenties and early thirties, with young families dependent on them and with no alternative employment to fall back on in the event of losing those jobs, in which they have developed particular rural skills.  The likely loss of a weekly wage bill of approximately £2,500 in a country village and surrounding areas is a sickening blow to the morale of the local people who are saddened by the daily sight of overcrowded super-buses taking our young people away to English cities and towns in search of employment.</P>
    <P>In no way can an alternative forest operation be substituted to replace the workload of the production of forestry trees within the locality.  If the argument be advanced that the decision to close this nursery was based on the quality of the land, it should be known that other areas of land in the locality were offered as being available; but there was no record of those offers being investigated or followed up.  I did say I was in the land business.  This last number of years we all believed that this nursery would run out at some future stage, but we did not think it would go so prematurely.  I have been offering land to the Department over a long number of years, but without any co-operation from the Department.  I still believe that there might be some land <Col N="1469" />&mdash; not immediately convenient to this nursery but in the catchment area about a half of mile from it &mdash; which would be suitable land.  That is why I would like to ask the Minister to hold back on the closure of this nursery for some time in order to investigate the situation.</P>
    <P>Ballinalee is situated in the most severely handicapped part of rural Ireland and is classified as a severely handicapped area.  I think we should look at it in a sympathetic, human and Christian fashion and see to it that those people will not be deprived of their livelihoods. Our locality seems to be the subject of much neglect, as there is no drive at all to buy land for planting either.  There is located in Longford one of the biggest and most progressive sawmills &mdash; indeed, the Minister visited it some weeks ago. That sawmill, situated in the centre of Longford, is celebrating its 75th anniversary soon &mdash; I think it may even be tomorrow.  I had an invitation to it but I cannot attend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We all need to be guided by somebody.  In view of the fact that this sawmill is located in Longford, this type of planning makes poor economic sense. Not alone does it eliminate the production of young trees in our area, but it also does little to ensure the production of sawdust as well.  A few years ago I remember lorry loads of forestry trees leaving Ballinalee for Scotland and Northern Ireland.  What shift in policy has occurred, so that now the trend is to create jobs abroad by importing planting stock from cross-channel and the Continent while at the same time planning to close down forest nurseries at home?  I understand that the policy is to close many of the forest nurseries in favour of large scale production by a few nurseries on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the claims put forward for increases in afforestation is the stabilisation of local rural communities. Since most of the afforestation at present and in the foreseeable future is targeted <Col N="1470" /> towards the midlands and west of the country, it is inappropriate that this nursery, which is ideally situated for the targeted planting areas, is to be closed down.  Indeed, it is ironic that in fact forestry jobs are to be lost in the very area where they should be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity, too, of welcoming this Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to grant power to the Minister to set up a new State-sponsored company to operate forestry on a commercial basis, and that is to be welcomed as a step in the right direction.  It is a Bill which has been promoted for more than five or six years and has now finally come to fruition.  The Bill apparently gives an endorsement to the Forestry Review Group report.</P>
      <P>I would like to pose a few questions to the Minister concerning aspects of the Bill that I am not clear on, or to ask the Minister could those matters be catered for.  I would like to ask the Minister how the new body, Coillte Teoranta, is to be staffed.  Will the embargo on public sector recruitment have any effect on the staffing of it, or are staffs to be transferred from other areas to staff this new body, or how will the recruitment take place to staff this new body?  Is there any provision to be made in the Bill whereby this new body will have to report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the work it is carrying out, or is there a set time? I believe that this body should have to report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should monitor the performance of this new body.  If they do not report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to whom will they be reporting?  Are there any targets set down through this new body for areas to be planted in any one given year?  Will forestry grants come under this new body or will they be still dealt with otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely our aim should be to eliminate or rather probably to drastically reduce the importation of Canadian and Scandinavian timber.  If we wish to compete with imported timber we will have to take steps to improve the quality of our native <Col N="1471" /> timber.  We should encourage and promote by IDA assistance proper drying facilities in our sawmills because if we do not get the finished timber dried to the correct standard, then we will not be able to compete with imported timber.</P>
    <P>Should we have our own pulpwood mill?  Perhaps there is not enough timber in the country for that, but if the rate of planting increases there should be enough within a few years to service that.</P>
    <P>The potential for the development of our forestry is enormous in Ireland.  As my colleague, Senator Doherty, has said, land is now coming on the market at rates at which it would be very economical to plant it.  I know tracts of land in Connemara that are coming on the market at £200 and £300 an acre.  A few years ago, in the early years of our EC entry, this land would be bought up for its potential as land suitable for reclamation or to turn into agricultural use.  This is marginal type land.  Now that land is of immense value for afforestation.</P>
    <P>We have the natural climate for growing timber.  We have the suitable soil types.  Yet the percentage of land in Ireland under forestry is very small in comparison to other EC countries.  I understand that only about 6 per cent of the land in Ireland is under afforestation. This compares with 9 per cent in Britain, 27 per cent in France, 29 per cent in Germany and with an EC average of 21 per cent.  All of this is at a time in our agricultural history, in regard to the EC, when we are being put under quotas, when we are being restricted in the amount we can produce in almost everything. We have beef quotas, milk quotas, grain quotas, milk lakes, beef mountains. There is a quota or a restriction on the production of practically everything except sheep.</P>
    <P>I believe now that we are at a stage where we have the natural climate for the production of timber and we should be gearing ourselves to bringing marginal land into afforestation rather than bringing marginal land into agricultural production. The cost of reclamation now does not justify the expenditure on that <Col N="1472" /> type of farming.  With restrictions on the amount we are allowed to produce agriculturally, it does not make economic sense at all to be now reclaiming land for agricultural purposes.  It is alien for me, as a person involved in the agri-industry, to have to say that; but that is the situation and the reality that we must face up to.  There was a mad rush for reclaiming land in the early and mid-seventies after entry to the EC, when it appeared that we had unlimited markets for our agricultural produce.  That is no longer the case today.  In fact, it would not pay a farmer to be spending £500, £600 or £700 an acre on reclaiming land, bringing marginal land into agricultural production. Because of the overall economic situation, both nationally and <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EC, it does not pay to be doing that now.</P>
    <P>We must bring about the situation whereby, through the incentives and generous grants which are available, this type of marginal land would be brought into afforestation production.  Our climate and our soil types can produce conifers &mdash; Sitka Spruce and so on &mdash; within perhaps ten to 15 years.  I see a difficulty in that for a small farmer who invests &mdash; and it is a very good investment, but it is more an investment for his children than for himself.  If the system could be more fully developed, whereby that small type farmer using marginal land going into afforestation could recoup more of his money each year rather than having to wait 15 years for his first pay-back, we would have a lot more planting of this marginal type land, which is now being more or less left idle, due to the price of small stock, the price of calves, the price of manure &mdash; the price of everything now. It does not make economic sense to bring that type of marginal land into half or full agricultural production, because the income is not there for that now and the cost of doing that is too high in relation to the income to be got from that type of thing.  Perhaps we could devise a system whereby grants could be linked &mdash; I know there are moves in that direction &mdash; and <Col N="1473" /> farmers could obtain an income annually from the year after they went into afforestation production, provided of course that the job was done right.</P>
    <P>Those are the questions I would pose the Minister.  I believe that if we take steps in that direction we would, over a year or two, greatly increase the amount of acreage under afforestation in Ireland. We would come more in line from the 6 per cent we are at now.  We would come more in line with the percentage in the other EC countries of over 20 per cent. That would be of long-term benefit both to the State and to the people directly involved in that.</P>
    <P>We do not now what the future holds in agriculture.  I do not like to be pessimistic about this, but a policy is now apparently developing in the EC, or thoughts in that direction are now apparently developing &mdash; more than thoughts; it is actually on paper &mdash; whereby farmers will be actually paid to get out of farming and paid to leave their land idle.  That is alien to the make-up of the Irish farmer and to generations of Irish farmers who had a belief in and a desire for farming.  It is entirely alien to the family farm in Ireland that land should be left idle, even marginal land.  Perhaps we should be looking more at better incentives &mdash; I know there are very good incentives there, but there are some obstacles in them &mdash; better incentives to bring more of the marginal land in Ireland under afforestation.  I think that would pay us better in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very subjective judgment, but you are entitled to it.  As a result I tend to look at it a little bit more critically than perhaps a Bill about which there was some controversy.  This <Col N="1474" /> Bill is one that comes into that category. Once you come across a Bill like this which appears to have such tremendous support from all sides of the House, I feel it must be taking away from somewhere or doing someone some damage or contradicting some philosophy which is already being championed.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill very carefully and listened to the Minister's speech very carefully and I think my suspicions are reasonably well grounded.  While I welcome the objective of the Bill and, as I understand it &mdash; and the Minister will be able to correct me &mdash; the objective of the Bill is to make the forestry service or the operation of forestry and timber in this country more efficient and more commercial. I am not sure that the Bill is going to achieve that in itself.  I note that the Minister said in his speech to the Dáil that this was fulfilling an election promise.  To me that appears to be a bad reason for actually bringing anything to this House.  Thank God, the Government have not used that as a criteria for most of its legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Election promises on the whole, thankfully, have not all been kept. The idea is obviously to put a new semi-State body on a commercial basis.  There you have got what is almost an inherent contradiction.  I think this is the real problem with this Bill, because when you are setting up a semi-State body you cannot really run it on a commercial basis by virtue of it being semi-State.  I think that the problem with this Bill is that the philosophy behind the Bill too often conflicts with the facts that are actually in the small print.  I understand what the Government are aiming at, which is really that the forests of Ireland should be run on a commercial basis.  But when you read the Bill, and when you even read the Minister's speech, you realise that they realise that what they are trying to do is actually impossible and that they are not going to be able to do it; but they <Col N="1475" /> are going to make the best possible effort at it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think it is a contradiction, and I would like to explain to the House why.  I find there is a certain amount of confused thinking about this sort of Bill.  The Minister's speech was full of extremely interesting and very plausible euphemisms.  Having said that he had the laudible objective of making money, he then said that the new company will make a loss.  He said that the new company will make a loss for a considerable amount of time, but he does not know for how long.  To me this is not running anything on a commercial basis. To me that is the opposite of running something on a commercial basis.  It is humbug to say we are going to run this on a commercial basis.  We are going to set up a company on a commercial basis, but it is not going to make any money. That seems to be defeating the objective of the Bill.  The Minister will undoubtedly be able to reconcile those two facts in his summing up speech, but I think it is very important that this be done as soon as possible by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would have suggested to the Minister that instead of introducing this Bill in the way he has, instead of introducing the clauses and the fundings requirements and the funding from the national Exchequer which he is providing, there are other ways of doing it.  The Minister has said that £100 million could be provided in shares and advances from the State and £80 million in guaranteed borrowings. To me, by any standards that is an awful lot of money to put into a company which you are going to call commercial but which is not going to make any money.  It seems to me that this is a very heavy subsidy with absolutely no great prospect of return in the near future.  I know that we say it is a long term investment.  I know that the Government's view is that there will be a break even point; but we are very short on projections on this.  I am not at all convinced that this is going to work, for reasons which I will outline in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle form of funding private <Col N="1476" /> forestry appears to be the EC.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for the obvious initiatives he has taken in getting EC funding.  I know it is very difficult to get that sort of slice of the cake and to squeeze more money out of the EC for this sort of development.  But, as the forestry development here is so behind and since such a small percentage of our country is actually afforested, I see the reasons why he has been able to get EC funding. But what I would have thought would have been far more sensible and far more constructive was to follow up a suggestion which my colleague, Senator O'Toole, made yesterday, and to look elsewhere for funding.  I do not believe the State needs to be burdened necessarily with this sort of funding.  I do not believe it is essential that the State pays for all the development of the forests of this country.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is, as Senator O'Toole said yesterday, that there are billions of pounds in pension funds in this country looking for a home.  There are billions of pounds in insurance companies. There are plenty of rich investors whose money is run by merchant banks. If this is a reasonable investment &mdash; short or long term, it does not matter &mdash; that money will find its way there.  What I do not understand is why the Minister instead of burdening the State with this dubious investment, as it is, if he believes it is a really good investment, does not either privatise the forests now or sell them to private interests or allow a market to develop in future afforestation. Because, if these forests have a future value &mdash; which undoubtedly they have, I can tell the Minister, and the Minister knows this full well &mdash; then because of the way the markets work it means that they have a present value.  There will be all sorts of pension funds, private investors, insurance companies, banks who will be prepared to put money into this sort of investment if it makes any sort of sense.</P>
    <P>Those who manage money of this sort have got funds for exactly this kind of purpose.  That is why I think it is wrong for the Minister to burden the State with <Col N="1477" /> it.  I would like the Minister to say in his reply that this is too long term or that it is too doubtful or too difficult or too risky; or maybe he will say it is too good an investment and we should not give it to anybody, that we should keep it in the State.  Perhaps emotionally and philosophically he believes that this land, this afforestation, should belong to the State and should not be sold off.  I do not know. All I am saying is that there is money available, and plenty of it, for this type of investment if the Minister wants to consider that alternative.  At a time when the public finances are in such a terrible state I think it would have been more appropriate to look to private industry to subsidise &mdash; if subsidise it is &mdash; what the Minister has openly admitted will be a loss in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>It was a bit depressing to read in the Minister's speech some of the phrases which give us the background to the thinking behind this particular Bill.  When he says in that negative way that funding has not been ungenerous, I agree with him.  What he means, of course, by that code word is that it has been a very generous piece of funding, and perhaps he means &mdash; and I would suggest he means &mdash; that it would not stand up to the normal commercial criteria which should be applied to this sort of investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right: it is not ungenerous. He goes on to say that further support will be necessary after five years. That is exactly the sort of situation which I would be fearful of, the sort of blank cheques type situation which might exist and has existed in other similar type bodies.  Having stated funding was not particularly ungenerous, it is a pity to see a bland declaration that in some time in the near future the Minister may have to write another cheque without quantifying how much it would be, without projecting how much it would be; but making it absolutely obvious to the company and to whoever is running the company that further support will be there if it is needed.  That is about the worst possible basis for any company to be run on.  It certainly does not answer or meet any of the normal commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> Having said that, the Minister goes on to say that the company must stand on its own two feet.  I again find it difficult to reconcile the fact that the company is going to be drawing heavily on the Exchequer for at least five years and the statement that it will be standing on its own two feet.  This Bill has a laudable objective but there is some very confused thinking behind it because it cannot be an independent company; it will not be run as an independent company.  They will not think of themselves as an independent company so long as they have the Exchequer backing them in this very generous way.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister had to say about the Civil Service.  Perhaps he could explain what he means when he is summing up.  It is indicative of a shift in Government thinking and in thinking in this country about the Civil Service and their relationship with the private sector and the commercial world. He says that the Civil Service are not conducive to commercial criteria which I presume means that the Civil Service are incapable of running a company on the basis of making profit, or that the Civil Service are not a commercially efficient organisation.  That is something with which on the whole I would agree.  It would be interesting to note if this is now the Government's view of the Civil Service.  Do the Civil Service need a shake-up?  Are the Civil Service not to be entrusted with running a commercial company like this?  Are the Civil Service incapable of taking decisions like that?  If that is true, what are the Civil Service for?  Are the Civil Service there not to take any initiatives?  Are they there simply to implement without thought the wishes and the whims of the Government without taking any decision on their own bat?  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  The Minister said also that the traditional restraints which apply to the Civil Service would be an obstruction to the company.  What are those traditional restraints?  We are on the point of unveiling some very new thinking about the Civil Service.  To back that up I will quote from the Minister's speech where he was referring to the new forestry company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> In the first place a commitment to commerciality must permeate all parts of its organisation.  In the past, the development of forestry in this country was not always guided by strict commercial considerations and as I have already said, a Civil Service structure is not the most conducive one for commercial operation.  All that must now change.  Freed from the constraints of the Civil Service, the company will have the necessary flexibility and freedom to conduct its business in a commercial way like any other private sector company.  It will have no excuse to do otherwise and no excuses will be accepted.</P>
    <P>It cannot be run like any other private sector company because they are going to be Government funded for at least five years.  I find an inherent contradiction in there.  Then the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Secondly, the company must operate in a cost effective and efficient manner.  I mentioned earlier that the current development of our forest estate has a major influence on the break even date and that, because our trees are at a certain stage of growth, it will still take some time before profitability is reached.</P>
    <P>What we need to know is vaguely when? &ldquo;Some time&rdquo; is not good enough if one is running a company on commercial criteria. Is it five years, ten years, 15 years, 20 years or is it three years?  It seems impossible that it will be in the next five years because the Government are obviously going to keep funding them.  We have no specific projections.  We have no specific ideas.  We are being asked to write a blank cheque without any promises. He then went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is not much the company can do about that&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have rarely read as vague a phrase in any speech</P>
    <P>&mdash;but it can certainly do a lot in terms <Col N="1480" /> of reducing its operating costs.  I expect it to do so and thus achieve a much earlier break even date than would have been the case if forestry had continued to be operated within a Civil Service structure.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly damning indictment of the Civil Service structure.  It is totally unspecific in projections, in profit targets, or in any sort of future targets for this company.</P>
    <P>If the Government are going to be giving this sort of money to this company, we certainly deserve to hear detailed projections. The Minister has said this will be run as a private sector company.  If a private sector company were going to a bank, which in effect is what is happening here, to borrow money or to inject share capital and they said: &ldquo;It will be some time before we are profitable, but we do not know when, and we will try to reduce our operating costs but we do not know how long that will take.  We also think that in five years we will be coming back for more money, but we have no projections&rdquo;, the bank would just show them the door.  This is very short on detail but very big on handing out money.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on with some generalised suggestions for improvements. Again these are short on detail. He made comments about the introduction of new arrangements which will reduce the outgoing on purchase and increase income per unit of sales and used the sort of phrases which could apply to any industry.  The point I am trying to make here is very simple.  If there is a transfer or if there is going to be a change in method, there is no sign of it here.  If there is going to be massive Government funding we are entitled to ask for answers before it is granted.  There may be a very good reason for this, but if the investment is as good as the Minister says, the funds should be there but the details should be there as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister finally summed up by saying:</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this is just another &ldquo;SSB&rdquo;.  I expect far more than <Col N="1481" /> that and if I do not get it I will give the board a very hard time.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister say he will give the board a hard time.  The Minister's phrase &ldquo;just another SSB&rdquo; is an extraordinary reflection on the semi-State bodies.  It is reflection with which I would agree.  I think the justification for semi-State bodies is very doubtful. Senator Ryan, undoubtedly, will have something to say about that.  I would like the Minister to say in what way it is going to be different from the other semi-State bodies.  Secondly, what is wrong with the other semi-State bodies?  I will tell him if he likes, but it will take too long.  I would like to hear it from him, because he has put it down here himself.  Thirdly what does the Minister mean by giving these chaps a hard time?  Does it mean that he is going to phone them up every morning and say: &ldquo;Listen, you are not making enough money, you are not doing very well.&rdquo;  Does it mean he is going to sack them?  Does it mean he is going to harass them at home?</P>
    <P>These are all very brave words but the Minister will make the appointments.  He will have to answer for them.  To put down blandly that he is going to give them a hard time is not good enough.  He must have real sanctions.  He must set them real targets to which they must keep.  If he likes he can give them incentives rather than threaten them.  Perhaps he should give them incentives, options, or all sorts of different incentives to meet targets.  To say simply they are going to have a tough time if they turn out to be like all these bodies run by this State is not good enough.  I suggest that the answer to this is that the State should have a very close look at all the other semi-State bodies that the Minister is talking about. He has, by implication, in fact, indicted them in what he says.  I am delighted to hear it.  I would like to hear specifically what he intends to do rather than just giving them a very hard time.  This speech, as all speeches which receive the approval of all parties, is very heavy on rhetoric but is very light on detail.</P>
    <P>I do not want to anticipate the speech <Col N="1482" /> of my colleague, Senator Ryan, but I suspect that ideologically he believes that the forests of this country belong to the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be recognised that this is a very emotive issue and a possible ideological fact and, indeed, it is something that has been applied to the oil and gas industry as well.  We have to decide whether this is a resource which should be privatised.  Should the private sector or the public sector be allowed into the field?  This halfway house which the Minister seems to be trying to achieve in this Bill is totally unsatisfactory.  This sort of compromise is going to give us the worst of all worlds and what we are going to have is a so-called commercial body which is floundering around but is, in effect, being run by the State, by the Minister and by the executive for the State.</P>
      <P>I would like to support that by pointing to the provisions in sections 14 and 44 of the Bill.  Section 14 says that acquisition and sale of land and sale of timber shall not be carried out without the permission of the Minister:</P>
      <P>The company shall submit to and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale and acquisition of land and the sale of timber, whether standing or felled.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be clearer than that &mdash; and some of these Bills are very clear. However, it is impossible to reconcile that with the statement that the company is being given autonomy.  To me it means quite simply that the most important decisions the company have to make are only going to be made if the Minister approves them and they are not going to be made if the Minister does not approve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To maintain that the Bill, in itself, is giving autonomy to the company is completely fatuous and wrong.  It is contradicted by section 14 of this Bill, which quite simply says that the company can do very little except what the Minister and <Col N="1483" /> the Government approve.  In effect, while it is being called a private commercial company, it is still being State funded and State run.  The running of this company and the old system of running the State's forests will not be that much different; and, indeed, I believe that many of the staff from the old forestry service will be transferred to the new company.  I am sure they have done a tremendous job, as the Minister quite rightly said.  It looks to me as if really very little is changing. There may be a bit more streamlining. The direction from which the orders come may be different, different people may be taking orders, but we are going to have the same personnel, the same people holding the strings and we are going to have the same people making the decisions.  There is going to be a board, but they cannot really take any decisions without the Minister approving them.</P>
    <P>Section 44 is a similar type clause. Section 44 (1) says:</P>
    <P>The company shall prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on resignation, retirement or death to or in respect of such members of the staff of the company as it may think fit.</P>
    <P>It is a very long section which goes on to elaborate on that particular subject.  It gives very strict and detailed powers in this area to the Minister for Finance.  This is absolutely impossible to reconcile with the supposed and the proclaimed belief and statement of the Minister that this is a commercial company being run like any other private sector company.  Quite simply it is not, and it is very wrong that we should maintain that it will be.  It is going to continue to make losses which no private sector company would do.  It has not produced projections, without which no private sector company could be funded, and it is going to be dependent on the Government, which no private sector company is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 38 is a similar type section, where it goes on to talk about general ministerial powers.  I do not want to labour this point, but it is very important that it gets through: &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance...&rdquo;  Now, we have got two Ministers having ministerial powers in this Bill.  We have got two streams of Government power.  The company have to seek permission from the Minister for one thing, who then has to seek permission from the Minister for Finance for another thing &mdash; and this in a company which is commercially run like a private sector company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section goes on to say that the Minister may issue directions in writing to the company requiring the company, ordering the company, to do certain things: section 38(1)(a) says &ldquo;... to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Government concerning the development of forestry and related activities of which he may advise <Col N="1485" /> the company from time to time&rdquo;.  How can that be reconciled with saying that this is an autonomous company run for commercial reasons?  It is simply saying one thing, and one thing alone, that the company have to do what the Government tell them if it is in keeping with the general Government policy as regards forestry.  That means that the idea of they being a private sector or an independent company goes out the window.  It is better that this is actually spelt out in full.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a real problem in other areas as well.  The requirement on the company to use the Office of Public Works in certain areas restricts them. There is a real danger in giving the Government quite so much power in the company's internal affairs.  The very fears which were expressed by this Government while in Opposition about the National Development Corporation have not materialised, but still could materialise. I am not worried about that because it is past history, but it is important to bring it out.  Those fears also should apply to this particular company.  I am afraid they do apply.  Those fears are that preferential treatment could be given to certain areas if the Government or any Government in the future have so much power in the direction of these natural resources.  I am not suggesting at all &mdash; I have said this on various issues before &mdash; that this applies to the present Government or any particular Minister involved. I am just saying that I find it a very difficult precedent and a wrong principle that the NDC should have funds available, which, if an unscrupulous Government or Minister took part or decided to, they could use for their own electoral purposes.  I know it is very difficult to avoid this.  It is part of the political game and it happens in other areas.  But there is a danger here that political interference could decide where roads are built through forests, where afforestation takes place, and the preference could be given to certain constituencies and certain areas because of ministerial power within this company.  I do not make this as a political point against the Government, and I wish to emphasise <Col N="1486" /> that.  I just wish to say quite simply that the less power and discretion that Ministers and members of Government have over this sort of development, the better. I would just like to see less and less of that particular power with the Government because while it may not be abused, it is certainly open to abuse and it is certainly open to temptation at some time in the future.  I have another very real fear about this Bill.  Because of the lack of projections &mdash; and because of the apparently very vague future in terms of profitability for this company, it may of necessity be vague &mdash; and the complete absence of any suggestion of what the return on the capital employed will be what the assets are worth &mdash; we can make guesses &mdash; but we cannot make any accurate guesses because of the lack of year by year projections &mdash; it seems to me that we may be going down a road, out of which it will be very difficult to get.  It is as though there is no exit from this road we are going down.  I am reminded &mdash; and I should remind the House &mdash; of the history of B &amp; I which has many similarities to this company.  The Minister may correct me because my facts may be wrong on this because I have forgotten some of them &mdash; but B &amp; I was making losses for 12 years.</P>
    <P>Government after Government, year after year, pumped millions and millions of pounds into B &amp; I.  The Government were really in a situation where they could not pull the plug on B &amp; I and they just had to pour more and more money into a loss-making company.  I think hundreds of millions of pounds were lost on B &amp; I by successive Governments.  It was not just this Government, but the last Government and the Government before that, which continued to meet the losses over 12 years without a remedy emerging, without too much pressure coming from successive Governments. However, cheque after cheque after cheque came from the Governments, small ones, large ones, whatever was required.</P>
    <P>There were requirements made on B &amp; I by successive Governments to put their house in order.  Those requirements <Col N="1487" /> were not actually complied with by B &amp; I in that they seemed to be incapable of doing that within the terms agreed.  They declared successive losses but the Government having poured so much money into B &amp; I, had to pour more money into B &amp; I to keep it afloat every year or every six months.  I am not saying there is a direct parallel here, but I am saying that without projections and in such a long-term investment as this, there is a danger that this will become a continuous and constant drain upon the public purse.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision or any recognition by the Minister or by the Government that the investment in forestry might turn out to be a bad investment, that the money put into foresty might turn out be be wasted money.  It may be unthinkable but it is a thought we should consider.  There is a possibility that we might be going down the same type road as we have been down before.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether there are any limits as to how much money the Government will put into forestry and where those limits lie.  After five years &mdash; as he has made quite clear &mdash; when he has put more money into forestry, will he say there is only so much more to go after this or whether it is an open ended cheque?  Is the commitment now so great that the company that is being set up is in fact cracking the whip because the Government cannot afford to pull back from the road which they appear to be going down?</P>
    <P>I would just like to get an assurance from the Minister that there will not be continuous dependence by this company on the Government for ever, that the Government have plans at some stage to say, &ldquo;Thus far thou shalt go and no further&rdquo;, and if the company are looking for more money and still making losses they will simply not get it.  Otherwise it is only human nature for whoever is running the company, as B &amp; I did, to say, &ldquo;We are not making money.  We have not met our objectives but there is always the Government behind us and we know they cannot let us down&rdquo;.  I <Col N="1488" /> know, and the Minister probably knows, that forestry is probably too big an investment now to be actually let down, but I would just like to see how much he is prepared to put in before he sees a return on this investment.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to what the Minister said about the new company not being just another &ldquo;SSB&rdquo;.  That is not a phrase I want to hang around his neck but it is a phrase which I think should be elaborated on, especially in regard to the appointments to the board and the chief executive.  The chief executive, as Senator O'Toole said yesterday, will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 35 states:</P>
    <P>The first Chief Executive of the company, having been selected by means of a public competition, shall be appointed by the Minister for a period not exceeding three years and may be removed from office by the Minister during that period.</P>
    <P>That is a very worrying, very difficult and a very wrong clause.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, and the week before, there is a danger of this just being another example of jobs for the boys.  I am not saying &mdash; and I do not want the Minister to take it personally or sensitively &mdash; that it will necessarily apply in this particular case, but the Government are continually giving hostages to fortune on this issue.</P>
    <P>On the Broadcasting Bill, a very similar Bill which we had last week &mdash; we had a very similar section in the Bill appointing the chief executive.  The small print in that Bill is similar to this one.  It gave the Minister total power over the appointment of the board, the chief executive and the auditor.  If that is the case and if that continues to be the case, it means that the new so-called private independent forestry company is being directed directly by the Government.  I do not believe that is the way this sort of company should be run.  It would be far more sensible if we were more honest about it and left the company in the hands of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This clause which gives the Minister <Col N="1489" /> power not only to appoint the chief executive, but to decide his salary, allows the Minister far too much power in this area.  I would have thought it would be far more sensible to make his salary and his remuneration statutory, if it has to be, or to leave it up to the board, or to fix it in a far less dictatorial way and also to decide the remuneration of the board in a completely different way.</P>
    <P>If the chief executive is to be dependent on the Government for his job, which he will be, he will have to, as in the Broadcasting Bill, implement Government policy.  That is something which I fear more than anything else in this Bill because I believe this is going to become just another semi-State body. The seeds of it are spelt out in this Bill &mdash; the structure of the board, the chairman, the directors, the way it is run, everything like that is so similar to other semi-State bodies that I have very little confidence that this particular board and company will have any more independence than the other semi-State body.  Yet it will have the dependence for funding on the Government that the other semi-State companies have.  That is going to be very difficult.  I would like the Minister to say, not just in an abstract way how it will differ not just about how he will operate it.</P>

I have arranged for a list of the proposed groupings of the amendments for the debate to be circulated for the information of Senators.</P>
      <P>Section I agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I had hoped that at this stage we would have had a few significant Government amendments to this Bill.  We did not have them and that is a matter of considerable regret to me.  The Bill deals with a number of extremely serious issues. Because it deals with serious issues I believe that regulations arising from this Bill ought to be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a regrettable fact that statutory instruments which do not require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that is, those that automatically come into force unless they are nullified, are rarely debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  The phrase &ldquo;rubber stamp&rdquo; that is used offensively to describe this House could be used quite appropriately to describe both Houses of the Oireachtas when it comes to a large number of statutory instruments.  I refer to those which do not need to be discussed or voted upon before they are approved of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable regret to me that on a number of occasions recently attempts in this House to have debates on regulations failed because the Government are unwilling to make time available and it is left to the Members to <Col N="1491" /> use Private Members' Time if they wish to do so.  I find that a matter of regret.  If we had a precedent or a general procedure that where a debate on regulations was requested it could take place, it would not be necessary for me to introduce an amendment such as this.  Without going into too great detail on the subject matter of section 10, for instance, it makes provision for regulations under this section which may in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) and (4), make provision for a large number of things &mdash; the manner in which the housing authorities exercise their powers, the amount and conditions of recoupments under subsection (4), notification of a decision on a request for accommodation, furnishing of information and such other incidental consequential, or supplementary provisions... That is by way of an example. There are a number of other provisions.</P>
    <P>I think those sort of matters are sufficiently serious, sufficiently important and potentially so far-reaching in their effects on some very vulnerable people that the Minister ought to seek, and ought to hear, the views of Members of the Oireachtas on these issues.  The only way that it is possible to guarantee the interest of the Oireachtas and discussion in the Oireachtas under the regulations is to require that those regulations must be approved before they are passed.</P>
    <P>We had this morning a particular example of the problems with such regulations: even when they can be discussed and even when they are quite obviously ludicrous that will not necessarily guarantee that they will not be passed.  In this case we have regulations that in terms of ordinary human beings and their conditions are far more far-reaching and far more serious in their implications; and yet, effectively, whatever the Members of the Oireachtas may think, unless they be in the majority in this House, the regulations may not be debated unless they are debated in Private Members' Time.  That is a strange way to deal with <Col N="1492" /> regulations that are essentially Government regulations.  The only way regulations which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Government can be debated is in Private Members' Time, if this amendment is not accepted.</P>
    <P>I simply suggest to the Minister that, in order to ensure the widest possible knowledge of regulations made under this Bill, in order to ensure the widest possible input into those regulations and in order to ensure that the expertise available to the Minister extends as widely as possible, these regulations should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and not made until a resolution approving of the draft is passed by each House.</P>

      <P>Every regulation under this Act will, in accordance with section 5 (2) of the Housing Act, 1966, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It may be annulled by a resolution of the House if either House passes it within 21 sitting days.  This procedure has applied to all regulations made under the housing code since 1966.  I do not accept that it is now necessary to provide that housing regulations be first laid before each House in draft form and await formal approval.  To do so would be wasteful of time and cause unnecessary delays.  We spend a lot of our time in this House and in the other House discussing ways whereby we can speed up methods of Government and improve the whole administration of Government and legislation generally. What the Senator is suggesting now would be a retrograde step, would inevitably lead to intolerable delays and might very well lead to the kind of delays which would be counter-productive and certainly run counter to what the Deputy is seeking to achieve by the very fact of this legislation being put in place in the first instance.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Government and the running of the country is not a matter for the Government alone: it is a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.  In the best of worlds it would be a matter <Col N="1493" /> for the Government to propose and for the Oireachtas to dispose.  In theory at least, the Government are answerable to the Oireachtas, in particular to Dáil Éireann.  I appreciate the constitutional difference between Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann, apart from other more practical differences.  It is not an argument to say that, because time is wasted on so many things, other matters should not be discussed.  It might be an argument that too much time is spent discussing the wrong things and not enough time spent discussing other things.  There is a body of opinion in this country which would hold that far too much that affects the lives of people goes through the Oireachtas by way of statutory instruments, on the nod, without any proper discussion.  There is a body of opinion that this is true of a considerable body of the EC related legislation which goes through without adequate and detailed discussion.  I really would have hoped that the Minister would have had a better argument to present to us here than that we have done it like this up to now and that is why we want to keep on doing it.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a good case in a climate of political opinion which has changed as much as it has in so many areas in the last few years for addressing any proposal on its merits, not on the basis of precedent, not on the basis of what we did last year or what we did for the last 20 years, but on the basis of whether it would be a good idea or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government orders the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this House it is subject to the approval of the House; I understand in the other House the Government decide the Order of Business.  If they do, they can decide when a particular set of regulations will be discussed.  Indeed, in the other House, I think they can decide how much time will be devoted to the discussion and they do that from time to time.  The suggestion that to insist that regulations such as those that will be made under this Bill would be discussed and voted upon in the Houses of the Oireachtas is not in any way a guarantee that there will be delay. Quite simply, if some of these regulations <Col N="1494" /> come up and I, say, or a Member of the independent group does not like them, then we can ensure that they will have to be debated and we can ensure that they will be discussed.  Requiring them to be debated is not a guarantee of delay; it is simply a guarantee of proper parliamentary accountability in an area which many people think needs to be dealt with with considerably greater imagination than perhaps is contained in this Bill as it stands.  It would, therefore, be an opportunity for the Oireachtas to assess in greater detail what precisely is proposed to be done about some of the more controversial areas of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that a Minister with the intellect of the present Minister would resort simply to the old argument that &ldquo;this is the way it was always done and that is the way I want to do it now&rdquo;.  I find that a less than satisfactory argument and I would have hoped he would have a good reason for doing so.  It is a pity that we are being simply told that is the way it was and that is the way it has to be.  I think regulations like this, in an area which is of considerable public concern, as the Minister is aware, in which a large number of people and organisations in society have concerns about different aspects of this Bill, should be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny before they are passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misses the point entirely.  This matter was pursued by some Deputies in the Dáil and after listening to my short explanation they unanimously agreed that what I was doing was the correct thing.  We may be all out of step except the good Senator; be that as it may, what I am saying to the Senator is that regulations under this Bill when enacted will not and cannot go through on the nod unless people like himself and others are asleep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations will be laid before Dáil Éireann and if any Dáil Member or Senator wishes to challenge those regulations then, of course, they can do so and if they get enough Members to support them they can annul them within the 21 sitting days.  What we are talking about <Col N="1495" /> in this amendment are not regulations; we are talking about draft regulations.  Is the Senator seriously suggesting that the <i>modus operandi</i> from now on in this matter should be that drafts of what we propose we might do at some later stage should be put before Dáil Éireann, have a long discussion on it, listen to counter arguments and then finally end with a regulation which again could be challenged under the law, if somebody chooses to do so within 21 days?  If that is not a recipe for delay, I do not know what is, and I regret that the Senator should pursue this matter in this way, because in effect what I am trying to achieve is that we get on with the job which is proposed to be done under this legislation.  What the Senator now suggests as the very first amendment is that we introduce a delaying technique into the whole business.  I cannot accept that.</P>

      <P>I rise to defend, first of all, the concept of Senator Ryan and I want to warn the Minister &mdash; if warn is the correct word to use for a Minister &mdash; that what happens in the other House or fails to happen because of the restriction on time does not necessarily mean that it has to follow through here because this House has a mind of its own.  According to the Constitution we have the facility to try to improve legislation, if possible, and we do not want to be preached at by anybody as regards what did or did not happen in the other House.  I know what happened in the other House in regard to this Bill was that there was relatively little time to discuss some of the amendments that certainly the Labour Party were interested in having put down to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent the best part of this morning discussing regulations that were made under another Bill.  The Minister concerned considered it advisable and beneficial to have an opportunity for the Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss regulations which were made under the Bill.  I think this morning the Minister benefited from the lengthy, wide-ranging debate we had here.  I supported the regulations <Col N="1496" /> which were brought in, as it happens because I felt they were appropriate arising out of the legislation.  I see nothing wrong with the Houses of the Oireachtas debating regulations.  I am looking at the section and I see &ldquo;such regulations as the Minister may consider necessary&rdquo;.  I see nothing about draft regulations in the wording of the Bill, unless there is another subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Senator's benefit, and to help him along in this matter, he is quite right in his interpretation of the matter; regulations will be laid before the House in the normal way.  The amendment purports to have draft regulations introduced into the House and I would put it to him that that would not be in the best interest of any legislation &mdash; to have draft regulations introduced before the regulations were made.  He makes my point.</P>

      <P>What consultative process is involved in the making of the regulations? Once regulations arrive before the House, as stated this morning, it is extremely difficult to amend them in detail or in part.  You have to accept the whole package or none at all.  In this area, I think the Minister will concede that Senator Brendan Ryan who has shown tremendous initiative in this House in initiating a Private Members' Bill for the housing of homeless people in particular, would feel &mdash; and I would agree &mdash; that he would have some competence in assisting the Minister to prepare regulations which would appear before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if there is some consultative process there I feel that Senator Ryan's case would be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished; I am not sure that the Minister understands the procedures of the Oireachtas.  I have in front of me a document which was before the House this morning and it is entitled &ldquo;Draft of Special Restaurant Licence (Standards) Regulations, 1988&rdquo;. That is precisely what my amendment refers to, a draft of regulations, because regulations which must be approved by <Col N="1497" /> the House can only be in draft form until the House approves of them.  That is not to suggest that there has to be some sort of chaos of the kind that the Minister implied.  It is simply a way of giving the regulations greater status in terms of the time of the Oireachtas.  Because I happen to believe that many of the issues raised by this Bill deserve the time of the Oireachtas they should be guaranteed it; it should not be a question of having to persuade a particular number of Members that they are of sufficient priority.  The issues are important enough to deserve priority consideration.  All I can say is that if regulations to decide how big the restaurants should be, how long the menus should be, what meals should be on the menus, are important enough to be discussed by this House, then the regulations that deal with the housing of homeless people deserve similar priority.</P>
      <P>It is a red herring for the Minister to lead us off into images of confusion.  I know how the Houses of the Oireachtas deal with draft regulations, I hope the Minister knows.  He should not be leading us into some imaginary quagmire of confusion by pretending otherwise.  Draft regulations are entitled &ldquo;Draft Regulations&rdquo; because they cannot be anything else until they are approved by the Oireachtas.  All I am saying is that the regulations the Minister would wish to introduce ought to be put before the House and ought to be debated before they are passed, because that is an indication of the seriousness of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to lead us slightly astray.  I know what I mean by draft regulations and the Minister should know.  There is no confusion; it simply guarantees debate on the regulations in Government time.  The question of delay does not arise.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act, the regulations under which we were discussing this morning, was signed by the President and came into law less than a week ago.  Yesterday, in the other House, these draft regulations were discussed. Last night, in this House, the discussion began; this morning the discussion concluded.  So, the argument that <Col N="1498" /> insisting that regulations be debated in both Houses causes delay does not stand up to rational analysis.  Equally, the argument that any confusion would arise does not stand up to rational analysis.  What does stand up is a perception of the priority of those regulations in the minds of Members of the Oireachtas.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that if regulations prescribing what sort of restaurants can get licences, what sort of menus the restaurants must have, are important enough to be discussed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, then regulations about how sections of this Bill to deal with the way local authorities make provision, among other things, for homeless people, ought to be given the dignity and the priority of being guaranteed a discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the issue &mdash; not confusion or delay.  The issue is the priority given to the question being raised in the regulations.</P>

      <P>Regulations under any legislation of the Oireachtas are important as far as I am concerned.  We are seeking here to change the method by which we deal with regulations.  Regulations will be made under this Act.  If and when they are, they will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. They will be available for inspection and, should either House of the Oireachtas choose to annul them, then they may do so in the prescribed form and in the prescribed time, as laid down.  In effect, all the regulations that will be considered under this legislation will be, more than likely, basic, procedural type regulations. I cannot see why what is in existence by way of procedure in these matters is not accepted and regarded as proper, as it has been heretofore in all matters concerned with Housing Acts since 1966.  I cannot see why we cannot accept what has been there, which has worked well under the Housing Act, 1966, in so far as regulations are concerned.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The point is that if the Housing Act, 1966, had worked we would not need this legislation.  We should not use that Act or regulations arising from it to justify anything about this Bill, because this Bill would not be here if it was not for the fact that the Housing Act, 1966, had failed in a number of areas to meet the housing needs of certain categories in our society. That is precisely why both the principles embodied in the 1966 Act and the way in which it operated needed to be scrutinised. Having said that, I am not going to delay the House on a debate on a matter of what sort of regulations we have.  As the Minister said, I can &mdash; and if I do not like them, I shall &mdash; raise the regulations under the procedures available to me.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;in the opinion of the authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as far as can reasonably be established&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment goes back to the way one perceives statutory bodies to operate. It refers to section 2 of this Bill; it refers in particular to the definition of a homeless person.  In that definition what is said in section 2 is that a person shall be homeless if &ldquo;there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority, he, together with any other person who resides with him...can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of&rdquo;.  The crucial phrase is &ldquo;in the opinion of the authority&rdquo;.  I do not like opinions by anybody as the basis for fundamental decisions about other peoples' basic needs.  I do not think it is a proper statutory base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, instead of &ldquo;in the opinion of the authority&rdquo;, we substitute <Col N="1500" />&ldquo;as far as can reasonably be established&rdquo;. That involves two extensions of the degree of proof that would be required of a housing authority before it was able to make decisions under this provision. First, it should be reasonably established. That involves an attempt to make a reasonable assessment and to establish some basis on foot of that reasonable assessment.  That is a much stronger form of wording than leaving it up to the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;.  I can form an opinion about anything by looking out the window.  But if I want to reasonably establish a perception I have to assemble information, I have to assemble evidence and I have to make some sort of attempt at a balanced judgment.</P>
    <P>I would not like to become involved in a wording which involved some judicial burden of proof.  But it is reasonable to suggest that, before a housing authority makes a decision about whether it thinks accommodation is available to somebody, there ought to be a reasonably established case on foot of which they make that decision.  Leaving it up to the opinion of a housing authority is far too generous to the housing authority.  It leaves them with a bolt-hole through which anybody who is less than enthusiastic can escape.  It does not give a proper equation between the obvious concerns of a housing authority and the needs of those who would be affected by this section.  The Minister could reasonably consider strengthening the phraseology here to ensure that those who are asking to be categorised as homeless will, at least, be taken seriously.  That is what this choice of wording, as applied here and as applied under the other two amendments, is attempting to do.  It is attempting to balance the interest of the housing authority as against the interest of the homeless person.</P>
    <P>As it stands, in my opinion, the housing authority does not really have to, if it does not wish to, make any serious assessment. It can simply form an opinion &mdash; as badly as this: on the basis of prejudice &mdash; if it wishes.  This is not an attempt to suggest that all housing authorities will be unreasonable or that most housing <Col N="1501" /> authorities will be unreasonable.  It is an attempt to balance the interests of very vulnerable people against the operations of a housing authority.  I think homeless people are entitled to that.  They are not entitled to any excessive burden of proof being loaded on a housing authority.  But, given the virtually non-existent obligations towards the homeless that this Bill will put on local authorities, as distinct from the things it will empower them to do, the least that could be expected is that the housing authority would have to make reasonable inquiries and come to a reasonable conclusion before it could judge somebody to be homeless or not to be homeless under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand Senator Ryan's concern about opinions of local authorities because often it is perceived that local authorities are faceless people. But, as a member of a local authority, as a member of a housing authority, I consider that I have a role and a function under the Local Authority Acts which would give me the power to direct the manager to consider somebody eligible for housing either by ordinary resolution or motion or under section 4, if I considered that the manager was unwilling to do so.  I want, first of all to reassure Senator Ryan that when we talk about a housing authority, we are talking about elected people who would have a responsibility to ensure that the homeless would get a fair crack of the whip.  I know that this Bill is watered down from the previous Bill under which we had a more specific obligation to homeless people. However, that is a point that we will argue an another section.  I want to reassure Senator Ryan of the involvement of elected members of the authority. We have a responsibility to act in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record in the area of rehousing itinerants is not the best.  Some councils have made efforts to provide halting bays and other such facilities for itinerants but with opposition to itinerants from the electorate in parts of Ireland it is most difficult.  From that point of view, the housing authority might not necessarily <Col N="1502" /> act in the way that Senator Ryan would wish.  Perhaps what he suggested would be a more specific way of tackling this problem.  I wish to ask the Minister, in assisting me to make up my mind as to whether I should support the amendment or not, if, under this new legislation, he will be laying down guidelines for local authorities as to the area in which they should function and what their role will be under this new legislation.  Perhaps that would help to clarify the matter for Senator Ryan in regard to responsibility of the local authority and giving their opinions in public to elected members.</P>

      <P>As a member of the major local authority in the country I am not aware of individual applications that are made by homeless people for accommodation. I know from looking at the housing list that many homeless people are housed by Dublin Corporation.  I receive no complaints so I accept that the allocations officer deals sympathetically with the applications that he receives. Nevertheless, I can understand what Senator Ryan is getting at.  He wants a balance between the housing authority and the homeless person.  He said that while most local authorities are sympathetic to homeless people there could be the odd local authority that might not hold that view and he wants to safeguard against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify that the local authority in my area provide a list of all applicants, approved applicants and applicants under investigation.  I am made aware at all housing meetings who the applicants are, what their status is and what is the stage of processing their applications.  Members have an opportunity to query why an application has not moved from being under investigation to approval.  I am a member of another local authority which set down a priority list as to who will get the first available house. That is a system that I do not necessarily agree with.  Obviously Dublin City Council do not have that facility.  The demand is so great in that area that perhaps it is <Col N="1503" /> not possible to give all the information to the councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, this legislation deals with more than just the homeless and that should be remembered by all concerned.  Certainly the homeless are a new priority in the legislation.  I suppose it would be fair to say that it is because of the continued concern of so many that this legislation was introduced as an improvement on the 1966 Act.  The 1966 Act set down basic principles as far as housing is concerned and we should not disregard it.  Of course, this is a new addition and goes considerably further than the 1966 Act.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris is quite right as far as local authorities are concerned.  They are the housing authorities and they have a major role in this area which is specifically catered for in this legislation, as Senators will see later.  Guidelines, of course, will be issued and that is specifically stated in section 10 (11) (a) and (b).  That matter can be dealt with later under that section.</P>
      <P>On the question of the substance of the amendment, it is necessary in order to avoid ambiguity that it is specifically indicated who takes the decisions in regard to the responsibility of housing authorities for the homeless.  That is the fundamental aim of section 2.  If these amendments are accepted, as is being suggested, any organisation, voluntary or statutory, could claim that they regard a particular individual as homeless and attempt to have the housing authority accept their opinion.  That is not the way I want it to be.  The local authority should have the power to make the decision and that should be enshrined without any diminution of that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, with regard to section 9, it is essential to indicate in legislation who should make the decision or judgment. The suggested amendment does not indicate from whom it shall be reasonably established that the applicant is in need of accommodation and unable to provide it from his own or her own resources. This is essentially a matter for the housing authority to decide in the light of the <Col N="1504" /> information available to them.  The opinion of the housing authority in such matters is not lightly formed and I think Senators will recognise that.  It is not a matter for some specified or non-specified individual to decide willy nilly as to who might or might not be entitled to any particular service under this housing legislation.  While I understand the point made by Senator Ryan, I think he would have to agree that when it is stated in legislation that a housing authority is the final decider in the matter, that involves more than just the opinion of one individual. Much information has to be obtained and assessments have to be made in order to arrive at that decision. In fact, the wording of the Senator's amendment, &ldquo;as far as can reasonably be established&rdquo;, also suggests in effect that opinions would have to be formed by individuals in order to obtain that very same end.  It is much more preferable to have it stated as it is, &ldquo;in the opinion of the local authority&rdquo; who take account of the total services, structure and administration available to the authority.  I cannot see good reason for accepting the amendment and consequently I have to ask that it will not be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the precise wording of the amendment from this side of the House is the problem then we would all be quite happy if the Minister accepted the principle of it and came back on Report Stage with his own wording.  I have been through this procedure many times.  The fact that the Minister wants it to be made clear that the deciding authority is the housing authority is not a problem.  If the Minister and I are simply disagreeing about the clarity of identifying responsibility there would be no problem at all.  He and I would agree that it must be made perfectly clear who is responsible for these decisions.  There is no problem there.  I think that is a bit of a smokescreen.  The basic issue is the difference between the matters being in <Col N="1505" /> somebody's opinion and it being reasonably established by that person.  It would be quite feasible to rewrite this amendment on Report Stage if the Minister would simply say that the authority should make the decision after having reasonably established the position.  That would meet the Minister's requirement, which is that the housing authority be responsible for making the decision and at the same time it would clarify that they have to make reasonable efforts to find out about the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to refer the Minister to the documented evidence that I mentioned in my Second Stage speech from a meeting between the Simon Community and the City and County Managers Association. Statements were made by representatives of that association which would lead one to be very worried about what sort of information gathering methods some of these people have.  They were inclined to dismiss all homeless people as drug addicts and alcoholics.  It is a pity that the Minister was not here for the end of the debate because he might have replied to what I said then.  The Minister of State did not exactly go into detail in his reply on the various points made by Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the reasons that I have been concerned about leaving words like &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; in legislation like this.  There are people in the City and County Managers Association whose opinions are already formed to the effect that virtually nobody who is homeless is anything other than an alcoholic or a drug addict.  There is no obligation on them to investigate the matter at all.  That is precisely why I find it necessary to talk about the wording of this sort of phrase.  If there was evidence already existing that all authorities are subject to a particular interpretation, or if the Minister could statutorily enforce a provision by way of regulation as to how they were to go about forming this opinion, we could all agree on it.  I accept that it will not necessarily be one individual who will make the decision. There is a structure of authority in a housing authority the same as in any other body.  But if the opinions of the city <Col N="1506" /> or county manager are of the kind that I have already described, then those in subordinate positions are not exactly going to go around twitching their noses and saying he is wrong in his opinion about homeless people.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that we have to keep coming back to this fundamental difference of perception between myself and many voluntary organisations who deal with homeless people and how they are viewed by statutory authorities.  One must remember that it is not long since many statutory authorities denied that they had any responsibility for dealing with homeless people.  We have come some way from that.  Perhaps this is more appropriate to the section.  I know it is quoted very often that housing authorities have housed 1,800 homeless people in the last 12 months.  I would like to know what definition of homeless people is used in coming up with that figure.  That would be interesting to know.  Given that most voluntary organisations will make an assessment of the number of homeless people at around 3,000, if 1,800 of those have been housed then there should be a severe drop in the demand for services for homeless people.</P>

      <P>I was wondering what you would say to me, a Chathaoirligh.  I will come back to the amendment and we can discuss the section later.  There is a difference of opinion between myself and the Minister.  If he can satisfy me that it is not clear from my amendment that the housing authority would be the responsible body, then I suggest that he introduce an amendment on Report Stage to clarify the position that it is the housing authority which must reasonably establish the housing conditions of an individual. If he is not arguing with me about the clear line of responsibility of a housing authority but about this wording, then we might as well settle it now.  I do not think the opinion of a housing authority is sufficient evidence on which to adjudicate on somebody's housing conditions.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies to the last comments made by Senator Ryan, I have no doubt in my mind where the responsibility should lie in this. Senator Ryan does not want to remove from the local authority that final responsibility.  I am concerned that at a meeting with representatives of the county and city managers a responsible body like the Simon Community were not satisfactorily dealt with.  I had no knowledge of it.  I am sorry if the inference was drawn at that meeting that somehow county and city managers were making decisions on their own about drug addicts and layabouts.  I will say without fear of contradiction that in our local authority, which is responsible for four or five housing authorities within the county, we consult with and have regard to the evidence of the county medical officer and his agents who work for the health boards but are subcontracted to the local authority to give specialised information to us on each applicant, whether it is for rehousing, exchange of housing on health grounds or any other reason.  On the file of each housing applicant is a report from the county medical officer.  That is the kind of reasonably established opinion that is formed before the manager writes a report for the members of the council, a report which is then subject to discussion and approval. That is a good procedure which involves medical people in the formation of the opinion; and the manager is obliged in law, as far as I understand, to have regard to that medical opinion.  That information is used in the formulation of an opinion as to whether somebody is entitled to be rehoused and put on an approved housing list.  If it is the case that other authorities work in a different way and that one housing officer makes all these decisions, then there would be negligence on the part of the housing authority; but I do not think that is how it works.  Perhaps more people who are not involved in statutory bodies will try to understand how we arrive at decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be seen, first of all, to be responsible in this area.  I want to say for the record how we ensure, as statutory <Col N="1508" /> bodies, that the system functions.  Now that new guidelines are being laid down we will be able to function more beneficially in the area of rehousing homeless people.  We have a record of doing just that.  We house single people, unmarried people, single parent families, unmarried mothers and many other categories.  No county manager has ever had the audacity to describe them as not being in accordance with family units or not being people in need of housing.  I am talking about men of the road and agricultural workers who are single, living in a caravan and in need of housing.  Of course, we have housed them.  We have produced quite a large percentage of OPDs throughout our housing estates to meet that requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is indeed, and I served on one for nearly 21 years.  At least I can agree with Senator Ryan on one aspect in that he recognises that this legislation is a huge advance.  He did not use the word &ldquo;huge&rdquo; but I am putting the adjective in to help him along the way. He regarded it as an advance in housing legislation; I regard it as a huge advance. It goes considerably further than many people in both Houses thought it might go.  I am really not interested in amending legislation for the sake of amending it. Unless the amendment does something to improve the position it is not worth talking about.  What I am basically trying to establish here is who is responsible for taking decisions.  The housing authority has that responsibility and I must make that absolutely clear.  Otherwise the whole sequence of events that will lead to doing the job properly will be defused and diminished.  Local authorities do not form their opinions by just simply looking out the window, as was suggested by Senator Ryan.  I take that as a flippant remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris understands the position quite well.  He understands that there are many factors taken into account. Much information is sought, including on <Col N="1509" /> many occasions the informed views of the elected members, who contribute on a regular basis at housing committee meetings and meetings of authorities.  Their views are always taken into account by the housing authority when they are making decisions about a housing situation in any area, and that is how it should be.  I do not want to diminish that. It is for that reason that I do not see it as necessary to concede this amendment.</P>
    <P>The words suggested in Senator Ryan's amendment are &ldquo;in so far as can be reasonably established&rdquo;.  Something cannot be established or decided reasonably without opinions being formed by somebody or some group of people. Opinions will always be part and parcel of the assessments that are made, whether it is the opinions of the chief medical officer, the housing officer, the social worker or a whole range of individuals or groups who get involved in making the assessments and providing the information to the housing authority.  That is exactly what happens in making the assessments.  Whether mistakes are made or not is another matter entirely and housing authorities can address themselves to that.  That is the reason we have local authorities.  They bring forward opinions about how the housing authorities mix business.  By and large we do not hear, as Senator Doyle said, complaints from members of housing authorities as to how the matter is dealt with. We hear complaints occasionally.  There is no question but that Senator Ryan is accurate when he says that there are individuals who have a misguided notion about certain categories of people and the priority they should have in the housing arrangements.  I accept that, but I do not accept that any application is finally determined by the opinion of one man or one woman.  For that reason I do not feel obliged to concede this amendment and I suggest to the Senator that it is not worth pursuing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to <Col N="1510" /> be agreeing with me and yet he says he will not accept the amendment.  We all agree that it should be perfectly clear who is responsible for taking these decisions. The only body that can be responsible is the housing authority.  We all agree on that.  What I want to ensure is that they have a certain obligation to assemble information before they come to a conclusion. There is nothing in this provision as it is drafted which can satisfy me.  Let us not have people here wave their experience on local authorities at me as some sort of guarantee that they have a superior knowledge about how housing authorities operate.  I have observed housing authorities from a different perspective over the years.  I have a particular view on how they operate and how they dealt with single people under 55 years of age.  A great fuss was created about that and people had to take them seriously, but until then those people had to put up with whatever they had.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare rent allowance scheme was also operated in an extraordinarily arbitrary, haphazard and unfair fashion until a considerable fuss was created about it in many areas.  It now operates a good deal better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ways of looking at the way any statutory agency operates.  One is from the perspective of those who deliver the service; the other is from the perspective of those who receive the service. With all the goodwill in the world and without attributing anything other than the best of motives to those who deliver the service, they often need the insight, experience and history of those who receive the service in order to learn how to improve it.  There is no monopoly of wisdom on how local authorities operate, although I accept that experience contributes a good deal to people's knowledge of how the country operates.  There are two sides to this.  There is the side of the deliverer of the service and the side of the receiver of the service.  Both sides are entitled to be heard and to be taken seriously.  What I am endeavouring to do, with the limited experience I have, is to ensure that both sides get a reasonable crack of the whip.  All I am saying is <Col N="1511" /> that there ought to be an obligation on a housing authority to make a reasonable attempt to assemble information and to be reasonably objective and detached in coming to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>As it stands &mdash; this matter relates better to a later amendment &mdash; the opinion of a housing authority is needed in deciding whether somebody can reasonably occupy certain accommodation.  How does that apply to somebody who has left a house because her husband is being violent?  Who forms an opinion on that? Is it up to the individual in a housing authority or the housing authority themselves to decide whether a particular incident of family violence is sufficiently serious, or how is it decided?  I think there is a requirement to establish objective information by contacting third parties like medical people, members of the Garda, etc. rather than dismissing the story of a wife who comes to a housing authority and says: &ldquo;I had to leave, I could no longer stick it because he was beating me up.&rdquo;  How is the information established if there is no obligation on people to do so?  There are many people in our society who would prefer to believe that family violence does not exist.  I know of the prejudices that exist.  I have met various members of local authorities and, like the rest of Irish society, like this House and the other House of the Oireachtas, they consist of a mixture of the excellent, the good, the mediocre and the appalling.  Because of that there is a need to ensure that what we want to be done is spelt out in regulations.</P>

      <P>I will be very kind to the Minister, but I will not refer to him as &ldquo;Your Excellency&rdquo;.  The Minister is not being helpful.  It is not unreasonable to expect a tightening up of the procedure of assessment of the housing needs of an individual beyond the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;. A medical opinion is based on experience and on an examination.  A legal opinion is based on the expertise of a barrister who attempts to understand the situation. This sort of procedure, as far as we know, operates very well.  If the complaints about how homeless people are housed are not heard it is perhaps because some of the homeless people are not very articulate.</P>
      <P>There is a gentleman living not 200 yards away from here &mdash; I think it is on the steps of the Department of Agriculture &mdash; who has been homeless for 11 years.  He has applied to Dublin Corporation for housing and has been told he can be accommodated in Ballymun. The gentleman happens to be quite a nervous and shy person and is extremely wary of the area in which he has been offered accommodation.  He has been told that if he wants accommodation in a more acceptable part of the city there is awaiting list of 35 or 40 other people and there is no guarantee as to when he will be accommodated.  Things do not work as well as people who deliver the services often imagine.  There are always victims of the delivery of services and they are entitled to be heard.  It is necessary that their side of the story is heard and checked out before a decision is taken. Appearance, history or anything else should not be sufficient to enable people to form an opinion.  Having said that, because the Minister will be doing something to clarify the thinking of housing authorities on this issue, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party got most of these amendments from a source with which I have some contact too.  We all made a submission, a submission which unfortunately was not responded to in the way I feel it should have been. A genuine attempt was made to transform this into excellent legislation.  It is a matter of regret that the submission was not responded to.  I have been concerned, both in this Bill and in a previous Bill, about the omission of any reference to a hostel from the definition of the homeless person.  It is strange because at a later stage in the Bill it is made clear that a housing authority can build hostels. Section 15 refers to &ldquo;the provision of dwellings (including houses, flats, maisonettes and hostels) by the authority&rdquo;. I would hate people to think that the solution to the problems of the homeless is to build hostels for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A hostel is not a home for any individual who has the capacity to survive independently or to live on his or her own.  A person may be in a form of accommodation which can be categorised by a housing authority as a hostel, as distinct from a night shelter &mdash; and, in spite of the best efforts of the organisation that I have some connection with, all State authorities insist on describing all our night shelters as hostels.  That is one of the reasons I am so concerned about the wording of the Bill.  It appears to me that most statutory authorities will regard a Simon Community night shelter as a hostel, because that is what they insist on <Col N="1514" /> calling them in spite of all our efforts to try to change their thinking.  That is why I, among others, would wish to have the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; inserted into the Bill. Hostel, may I say, as defined in amendment No. 7.  Many people have explained to us that &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; is a kind of a catch-all word.  Apart from the obvious meaning of it, I have clearly, like other Senators, excluded hostel accommodation for students, professional trainees or youth hostels from the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister can make various arguments about who might be affected by this amendment.  Let me remind him about the wording of section 2 (b) which refers to a person &ldquo;living in a hospital, county home, night shelter, hostel or other such institution, and is so living because he has no accommodation of the kind referred to in paragraph (a)&rdquo;.  Hostels for the mentally handicapped are not affected by this amendment.  We are not going to say that a local authority will have to define all mentally handicapped people living in hostels as homeless under section 2 because of the fact that they are not living in those hostels solely because they have no accommodation.  They are living in those hostels because they are in need of a particular kind of sheltered accommodation.  It is precisely the same wording that refers to a hospital, because we all know there are people living in psychiatric hospitals in particular because they cannot get accommodation.  It is equally true that there are people living in hostels, particularly hostels as defined by health boards and local authorities, simply because they can get no accommodation.</P>
    <P>I want to anticipate what I know to be the traditional argument against inserting the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; and that is that hostels cover people like the mentally handicapped or people who are recently discharged from prison.  Hostels for recently discharged prisoners are not simply to make provision for them because they are homeless; they are actually half-way houses to enable them to acclimatise themselves to the realities of living outside prison.  They are not in those hostels <Col N="1515" /> simply because they have no accommodation; they are in them for an extra reason.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; in order to allay the fears of a large number of voluntary organisations who run night shelters and who are convinced that many housing authorities will chose to regard night shelters as hostels because they have always done so and there is nothing in this legislation to make them do differently. The word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;, as defined under amendment No. 7, would clear that up and would not leave housing authorities open to some compulsion to regard as homeless people who are in hostels because they are mentally handicapped, because they are ex-psychiatric patients and so on.  It is an attempt at clarity which will, on the one hand, allay the fears of a considerable number of people and, on the other hand, guarantee that persons who are in hostels because of the fact of their handicaps of one kind or another will not come within the ambit of section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the signatories to this set of amendments I want the Minister to be reassured that we are trying to be as specific as possible about inserting this description of what we all considered to be a temporary shelter for people.  We want the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; added and the provisions read, &ldquo;living in a hospital, county home, night shelter, hostel or such institutions or other such institutions...&rdquo; The Minister will probably tell us that the words, &ldquo;or other such institutions&rdquo; will cover hostels.  It is the opinion of people like Senator Brendan Ryan, and indeed those of us who have had dealings with people who were concerned about the exclusion of the definition of a hostel, that not having it included here could leave a loophole in the legislation.  I do not think the Minister, his officials, the Department or the Government would like to see that happening in a Bill which is trying to address the problems of homeless people.  Therefore, to assist the Minister we have defined what we consider to be a hostel. <Col N="1516" /> It should be interpreted, the amendment says, &ldquo;as a multiple occupancy accommodation constructed for the purpose of providing refuge aid facilities or services for a person who would not otherwise have accommodation readily available for him to occupy it but shall not include hostel accommodation for students, professional trainees or youth hostels.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Nobody can deny, if somebody is staying in a hostel or in a night shelter, that in some way they are not homeless.  But while they might be in those places of shelter or refuge for one night, they are transient, and they certainly could not call it their own.  It would not be a home as we understand a home, a place a person can go to and come from, where there is a certain element of privacy, a certain security of occupancy and tenancy. We feel that adding the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; to this will make the section more definitive, particularly when it is taken in conjunction with our interpretation of what a hostel should be and with what everybody thinks it is at the moment.  This is not an unreasonable amendment.  If the Minister understands the good will with which it is being made he will respond positively to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern behind these amendments might very well be misplaced. The term &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; was consciously omitted from the definition of the homeless person in this Bill, and in the 1985 Bill, for the very good reason that hostel accommodation, incorporating both support services and decent standards of privacy, is an appropriate and indeed often an essential element of the range of accommodation necessary to meet the needs of homeless persons. It was precisely for that reason that the 1985 Bill provided that local authority housing subsidy would, for the first time, be made available for the provision of local authority hostel accommodation. Since then the Government have revised the voluntary housing scheme to allow the provision of modern hostel accommodation for homeless persons to be effectively grant aided up to 95 per cent by housing authorities with the full cost <Col N="1517" /> of these grants being met by the Department. Section 15 provides for those arrangements.  It may be helpful if I say that I regard the existing Simon hostels as coming within the definition of a night shelter or a similar institution.  That was the basic argument put forward in the other House.  I have no problem at all in referring to what happened in the other House.  Some people do not like it happening here but sometimes it can help to clarify a little matter that may be causing concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no trouble in justifying the need for this House.  Senators do not have to be so defensive about it.  As far as I am concerned the whole question about Simon hostels comes within that definition of night shelter or a similar institution.  I will make that point very clear in the guidelines that we will be issuing to local authorities in so far as the implemention of section 2, and perhaps even more importantly, section 10 of this legislation is concerned.  If that helps to put the minds of Senators at rest about that element, then that matter can be resolved quite adequately under the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The amendment could be quite harmful in its effects in that it could hinder the development of appropriate modern hostel accommodation for homeless persons as legally such accommodation could not then be used by a housing authority to meet the housing needs of those homeless persons for whom it was appropriate and suitable.  In effect, I could summarise my position in the matter very simply by saying that I regard hostels as part of the solution as far as the homeless are concerned, not in its entirety, but it certainly will form, and has formed, a partial solution.  To accept these amendments would put that out of court and could, in fact, be counterproductive to what we are seeking to achieve by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will understand that, of course, certain kinds of hostels are very <Col N="1518" /> appropriate for certain kinds of people, particularly for people who leave institutions and who are accommodated, and can be accommodated, in this type of arrangement.  For that reason I suggest that Senators would have their fears set aside in so far as my understanding of the Simon hostels is concerned.  I only use the word &ldquo;Simon&rdquo; to give an example because, of course, they are not the only voluntary organisation involved in this. We must not get tied up in referring to Simon as if they, and they only, were the sole voluntary organisation that has a concern in this matter.  They have &mdash; I have already put this on record in the Dáil and I will put it on record in the Seanad &mdash; my considerable esteem for the work they have done, and continue to do, but it is no less than the work done by other voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others.  There is no point in naming them now because people will ask why I did not mention their organisation which may have been helping the homeless for 30 to 40 years.  They all do excellent work and it is to enable their hostels to be understood in the way I suggest now, and which will be clarified in the guidelines that I will be issuing, and also to have it understood that I regard hostels as a partial solution to this problem that I ask Senators to see my point of view in the matter.  I ask Senators not to press the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained my position better than I could because he has spoken about hostels for people who need support or who need protection, and so on.  Those people who need hostels for any other reason other than the fact that they have no accommodation are not covered by the hostel terms as we have introduced it.  We are talking about people who are in hostels simply because they have no other accommodation, not people who are in hostels because they need support, or somebody to cook for them, or somebody to listen to them, or because they need the experience of communal living due to their experiences, their age or anything like that.  We are talking about people, <Col N="1519" /> according to the wording of the section as introduced by the Minister, who are living in a hospital, county home, night shelter, hostel or other such institution. We are referring to people who are solely there because they have no accommodation of the kind referred to due to a lack of accommodation, not because of their personality needs, not because of their needs in the areas of, say, drink or drugs, not because of their age, not because of mental handicap but because, purely and simply, they have no accommodation.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that a hostel is proper or right accommodation for anybody whose only problem is that he or she has no accommodation.  Anybody who has no accommodation and has no other problems needs the privacy of his or her own accommodation, private and separate from that of others, or to be free to choose a different kind of accommodation, for example, sharing a house with somebody else.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that in any way the sort of hostels for people who need support &mdash; not all homeless people by any means need that sort of support &mdash; people who need help or assistance or anything else, are in any way implicated in this.  We are talking about hostels for people who have no accommodation and are in the hostel because they have no accommodation. Let it be said that there are homeless people who need to be in hospitals and it is one of the scandals of our society.  Like any voluntary organisation dealing with homeless people I know that there are people who need to be in hospital because they are psychiatrically ill or, indeed, because they are physically unwell.  That does not mean that we should exclude hospitals from this definition because there are homeless people who need to be in hospital.  Some people, because of their age, need to be in county homes or in accommodation for old people.  That does not mean we should exclude county homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are homeless people whose proper place of living ought to be a hospital or a county home but that does <Col N="1520" /> not mean, and the Minister did not choose to say so, that hospitals should be excluded from this definition.  Similarly, the fact that there are some homeless people who need a particular kind of hostel support should not exclude the term &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; from this definition.  Our amendment would do an awful lot to alleviate the concerns of a considerable number of people.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister that anybody who thinks that the Simon Community are anything other than a small part of the work that has been done for homeless people in this country is mistaken.  The Simon Community are a small part of the work.  They may be vocal, and the Minister may have a view as to whether they are excessively vocal or not, but in terms of the provision of services there are a vast number, most notably, as I said in my Second Stage speech, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who have been doing this work for a long time.  Indeed, the county homes used to provide this service but regrettably they are doing less and less of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a coherent case for introducing the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; precisely because of the ambivalence about it.  It is because the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; is ambivalent that we have drafted a definition which makes <Col N="1521" /> clear what we are talking about.  It also makes clear that it is only people who are in such a hostel precisely because they have no accommodation, and for no other additional reason, that they are referred to.

      <P>No.  The Minister in his response has confirmed my worries and concerns in this area, which prompted us to put in the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;.  The Minister has now admitted that he considers the provision of hostels, as he understands them, by the local authority, or anybody else, goes some of the way towards meeting the problem of the homeless.  It is our argument on this side of the House that the accommodation that is available in hostels in no way goes towards the cause of homeless people who need a home or the privacy and facility of it.  There are people in hostels who need other services in the hostels and probably would not be capable of living in a home, a small house or an OPD on their own.  That is why, and this is perfectly understandable, they are in the night shelters, hostels or other such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Minister's definition of &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; that has confirmed in my mind that it is appropriate to have the word in the Bill.  The fact that it is not there will give an opening to local authorities to say that people who are in hostels need not necessarily be included in guidelines for people who need rehousing.  That would be a pity because for many people being in those hostels is a temporary arrangement. It does not meet the case for rehousing them.  If they are there, not of their own choice, they are debarred from being considered even now by any research group, medical people or social workers, for housing.  If they are in a hostel they may be debarred from consideration as a homeless person under the definitions of the Bill.  The Minister would want to confirm to me that his guidelines to the local authorities, and <Col N="1522" /> whatever definitions he lays down, will cover this.  We are talking in terms of a local authority maybe maintaining a register of hostels operating in their functional area in accordance with subsection (2).  They may not enter into such register hostels that are operated for such purposes as provision of accommodation for students or other people.</P>
    <P>We are trying to be absolutely specific in what we are doing and we are trying to make sure that it is not misrepresented by anybody.  Section 2 (a) states that a person shall be regarded as being homeless if there is no accommodation available which he can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of.  That is why we have included &ldquo;hostels&rdquo; as one of the additional other institutions and we want that specified because there is, obviously, ambiguity about people's understanding of what a hostel is or the service it gives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I rise is to say that Senator Ferris's understanding of the Bill now confirms for me that I am right in my attitude.  He made my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister made Senator Ryan's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Senator Ferris made my case, quite eloquently, by saying that a hostel is not a solution to the housing of all homeless persons.  However, it is acknowledged, and is acknowledged too by Senator Ferris, that certain homeless people, particularly those who might have an institutional background or, perhaps, young people, may require the supportive care which can be provided in the hostel accommodation.  That hostel accommodation may very well be, as Senator Ferris quite rightly recognised, an interim arrangement and may not necessarily be a long term one, depending on the needs of the particular individual. There are many people living in hostels who would prefer to live permanently in the hostel environment with the advantages of the company that is available there and a certain level of support.  They would not want me to make them leave. <Col N="1523" /> I am not for turfing people out of institutions or hostels, call them what you like, if they do not wish to leave and if they find support there.  That is a danger if we pursue the matter as suggested.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I am aware of people in this town living in particular circumstances for 20 years and who regard themselves not as homeless.  They are looked after, they get their meals, their support and so on and they have the privacy referred to by Senator Ferris. There is the element of privacy and security of tenure &mdash;&ldquo;tenure&rdquo; was the word used by the Senator &mdash; and that is the reason I say that a hostel can be a partial solution to this problem of homelessness. It would be totally unreasonable, as far as I am concerned, to suggest, as Senator Ryan has, that a hostel is not a suitable form of accommodation for certain categories of persons.  There are people who would prefer to have the communal atmosphere, who would need, require and want the support of a hostel.  They would prefer it rather than the loneliness that one can sometimes experience living in a flat.  To suggest to them that their position might be altered, diminished or somehow not encompassed in the way hoped for in the legislation would, I believe, be doing a disservice and taking away that little element of choice to a few.  It is the few we talk about in this type of legislation.  This legislation, while it deals in many ways with the thousands and thousands involved in housing arrangements in other circumstances, affects a few and that worries me.  The few can have their positions seriously altered and the solution to their personal requirements and what they want for themselves would be diminished if I accepted the amendments.  Senator Ferris is right in that regard and I take his comfort to the Minister in good spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify two comforts to the Minister.  I need to be comforted and to be absolutely sure about what we are doing.  It is very difficult to talk about comfort when we realise some of the discomfort those people are going <Col N="1524" /> through.  I am saying that nobody opts out of or is pushed out of a hostel or any other accommodation.  They apply to leave but I want to be categorically clear that if somebody temporarily residing in a hostel applies to a local authority for consideration for rehousing they will not be debarred or excluded.  They may apply because they might not consider the hostel to be the right place, but it may be the only place that is available to them. Please do not exclude them.  I would hate if any local authority formed the opinion that because somebody was in a hostel considered suitable for some other people they should be debarred.  They may have an address of a hostel or institution but that is not the point.  Can the Minister reassure me that he will not exclude any applicant from a hostel if the applicant considers he should be rehoused in the privacy of a little house or otherwise?  If he can I will not have many more worries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it crystal clear, and it might be helpful to a lot of people, including the Senator, that homelessness in voluntary housing accommodation, including hostel accommodation, will not debar an individual from consideration by a local authority or housing authority.  That is specifically catered for in section 10 (9).  The Senator's point is totally covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went off on a slightly unfortunate tangent about turfing people out of hostels.  The problem is that he is not being consistent. There must be some reason for excluding hostels from this definition and I do not think we have found it yet.  There are people living in psychiatric hospitals who are only there because they have no accommodation.  Is the Minister saying that they are going to be turfed out under this legislation because they are defined as homeless?  I know he is not.  I am not suggesting that people who live in hostels and who do not want to move should be turfed out.  What I am saying is that people who are in hostels, and who have <Col N="1525" /> no other problem, ought to be categorised by housing authorities as being homeless.  I have read section 9, which the Minister referred to, and that does not just cover hostels.  It covers anybody who is catered for under section 10 which refers to financial assistance, assistance with renting accommodation, arrangement with lodgings and so on.  Any of those are still eligible for local authority housing and I am quite clear about that. However, what I am not clear about is why people who happen to be living in hostels cannot be listed among those who are homeless in terms of what is going to be done later on for housing assessments and in terms of what the housing authority may have to do for them or may feel obliged to do for them under the provisions of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why we can list people in hospitals, who perhaps do not want to leave, or people in county homes, who do not want to leave, or people in night shelters.  I know of people in night shelters who do not want to move into any other accommodation for the reasons the Minister has listed.  Sometimes, unfortunately, the Minister gives the impression that the things he has thought about are somehow entirely new.  I am aware that there are people in all those institutions who do not want to live elsewhere, and that is not something that we should make too much of because many of those people have been conditioned by many years misery and have no other source of identification.  I also know, in considerable detail, that many people do not find the isolation and the loneliness of living in a flat on their own preferable to living in a hostel.  Nobody is suggesting that there is anything in this Bill which is going to force such people out of accommodation that they want to be in into accommodation that they do not want to be in, other than, may I say &mdash; I do not want to be too nasty about this &mdash; the fact that the Government cutbacks are going to convince many of the health boards that they are going to have to dump people out of psychiatric hospitals. They do not want to go but health boards will have to tell them they will have to <Col N="1526" /> live on their own.  That is the only case in which people are going to be forced out of where they want to live into where they do not want to be.</P>
    <P>What we are simply saying is that such things as hostels exist.  They are places where many people live simply because they have no accommodation.  People who are in hostels simply because they have no accommodation ought to be categorised as homeless, because that is what they are.  Nothing else matters on this issue because everything else is covered.  People can be in hostels because they need the transition arrangements, because of their mental handicap, because of their psychiatric history or whatever.  The truth is that nobody need be forced out of a hostel.  But people living in hostels are homeless and are entitled to be given the same priority as people living in long stay psychiatric institutions, county homes or night shelters. Multiple occupancy accommodation, which is what a hostel will be, is not the sort of accommodation that we shall regard as the norm for housing for people who want accommodation which they call their own.  That is why hostels should be incorporated in this definition. That is why I cannot withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <P>I take it that I have convinced Senator Ferris about the question of the entitlement of people to be considered for local authority housing even though they are in a certain hostel situation.  That is catered for.  That was the main thrust of the Senator's contribution and the fears he expressed.  I want it accepted.  The position of variance between myself and Senator Ryan is that I see a certain kind of hostel as being a partial solution to this problem.  It is catered for in section 15. <Col N="1527" /> That is the reason it is catered for there. There are individuals who can be, could be and are homeless.  They are in these places and they do not want to leave.  I do not want them &mdash; if using the word &ldquo;turfed out&rdquo; is too sensitive, then fair enough; but I want that element of choice to be there.  That is the reason why I want it to be part of the solution and I want the choice to remain for certain individuals. <Col N="1528" /> We are talking about individuals. For that reason I would ask the Senator not to press that matter.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  if the authority is satisfied that a person is in real and present danger of coming within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b) within 28 days,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a failure in logic in both this Bill and in the previous Government's Bill that I have never been able to get to the bottom of.  While it is accepted, whatever the arguments we may have, that people who are homeless are in need of provision, in need of concern and in need of considerable support &mdash; and we may argue about the degree of that support or the specific obligation to provide support &mdash; there is a clear indication, by virtue of the existence of the definition and the detail into which the Minister has gone in this Bill in the definition, of the extreme need of people who are homeless and the fact that, as a society, nobody believes <Col N="1529" /> that anybody ought to be living without accommodation.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is most welcome.  It is peculiar therefore that, if we accept that homelessness is a particularly devastating form of deprivation, we cannot attempt to anticipate such a form of deprivation by ensuring that people who are threatened with becoming homeless come under the aegis of the housing authority; and that whatever they propose to do about homeless people should be done about people if, as the amendment suggests, &ldquo;the authority is satisfied that the person is in real and present danger of coming within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b) within 28 days&rdquo;.  In other words, if a housing authority is satisfied &mdash; and we are being conservative here because we use the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;is of the opinion that&rdquo;, which is the Minister's preferred choice of words.  However, we try to be consistent in these things and, since we wanted them to be satisfied or to have some evidence on the previous occasion, we want similar evidence now.  If an authority is satisfied that a person is in real and present danger of effectively becoming homeless within 28 days, then they ought to come under the provision, they ought to be defined as being homeless, because of the extreme need that those people will be in within a relatively short period of time.  I know that there is provision later in the Bill for the provision of emergency accommodation.  I am well aware of that.  I very carefully read legislation before I get involved with a Minister of the ability of the present Minister so that I know what I am talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things the Minister and I have in common: we both know what we are talking about. The point, of course, is that in terms of what the housing authority needs to do in terms of its assessments, in terms of its responses or indeed of what it is empowered to do under this legislation, in my opinion the powers will be considerably greater if those who are threatened with <Col N="1530" /> homelessness, if those who are identified and the authority are satisfied that they are threatened with homelessness, are brought within the provisions of section 2.</P>
      <P>That is why I would ask the Minister to accept the concept of being threatened with homelessness.  It is actually a concept that is in the British Homeless Persons Act, because of the fact that it was identified as a sensible way of anticipating problems before people actually ended up on the streets.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if I may deal with amendment No. 5, since we are talking about both of them, this is a specific reference to a particularly painful method by which people cease to have access to accommodation, and that is by the threat of violence or the likelihood of violence in some other person.  I would be concerned that the use of violence or the threat of violence to keep people out of accommodation that they might otherwise reasonably occupy ought to be inserted in this, in particular to deal with the problems of family violence and of battered wives.  I do not want us to be in a position similar to the position in the United Kingdom where many housing authorities have actually said that because somebody leaves a home as a result of family violence that person is voluntarily homeless and therefore not covered by the provisions of the British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the threat of violence or the experience of violence ought to be identified if for no other reason than to make it clear to people who are advising the victims of family violence that they come under the provisions of homelessness legislation, however inadequate it may be.  This is the second or third Minister I have dealt with on the issue of homelessness and I have a pretty good idea that he will tell me that the &ldquo;reasonable occupy&rdquo; phrase in section 2 covers the threat of violence.  I accept that it is possible to argue that.  But I think the experience and the threat of violence is such an extreme trauma that it should not be implied in a definition of homelessness; it should be explicitly stated within it to make it clear beyond any doubt to any <Col N="1531" /> housing authority that this Bill covers those who are forced out of their accommodation because of violence.</P>
    <P>That is not an unreasonable demand. There is nothing at variance with the Minister's intent in this Bill.  It is simply an attempt to reassure those who would otherwise be concerned that they might not be covered or to make it clear to those who have the job of implementing this legislation that their brief extends to people who are excluded from their housing because of the threat of violence. That is all I wish to say on these two amendments.  We are getting into deeper issues about the problem of homelessness at this stage.  I look forward to what I am sure will be a constructive response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to the excellent points made by my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, I want to say at the outset that trying to insert this kind of definition has been considered over a number of years as being revolutionary and controversial, to say the least, because there was always a worry in the minds of people who felt they would be carrying out this legislation that the threat of homelessness would be difficult to determine.  People get threatening letters from solicitors, letters purporting to say that if they are not out of the house by a certain date they will be forcibly ejected.  This kind of letter emanates from solicitors' offices without regard to the fact that one has to go to court to get a court order before one can be evicted or taken out of one's home, for whatever reason.  Usually people have to resort to the courts before they finally put people out.  Unfortunately, I have witnessed evictions in my time by the private sector.  They evicted people who were living under peculiar caretaker clauses in what was termed to be the family home for up to 100 years.  But suddenly they found themselves, on a snowy day in the village of Bansha, being evicted.  Evictions do happen in this day and age.  Unfortunately, some local authorities have had to resort to requesting <Col N="1532" /> people to vacate their houses because they were unable to meet the repayments.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned about in this amendment is that a threat of a letter from a solicitor's office, using whatever legal jargon the solicitor might use, would not be considered to be a real threat.  So, we put into this amendment the words &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;present danger&rdquo; of becoming homeless within the meaning of the Act. This means going through the normal procedure, the procedure of going into a court where the judge, as we understand it, would normally give a decision that these people would have to be forcibly ejected from their house.  This is happening. I am concerned therefore that when there is a real and present danger of a person becoming homeless within the meaning of the Act, and within a specified number of days, the local authority, as the housing authority, should be able to respond before it happens.</P>
      <P>At present under the emergency situation, when somebody is put out on the road or is in danger of being put out on the road with their belongings and their children, the local authority have to respond instantly by providing mobile home accommodation, then they have to put them on an application list, then on a housing list, and finally try to allocate them a house as one becomes available. So, there is a little bit of bureacracy, because up to then the accommodation they had would have been considered adequate for their needs.  Our concern is that their ability to remain in that adequate accommodation is being removed through the forces of law or any other real or present danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also concerned about the level of violence that is, unfortunately, with us nowadays.  In regard to the allocation of deserted wives' allowance, if the wife admits that she left the home, even because of violence, she debars herself from the receipt of a deserted wives allowance, because she is considered by the Department of Social Welfare to have left the home, even if it was in the interests of her own safety and that of her children.  Whether we like it or not, <Col N="1533" /> these events are happening.  Nobody would advocate that somebody should stay in a house where their life is in danger or that they may voluntarily, if you like, make themselves homeless in the interests of their own safety and the safety of their family.  But that might preclude the housing authority from being able seriously to consider them as homeless.</P>
    <P>We are concerned therefore.  In that regard we tried to be reasonable in defining it as &ldquo;real and present danger&rdquo;.  The Minister, in his response, might be able to reassure us, because this is fundamental to what is understood by all of us involved in trying to do something in the area of homelessness.  I admit that it was not in previous legislation either and that previous Ministers did not manage to get it through the parliamentary draftsman and into legislation.  We hope the Minister, in his own excellent and flamboyant way, might concede this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>People in the past have received notices to quit from their landlords or their agents.  Unfortunately, people leave their place of residence through fear.  Of course, as was pointed out, the only legal way to serve notice on tenants is through the courts, through the serving of a civil bill and an order being made by the court and then the sheriff taking action on a court order.  In Dublin the people who go through that procedure find themselves on the priority list for housing.  So, they are better off than people who just find themselves homeless. They are a special category and they can jump the queue, so to speak.  But there is no accommodation for those referred to in the second amendment and for whom I would have some sympathy, that is, people who are suffering or have suffered from violence in the family home and for that reason have to leave or are forced to leave.  I would be sympathetic towards the Minister considering that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  I do so despite <Col N="1534" /> the fact that I am very much inclined to agree with my distinguished colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, that both he and the Minister know very clearly and in a most professional way what they are talking about and that I am, in a certain sense, intervening as an amateur, but as an amateur who is moved very strongly by the plight of the homeless.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 says:</P>
      <P>...if the authority is satisfied that a person is in real and present danger of coming within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b) within 28 days ...</P>
      <P>I understand this to mean that a situation would be rectified where there could be a time lag between the time in which a person actually becomes homeless and is rehoused in a practical sense.  Luckily it is not so frequent an occurrence now, but I have very clear memories &mdash; until the last few years, in fact &mdash; of not so long ago seeing people in the inner city of Dublin with their possessions dumped out on the side of the road.  The unfortunate people sometimes camped under polythene with a few miserable possessions waiting to be rehoused.  It is a very shameful sight in this country, and I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.  If there is any way in which this time lag can be removed then it should be acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were very poor people in the majority of circumstances.  There is now, of course, as the Minister is aware, the case of the new poor.  There are situations in which people &mdash; to use offensive class terminology, which I suppose I must &mdash; middle class people caught by the economic circumstances that are currently prevailing find they have to default on mortgages, for example.  There have been a number of programmes which instanced this over the last year, cases of professional and business people whose livelihoods have collapsed for one reason or another.  They are forced to default on mortgages, they are evicted from their houses and the local authority is unable to house them, apparently, until they are actually out on the side of the road.  I <Col N="1535" /> think that, even if that situation obtains only for 24 hours, 12 hours or even one hour, it is 24, 12 or one hour too much, because apart from anything else there is the humiliation, the shame and the obloquy to which these people are unnecessarily exposed by virtue of economic circumstances over which they have no control.  So, I would urge the Minister to consider the very carefully worded amendment in the names of Senator Ryan, Senator Ferris, Senator O'Shea and Senator Harte, which I am happy to support vigorously.</P>
    <P>The second amendment, amendment No. 5, deals with the possibility that some person already has accommodation, but that accommodation to which he or she has a technical legal right may not represent a real possibility because of the contingency of violence.  Now I think that this is a real situation.  I am concerned that this amendment starts with the pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; because it seems very clear to me that in the majority of circumstances what we are probably dealing with here is a situation of battered wives.  I understand that there are technical reasons of draftsmanship why the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is used, but it is a particularly unfortunate form of sexism and it is an offence to the majority of citizens of this country, who happen to be female, that in terms of the technology of draftsmanship it should still in this year of 1988 be maintained that the pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; includes the female.  I presume that this is the reason that this is done, and I know that it is not directly relevant except as a kind of a codicil to this paragraph.  I find it offensive and I expect the Minister, as a forward thinking person, and his advisers also find it offensive; but I do not suppose that in terms of this Bill anything could be done about that.  Although I believe that as it is a situation of battered wives that is being addressed here it is a very real situation, it is also a situation in which, in my limited experience of dealing with these areas, the Garda and other family members are very often reluctant to get involved, precisely because it is a family matter.  In these sort of circumstances I <Col N="1536" /> frequently hear people say &ldquo;I do not want to be involved because it is family&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be a situation in which the State ought to operate <i>in loco familii,</i> if I am getting my Latin cases correct, in the place of the family, and ought to take care for these unfortunate people.  I would be interested in a comment from the Minister, if this is possible, with regard to the use of the pronoun and perhaps, as I say, this forward looking Government will be prepared to introduce some procedural change to remove this anomaly.</P>

      <P>I believe, Senator Norris, that it is the Interpretation Act, 1937, that so decided that &ldquo;he&rdquo; in legislation would also include &ldquo;she.&rdquo;  The Senator will have noticed in his casual perusal of my contributions in this matter and other legislation in the other House that I regularly state &ldquo;he or she.&rdquo;  I do not know why I do that for any particular reason except&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is perhaps sometimes safer to be on the side of the ladies in these matters.  Anyway that legislation, in the same year as the Constitution, determined all these matters for us and, as the Senator quite rightly says, the draftsman is not about to change it now to accommodate this piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I take your point, Senator, about amateurs. If we were considering sporting activities, it has been my experience that rarely does the amateur succeed when he is dealing with the professionals; but in this business we are talking about this afternoon, often the amateur has the most salient point to put forward, as I have discovered, so your contribution is both worthy and precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I would join with all the Senators in saying that eviction from a home is never a pleasant sight, and thankfully it is a rare sight.  As the years have drifted along, whether by good fortune or by more active local authority and <Col N="1537" /> housing authority participation and understanding of the needs of individuals or whatever, it now is a rare occurrence. I hope it might not and should not happen in the future.  The point about the substance of amendment No. 4 &ldquo;threatened with homelessness within 28 days&rdquo; is in fact already covered in section 2 (a) of the legislation in relation to accommodation which a person &ldquo;can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of.&rdquo;  I know that will offend Senator Ryan, who will already have had the experience of some five or six years of tussling with the basic principles enunciated in this legislation and that he will be familiar with contributions made here and in other places and the reasons put forward in a substantive way for supporting a particular point of view.  But, at the risk of offending his sensibilities in these matters, I will have to say that the question which is the substantive thing in his amendment is already covered for in section 2 (a).  That was deliberately drafted in the broad terms &mdash; and in the 1985 Bill as well &mdash; and I have retained that broad wording in order that a housing authority may use their new powers under section 10 in as flexible a way as possible.  That caters for the point made by Senator Ferris, and indeed by Senator Norris as well, in that emergencies can now be attended to effectively under another section of this Bill and that matter is being conceded by Senator Ryan.  I think he has referred to it in a previous way, if not in public as I am sure he will later on, but he certainly has conceded the point in private that that is a most forward thinking section of the legislation and he will be generous in that matter in due course.  It was with a view to ensuring that the emergency elements could be catered for effectively that I retained what I regard as suitable wording in so far as section 2 (a) is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out as well that the main objective of the provisions of the Bill regarding the homeless is to provide new powers to housing authorities for dealing with the relatively small number of persons who are actually homeless and may require urgent action <Col N="1538" /> outside the normal system of allocation of local authority housing.  I know that that remark about a limited number of people will immediately draw fire from certain Senators in regard to establishing what is the total number regarded as homeless in this country.  But I shall not be drawn on that matter this evening, be assured of that.  Persons who may lose their accommodation in the near future may apply for and be offered local authority accommodation in the normal way &mdash; and, of course, without having to become homeless in the process &mdash; and that I think is one of the fundamental points made by contributing Senators.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that in so far as is possible, persons can, without becoming homeless, apply and be given accommodation by a housing authority.  The proposed amendment appears to ignore the fact that persons threatened with eviction or homelessness for any other reason are, and have been in the past, housed by housing authorities for many years under the existing legislation and under previous housing codes.  That is the position, and Senator Doyle admits that. That position is already proven and established. That makes my case as for not supporting the amendment.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, while persons who are not in fact homeless should apply for and have their needs assessed in the normal way, housing authorities will be able to use these new powers under section 10 to deal with cases of threatened homelessness where appropriate and not solely homelessness that is threatened in a period of 28 days.  Why would I include in legislation a named day where one might be threatened with homelessness? Whether it is two days, 12 days, 28 days or indeed six months, that is not my concern. My concern is that it has been the practice, is the practice and will continue to be the practice that if a person is threatened they can be accommodated by a housing authority under this legislation, and particularly under the provisions of section 10 which give a new impetus to the housing authority and that extra framework of authority to deal with the question of homelessness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> May I deal with the substance of amendment No. 5 as well as it might be the most suitable way of dealing with this. I must oppose that amendment for a very good reason.  I feel it is unnecessary.  I put this point to Senator Norris, that persons who cannot reasonably remain in occupation of accommodation are already covered in the definition in section 2 (a). I refer him to the definition in the legislation. Persons suffering violence or the threat of violence in the family home cannot reasonably remain in the accommodation. I will go so far as this, Senator Norris, that in the issuing of guidelines to local authorities and housing authorities I will point that out to them, the clear, unambiguous terminology in the guidelines. That can only happen, of course, when the Bill is enacted; but it is important to have it addressed here and stated here that it will be the case.</P>
    <P>The definition of a homeless person is in general terms, and I deliberately want it to be in general terms.  It covers all the categories of need rather than attempting to include specific categories, such as victims of family violence, travellers or persons with institutional background, single persons or any other group.  I would rather not get into naming specific categories in legislation.  It is much more useful for housing authorities &mdash; I think Senator Ferris has already agreed with me on this point &mdash; to take a general view where they can cater for any particular category and to deal with their needs and requirements accordingly.  People in any one of a whole list of categories may or may not be homeless, of course.  I consider that it is preferable to define homelessness simply in relation to accommodation not being available to a person, regardless of any other label or description that someone may wish to attach to that person.  I am not interested in labelling people in this legislation.  That would be offensive.  It would certainly be offensive to my sensibilities in the matter. I would ask you to take that in good faith.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am satisfied that the matters referred to by Senator Ryan and others are catered for very adequately in <Col N="1540" /> section 2 (a).  First, I take it that the kind of people they are talking about could not reasonably be expected to continue in the accommodation and consequently they can be accommodated by the legislation. Second, it is not a requirement, as some people seem to misunderstand, that you have to be homeless in order to be housed by a housing authority.  That is not so.  Third, the question about an emergency is adequately dealt with and catered for in section 10.  That being the case, I would respectfully suggest to somebody whom I do not regard as an amateur in these matters, Senator Ryan, that he might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 11, (1) (c).  The problem with that section is that it refers to schemes for priorities for letting local authority dwellings.  I would advise the Minister not to go too far in quoting private conversations.  I have had a long number of private conversations with the Minister about this issue as well as I do not want to get involved in my recollections of private conversations any more than I want to get involved in his recollections of private conversation.  We will leave the conversations to what is said on the public record if the Minister is happy with that?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, since he was not talking about me &mdash; I am not sure whom he was talking about but he clearly was not talking about me &mdash; so we can leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the recognition of emergency accommodation because I had an unfortunate experience with Cork Corporation some time ago, ten years ago, in which somebody was recommended for emergency accommodation and all sorts of procedures were gone through. The recommendation was made and then Cork Corporation announced that they had no provision for emergency accommodation and the whole thing turned out to be a kind of a farce.  The provision for emergency accommodation applies only to a scheme of priorities for local authority lettings.  Therefore, the question of emergency accommodation does not arise in the context of the powers &mdash; we will come to take at considerably greater length later on &mdash; which local authorities may use under section 10.  Section 10 applies to people who are homeless.  It does not apply to the question of emergency accommodation.  Emergency accommodation is referred to in terms of local authority lettings, not in terms of the general powers which, if they were used, would be quite useful under section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing is that the emergency accommodation provisions refer only to local authority lettings.  They do not apply to other areas and therefore one has a certain uncertainty about them.  Having said that, having listened to the Minister and being the reasonable man I am, I think the Minister has actually made a good case that the concern, particularly about violence, is fairly well implied in the legislation.  I wanted to make sure that it was made clear.  Since the Minister has undertaken to make guidelines available which will interpret it as such to the housing authorities, I do not think, being the reasonable man that I am, that I could pursue the amendment about violence, <Col N="1542" /> given the commitments that he has made. I will have enough things to pursue later on anyway so I do not necessarily want to pursue that one.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of people being threatened with homelessness, the Minister was less than serious when he made an issue out of the 28 days.  If the Minister wants to make it 365 days, I will be the first to support him.  There is no problem about the number of days.  I was endeavouring, and I am sure the Labour Party were also, to identify a reasonable period of time.  I am not happy that what he says is intended is as clear from the legislation as he would wish it to be. The question of &ldquo;reasonably remain in occupation of&rdquo; is a peculiar choice of words.  It would raise questions about people who were being evicted, for instance, by a building society.  What is reasonable in that case?  What procedures do they have to go through?  It does not guarantee an interpretation.  It is one thing to say &mdash; I agree with the Minister here &mdash; that reasonable people would assume that somebody who is threatened with violence could not reasonably be expected to continue to live there.  People are being forced to go through long rigmaroles of court procedures when they are being evicted.  People who have lost their jobs have written to me outlining their endeavours to fight off eviction and then being presented with a bill for £300 or £400 for the building society's costs in trying to evict them.  They are faced not only with the indignity of losing their house but with building society costs as well.  At what stage do the housing authority get to the stage where they reasonably believe that the person can no longer reasonably occupy the accommodation? I think there is a case for defining the term &ldquo;threatened with homelessness&rdquo;.  Having said that I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt.  It is a matter for the Labour Party what they wish to do but I do not propose to push either of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the Minister's response.  As a member of a local authority I am looking forward to <Col N="1543" /> seeing the guidelines that the Minister will be laying down for local authorities. I will peruse them to make sure that they meet the requirements.  The Minister considers that section 2 (a) will cover the two areas that we were worried about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be foolish in the sense that I may be opening the Minister's eyes to a meaning of this that may not be intended.  It appears to me that section 2 is written as if a person has no accommodation &mdash; not if he or she had a previous history of accommodation &mdash; available.  For instance, if an Irish person returns from Britain and it is impossible to check up their previous accommodation history, the housing authority have no option but to regard that person as homeless.  A person who is discharged from a hospital and has no accommodation because of that is automatically homeless, irrespective of whether the person is mentally ill or mentally handicapped or has another complaint.  In other words, the simple fact that a person has no accommodation means that a local authority have to classify that person as homeless, irrespective of anything else.  I am interested in that because it is, as far as it goes, a broadening of the definition of who comes under the aegis of the housing authority as far as being homeless is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tease this out a bit further because it is extremely <Col N="1544" /> important.  There is going to be no exclusion of people because they are mentally handicapped, or because of any other previous history, from being defined as homeless and therefore included for housing assessment purposes and for all the other things contained in this Bill.  If people need support services or various other things that might be a function of a health board but are categorised as being homeless, and therefore coming under the aegis of the housing authority, will the Minister explain how he understands that a housing authority are going to make provision for those people?  I do not think that section 10 (1) (a) goes into anything like the detail that many people would have thought, if we are talking about people who need perhaps intensive support in any sort of accommodation they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help commenting on the peculiarity of us passing into law something which is already abolished. I find it a peculiar confusion of organisation that we are actually legislating for something which no longer exists.  I appreciate that it is not quite gone yet.  I think &mdash; and this is all I want to say on it &mdash; that the Houses of the Oireachtas would do their own image a lot of good if we did not end up in the rather peculiar position of actually, as we are on section 4, legislating for something that is already abolished.  I do not think it makes any sense and I do not think it is the way a legislative Assembly ought to be asked to operate.  Governments ought either to find ways of operating <Col N="1545" /> within existing legislation or produce the legislation before they do things like that and not leave us in the quite ridiculous position of legislating for something that has been already abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan, one has difficulty in trying to comprehend this.  I would like to put it into context. There are applications for the £5,000 grant at present from people who have not yet completed their new houses.  They have been approved for this grant.  There is a contract between the Minister, the Department and the applicant and because the application was made while the grant was still in operation, although not yet paid, these grants will continue to be paid when the local authority house is surrendered under the scheme and when the other house is completed for the applicant.  There was a valley period in between the application and the abolition of the scheme.  There are still grant applicants who have not moved but have a formal approval for the £5,000 grant if and when they surrender the local authority house.  From that point of view, I think it is appropriate that we should refer to it and put it on record that there are still people in that transition situation.</P>
      <P>In passing, let me say that in spite of all the criticism of this scheme, it assisted people to try to better themselves if they could, and they did.  This released local authority houses back into the housing stock and this allowed the local authority to complete their housing list or to allocate houses to people on the list who had not been allocated a house.  It served a very useful purpose but many people criticised it because they said all the best people left, leaving areas with social problems and so on.  We are living in a free society and people who want to better themselves as they consider fit should not have had any aspersions cast on them for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to express my dissatisfaction at the cancellation of the scheme and to put on the record of the House that there are still people who will benefit by way of £5,000 <Col N="1546" /> when they carry out the contract that they have with the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed by Senator Ferris.  I think the scheme was a success and enabled a number of people to buy a house in their own area.  But in inner city areas &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; it gave people an opportunity to move from overcrowded flats, where they did not have sufficient points to get a local authority house and to buy a house of their own in the area. That was one of the best social advantages of that scheme.  Any time I have had an opportunity to speak on it, I have asked the Minister if he would consider re-introducing such a scheme for dwellers of flat land only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision was included in the 1985 Bill and had that legislation run its race to a conclusion, then the matter would not be before us.  Because of the peculiarities attached to the non-passage of that proposed legislation, it now falls to Deputy Flynn to rectify the situation in everybody's interests.  That is really what I am doing here.  I am regularising a situation that has persisted for some time.</P>
      <P>It raises the interesting point that when grant forms and new types of grants are announced by Government and by Ministers, if one had to wait for their implementation until the necessary legislation was totally in place it might take some considerable time thereafter and consequently many people might not support the point of view being put forward here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I take the point that it is always desirable to have the legislation cleared by the Oireachtas as early as possible in these cases.  Time constraints and schedules of legislative proposals do not often allow it to happen that way. However, I think the blame &mdash; if that is the proper term &mdash; for the tardiness in clearing up this matter is well known to Senators.  To put Senator Ferris' mind at ease, those that have been approved for surrender grants in the normal way and are still awaiting the final transfer, will <Col N="1547" /> be accommodated and money has been provided to enable that to take place.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate this evening to go into the pros and cons as to the usefulness or otherwise of that surrender grant.  There are certainly two points of view and I hold one which is somewhat at variance with that of Senator Ferris in that I think the £5,000 grant was a disaster.  It led to a breakdown of many communities in many estates and only now, because of a recent survey that I undertook myself, are we beginning to restore a level of uniformity and support that existed in communities before the £5,000 grant was introduced.  It did not help existing communities when it deprived those communities of those who were best able to afford the accommodation and often the leaders of the community were enticed out into better accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything derogatory about those who found it possible to move up-market and to improve their position in life but it certainly diminished the capacity of the communities that were left behind in dealing in a community way with many of their problems.  The situation is somewhat restored now.  I do not want to refer to any particular books or written references to the matter but you will find support for my point of view being expressed by leaders in the communities so affected and also by commentators who would not be regarded as amateurs in writing about homelessness and about local authority estates.  It is in a book I have here but I cannot give the exact reference and consequently I do not want to put it on the record.  It is generally believed now that the £5,000 surrender grant, while it achieved something in so far as making more housing available to local authorities did not achieve better balance of community life in the estates.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Kelleher.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the motion in the names of the Fine Gael Senators, that the Seanad calls on the Government to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations of national lottery funds will be made and disbursed, I have no doubt from my travels around the country and in talking to people and to beneficiaries under this scheme, that they would prefer if there was an independent, autonomous body responsible for the disbursement of these funds.  First of all, the funds are very welcome.  Secondly, those of us who were involved in putting the legislation together which made the funds available, want to be crystal clear in saying that we have no objection whatsoever to the various sporting and cultural organisations that have benefited. But there is a perception that in some way the national lottery is being used and disbursed otherwise than in accordance with the relative legislation.  That is understandable because all the announcements that are made about allocations from these funds are made by Deputies and Ministers and Ministers of State from the Government party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been an acceptable procedure for a long time in connection with the allocation of grants and various other allocations of Government funds given out under certain Department Votes and subheads.  There is a belief abroad that the national lottery funds, because of the <Col N="1549" /> very special way in which the lottery was set up and the way in which the Government have come to have them available to spend, this particular disbursement of funds should not be seen as a Government function.  We have the Government announcing an allocation purporting that it comes from Government funds which it does not and announcements being made by people associated with Government as if an allocation was from Government funds &mdash; which it is not &mdash; obviously being informed through the offices of those who have the facility and the information available to them when the allocations are decided.  That is, as I understand it, the nub of the motion.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael group want to remove allocations from the political arena because this money is not secured through political decisions.  This money is secured because people support the national lottery which is run by the National Lottery Board and they advise Government as to the amount of money available for disbursement in grants.  I understand there is an application process which is dealt with by the Minister for State in the Department of Education. The Taoiseach's Department, I think, has the overall responsibility.  The widespread condemnation throughout the country of the manner in which the grants are announced has led to demands that somehow there should be an independent voice, opinion and authority, not alone to look at the applications but to announce them so that all of us can feel part of the distribution of these funds as all of us were part of initiating the legislation and as all of us are contributors in some way or another to the coffers of the funds.  That being so, it is certainly outside the area of the privileged few who know about the information and those of us who have a right to know also, as part of the legislative body that set up the procedure.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed the allocations to several sporting and cultural bodies within my own constituency.  There is no suggestion that anybody on any side of the House is questioning the eligibility of some of the beneficiaries of these funds. <Col N="1550" /> It is the process that is used to allocate them and to announce the allocations. They are definitely being used by politicians for political purposes, which is not what the funds were intended to be used for.  If that were the case, people could assume that this lottery was a further extension of the taxation system, which is a political instrument.  The funds from taxation go into the coffers of the Government and are dispensed by the Government on the basis of the need in particular areas or communities for capital works, local authority funding and other such projects.</P>
    <P>I regard the national lottery funds as the property of everybody and as such their disbursement should be above any question of political interference and allocations should certainly be announced outside the political structure presently being used by this Government for the allocation of the funds.  For that reason I and my colleagues would support the concept of forming an independent authority to do this.  It would benefit the Government and would probably benefit the national lottery in that it would have broader support from the public who have generously supported the lottery by their participation.</P>
    <P>Often the lottery has been criticised and people have made judgments about its morality or otherwise, but its success and the way people have responded to it has overcome any inhibitions that particular people might have had about participating in it.  I feel that the money that is becoming available for various schemes, money that would never have been available for these schemes were it not for the lottery, should be used and distributed as independently and as impartially as possible without the question mark that is being put against its distribution by various people throughout the country.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us in the names of the Fine Gael Members of the House is that Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations of national <Col N="1551" /> lottery funds will be made and disbursed. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Pat &ldquo;Cope&rdquo; Gallagher, not that this is his first time in the House, but it is the first time we are both performing at the one time, so to speak.  I am glad to see him and, indeed, I am particularly delighted to see the Minister here for this debate because he is one of the most useful disbursers of money that the lottery has found.  We are not too far behind in Donegal.</P>
      <P>Questions are raised about how the lottery moneys, not so much the projects they are being assigned to, are being determined and who makes the announcement.  That is basically the political debate that is going on.  Deputy Stagg was talking about how the projects are chosen.  I do not know if there is a specific form whereby one applies for moneys under the national lottery scheme and it might be useful if the Minister would either nod or give me an indication to continue in that line.  If there is a specific form, I am not aware of it; but I am aware of a number of deserving causes that have applied for funds to bodies such as Bord Fáilte and have not been in receipt of moneys while at the same time promoters of projects who have not applied anywhere for funds are being given funds.  This I cannot understand.</P>
      <P>The national lottery was set up under the Coalition Government and steered through the House by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  In his speech he said:</P>
      <P>...the Government have decided that the surplus of the lottery is to be applied to the benefit of sport and recreational facilities, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These will be the first purposes under this section to be listed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> It would be possible to specify such purposes in the Bill but the Government consider that this approach lacks flexibility; for example, the provision of national lottery resources to some areas not included in the list I have just <Col N="1552" /> mentioned would have to wait amending legislation.</P>
    <P>In a broad way he indicated how the funds would be distributed.  I want to mention one area; and I know the Minister would be aware &mdash; not that he plays golf &mdash; of Port Salon Golf Club.</P>
    <P>This club has applied for funds under almost every possible heading but it may not technically have applied for funds from the national lottery, not being aware of any specific form being required for such application.  To put it on the record, Port Salon Golf Club is one of the four founding member clubs of the Golfing Union of Ireland, the other three being Royal Dublin, Royal Portrush and Royal County Down, to the best of my knowledge.  We in Port Salon are part of the history of golf in this country.</P>
    <P>Port Salon Golf Club members recently saved that course from possible extinction by purchasing the golf club grounds.  In doing so they salvaged that club and in order to do that they conducted their own lottery or draw and raised a substantial amount of money. They have kept the club alive.  They are now proposing to build a club house. They are not looking for anything extravagant, but they are looking for something to which we could take the many golfing dignitaries that may come to us in two years' time to celebrate the centenary of the Golfing Club of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have already indicated in principle our willingness to host a fairly major golfing competition, but I am sure the Minister, no more than myself as a club member &mdash; indeed, as a former committee member, and past captain of the club &mdash; would like Port Salon members to be inviting the golfing dignitaries to change in the open winds of Lough Swilly.  We would like a club house.  We have applied to everybody where funds are available.  Unfortunately, we have not applied specifically before this to the national lottery because we were not aware if there was a specific form for that purpose.  I spoke to the Minister's colleague, Deputy Fahey, and I am now formally, through the Chair and this <Col N="1553" /> House, asking the Minister to take a personal interest in this matter.  If we could get some funds this year and a promise of some funds next year, we would not be slow to raise the money ourselves.</P>
    <P>I might stress that the social balance within our club is such that many of our members are not earners, good, bad or indifferent.  Despite the association of a certain social standing with golf in the past, many of our members who never were earners are privileged in that they were never involved in the social distinction that applies to membership of golf clubs; they play their golf and have been playing it.  The net effect is that the average income of our club members is relatively low and we would find it difficult to go back to the public to look for funds when we have already got quite a substantial amount of money to enable us to own the club and the course and to get it back into good shape.</P>
    <P>Today, I was on a deputation trying to retain a post office in the village of Ballindraith, County Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will, because what I am talking about is an independent authority to determine the manner in which the allocation of funds is made.  I would hope that if such an independent authority were in existence they would give some funds to keeping Ballindraith post office open.  Remember that Ballindraith post office is one of the possible outlets for selling national lottery tickets but unfortunately, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, the powers that be have decided to close Ballindraith post office.  Let me just say that the reason given for closing it is, basically that as a unit it does not make money.  There is no talk of the social implications of the closing of that post office &mdash; and remember that the funds are for social as well as other reasons.  There are serious social implications in the closing of the post office. A whole community can disintegrate without that post office.  The policy of <Col N="1554" /> closing small schools right around the country has sadly affected rural areas.</P>
      <P>I am asking Deputy Gallagher, as Minister of State, to impress upon his colleagues and his senior Cabinet Ministers that they should endeavour to persuade the semi-State body, An Post, not to close small rural post offices simply because they may not be money-makers. I think it would be a sad day if that were the criterion to be used &mdash; we close the shop because that shop does not pay.  I hope and I know that the Minister will take cognisance of what I have just said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific point of the independence of the authority, I am not sure if it is possible to have an independent authority at any time, because the Government of the day would have to set up the independent authority, and we all know that people in Ireland are so politically tuned in, and rightly so, that it would be difficult to form an independent authority of any kind in our country, except in County Donegal where we have a number of variants of Independents.  I would advocate, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that there should be set up an authority of county councillors and members of other local authorities because our councillors have, for some years, been starved of funds.  When you are starved of funds, you are starved of power and our councillors are starved of that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our councillors at the end of the day represent the people on the ground and inasmuch as we are elected to this House, we in turn represent them, so that perhaps we are more representative than the other House.  I have no doubt that if the power were to be given to an independent body comprising largely of members of local authorities you would get a balanced view because by the very nature of the balance of local authority areas, each side of the House is represented.  When a group of people would come together within a particular electoral area to advocate that funds be allocated to a particular scheme, it would only be when you had <Col N="1555" /> the total support of the members in that electoral area that it would warrant serious consideration.  In our local authorities, when giving out amenity grants and such other grants, we do not do it foolishly.  These funds are allocated wisely; they are allocated to deserving causes.  I have no doubt that if this independent authority were to comprise of local authority members, that in itself would give it its independence provided the local authority members came from each and every side of the political divide.</P>
    <P>There is concern abroad and the Chair will be aware of that concern.  I know the Minister would be aware of the opposite to that concern.  It is nice &mdash; and I suppose it is part of being in office &mdash; to have the chance of announcing the allocation of grants.  I am not so sure that the Minister's colleague, Deputy Connaughton, would be equally pleased with the method of announcing the grants.  We, on this side of the House call on the Government, therefore, to establish an independent authority.  I, as a Member of this side of the House, ask that the independent authority be comprised largely, if not totally, of local authority members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by concurring with my colleague, Senator Loughrey, in his call for the involvement of local authority members on an independent commission that would be set up.  I was glad he got back from the post offices to get on to that line because when I came in first I did not know what was going on, but I would certainly concur with his concluding remarks asking that local authority members would have a say on this authority.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, I am a bit disappointed that the Minister of State with responsibility for Sport, my own colleague, Deputy Fahey, could not be here for the debate because I would prefer to cross swords with him than with Deputy Gallagher.  I am sure the Minister of State will understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must establish the fact about the <Col N="1556" /> national lottery.  The national lottery was first set up and began running in February 1987.  It must be acknowledged here that it was the brainchild of the former Minister of State with responsibility for Sport in the previous Government, Deputy Donal Creed.  He first set it in motion, having come to the conclusion that we should have a national lottery of this type to cater for the needs of sport and sporting organisations throughout the country. It was expected, when the lottery was set up, that it would raise about £7 million in the first year and it was stipulated that this money would be spent mainly on sport.</P>
    <P>The income from the national lottery in the first year far exceeded the wildest expectations when the sale of tickets in the lottery exceeded £70 million.  After administration costs and prize money there was a fund of over £45 million to be allocated.  Most of this was to be allocated to sport with some going to the Department of the Environment &mdash; about £6 million &mdash; in amenity grants; some allocated to the Department of Health and some to the Department of Social Welfare.  All that legislation and planning was correct when the lottery was established.</P>
    <P>This motion asks that Seanad Éireann call upon the Government to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations of the national lottery funds will be made and distributed.  It is signed by myself and my Fine Gael colleagues.  The motion was put down because it is obvious to anybody that the system of distribution of national lottery funds is being abused by the present Government.  It is not the system of allocating that is being abused, but the system of announcing the allocations that I submit is being abused.  I regret to say that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has been part of that abuse as well.  That is why I am sorry he is not here.  I would say now to Fianna Fáil Ministers and TDs that the game is up because the manner in which the grants are being announced is unacceptable.  Political strokes should not be tolerated in the allocation of those funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Huge cash grants, money which belongs to us all and which should be distributed according to the most stringent rules, should not be exploited by politicians in the greedy interest of personal political advancement.  The Government decide an allocations and, while that may not be the best position, it is not the cause of real controversy.  The reason for the controversy is due to the haste of Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members to go back to the constituencies to announce the goodies. This is bringing the lottery into disrepute. Some members of the Government party seem to think that this money is a personal re-election slush fund.  In constituencies where there are two Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; for example, Limerick East &mdash; there is strong competition between the Ministers in announcing grants and one is trying to best the other.  In North Tipperary there are also two Ministers.  I understand from people in that area that, if one Minister announces a grant one week for a particular organisation in a parish, the following week, the other Minister announces a grant for a different organisation in the parish.  That is bringing the whole aspect of the national lottery into disrepute.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are two Ministers of State.  I must acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, a neighbour of mine, does not seem to have stooped to the low level of trying to pretend that the money is being personally given by herself.  Perhaps she is not informed as quickly as she should be of the allocations within her constituency.  The same does not apply to the other Minister of State in the constituency, Deputy Francis Fahey who is Minister with responsibility for Sport.  He does not make announcements publicly. He has a different system from the Ministers in other constituencies.  For example, if a grant is announced in a place like Turloughmore, he does not make any publicity about it but he writes to everybody in the area telling them that he has allocated a grant to their sports complex, their GAA project or whatever <Col N="1558" /> the case may be.  That is a gross abuse of his position.</P>
    <P>Of course, I acknowledge that the places getting the grants are all entitled to them and I am sure they will put the money to good use.  The argument I have against the system is that it should not and must not be seen that somebody is giving this money out personally.  That was never the intention when the national lottery was set up.  It is most extraordinary that a Minister would do that. It is time that an end was put to this codology because people are now seeing through it.  If it is continued it may be damaging to the whole concept of the national lottery and the good that this lottery money can do.</P>
    <P>I would urge Senators to support this motion &mdash;&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations of national lottery funds will be made and disbursed&rdquo;. There would be a lot of merit in that type of an independent authority having members of county councils and local authorities on their board.  Those people have a say in the spending of amenity grants within their counties and there are no better people to establish the needs of their areas in this regard.  If this independent authority is set up, and I believe it should be, the local authorities should be involved.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to listen to the comments from the other side of the House on the national lottery.  One would think that nobody abuses the system only the present <Col N="1559" /> Government.  The Government are doing a very good job with the national lottery and the funds are allocated in a very reasonable way.  Nobody should criticise it because many projects in this country would never have got off the ground were it not for the national lottery.  I want to put it on record that I was the one politician who proposed the national lottery as far back as 1979.  At the time I put down a motion on it at the General Council of County Councils and it went further up along the line.  I had a different idea about the national lottery then.  I felt that it should be more localised and that each county should allocate the funds in the way they saw fit.  I will be putting that proposal to the Minister later.</P>
      <P>We are listening this evening to criticisms about whether two Ministers or one Minister is announcing grants for certain areas.  In my constituency of North Kerry there was no Fine Gael Minister or TD during the last Government but there was a Fine Gael Senator.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if the other side of the House can name one project which got money from the <Col N="1560" /> national lottery and did not dispose of it. It is about time they stopped cribbing, because it is a good scheme.  I would like to see the national lottery extended perhaps to the United States, England, Australia and other places so that the funds would be increased.  Many sports facilities would not have been developed were it not for the national lottery.  It has done much good for this country.  I would like to see the national lottery in future years extended from the sports area when that has been developed.  The national lottery should take on a new role.  It should be put to use in other areas and should not be confined rigidly to sports facilities.  If there must be criticism in this House let it be honest criticism.  I would ask the other side of the House to stop cribbing about something that has worked very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions for the Minister and I am glad he is here to answer them.  One of them might be a bit irrelevant at the moment.  The first question I wish to ask is: why did Leitrim fare so badly from lottery funding? Is the funding based on population or on political clout?  I have no doubt that the Minister is one of the strongest political people in the State.  He represents the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. I was amazed to find that we ended up, as we usually do, near the bottom of the pile as regards State aid from the national lottery funding.  If the allocation is based on population, we are the lowest populated county and unfortunately that population is decreasing.  Governments have a social obligation to help a poor county.  That can only be done by funding through State agencies.  Leitrim, per head of population, has put as much money into the national lottery as any other county and the size of our population should be taken into consideration.  We have not got a very strong economic base and we need a lot of State aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not crying that Leitrim needs all the money it can get from central Government.  We have many positive projects and the Minister is aware of them.  For example, there is one cultural <Col N="1561" /> project in my county that has not received any funding from the national lottery. That is a pity because it is an excellent project &mdash; the provision of a drama theatre in Carrigallen.  It was thought that that type of cultural activity would be funded through the national lottery.  The local community have raised a lot of money and have put a lot of hard work into the provision of this theatre.  The Government should give the community the credit due to them by providing financial assistance.  This would help immensely in the provision of a theatre in Carrigallen, the only one in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Another project that could benefit immensely and that could put up pound for pound is Ballinamore Golf Club.  It has been in existence for a number of years but only in the past few years has it started to expand.  Excellent club facilities have been built.  If that club were given funding for which they have submitted an application through the national lottery, they would make great use of it.  One project in Leitrim for which money was received from the international fund is the indoor swimming pool and complex at a hotel outside Ballinamore. This was a very welcome grant. It is this type of grant aid that will help communities to flourish and to have the facilities that will attract people.  The Government should reconsider the way they allocate money to communities.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal specifically with one area of funding by the national lottery, that is, grant aid for outstanding sportspersons.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Sport is not here, as a colleague of mine has already stated.  This scheme was introduced in July 1986 and the first allocation was made in September of that year.  The scheme has not been asked for and a suggestion of this nature had never been made at any meeting of the Irish Federation of Sports Bodies between 1983 and 1986, nor was such reported in the press as having been put forward at the annual general meeting of any national sports body.  Theoretically, the idea behind such a scheme is good but in practice it would appear <Col N="1562" /> difficult, if not impossible, to operate fairly.  Variations of this abroad can be used, and indeed some might be particularly applicable to the situation in Ireland where facilities are not equitably distributed.</P>
    <P>The State has provided two sports tracks in Dublin, two in Cork and one in Limerick, while Tullamore Harriers have provided an excellent private facility.  It is clear from this that athletes in many parts of the country are severely handicapped. Some have to travel well over 100 miles to train on the modern tracks. Financial aid to offset this would be very helpful.  In some countries very young performers who have achieved a certain set of standards are provided with special help.  Financial aid should be provided for persons who have achieved selection for certain major events such as world championships so that they could make adequate preparation in training and competition during the time leading up to the event.  Aid should be provided to performers on the basis of having achieved a pre-set standard in their events. There might indeed be room for a social welfare angle, with an aid being provided for those with talents who are socially or financially disadvantaged.  The operation of such a scheme with these parameters would require some clear ground rules visible to all potential applicants, with perhaps a certain discretion in regard to borderline cases.  There are no such definite guidelines published.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal specifically with one athlete who comes from Ballinamore, Mrs. Patricia Griffin, and I think the Minister will be aware of her success.  Before I state what Mrs. Griffin has achieved as an athlete&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is an airport. That is a sad reflection.  On Sunday, 19 June Mrs. Griffin won the Millennium mini-marathon in Dublin.  She was 38 seconds ahead of her nearest rivals which is a lot in any track or field event. This year she came ninth in the National Cross-country Championships in Ballyhaise and she also finished 39th in the world championships in Adelaide, Australia, which was a very creditable performance.  She trains twice a day, three times a week.  She has to go to Tullamore, which is 140 miles round trip, to train and she gets no expenses for this. That is the nearest tartan track available. She also has to go to a cinder track in Lanesboro, which is a round trip of 80 miles.  As the Minister and everybody else will be aware, this is very costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Griffin is a member of the Ballinamore Athletic Club, which has had some very successful athletes who have represented this country at world championship and Olympic events.  There are 150 members in that club, most of them in the age group of eight to 18; but, unfortunately, the athletic club does not have enough money to provide the type of costs that Mrs. Griffin would incur in her training.  She made an application in July 1987 under the Department of Education scheme for grants to outstanding sportspersons, but to date she has not received an acknowledgement. Unfortunately, and much more importantly, she has not received any money. She has a very good case.  I would be slow to highlight one individual above anybody else but I feel strongly about this case.  Mrs. Griffin has represented her country and her county at the highest level and she has been successful.  As a representative for the same constituency, I ask the Minister to inquire from the Department whether she would be entitled to grant aid in the near future. Mrs Griffin hopes to represent Ireland in the Seoul Olympics in the 10,000 metres event.  She has three more races to run this year.  She will be the first lady from Connacht to represent us at that distance in the Olympic games.  She has a record <Col N="1564" /> and a case which would entitle her to State funding.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls for the setting up of a body to distribute national lottery funding. Senator Loughrey made the case that members of local authorities should be members of this committee.  I say that with tongue in cheek.  Some people would say it is open to political abuse at the moment and I am sure if there were local authority members on that board they would say the same thing.  Unfortunately, there are cases for money which is being made available from the national lottery which seem to be open to political abuse.  This is not doing the national lottery any good and it is not doing politicians any good.  I would be in favour of a special board being set up, at the discretion of the Government, to provide funding from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate Mrs. Patricia Griffin on winning the Millennium mini-marathon.  I hope that after these few words, she might be compensated financially for all the hard work she has put in over the last number of years.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter which was discussed last week and again this week.  While I am not going to be parochial, I will respond to some points raised by Senator Reynolds.  I would like to be associated with the congratulations he has extended to Mrs. Griffin in relation to her successes.  A track is being provided in Connacht &mdash; in Galway &mdash; under the regional centres which I will be referring to later.  Obviously, one would be anxious to ensure that the drama theatre centre in Carrigallen would get consideration.  I will look into matters like the case the Senator raised in relation to Mrs. Griffin, who did not get a reply.  At least there should be <Col N="1565" /> a response to any queries that are made by individuals or on behalf of individuals or groups.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in March 1987, the national lottery has proved to be an enormous success and is now established as a colourful feature of everyday life. The response from the public to the lottery has been far in excess of our original expectations and their continuing support augurs well for its future success.  That this is the case is due in no small measure to the hard work and dedication of the National Lottery Company in guiding the lottery through its launch phase, in developing an imaginative series of instant games and, now, in consolidating its popularity with the launch of Lotto.</P>
      <P>The funds generated by the lottery are already having a measurable impact in terms of support for hundreds of individual projects throughout the country. To date, £71.5 million has been allocated in the areas of sport and recreation, youth, the arts, health and welfare, the Irish language and national culture. Many worthwhile projects are now in train thanks to the lottery and the effects of these will become more and more apparent in local communities as time goes on.  Were it not for the lottery, there is no doubt but that many, if not most, of these projects would not be getting off the ground.  This, for me, is the real success of the lottery &mdash; support for hundreds of worthwhile community-based projects throughout the length and breadth of the country, giving local communities a boost in the face of the many economic and other difficulties which beset them at present.  Funding for discretionary projects must inevitably be a low priority for any Government in terms of overall national expenditure priorities, given the current economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that we can be clear on the current method for allocating the lottery proceeds, I would like to explain how the system works.  In the first instance, it is a matter for Government to decide on the categories which will be eligible for lottery assistance.  The National Lottery Act, 1986, specifies that lottery proceeds <Col N="1566" /> are taken into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue and may be applied for the purposes of sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and the health of the community, and such other purposes as the Government may determine from time to time.  Any decision to add to the list of purposes for which the funds may be used must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Since the passing of the Act, the Government have decided to add youth, amenity and welfare to the list of beneficiary sectors.</P>
    <P>All proceeds from sales of national lottery tickets, less sales agents' commission and &ldquo;instant&rdquo; prizes payable by sales agents, are paid by the National Lottery Company into the national lottery fund, which is maintained in the Central Bank, under the control of the Minister for Finance.  The lottery company draws on this fund to cover (i) its operating costs and management fee as negotiated with the Minister and (ii) larger prize liabilities falling due.  The balance &mdash; the lottery surplus &mdash; is available to the Exchequer.  In practice, the Exchequer draws on the surplus only when funds are required for immediate disbursement to approved projects. Moneys accumulating in the national lottery fund earn interest which increases the level of funding available for projects.  The funds are channelled through the national lottery subhead in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance to suspense accounts operated by the spending Departments who are responsible for their administration.</P>
    <P>To date £24.2 million has been issued to Departments for spending on approved projects.  Once the Government have determined the broad allocation by programme of the national lottery surplus, the selection of individual projects within each area is decided upon by the relevant spending Minister.  Departments concerned have drawn up detailed procedures for inviting and processing applications for grants. Criteria such as the desirability of the proposed project, its cost-effectiveness, involvement of the local community, the <Col N="1567" /> availability of existing facilities of similar type in the area, and the number of jobs it is likely to create are all taken into account in the consideration of applications. As applications for project funding submitted to Departments are running well ahead of resources available to date, there is a process of selection involved which will inevitably result in many disappointed applicants.  All projects must, however, comply with the eligibility criteria laid down for the relevant schemes.</P>
    <P>That is a general outline.  Let me now illustrate how this process operates in practice for particular schemes, starting with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement last November of Government decisions on the allocation of the national lottery surplus, the Department of the Environment wrote to local authorities asking them to nominate suitable projects.  In the following weeks local authorities around the country put forward hundreds of projects.  In addition, up to 21 April, when the amenity grant allocations were announced, hundreds of other projects were brought to notice in written representations from Members of the Oireachtas on behalf of the promoters of particular projects and in applications made by the promoters of projects themselves, including residents' associations, community councils, local environment groups, and so on.</P>
    <P>All of these applications were taken into account in the Minister's determination of individual allocations under the amenity grants scheme.  When the decisions were made, over 2,000 requests for amenity grants to a value of £60 million had been received.  In such circumstances, the relatively small allocation of £6 million was bound to leave many applicants disappointed. Nevertheless, some 550 projects were approved for grants.  Even now, with the available funds allocated, grant applications continue to flow into the Department. The intention was, and still is, to ensure that funds are distributed on an <Col N="1568" /> equitable basis to all parts of the country. The fact that no county was left out of the grant allocations is testimony to the achievement of this objective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no formal application form required of those applying for an amenity grant.  However, a fact sheet was devised by the Department and arrangements were made in respect of each project to have this fact sheet completed and returned to the Department. The information supplied on each fact sheet comprises a general description of the project, commencement and completion dates, the name of the body carrying out the work, financial details and employment potential details.  The purpose of the fact sheet is to facilitate the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in administering the scheme and to provide the kind of detail that would be used later in the year when it comes to checking claims for payment of individual grants.</P>
      <P>In some cases, fact sheets were either not available at the time of the making of the allocations, or were not fully completed. This does not mean, as Senator Kelleher implies, that the Department of the Environment did not have applications for grants.  The initial, direct approaches to the Department by interested bodies and organisations and the lists of nominations submitted by the local authorities all constituted applications. How else can they be classifed? The fact sheets are part of the administrative follow-up instituted by the Department of the Environment.  Let me add that it is quite normal in the case of grant schemes to have to seek further information of one kind or another which may not be strictly necessary at the allocation stage but will be needed before payments can properly be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's letter to local authorities brought this fact to their attention and asked them to have these forms submitted as soon as possible.  This was to ensure that all parties would be operating <Col N="1569" /> with a clear understanding of the nature of the project which was being grant-assisted and to ensure that grants will be properly calculated and paid when the time comes.  This is what happened in the case of the 23 projects in the Dublin County Council area to which Senator Kelleher referred.  Let me say that there are also projects in other counties which did not have completed fact sheets.</P>
    <P>In administering the lottery allocations, steps were taken in both the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education to prevent any overlap in assistance between the amenity grants scheme run by the former and the recreational facilities scheme administered by the latter.  This is relevant to the case of Kilnamanagh Community Centre referred to by Senator McMahon.  This project has already received nearly £160,000 in State funding mainly from the Department of Education.  The question of allowing further aid is under consideration at present in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Local authorities act as agents for the Department of the Environment in the administration of the funds made available for amenity purposes.  When the allocation decisions were made, each county or city manager was notified of the decisions on a county-at-large basis. The managers were asked to inform the successful applicants of their grant allocations and to brief them on the conditions of the scheme.  Local authorities will, in due course, certify that payment of the grants are in order.  On receipt of such a certificate, the Department will pay the local authority and, where the project has been executed by a body other than by the local authority themselves the local authority will pass on the amount of the grant to them.</P>
    <P>As to the Dublin Millennium grant, which is also administered by the Department of the Environment, the Government announced on 19 November 1987 that £700,000 of the national lottery surplus would be spent on projects and events associated with the Dublin Millennium. The projects or events earmarked for assistance had been drawn up <Col N="1570" /> by the Millennium company &mdash; Dublin Promotions Organisation Ltd. &mdash; and were submitted for Government decision by the Minister for the Environment following approval by the Cabinet sub-committee on the Millennium &mdash; of which the Minister for the Environment was chairman.  The projects were mainly in the area of arts and culture and in support of community efforts most of which would not attract commercial sponsorship. The £700,000 grant is channelled by the Department of the Environment on a phased basis to the Millennium company who are responsible for the subsequent expenditure.  The detailed allocation of funds is on the basis of a list of projects or events which were approved by the board of the Millennium company and submitted to the Minister for the Environment last January.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher also had some ill-judged comments to make on <i>per capita</i> comparisons between counties.  He referred to my own county of Sligo.  He cannot but have been aware that there is but one major project involved &mdash; a regional sports centre &mdash; which will benefit not just Sligo but also the surrounding counties in the north-west.  This is also true of the comments on the <i>per capita</i> figure for Dublin where many of the facilities being provided are for national rather than regional use.</P>
    <P>We have seen figures for averages in particular counties, whether it be Sligo, Galway or Dublin, but what is not being taken into full account by those who make allegations is that centres like Galway and Sligo are regional centres and have allocations on a regional basis outside the broad allocations of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education for amenities, youth and sport facilities.  Dublin has quite a number of national schemes included on a national basis.  If one looks at those figures one will find that in addition to allocations made from the Department of the Environment, and some from the Department of Education, in 1988, £600,000 was made available to Galway; £500,000 to Athlone; £500,000 to Cork; £300,000 to Waterford and <Col N="1571" /> £250,000 to Limerick; the Morton Stadium in Dublin, received £400,000; Sligo £300,000; Tallaght in Dublin £300,000 and Baldoyle in Dublin £100,000.  There is also the national centre which received £3 million and local centres in other towns and counties received £1.9 million in 1988.  The outdoor stadium received £750,000.  Those projects will proceed, thanks to the lottery.  The example of Sligo is used here, and in many other places, and the figure of £23 per head of population is quoted.  The allocations for 1988 show that with a population of 56,000 and a total of £711,000 going to Sligo the amount per head of the population was £12.70.  If one takes away the regional sports centre in that area one will find that the figure is nearly below the national average at £7.30 per head.  I was anxious to give that information to put the record straight.  I believe I am a fair man and I try to be fair in everything I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Reynolds referred to the other part of the constituency I represent, Leitrim, where we are making progress.  It may be that the reason there is a little more going to Sligo, or other counties, as against Leitrim is that there might not have been suitable projects available.  The lottery will go on for years to come and over the years Senators will find that we will not have sufficient projects throughout the length and breadth of the country to use up the surplus of the proceeds.</P>
      <P>Projects may be submitted this year, next year and the year after because the lottery, as I said at the outset, has been an enormous success.  We will have successive Governments and Departments having these resources, the people's money, to give back to the people, to their projects and communities.  That is what the lottery was set up for and that is why we are so heartened by the great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn now to the Department of <Col N="1572" /> Health who have responsibility for the £6 million allocated by the Government for services for the physically and mentally handicapped, services for the elderly, psychiatric services, community information and development services, Aids prevention services and provision of services for cases of child sexual abuse.  Proposals for projects came from the Department of Health, on the basis of their assessment of needs, and from health boards and voluntary agencies. Independent agencies requesting lottery funds were asked to forward full details of the organisation, including its aims and objectives, details of the proposed projects, the total finance required for the project and the funding requested from the lottery.</P>
    <P>Successful applicants were notified that payment would be made via their local health board on receipt by the health board of a written application from the agency for payment.  Where the projects are being undertaken by health boards themselves, the boards have been advised that the money may be spent only on the authorised project and that certification of expenditure must be submitted to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The largest single lottery allocation &mdash; £33.894 million &mdash; was made to the Department of Education and £20.75 was allocated for sport and recreation, £10 million for youth and £3.144 million for miscellaneous cultural and Irish language related grants.  The national lottery proceeds in these areas are funding important new initiatives such as the national sports centre and the regional sports centres programme together with many ongoing activities which had previously been funded through the Exchequer but which are now being expanded in the light of the additional funding available from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this stage how much I agree with Senator Fallon's remarks on the importance of the national sports centre concept.  The centre will embrace a major indoor multi-functional sports arena with ancillary accommodation together with a 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> The floor area in the arena will accommodate a six lane 200 metre track and a broad range of indoor sports to an international level, using, it is anticipated, changing floor finishes to meet varying surface needs.  The centre is being planned on the basis that its operation in due course will be to the maximum extent possible on a self-financing basis.  Constituting, as it will, the largest indoor resource available in the entire island it is intended to capitalise on its use for conferences, concerts, exhibitions and so on, in addition to its primary role of staging major athletic and sporting events.  The Government are aware of the valuable contribution this centre can make not alone in fulfilling its primary role as a national sports centre but in tapping the commercial potential of sport, in reaping the economic spin-off for tourism, and particularly in view of its location, in assisting the environmental and commercial renewal of inner-city Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education administer a capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities.  This scheme aims to promote greater leisure opportunities for the community by assisting local initiatives for the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities, excluding swimming pools and environmental works.  Both indoor and outdoor facilities qualify.  The scheme is presently restricted to facilities being provided by voluntary community organisations. It does not assist the purchase of sites or of premises.  Neither will a grant be awarded in respect of projects being grant-assisted by any other Government funding.  There are stringent requirements laid down governing security of tenure, adequate local financial support and the planning, construction and upkeep of the project.</P>
    <P>In the case of grants up to £15,000 grants are paid (a) on submission of certification that the project has been completed as originally planned or (b) on submission of certification that work to the value of twice the value of the grant has been completed in respect of the grant-aided work.  For grants over <Col N="1574" /> £15,000 payment is made following submission of architects' certificates, builders' invoices in respect of work completed.  Amounts of grant instalments relate to the value of grant-aided work completed.</P>
    <P>Similar to the experience with the Department of the Environment scheme, there have been many hundreds of applications for assistance &mdash; more than 900 in all &mdash; under the Education scheme for the provision of recreational facilities. Given an allocation of £4 million in 1988 for this scheme, it is obvious that not all applicants can be satisfied.  Nevertheless, so far over 250 projects have been approved for grants totalling almost £4 million throughout the length and breadth of the country and no county has been left out of grant allocations.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious from what I have just said that the processing of applications is, of necessity, a detailed task requiring considerable resources in terms of manpower and back-up office systems.  To the extent that this work is being done by those Departments concerned, the administrative costs of the scheme are not deducted from the lottery surplus itself, which would otherwise have to be the case and, hence, the full surplus is available for deserving projects.  In addition, the expertise of the Departments who are dealing with these areas and which has been built up over the years is brought to bear on judging the most deserving of applications.  I particularly welcome the fact that no Senator has questioned the entitlement to lottery funding of any of the projects being assisted.</P>
    <P>The proposition that decisions on the allocation of the lottery surplus should be taken out of the hands of the Government and given to an independent board may have a superficial allure at first sight but it does not stand up to closer scrutiny. Under existing procedures, there are detailed rules laid down to ensure proper financial accountability.  Issues from each Department's national lottery suspense account are audited in the same way as other public expenditure and are published in the Appropriation Accounts. <Col N="1575" /> Recipients of grants are required to submit audited accounts to the Department concerned after the end of the financial year and to provide a separate account of expenditure on the project for which the grant is given.  Where the grant represents the greater part of the total income of the grantee, the books and accounts of the grantee are to be made available, if required, for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Also, each Minister is directly answerable to the Oireachtas for decisions on the allocation of lottery funds coming within his or her area of responsibility.  If these responsibilities were to be passed to an outside agency or board, there would, in my view, be an unacceptable diminution in accountability to the Oireachtas for the expenditure of public funds contributed by the people of Ireland.  Senator Fallon has rightly pointed to the importance of this principle.</P>
    <P>Opposition Senators were critical of the role of Government Ministers, Deputies and Senators in contacting successful applicants.  Senators Fallon and O'Callaghan have, I think, rebutted these criticisms more than adequately but let me put it on the record that my Department have confirmed with the spending Departments concerned that no successful applicant has received funding to which he or she was not entitled under the criteria for the relevant schemes.</P>
    <P>Senators will also appreciate that the existence of an independent board to decide on lottery allocations will not of itself guarantee unquestioning acceptance for decisions on allocations.  For as long as applications for support exceed the level of funding available, there will always be disappointed applicants.  Irrespective of whether the deciding agency is a Government Department or an independent board, that disappointment may find expression in complaints about the decision making process.  Our present arrangements ensure the accountability of Ministers to the Oireachtas for their decisions.  This would cease to be the case were the responsibility to pass to an <Col N="1576" /> independent board.  The real issue is to ensure that public support for and commitment to the lottery continues to grow so as to generate a level of funding which will enable this, and future Governments, to provide support for community based initiatives in every county and parish of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In a discussion on something like the national lottery I do not know what is meant by an independent board.  We discussed three different independent boards under various pieces of legislation over the last week, one on foresty, one on broadcasting and I cannot think of the third one and as yet I do not know what makes a board independent.  As somebody on the cross benches, as it were, it is not of great relevance to me to which side of the House an independent board might owe their allegience.  I am far more interested in the accountability of money spent by the State.  For that reason, it is good that the discussion is taking place.  It is also good that both sides of the House are having &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at each other about how the surplus should be spent.  To me, the quote of the debate so far was made by a Government Senator who said, &ldquo;You would think nobody abused the lottery except the present Government&rdquo;.  I am not sure whether he meant to say that but that is precisely what he said at the time.</P>
      <P>It seems that this is all about accountability. The reason we are looking for an independent board related to accountability. The case made by the Minister for Finance was about accountability, by insisting that the money of the people is properly accounted for.  The argument can be made for and against what is independent and what is not independent; whether the Government are doing the right thing or otherwise.  I am more concerned about accountability and also the imaginative use of the money.  I want to raise a number of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that I have asked that at some time in the future &mdash; I hope tomorrow night &mdash; we should consider my proposal for the setting up of <Col N="1577" /> a pilot scheme for Telefís na Gaeltachta with funds from the national lottery.  It is something that has been adverted to by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions since he came into office.  I will leave a discussion on that topic until then.  I hope it comes at some stage.</P>
    <P>I missed part of the Minister for Finance's speech but in referring to the various Departments who were allocated money from the lottery funds, he may have referred to the Department of Communications. I have two pet interests, one I have just mentioned, Telefís na Gaeltachta, and local television of various types specifically pointed at people. The other is the setting up of a shortwave radio service.  I have said on a number of occasions in this House that we have had ample discussion on radio on various things that we need but I hope that in the spending of money the Department of Communications might investigate the possibility of setting up a shortwave radio service from this country.  I want to refer to some of the reasons why.</P>
    <P>Very recently we went through the &ldquo;write and invite&rdquo; scheme with the Department of Tourism and Transport to encourage people to come to Ireland on holidays.  A shortwave radio service which can get into people's houses, wherever they be, in Sydney, San Francisco or Moscow, could make a more direct impact.  Obviously, that could be developed at length.  Another reason would be diplomatic use of shortwave radio; it used to be called propaganda in the olden days and is now called diplomatic use.  This could be used for diplomacy matters, for putting across our point of view.  For a small nation we are very often in the focus of international attention and in putting forward our point of view on issues like Anglo-Irish affairs, the North of Ireland, the Birmingham Six and other national and international type matters, a shortwave radio service would be of immense use to us.</P>
    <P>At a time when emigration, regrettably, is running higher than it has done for years we have discussed on numerous occasions in this House the need for setting up support and advice services for <Col N="1578" /> those people.  Those people who are trying to protect themselves in other countries, whether it be New York, San Francisco or anywhere else, do not know where to turn for help.  Very often they are afraid to go to the Irish Embassy, unjustifiably so, but they are afraid to approach authority at any level.  A shortwave radio service would allow us talk to those emigrants when they have settled in other countries.  We can advise them, give them support, direction and some help.</P>
    <P>Another reason why a shortwave radio service would be useful would be to help us reach those people of Irish extraction who are in positions of power and influence or are wealthy in other countries to try to get them to re-invest here.  That could be done very successfully through a shortwave radio service.  I intend developing that suggestion of a shortwave radio service and putting it as a proposal to Government some time in the near future.</P>
    <P>Within Ireland there are some fairly imaginative schemes which might be considered by the Government.  In many cases this would, perhaps, make the case against an independent board, perhaps not.  There is also a political element in the decisions about allocating money for any kind of a project.  It is right that there should be a political element in it.  I do not mean political in the sense of strokes or grafts or anything like that, but it is very often a political decision where to spend and it should be a political decision. If one takes a project like &mdash; as the Minister for Finance is in the House &mdash; the Sligo-Limerick railway line I could not stand up, put my hand on my heart and say to the Minister for Communications that we should re-invest money in that because it would be a commercially viable proposition; it would not be. However, it would be very useful from a tourist point of view and would be useful in terms of building up local communities and connections between them in that area of Connacht.  Projects like that should be developed.  In other words, I am referring to projects that are larger than community based ones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I would like to expand on a point raised by Senator Reynolds in relation to support for sportspersons whether it would be through grants, scholarships or whatever. A beginning has been made in regard to this.  It should be of great value. If one thinks back over the last year or so one will recognise that as a nation we have proved beyond doubt how sports conscious we are.  We are absolutely indiscriminate in terms of the sports we follow.  It was completely wrong of that former Member of the Oireachtas to make comments about GAA supporters. They were totally false.  I am not going to develop that.  However, we have seen over the year the response to an Irish cyclist in France; the response to Eamon Coughlan and other athletes; the response to the Irish soccer team and the response to people in different sports, even boxing and Barry McGuigan.  A sporting success on the international front gives a lift to the nation.  The neighbourhood, or the county, get a lift when their representative does well.  We should look very carefully at this.  We need to spend money on a number of 50-metre pools.  We need to spend money on tartan tracks around the country, ones that will be used &mdash; there are a number that are not being used.  We need to support all that is best in the area of sport and to direct money in that general direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave details of the allocations to the different Departments, particularly to the Department of Education. I found it somewhat ironic that the Department of Education were handing out largesse on schemes which would be quite important &mdash; the Minister went through them and I do not have any objection to the areas in which the money will be spent &mdash; and that other Departments handed out money for local leisure centres which may be very good, but while all of this was happening the building fund for local schools was being halved.  I find that a bit ironic and a little cynical.  I would prefer to see national lottery money being channelled into the retention of local schools &mdash; when I say <Col N="1580" />&ldquo;retention&rdquo; I mean the retention of the roofs, the walls, the ceilings, the floors, the windows, the heating and lighting of those schools.  I am not talking about the retention of the teaching staff.  I feel there is a great national resource there.  This week I had the unpleasant duty of inspecting a school in the Dublin area which is about 30 years old.  It is just falling down because of lack of support.</P>
    <P>Looking over the various areas in which money might be spent, I do not have an objection &mdash; the Minister for Finance very cleverly said no Senator had objected to any of the projects for which money had been allocated.  I am sure he is right.  I cannot see any politician objecting to money being spent on his or her own constituency.  I think it is absolutely incorrect &mdash; and this is the point that I would make &mdash; that the local Government politicians are informed first.  I would like to hear somebody from the Government side or the Opposition side of the House justify that practice to me.  It is incorrect.  It is no more than buying votes.  I see no justification for it. It is wrong and it should be clearly seen to be wrong.  It is little more than graft. This happened in the last Government as well.  I am not applying this to the Fianna Fáil Party or any particular party.  This is the way Governments work.  I have seen it down through the years.</P>
    <P>It is wrong.  It is not right that public representatives of the Government party should get first information on a project in order that they can go and tell those people a day or two days before everybody else so that they might get the credit for the success of that particular project. The only reason it is done is so that they claim the credit for it.  If they can claim the credit for it and if they are claiming the credit for it, then the system is rotten, it is bent and it is political strokes.  If it is done properly and correctly people are only getting what they are entitled to get.  Then they should get it from the Department, they should be informed by the Department, and that is the line that it should go on.</P>
    <P>For that reason, and for that reason only, I will be supporting this motion <Col N="1581" /> tonight, not because I think an independent board is a better way of managing the money.  In fact, I think the Minister for Finance made a very strong argument that it was not the best way of managing the money.  It is not for that reason, but I am sickened to my teeth of this.  I see it happening in schools.  A school is granted an extra teacher to which they are entitled.  The local TD is told and he goes down and tells the school authorities.</P>

      <P>Or the local Senator, or whatever and he tells the schools authorities. The local football club get a grant and the local TD is sent down to tell them.  It demeans the job of public representative. It gives the impression that the country is bent; it is an insupportable activity.  I say this equalhandedly in respect of both sides of the House.  My only reason for supporting this motion tonight is because it would stop that despicable and insupportable practice.</P>
      <P>People can make all the comments they want, but I would dearly like to hear somebody defend that.  I would compliment Senator Kiely on what he said.  He said it is being done by all sides.  I agree with him.  Is it not time to call a halt to it?  This is money that is there; it is not handouts.  It is not a question of the local TD grafting and giving. It was as bad in the last Government and the example was given.  It is only a short step before they start handing out single pound notes and saying &ldquo;There is your grant&rdquo; or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with those words that I would conclude my remarks.  I do consider it as a form of extra taxation.  It is the worst kind of extra taxation.  If I had my choice I would not have a national lottery at all. There should be a fair system of taxation which would pay for the proper projects out of central funds collected by due taxation. This is an attraction to the poor. The people who mainly spend money on buying these tickets are people who do not have money for other things.  It creates a false hope, the illusion of sudden <Col N="1582" /> wealth.  It appeals to the greed in people, which we all have to some extent.  It worries me.  I feel sad when I see people in local shops, who can ill-afford it, not spending money on other things so that they can spend a few bob on the national lottery.</P>

      <P>If this motion has served no other purpose it certainly has evoked from the Minister for Finance a very fine exposition of the programme, where the money has been spent and the general allocation of it.  For that we must be extremely grateful.  Personally, I have no great grouse with the Minister or the Government on the allocation of this fund.  I must declare an interest, as chairman of the Ryder Foundation.  We applied for two projects and we were successfully grant aided for our social development in Owning, County Kilkenny, and Ballyroan, County Laois. I very much appreciate the help and the boost that kind of funding gives to voluntary organisations.  The only point that I should like to make, and make very strongly, is in regard to the distribution of the fund.  The lottery fund is new, and I want to compliment all associated with the management of the lottery because it has been eminently successful.  Despite what other speakers have said, it gives a great many people hope in speculating a pound on the Lotto or buying a ticket.  It gives them a momentary lift, and I do not think it is that bad.  Of course, if people are addicted to it and start buying strings of tickets beyond their means, then one <Col N="1583" /> is into a problem area.  But by and large, people get a nice kick out of even the small prizes that they win.</P>
      <P>As I said, the only reservation I have is about the distribution of the funds.  I believe there should be a 100 per cent reserve to assist and encourage developments undertaken by voluntary organisations. As far as Departments and the State are concerned, lottery funds should not be allocated to health boards or local authorities to substitute for funds for the maintenance of proper services or the development of infrastructures.  Such funds should appropriately come through the normal channels of taxation.  I believe that, if the Government and the various Departments were able to maintain that simple rule, then I do not see how anybody could have any great objection.</P>
      <P>I am probably the third longest serving Member in the Oireachtas at the present time and I know many politicians at every level.  It is my firm opinion that no one is closer to the public or better placed to vet the effectiveness and ability and to assess the competence of local voluntary organisations than the Deputy, the Senator, the urban councillor or the town commissioner.  I believe the Departments of State and Ministers should pay heed to the recommendations that come up; because, by and large, I think very few councillors or politicians of any party, or no party, will recommend a project that is not over and above board.  I am convinced of that.</P>
      <P>Why do politicians always want to take from the standing of the profession, if you would like to call it a profession?  It is an honourable profession inasmuch as you have the honour conferred directly by one's neighbours and constituents and friends at whatever level.  We do not take ourselves seriously enough from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery has been a great success.  It had been advocated here for many years in the House.  We are all pleased that it has taken off and I would hope that it will continue to be successful. I would not like to see the allocation of the funds being handed over to an <Col N="1584" /> organisation, shall we say, in the capital city which could be justly accused, perhaps next year, of being remote from the needs of small, perhaps almost insignificant voluntary organisations down in the country.  One meets in one's everyday life as a public representative small parish or half parish rural communities able to achieve the provision of tremendous facilities for the enhancement of the living conditions in their own communities. Over recent years the county councils have been able to undertake that provision, perhaps, of church carparks and carparking adjacent to cemeteries and there has been tremendous development of parish or community halls.  These structures tend to keep local communities viable and together.  They do not have to be grandiose palaces.  This is not about building the kind of facility to which you can bring the top pop stars or bands in the country and accommodate several thousand people.  But to have a facility where communities can plan and work together is extremely important.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty right across the country in raising funds, because there are so many very worthwhile causes.  It is difficult to compete, and nobody can compete with the national lottery.  Therefore, the funds should be very well distributed right across the country.  The Government should do that and perhaps avoid the pitfalls.  During the course of the debate here several instances were mentioned of organisations being grant aided without even applying, but it should be easy enough to get over those problems if they arose &mdash; and, I am sure, if they did they would not be mentioned here &mdash; and have a criteria and a system of application and nominations for grant aid.</P>
    <P>The national lottery is a new organisation, a new phenomenon in this country, and it is possible to improve on it.  I am confident that the Government can improve on the situation, and I wish them well in doing that.  However, I do not, like some of my colleagues, distrust politicians; and I think that it ought to be possible to make representations to one's colleagues on the other side of the House. <Col N="1585" /> I, personally, have done that successfully and I would hope to be able to do that again.  I ask the Minister of State present, who has responsibility for the national lottery, to consider before the next <i>tranche</i> of allocations are made, a system that perhaps would be very clearly over and above board.  I find that people criticise the allocation of these funds.  When you ask them how much they applied for they would say they did not apply or make any recommendation.  I think that is unfair, because my experience has been that I have had 100 per cent success in everything I asked for and I would hope that that record would continue in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Senators will be aware that the problems we envisaged and that have arisen in the disbursement of finances from the national lottery have largely been brought about by its huge success rather than the disappointment of not achieving the required amount of financial aid that can be disbursed through the national lottery scheme to the many communities throughout the country that require and make application for funds. The national lottery was established in 1986 and came into operation with the funds being made available in 1987.  The tremendous success of the national lottery can be attributed mainly to the gambling instinct that is inherent in most Irish people.  I often hear people speaking of the problems that can arise in relation to the lower socio-economic strata whereby they might be inclined to spend all the money they have on national lottery tickets, money that should be used for their family requirements.  Without being in any way uncharitable, I think that in a situation like that by and large that money would be frittered away on something else if it was not spent on national lottery tickets, because that gambling instinct is there.  All of us will know of towns and cities in which most days of the week bookmakers' offices are full if there is a race meeting on anywhere.</P>

    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Callaghan is very evident in his patronage of those events and I am glad he recognises that here this evening.</P>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity of welcoming the many developments that have taken place as a result of the proceeds of the national lottery under the various headings that have been pointed out to us by the Minister for Finance in his speech here this evening.  Indeed, many communities would not have had the wherewithal or would not have received the necessary financial support to embark on many ambitious projects that were needed in those communities.  I want to pay tribute to Deputy Donal Creed, whose brainchild the national lottery was, and which was brought about mainly through his efforts, if you will permit mentioning one name in the House, a Chathaoirligh.  He lobbied long and hard during the period of the last Government to convince the Cabinet of the day that the national lottery was certainly a scheme that was worth pursuing and that could provide much needed finance, finance that was becoming increasingly scarce, in order to fund various community projects under the many headings the Minister has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, in the sport and recreational area, in the health area, and in the arts and culture area and in local authorities, many areas of the country are embarking on projects now which they could not have done without the aid of this particular source of finance.  I will refer, firstly, to the amenity grant scheme run by local authorities.  The Minister for Finance spoke this evening about the surplus funds which accrued in 1987 from the proceeds of the national lottery and that applications were requested from each local authority to submit proposals <Col N="1587" /> whereby this money could be spent in their area.  Local authorities are required to contribute funds themselves to supplement funds from the national lottery in order to carry out those projects.  I am extremely concerned that local authorities would be put in a very invidious position whereby they would have to overrun their expenditure, which has not been allotted in their estimates, at the end of the financial year in order to match the national lottery funds so that the projects grant aided from the national lottery can be got off the ground.  Otherwise, they would run the risk of disappointing many communities in their area who, through their local representatives, would be putting great pressure on the council to embark on those projects.</P>
    <P>I think this is an area that the Minister would want to take due cognisance of, that planning for the year in relation to the allocation of funds to the local government amenity scheme must be done early enough in the year in order to ensure that the estimates agreed by the county councils or other local authorities would have built into them the necessary finance in order to match the lottery funds to get those projects off the ground and make sure that the amenity applications are proceeded with.  That is something that has brought some local authorities into some difficult financial predicaments in the recent past, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The concept of a lottery is nothing new. In fact, I would say &mdash; and I think everyone here would probably agree with me &mdash; that the country is presently punch drunk with the number of lotteries going on in each particular community at the moment.  The country is effectively being run on lotteries of every discription.  If you are building a community hall, a home for the elderly, or a sports centre a lottery is certainly the way in which the necessary financial contribution is sought from the public by each community. Therefore, the extension of that principle by providing funds from the national lottery is a natural extension of the lottery concept, and it is not so surprising then that the national lottery has been such <Col N="1588" /> a success.  An Post, the agency through which lottery tickets are purchased, provide a ready-made vehicle for having a centre where tickets are purchased throughout every corner of the country, because An Post have offices and facilities in every community.</P>
    <P>The core message in the motion before the House this evening is that the criteria regarding the success or failure of an application is not that evident in the areas where funds are given or where applicants are disappointed; it is this lack of communication regarding the criteria essential in order to satisfy the various headings of the scheme financed by the national lottery which brings an element of controversy into the scheme.  Obviously, groups feel aggrieved if they are left out.  The Minister for Finance has explained the number of applications that have been received and the number of people obviously disappointed as a result of the revelations made this evening.  In regard to how they would go about making an application, it seems that it is politicised too much in the eyes of the community.  It is this apparent politicisation of national lottery funds that is becoming the subject of controversy in the allocations at the moment and is certainly bringing about at local level a sense of outrage at the disbursement and allocation of those funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, has indicated that <i>per capita</i> the allocation of funds is evenly distributed throughout the country and that, in addition, funds are allocated to various projects in regional centres on the basis of their regional importance.  I am not surprised that Sligo was one of those areas picked as a regional centre.  Indeed, fair play to the Minister for Finance that he would have an input into that decision.  I, or any politician or any local representative or Oireachtas representative, would do the same in order to make the best of our representations to further the interests of our own constituency. Good luck to him for doing so. but it should not hide the fact that the allocation of funds throughout the country <Col N="1589" /> is not done on an even-handed basis. There is disquiet, and under the surface there is concern, that, where there is greater political influence over the allocation of funds, those particular interests are getting more funds out of the national lottery than areas where there is less political influence.</P>
    <P>I can give you examples from my own area.  Take the amenity grants.  Clare County Council would have received £90,000 from the amenity grants scheme to local authorities while Mayo County Council would have received £405,000 for the amenity scheme.  I cannot but help come to the conclusion that the fact that the Minister for the Environment happens to be from the county of Mayo would have a bearing on the allocation of those funds to Mayo <i>vis-a-vis</i> the allocation we are giving to Clare County Council.  If I am wrong, correct me, but I cannot come to that conclusion without having a long hard look at the situation. I know, a Chathaoirligh, you will forgive me for mentioning that figure in your own county.</P>
    <P>Again, the amount per head in Sligo and Carlow, for example, bears no relationship at all.  It is certainly completely out of proportion.  In fact, Carlow has one of the lowest allocations in the country at £1.40 per head.  Sligo, when you include the regional centre, works out at £23 per head.  The south-east in general &mdash; perhaps we have not enough political clout in the south-east; we will have to examine our consciences further in relation to that matter &mdash; has been very much neglected when you consider the allocations that have been made in other regions.  This heightens the controversy and heightens the distrust &mdash; perhaps that is too strong a word &mdash; that the public would have of allowing a political input into the allocation of funds from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The substitution of funds for various projects has been made following the introduction of the national lottery.  This was a natural extension of what was likely to happen if the lottery was to become the success it has been.  Funds are distributed <Col N="1590" /> through the Department of Social Welfare to many community groups, through the Department of Education under the community recreational scheme and through the health boards in terms of providing maintenance grants and capital grants for the building of homes for the elderly.  It was only natural, therefore, that funds from the national lottery would supplant funds that were already being allocated through the various spending Departments to those areas initially.</P>
    <P>There are a number of projects that the Minister would want to clarify in relation to my own area of Kilkenny.  I will conclude by seeking information in relation to that matter, because it appears it is very difficult to get information from the Department of Education and the Department of Health in regard to funds, when they will be made available or what criteria are essential to get funds for those projects from those various Departments. I mention in particular the allocations that are essential for the building of a theatre in Kilkenny, the Graiguenamanagh Elderly Association are seeking adequate finance for a project, the fact that no funds have been granted from the Department of Education for Muckalee Community Centre.  Those are just examples of funds that are necessary to be made available and are essential for those communities while other areas, of less importance in my opinion, have received grant aid.  I will not go into the details of the areas that are of less importance.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue in this motion is this: there is an opinion abroad that Ministers are seeking to represent Santa Claus all the year round rather than once a year.  It demeans politicians and only heightens public cynicism.  The only way in which all of us can remove ourselves and distance ourselves from becoming embroiled in controversial matters and allocation of funds &mdash; funds we would like to see coming to our area but in regard to which we would be accused of having a political input over and above other areas &mdash; is to establish an independent <Col N="1591" /> board what would give due explanations and set down proper standards of criteria and assessment for the <Col N="1592" /> allocation of funds from the national lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish somebody amongst those who advocate a particular way of developing the country would explain something to me because it is implied in much of what is said about forestry, and, indeed, it is implied in the Minister's speech, that somehow or other we did not get it right about developing forestry over the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech is full of interesting information about, for instance, the scale of European or EC imports of timber &mdash; the fact that the EC has to import 75 per cent of its timber, that the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, has to import 90 per cent of its timber requirements.  The expectation is that those figures will rise rather than go down.  We know that other countries have developed remarkably successful and profitable timber industries based obviously on forestry as the primary producer. Yet, over 60 years we have effectively failed to produce a viable forestry industry.  That is underlined by the fact that even still the returns from our forests are less than the annual expenditure on them.  Far be it from me to criticise State investment in a productive area, but it would be useful if somebody somewhere would do an analysis of the Irish private sector.  We are told it is ready and willing to grasp all opportunities, given half a chance &mdash; and that is not just a matter of opinion, it is the underlying thrust of the main economic strategy of this Government and, indeed, of the Opposition party that occupy most of the benches in front of me &mdash; that we must base our hopes for economic development on this vibrant, thrusting private sector that is simply waiting for the climate for enterprise to be presented to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know in detail what grant incentives, etc., were available or are available for forestry, but I know that they are generous.  I know they are generous in terms of both grant assistance and tax write-offs and they have been for a considerable period of years.  What <Col N="1594" /> appears to me to be evident is that notwithstanding the considerable range of incentives, the considerable range of encouragement that was available, there has been until recently &mdash; and the Minister mentioned this in his speech &mdash; virtually no significant take-up of private forestry, other than, I presume, on a very small scale by individual smallholders or farmers around the country.</P>
    <P>For instance, there has not been, that I am aware of, any significant institutional investment in forestry, though apparently outside this country most pension fund managers recognise forestry as a particularly appropriate form of investment producing a long term yield which would be appropriate to pension fund investors.  The Minister's own unfortunate attempt to try to sell off some of our State forests &mdash; something that I did not agree with for a number of reasons &mdash; was not exactly a spectacular success, because apparently those who made noises about being interested in buying up semi-mature State forests, once it became apparent to them that they were going to have to pay a commercial price, decided they were not interested.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the consistent record of the Irish private sector is that they will not go into anything involving a reasonable risk, a business risk where there might not be an absolutely secure State guarantee or a guaranteed margin on the investment, which only a catastrophe could undermine.  They will not take that risk.  The hand-out mentality that is so often ascribed to people on welfare and other people in our society, is in fact perhaps best seen in the mentality that masquerades as the Irish private enterprise sector.  Unless they are cosseted on one hand by tax incentives and on the other hand by grants, and underneath that by State guarantees against loss on the odd occasion when they take a risk, they seem to be entirely reluctant &mdash; in particular the Irish banks and financial institutions &mdash; to take any sort of a risk. They expect other people to make a proper assessment of a commercial proposition and make an intelligent decision about what to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> It appears to me that most of those who control large investment funds in this country are reluctant to actually do that which they are actually paid to do, and that which they expect substantial rewards for doing, which is to assess the risk involved in a particular commercial enterprise, make a judgment and then make a decision to release funds under their control into that investment and accept the consequences of that risk. They hope the consequences will be success and reward but implicitly, in a proper philosophy of private enterprise, they would also have to accept the consequences and the penalties of failure.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have in this country a private sector, particularly in the financial sector, which is intent on demanding for itself the maximum rewards for growth, but which at the same time protects itself, through the State, from any of the possible penalties of failure.  We have seen it, as I said earlier today, in the bailing out of Allied Irish Banks when they made a monumental mess of a particular acquisition.  We have seen it, too, in the way in which the PMPA has been protected.  We seem to have this presumption running through most of what masquerades as the Irish private financial services sector that, in fact, all they are expected to do is to provide money for investments which, if they go wrong, will be guaranteed by the State.  As far as I can see the only real risk they take is in the relatively small proportion of the lending they make to domestic purchasers to buy consumer goods with the ordinary unsecured personal loan.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister fairly well and I have come to respect his intelligence and his capacity to think creatively.  It is nice to talk to the Minister for once about something where I do not have to complain about him representing somebody else.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if anybody has endeavoured to find out why there has been no willingness on the part of the Irish financial institutions to invest in forestry. Is it that there is no evidence to suggest that it is possible to build a viable <Col N="1596" /> forestry and timber industry in this country? If that is so, then this whole venture is doomed to failure.  Is it simply that Irish financial systems presume first, guarantees against loss and, secondly, presume short-term profitability inside a time scale that is incompatible with the time scale that is involved in forestry development? Is it essentially that they are so cautious, so conservative and so unimaginative that the sort of scale of decision-making that would be involved in large scale investment in forestry is beyond them?  If it is, then the new body will be particularly exciting and worthwhile.  In principle I think it is.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the previous speaker, Senator Ross, said, I think the record of semi-State companies is remarkably good, given the heavy hand of Government interference they have all had to deal with over the years.  For example, the ESB are forced to keep open some of their most inefficient generating plants because of the possible political consequences of closing down in particular turf-burning stations which in terms of costs per kilowatt of power produced are remarkably inefficient.  There are political reasons why they must be kept open and on balance, I agree with them being kept open.  However, it is improper then to point at the ESB and say, they are a sloppy organisation, and that they should do this or that.  For instance, the ESB are accused of being overmanned but very few Members of either House would sit back quietly if the ESB unit in their immediate area of interest was to close or halve their workforce.  It is very difficult for ostensibly commercial semi-State organisations to operate when there is this perpetual political demand being put on them to meet targets other than proper commercial targets, i.e. the capacity to produce a product at a price which is acceptable to the customer and which also guarantees that the company is both viable and profitable.</P>
    <P>There is no reason anybody who is on the left in politics should apologise for expecting commercial State companies to be profitable.  It is one of the classic pieces of woolly thinking: there <Col N="1597" /> is a presumption that somehow there is some correlation between socialism and inefficiency and some correlation between socialism and lack of profitability. In the most successful social democracy in the world, Sweden, Volvo made £1.5 billion and Saab made £0.5 billion in the last financial year.  That is £2 billion between two companies.  That is what I call the best mixture of social democracy and the market economy I am aware of.  That is the model our semi-State companies should be aiming at. There are many reasons to suspect that this semi-State company, however welcome the concept, will be hamstrung by a considerable number of inhibitions which will prevent that taking place.</P>
    <P>The principle of setting up a semi-State body to develop forestry is a good thing. It is quite clear that the Irish private sector will never be prepared to accept the long-term investment that is necessary for the development of forestry.  It is clear that no amount of incentives up to now have managed to attract other than minuscule investment in forestry. There is no reason to believe that this is going to change.  It will probably be one of the ironies of the completion of the internal market in 1992 that in the future other non-national financial institutions will find investment in forestry in this country a considerably greater attraction than the national financial institutions because they are able to think in the longer term and they have more experience of forestry.</P>
    <P>Forestry is a substantial part of the development of most of the European Communities.  As the Minister said in his speech, we have about 6 per cent of our land area under forestry, the European figure is around 24 per cent.  It is an astonishing anomaly.  Governments have a habit of blaming the previous Government for everything that goes wrong.  As a nation, we can probably blame our former imperial masters for what is wrong with our forestry.  Of course there is some truth in that but it is a bit much to keep on saying it after 60 years.</P>
    <P>The principle of a semi-State organisation to develop forestry is good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> However, nobody has yet done the sort of detailed, hard-headed financial analysis, cost benefit analysis, to convince me that there is a viable future for Irish forestry. In spite of my cynicism and scepticism about the Irish private sector &mdash; and my cynicism and scepticism goes deeper every week as I watch them wallowing in the two most ephemeral economic successes of the 20th century, that of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan and their believing that these artificial growths can bé sustained without producing anything the world wants to buy. These Irish financial institutions seem to believe that, but you cannot get them to invest in anything as significant as something that grows, develops and makes money and can be sold in the future as a product.</P>
    <P>What is so obvious about forestry in terms of its potential, in terms of the markets that are available to it, suggest that even Irish financial institutions ought to have woken up to the possibility.  I am amazed, for instance, at the way financial institutions queued up to fund farmers to produce more and more of the same things that were already in vast oversupply in the European Communities. They invested in agriculture, to produce more and more products that nobody wants to buy at a price nobody is prepared to pay.  The financial institutions are apparently unwilling, unable or incapable of doing what is needed to be done, which is to invest in something which is in undersupply in the European Communities and which is liable to become more and more in demand over the next 20 years.  Has anybody, either in the Department of Finance or in the Department with responsibility for Forestry actually come to a conclusion about why the Irish financial sector will not invest in forestry? If it is simply because of their own inherent conservatism, then this is going to be a very exciting development.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I feel that if this project is as full of potential as I think it is then the Minister will overload this agency with burdens of debt that are going to make their life quite difficult, <Col N="1599" /> bearing in mind that one presumes that we are talking about at least a 20-year, if not a 30-year, period before a real substantial return on the investment is generated.</P>
    <P>The Minister is nodding his head.  I look forward to what he has to say in his speech.  He says five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was shaking his head in disagreement.  My vocabulary is rather restricted at this hour in the evening.  I know the Minister's speech talks about a five-year period but we have had 50 years of investment in forestry and it is still not making money.  Unless the Minister can produce new figures, then I am not convinced about it.  If the Minister thinks we are somehow at a launch point and that we are going to make substantial amounts of money I would be interested in hearing that.  He has made an act of faith in his speech that it will happen.  He has not produced any detached financial analysis which would suggest it would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The students at the institution I work in released on the world have been trained at great length about how you make a proper financial appraisal of an investment project and how you actually work out when it will begin to make money, how much money it will make and, I presume, that since we are setting up a significant semi-State organisation somebody somewhere has done that.  Much as I approve of expansion and extension of the role of the State sector, I would hate to think that it is being done on a wing or a prayer because whatever I think about the power of prayer &mdash; and I think quite a lot about it &mdash; I do not think it is the way to make proper financial decisions and I would hope that somebody somewhere has done a proper appraisal of this on the basis of either comparative performance by other countries or the expected maturation of our forestry in the immediate future or whatever. Somebody somewhere ought to <Col N="1600" /> have made a proper attempt at quantifying the risks, quantifying the investment required and quantifying the projected returns from that investment. If it has not been done then this whole thing should be put into limbo until it is done because it is the only proper way in which proper investment decisions can be made.  I know of no other way.  I do not believe it should be done for ideological reasons, I do not believe it should be done for political reasons, I do not think it should be done for social reasons unless they are clearly stated and above board in the legislation set up to develop an agency.  I am not persuaded that that is the case.</P>
    <P>If, on the one hand, it is successful then I think it is something that is both to be welcomed and encouraged.  We have such a startling set of facts to which I have referred &mdash; the fact that the EC import 75 per cent of its timber, the fact that the import bill for timber is second only to the import bill for oil as the Minister said.  We are a country that is under-forested, this should make it clear to us that this idea presents considerable attractions for us.</P>
    <P>The fact that Córas Tráchtála has identified the whole DIY area as an area for future Irish exports ought to offer opportunities for downstream timber processing related to the DIY industry and one hopes that there will be an attempt to integrate the development of our forestries with the CTT attempt to increase Ireland's share, particularly of the British DIY industry.  My own view of the alleged British boom is that I would not like to base our future economic development on that boom because I think that boom is almost over, if it ever existed.  It was quite artificial since it was not based on the production of new goods or new services; it was based on consumer spending.  That is not the way to develop an economy.</P>
    <P>There are other implications of the development of forestry.  The major one I would say is that given the inevitability of the end of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; and it seems that nothing in this country wants to confront what I would <Col N="1601" /> regard as the inevitable end of the Common Agricultural Policy within the period of 15 or 20 years &mdash; then obviously forestry ought to be a major alternative attractive investment for many people who are currently involved in agriculture. I think the idea that we can keep on forever producing more and more of these things that nobody wants to buy, as I said before, is nonsense and one of the nonsenses that we seem to have hypnotised ourselves with, notwithstanding the evidence to the contrary.  I really do wish we would call things what they are instead of generating imaginary terminology and fictitious headage payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to a new compensatory allowance scheme which will allow farmers who are in receipt of headage payment in respect of livestock to continue to receive such payments if they afforest part or all of their land.  So, we will be paying headage payments, presumably, for fictitious animals that have been displaced.  Why would they be refused headage payments simply by afforesting part of their land?  Maybe I am missing a detail here but it appears to me that people would be allowed to keep on being paid headage payments.  Does the fact that somebody afforests part of their land somehow make them ineligible for headage payments or, is it that in fact the land that would otherwise have been used for livestock is going to be used for afforestation instead?  Where are all the livestock that were going to be on that land?  They will be gone I presume, so farmers are going to be paid headage payments for non-existing livestock.  I do not think that is the logical and sensible way to deal with this matter.  It creates another fiction, apart from the fiction that apparently we are paying headage payments for about 150,000 more head of livestock that actually have been in the census anyway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only one sentence off the forestry.  The principle of the Bill <Col N="1602" /> is not in question but there is a considerable number of details in the Bill that need to be addressed and I want to keep them fairly brief.  There is a number of sections that need comment.  Given the general aggressive nature of the present Minister's views it is particularly disappointing that there is no provision for worker directors in this Bill.  It would have been a quite simple thing either to introduce it in this legislation or to amend the worker participation legislation that went through this House and is currently before the Dáil.  I think it is a matter of considerable regret and it must be a deliberate policy decision to exclude worker directors from this company.  I would like to know if perhaps the Minister could explain to me why.</P>
      <P>Second 16 has to do with changes in the Articles of Association.  In the case of the legislation to deal with Bord Telecom and An Post changes in the Articles of Association must be notified to the trade unions.  For some reason or another a similar provision is left out here.  I would like to know why.  Either it was a mistake or it is being left out for some reason. I have already spoken effectively about those sections to do with the financing of the company.  I am not happy, I must say, with the requirement that an organisation which is expected to think in a much longer-term, though a realistic, commercial term about its investment, will have to borrow £80 million over the first five years.  I think that may well be an excessively heavy level of debt and if they had to even develop on a smaller scale, with less ambitious targets, it might be fairer to them than the extraordinary burden of debt they could run up, particularly if this Minister is followed by a less sympathetic Minister who decides to leave them more or less afloat in the commercial financial market without much protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much more serious is the fact that under sections 18 and 21 relating to the issue of shares by the Minister and the transfer or sale by the Minister for Finance of shares this whole agency could be privatised without the matter being brought before the Dáil or the Seanad. <Col N="1603" /> The Minister, apparently on his own initiative, without the approval of the Oireachtas could sell off this company and privatise it.  I find that quite sinister. It seems to me to reflect a less than wholehearted commitment to the idea that this agency should remain a semi-State company and particularly, given the appalling performance of the Irish sector I think that it would be a tragedy if this agency were to be left in State hands while the risks are being taken and once the profits begin to be generated there will be privatisation possibly.  That is the characteristic of those who demand privatisation in this country, that they wait until Aer Lingus return to profitability and then they demand privatisation; they wait until B &amp; I returns to profitability, if it does, and then they will want it to be privatised.  They are now talking about ICI being privatised because it is more or less back in profit. They will be talking about other agencies. Now that the shocks of the seventies have been overcome with the assistance of the State and the taxpayer, people will talk about privatisation.  Nobody would want to privatise this agency until such time as it began to make money but once it begins to make money a Minister with a different ideological perspective from the present Minister might go along with privatisation. I have a good idea what the present Minister's ideological perspective is, even though Fianna Fáil Ministers by and large claim to have none.</P>

      <P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have, but I do not ever report on private conversations. I will not say any more than that.  I think it is remarkable and somewhat sinister that a body which would have invested in five years time upwards of £200 million in forestry development and which, as the Minister said, will have transferred to it substantial assets paid for by the taxpayer, could be sold off without any reference to the Oireachtas almost at the whim of a future Minister for Finance.  I <Col N="1604" /> think that is a great pity and I cannot imagine that the decision to word those sections as they are worded was taken other than deliberately and with a view to facilitating privatisation or something else.  There may be another reason but if there is, I do not know what it is.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the usual provision which, as far as it goes, is hardly unwelcome in section 33 about the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by directors.  It is a pity that the same section does not make any reference to precluding directors from using confidential information for their own benefit.  EOLAS, the State agency concerned with science and technology etc., has written into it a specific proviso that directors of EOLAS must make known any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest that might arise from a particular contract being placed by EOLAS and must take no further part in the decision making related to that.  That ought to be.  We expect it of people on ethical grounds, but it ought also to be quite clearly illegal for people to use information that they get because of their membership of a State board for financial gain.  We all accept that it is unethical.  It ought to be very clearly illegal.  It may well be illegal in principle because of some other basic legislation but it ought to be spelled out explicitly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to section 34, I think it is a pity that a Minister who was a distinguished Member of this House would allow section 34 to go through.  Section 34 is to do with membership of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.  I have spoken on every Bill concerning State agencies and said that it is wrong to equate membership of this house with membership of either the Dáil or the European Parliament because it is impossible to believe that everybody who will come into the Seanad will be paid in their previous employment less than £12,000 a year.  You are effectively saying that anybody who is in any way above the average male industrial wage, who is employed by an increasing range of State companies, must actually live on something <Col N="1605" /> in or around £12,000 a year if they are to become Senators.  That is at variance with the whole philosophical base of the Seanad which is of a vocational body representing vocational interests and which is not meant to be the preserve of full-time politicians.</P>
    <P>To make the Seanad increasingly the preserve of full-time politicians is not only at variance with the spirit of the Constitution but it is also extremely unfair to an increasingly large number of employees of semi-State organisations. To give a very simple example, this country is endeavouring to develop itself into a high technology country.  It is now impossible, for instance, for the director of either of our NIHE's to accept a nomination from a Taoiseach to become a member of the Seanad because that particular person would have to cease to be paid by the institution and become a full-time Senator.  This is a piece of contradictory drafting that is inserted willy-nilly into every single piece of legislation that has come before this House which equates membership of this House with membership of the Dáil and the European Parliament.  I do not think it is right and I think it is there because people do not think about it.  I particularly invite the present Minister, who is a former Senator, to imagine what it would be like to have to live for four or five years on a Seanad salary.  It is something that those who have to do it &mdash; and I do not have to, and that is why I feel particularly free to talk about it &mdash; will assure you that they do not intend to do for the rest of their lives if they can possibly avoid it because the salary is not exactly generous. It is not a salary that any trade unionist would regard as the acceptable upper limit of his or her aspirations.  It is, therefore, quite wrong to insert a provision into every single piece of legislation that I have seen in the last seven or eight years concerning any State agency which says that any employee of that agency who becomes a Member of this House must cease to draw any salary from the State agency.</P>
    <P>It is at variance with the philosophy of the Seanad; it is going to discourage more <Col N="1606" /> and more people with skills, particularly in the educational and technology areas, from becoming Members of this House and it is going to reduce the pool of skills from which a Taoiseach or a political party or indeed the graduates of either the National University or Trinity can draw in terms of electing their members. It is going to make this place the preserve largely of people who are either self-employed or in some sort of pseudo-private employment like universities which even though they are funded by the State are effectively private employers.  I think it is time that somebody somewhere in some Government Ministry actually asked himself if this is necessary and what it is there for.  I think it slips through without people thinking and it ought to be addressed.</P>
    <P>If people want to make this a full-time institution for full-time politicians then they should pay people the same salary as they pay full-time politicians in both the European Parliament and the Dáil. The reason Senators are paid less is because it is presumed that it is not a full-time institution.  I say that with respect to my colleagues.  I have nothing to say about the recent developments because it is far too easy for those like me to make smart remarks about them.  I regret very much the fact that membership of the Seanad is always referred to in matters like this.</P>
    <P>There has been quite legitimate concern about section 36.  I am fascinated that at a time when deregulation is the fashion of the day in so many areas, successive pieces of legislation about State agencies actually introduce the right to legislate for the wage rates of employees of semi-State companies.  I find that quite objectionable.  I think it is a completely unfair loading of the dice against the employees where they cannot negotiate; they cannot appeal to independent arbitration. They are simply at the mercy of a political decision about how much they should be paid.  I think it is wrong legislation. It is wrong both in terms of the industrial relations prospects of a company and also in terms of the rights of the employees of the company.  I do not think <Col N="1607" /> it should be there.  Section 36 should be withdrawn.  If the Government are unhappy with the way either the Labour Court or the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme work they should, by negotiation, get them changed but they should not by-pass all of these by introducing this sort of offensive legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 38 seems to be the section which completely undermines the possibility of this agency operating as a commercial agency.  The Minister is shaking his head in a negative fashion.  I will read out section 38:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, issue directions in writing to the company requiring the company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Government concerning the development of forestry and related activities of which he may advise the company from time to time, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to provide or maintain specified services or facilities, or</P>
    <P>to maintain or use specified land or premises in the company's possession for a particular purpose.</P>
    <P>The company shall comply with every direction given to it under this section.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that to suggest that any of those instructions must be based on any commercial criteria.  There is nothing in it other than the perhaps naive presumption that because the Minister for Finance approves of it, it is going to be commercial.  The ESB is compelled to keep open a number of turf burning stations that it wishes to close because of political decisions, not because of any commercial decisions.  I know that Aer Lingus was forced to keep open the transatlantic route when it was losing a large sum of money and then having gone into the red because of it, was accused of being an inefficient State organisation.  I know that these things go on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> I do not think that any Minister is going to necessarily make a directive simply to preserve his own patch of land but I do believe that there will be a conflict between the political perceptions of a Government on a particularly controversial issue, for instance, about the acquisition of land or the development of a particular area, and the commercial requirements of what is supposed to be a vibrant, commercial semi-State organisation. I do not think the Minister should retain to himself the right to give instructions like that unless he is prepared to qualify them by saying that these must be subject to the normal laws of commercial investment and commercial decision-making; otherwise he is effectively saying: &ldquo;I can tell you what to do any time and you must do it whatever it does&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Incidentally I think that there is a question &mdash; since this is going to be a registered company and is going to be incorporated under the Companies Act &mdash; about fraudulent trading where, a Minister, say, gave directions like this to a company.  I do not know why the Minister, on the one hand, wants to set up a commercial State agency which is meant to make a profit and maximise the profit that can be made out of our forestry, and in the process &mdash; because I happen to believe the two do fairly well overlap very often &mdash; maximise the employment potential of our forestry, while on the other hand he says: &ldquo;If I want you to do something then you must do it irrespective of whether it costs you large sums of money or small sums of money&rdquo;.  I do not think those two things are reconcilable and the Minister cannot have it both ways.  There is a little bit of glibness here in the sense that in the Minister's speech there is considerable reference to the Civil Service ethos not being ideal for the development of a commercial agency.  That is to a certain extent a political cop-out because it points a finger at the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about attempting to develop a commercial agency in a Civil Service ethos is that it is under the thumb of a Minister.  What effectively we have done here is that we have attempted to <Col N="1609" /> take away the Civil Service side of it but we have left the possibility of day-to-day political interference in the operations of what is supposed to be commercial State agency.  I do not think the shareholders in a private company would be able to have that sort of power.  If there were a majority of them I do not think they would be able to issue a direction to a company because they were shareholders in it, that it must do this or that irrespective of the commercial value of the action.  I do not think that actual power exists under company law or in regard to the Government's private company.  I do not see why it should exist for State companies. It is the sort of provision that guarantees that yet another State company is going to be forced to do things that are mutually contradictory, to invest and lose money and then be blamed because they do not make money.  That is the history of a large number of our semi-State companies.  CIE are told, quite rightly, to keep the railways open &mdash; and I agree fully with the decision &mdash; but they are then blamed because the railways do not make money.</P>
    <P>Every one of our State companies have been told to do things that are inconsistent with optimum commercial operation. I believe that a semi-State company should operate on a strictly commercial basis other than in areas where there is an identified social need which is costed and funded separately and which is not taken in under the heading of their commercial accounts.  I think retaining those sort of provisions is fundamentally at variance with the objective of setting up a commercial semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>It is a classic position here to say that we always think the present Minister will not do anything like that and that his successor will.  Having said that, I have to say the same thing about the present Minister.  This Minister is subjected to the same temptations as I am.  Therefore, if he does not like what a semi-State organisation is doing, how can he be sure he will not feel obliged to interfere?  It is a classic thing.  If you delegate authority and responsibility to somebody else, your <Col N="1610" /> first job, if you are going to make delegation work, is to be prepared to support what the person to whom you delegate does even if you do not agree with it. Anybody who claims to be good at delegation and reserves the right to overrule what that person does is not a good delegater; he is simply passing on the admiinstrative burden to somebody else but keeping the authority for himself.  It is about time that semi-State organisations were protected from that possibility of day-to-day interference.  It does not exist in the private sector.  There is no reason, constitutional or financial, why it should exist in the public sector.  It exists and will continue to exist for purely political reasons.</P>
    <P>If we are going to make this a commercial agency, so be it.  If we are going to make it a social services agency, then so be it: I believe in both kinds of State agencies.  But you cannot make one into both without causing contradictions which will make life difficult, which will guarantee conflicts and will guarantee that you will either get poorly motivated executives or no executives of any quality. If people are going to be given the job of running a major commercial State agency, then they ought to have the independence and the authority that goes with a similar scale of operations in the private sector.  I appeal to the Minister to remove section 38 completely or else to rewrite it in such terms that the Minister's directives can only be implemented if they are consistent with the commercial objectives of the agency.</P>
    <P>Can I ask the Minister to have a look at section 39, subsection (3), because I do not think it makes any sense:</P>
    <P>&mdash; The Minister may on his own initiative and shall on the application of the company issue a certificate in respect of specified land certifying, as he thinks proper, that the land vested in the company under this section or did not so vest &mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not understand that sentence &mdash;</P>
    <P>and the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the facts so certified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> Maybe it is a drafting or a printer's error, but I do not believe that sentence makes any sense.  Either it should be &ldquo;that the land the Minister vested in the company under this section or did not so vest and the certificate...&rdquo;, but there is either a word left out or that is gobbledegook.  I have had gobbledegook before via the parliamentary draftsman so at this stage I do not believe that the draftsman is necessarily right and I am wrong.  I ask the Minister to clarify at some stage, either on Committee Stage or now, what that subsection means.</P>
    <P>There is, I understand, considerable concern about the position of employees of this agency.  The status of present members of the Forestry Service apparently is guaranteed but the prospects of future members, apparently, are not nearly so clear.  These are some of the issues I would like the Minister to address either now, or on Committee Stage tomorrow, or whenever we take it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to raise something which I think needs comment.  Perhaps it has been covered somewhere but, if so, I missed it, namely, the forests have never been treated exclusively as a commercial resource.  They have been treated as a leisure resource and as part of our environment and have been developed as such.  Has the Minister a clear plan in his mind to reconcile the quite proper emphasis on commercial development that is contained in his speeches on the Bill with the traditional environmental contribution the forests have made and the recreational and other contributions they have made?  Essentially, we used to have the Forestry and Wildlife Service; we now have the forestry section becoming a State agency.  How is the other side of the development of our forests, which has made such a contribution to our amenities and which so many people enjoy so much, going to be guaranteed and protected under this legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but I must respond to a number of points that were raised by Senator Ryan.  I have never heard such <Col N="1612" /> a despondent type of speech from any Senator in this House about a very positive piece of legislation.  There is possibly one area of agreement that I would have with him and that is that when English is being written it should be written as it is spoken or written as people nowadays would suggest that it should be written. Parliamentary draftsmen seem to be writing English that is more related to the 18th century than to the 20th century and I would agree with him that at times there is a problem in reading what is in parliamentary draftsmen's version. While I do not agree with him on his interpretation of the particular section, I do suggest that our parliamentary draftsmen would look at English as it is spoken and at English as it is understood in the 20th century and not go back to the 18th century from which they seem to take their current writing.</P>
      <P>We have had an appalling list of wrongs from Senator Ryan about the private sector.  We have had from him over the past number of minutes an indictment of the private sector.  One would imagine that people in the private sector in Ireland, whether in forestry or in any other area of society, are crooks, that they are not in it for anything else except to try to maximise the benefits to themselves and make no effort to maximise the benefits for others.

He has never had to come to grips with the problems that have been associated with working in the private sector.  He has never had the worry of having to deal with banks and to pay his staff or having creditors on his back.  He has had the protection of having a dual salary for a long number of years.  He comes up here and he tells us who are in the private sector what we should and should not be doing.  He comes from a privileged sector of society <Col N="1613" /> and it is about time that his lies were nailed.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan, you will have to withdraw that last remark about Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw.  If I used a word that is not desirable to use in relation to anybody, I will withdraw it. From the protection of the exclusivity of where this Senator comes from, he is in no position to give out about people in the private sector.  He mentioned the &ldquo;appalling record&rdquo;&mdash; he used those words &mdash; of the private sector.  There is no appalling record in the private sector.</P>
      <P>To get back to the Bill, the Senator gave out about the risk factor.  There is a risk factor in any enterprise.  This Minister is bringing in a Bill which will ensure that Irish forestry will operate in a situation in which there is a commitment to commerciality.  I do not understand much of what Senator Ryan said about this Bill. There is a shortage of timber in Ireland and in Europe.  The Minister is trying to redress the balance and to give a commercial aspect to afforestation in Ireland. Timber is becoming a very scarce resource, not alone in Europe but in the world in general.  This Minister is attempting to redress the problems we have had in Ireland in the past.  He is attempting to bring the timber industry into a commercially viable position and not with, as the Senator has said, the heavy-handed Government interference that existed in the past.  I do not think there was a heavy-handed Government interference in the past.  One of the problems that existed was that people did not realise that timber was an excellent resource which took a long number of years to come to commercial fruition.  An attempt is being made in this Bill to give those who go into the timber business a return which will be viable for themselves and indeed for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> The Irish financial sector involvement in the timber business has been criticised by Senator Ryan.  I suppose it could be said that, because of the long term investment necessary, the banks and the commercial institutions were not eager to get involved.  Similarly, the banks were not inclined to get involved in long term investment in housing.  That was left to the local authorities or to building societies. Now the banks see that housing can be a viable proposition.  They realise, too, that the financing of the forestry sector can be viable in the long term.  There are many problems associated with the lack of timber.  In India at present there are no forests.  States like Brazil are wiping out forests at the rate of 17,000 hectares per day.  There are problems associated with deforestation in the African Continent and the sapele is growing at an enormous rate.</P>
    <P>Anything that the Government do to increase the potential for afforestation has to be fully supported.  The Minister has in this Bill attempted to commercialise afforestation.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that he will succeed, because that is what he intends to do.  I am delighted that in the past number of weeks he has invited Vice President of the European Community, Frans Andriessen, to Ireland.  He will come here within the next couple of weeks.  I am quite sure that the Vice-President will endorse what the Government and the Minister are doing in terms of this Bill.  They are doing what should have been done many years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the remarks of Senator Ryan about the appalling record of the Irish private sector.  The Irish private sector has helped him and many like him to live in the cocoon in which he lives. There is nothing sinister about being an entrepreneur.  An entrepreneur in this country is a vilified person.  People such as Senator Ryan living in cocoons do not know what it is like to be in private industry.  An attempt is being made here to commercialise Irish forestry and I commend the Minister for the work he has done since he came into that office.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that the <Col N="1615" /> salary of Senators is not what it should be.  That is the only area in which I agree with him.  I commend the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  I have absolutely no doubt but that as a result of it a commercial afforestation programme will be set up and that our children and our children's children will benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, in the most genuine way, to extend to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to all the Senators who have spoken on this debate over the past two days, my thanks for the very forthright, interesting way they have dealt with the provisions of this Bill.  Reference was made on a number of occasions to the fact that I had served in this House.  I have to admit that on those occasions I looked forward to the opportunity of some day doing what I have been doing for the past couple of days.  I would like to thank Senators for their welcome and support.</P>
      <P>I will try to deal with all the contributions as comprehensively as possible.  I will begin by dealing with some of the general comments and then I will try to deal more specifically with others as they arise.  Should I fail to cover some elements we will have ample time to deal with them on Committee Stage. In the earlier part of the debate quite a number of Senators were interested in the funding for forestry from EC sources. I want to say straight away that, far from having any ideological objection to EC funding for private forestry, I naturally welcome it.  I will try to ensure that that area is properly developed in the future. Public forestry is also an essential element, indeed for a very long time, as at present, it has been the main element in meeting national forestry targets.  I agree completely with Senator Norris therefore that the EC should provide substantial funding for public forestry.  To do otherwise would be to discriminate in an area which is very important to us.  We literally cannot accept a continuation of the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> While most of the points in relation to EC funding for public forestry were directed at the advantages we have in this country for tree growing, I would merely point out that from an EC point of view &mdash; this point was made by Senator Brendan Ryan &mdash; since there is such a heavy import content of timber into the Community it is also vital for the Community as a whole that forestry is developed. We are in a strategic and advantageous position to do that.  Therefore, in calling for support for public forestry in Ireland we can do so in a totally EC context.</P>
    <P>Forestry has been a poor relation in the EC.  It may be no harm to put it on the record that it has been often a poor relation here in Ireland so far as its treatment by Government is concerned. Because it has been often a poor relation here at home, and it certainly has been a poor relation in the Community, overall Community policy on forestry as a whole has been quite slow to develop.  Forestry has been catered for not in a specific way but very often through other programmes &mdash; for example, agricultural programmes where there were straightforward conflicts. In the context of contributions made by Senators with regard to the slow rate of development of forestry in some areas, particularly in the private area, one has to take into account the background and the thinking in agriculture generally and the manner in which forestry as a result was pushed out onto the perimeter and did not get the kind of treatment it should have got.  Since we came into office we have made a major and sustained effort to change that climate. There is evidence here at home and in the EC that forestry now has a higher profile and that we can expect, provided we do our job properly, to be able to improve quite substantially the elements which go to supporting forestry, particularly public forestry, in the future.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next fortnight I will be meeting the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Andriessen.  We will take advantage of his trip to this country, on my invitation, to visit some of our forests and see at first hand counties, particularly in the west, that have real potential for <Col N="1617" /> forestry development.  We will try to ensure that he understands perfectly the necessity for greater financial support for the public forestry element.</P>
    <P>With regard to the policy-making organs in this country, we have established a special section in our own Department.  The Taoiseach is heading a special committee so that for the first time we are beginning to put together a programme as to how best to achieve these financial aims in Europe.  The House can be happy that these developments will prove fruitful.  We have already improved the position with regard to an £8.1 million grant for roads from the European Regional Development Fund and we have negotiated a £29 million loan preferential treatment for forestry development from the European Investment Bank.  We will continue to explore every avenue and possibility to improve that situation.  We effectively want to throw down the gauntlet to the EC in this area and to manage it in a much better way than has been the position heretofore.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the question of worker directors in the new company.  I have said in the Dáil, and I repeat here, that directors of Coillte Teoranta will be appointed solely on the basis of the contribution they will make to the company and not in a representational capacity.  We do not, therefore, provide for worker directors although the above approach would not prevent an employee of Coillte from being appointed to the board.  I have had discussions with unions on this matter and I have told them that I would have no objection to availing of the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, to provide for participative arrangements at sub-board level, as envisaged in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I can also assure Senator O'Toole that the Minister will appoint only the best.  My record proves that I do not go for the old pals' act.  No matter what criteria are applied in the appointment of directors, they would not prevent such a happening, <Col N="1618" /> but I can guarantee the House that it is not going to happen in this case.  The Bill reflects the generality of State body legislation in providing that the Minister appoints the board.  Senator Ross conveniently forgot that in this context the chief executive was appointed following a public competition.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by a number of Senators of the sale of shares provisioned by the Minister for Finance. Section 21 follows the generality of State body legislation which provides for the sales of shares, legislation such as that dealing with SFADCo, the Irish Steel Holdings Act, the National Film Studios of Ireland Act, 1980, or remains silent on the matter.  Being silent does not prevent the Minister for Finance from selling his shares.  The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, was the exception.  This set up two monopolies, BTE and An Post.  All of the rest either had the same provision that I am putting into this Bill or were silent. Section 21 is not a charter for private participation.  It gives the Minister for Finance a certain flexibility in regard to share sales in accordance with the practice of other State body legislation.  There is no intention in section 21 to allow for a private takeover by the company.  Why would the Minister for Finance give somebody else all the benefits of the investment in forestry?  It is only reasonable, however, that he should have a certain flexibility.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Senators with regard to amenity development and the environment in general.  The company will take over the present amenity activities &mdash; for example, the forest parks, picnic sites, etc.  They will be first of all, expected to maximise revenue from this source.  I am at a total loss, having known Senator Ryan for a very long time and, like Senator Lanigan not doubting on occasions his capacity to put his point across, to know why he could have ignored certain provisions in section 38 which includes a most important clause which provided that the company will be reimbursed for losses incurred on <Col N="1619" /> non-commercial activities such as amenity. For the first time we have been able to put into legislation a provision which enables the company, following a directive from the Minister, to carry out specified works and, as a consequence, where they are not commercial and where the company have attempted to make them as profitable as is humanly possible, the difference will be made up by the Minister. I think Senator Ryan, if he had a further opportunity to speak in this debate, would have to acknowledge that he has not seen that provision too frequently. It puts into character &mdash; I will be dealing with this later &mdash; some of the real effort that has gone into the production of this Bill to make it as comprehensive and as fair as possible.</P>
    <P>The company, like others, will be subject to the laws of the environment.  The final part of Senator Ryan's question related to the environment.  Section 13 obliges the company to have regard to the environment and amenity consequences of their operations.  Section 38 allows the Minister to give the company binding directions on specified matters relating to these operations.  The company therefore, unlike the generality of State bodies, would have specific amenity environmental responsibilities.  In addition, I accepted a Dáil amendment to provide for consultation with the Minister for Finance on forestry developments in areas of scientific interest. Senator McEllistrim was quite concerned about this provision.  He, too, can be quite happy that his fears will be catered for.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at this stage that the Forest Service can be very proud of its achievements in that area.  The forest parks, picnic sites and reserves are the window through which the public have come to know forestry.  It is one area which has caught the imagination of the public and it is important that we deal with it in the future as well as we possibly can, bearing in mind that much of that activity is not commercial.  At the same time, it should not be neglected because <Col N="1620" /> of the commercial force we are putting behind the company.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was worried about the broadleaves and I will just bring that into the context of amenity.  Despite the problems that we have nationally, we have introduced and increased the level of grants for broadleaf plantation.  We have stopped the carnage in Coolattin. We have donated free of charge to Dublin University, the Dublin Millennium group and other groups deciduous plants for planting in different cities and towns.  We have had consultation with the tree council. The broadleaf plantation which formed part of our history going back over the centuries will not be reintroduced overnight but we will try to ensure that there will be a proper balance. Each year for the past two years we have increased, albeit a small percentage, the level of broadleaf planting and we hope to continue to do that.  In deference to Senator Kiely's contribution, he acknowledged what we are trying to do with regard to getting cash from the ash so that, particularly in Tipperary, we will have sufficient resources to deal with any problems that would come up at the Munster Final or later on.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the fear that was expressed with regard to indiscriminate cutting of trees.  Farmers and others tend to use mechanical hedge cutters. They are a very lethal machine and should be used with more discretion.  It is not possible to put it into legislation but I would very much like to see a climate of opinion developing where people would at least feel that there was an obligation on them to replace trees when they cut them down.  It is bad enough to cut them down but not to replace them or not to do anything about them in the future is painful and unnecessary.  We have ample opportunity and knowledge to stop that kind of carnage.</P>
    <P>In regard to private forestry development, the Seanad, as it has been known to do in the past, has taken up two different sides of the coin.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Senators Kiely and Mooney felt there was a need to develop private forestry while Senator Ferris and others <Col N="1621" /> felt that there was no guarantee that private forestry would deliver the goods. Some Senators were reading from material which is somewhat out-of-date in this regard.  I know what the pressures are and this can happen all of us from time to time but we have had a tenfold increase in private planting since 1983.  It was 3,200 hectares last year, it will be over 4,000 hectares this year and I will guarantee to this House that it will be over 6,000 hectares next year.  The farming component in that will keep on increasing.  We have also extended the grants to the co-ops so that a co-operative effort is being made to bring groups of farmers together to push private forestry.</P>
    <P>The imbalance between State forestry and private forestry is being tackled.  As Senators know, 85 per cent of the forests are owned by the State.  This is unique by international standards, Europe or otherwise. In Finland, for instance, 65 per cent of the forests are owned by the private sector.  We need to encourage farmers, land owners and others to become more actively involved.  This is not a question of a row between the private sector and the public sector.  There are resources held by groups which we want to release and which will help to create employment and a more stabilished and developing processing industry for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor said that private forestry development had mainly helped insurance companies and banks.  I do not think he is getting the point in this.  Irish investment companies and banks are prepared to invest in forests in the UK.  I want to rehabilitate that money in terms of investment here at home.  There is a considerable amount of financial resources and it is important that it be used here at home rather than in other countries.  I do not think we should object to this development.</P>
    <P>There were conflicting views on section 14.  Senators Reynolds and Ross thought it to be quite restrictive while Senator O'Toole was not adverse to the sale of land in specific circumstances.  The basic intention behind this provision is to ensure that the company does not flog off land to make up for management <Col N="1622" /> deficiencies.  Its purpose is to prevent the sale of the family silver, if you like.  I really do not understand the objections to this provision.  It is being interpreted by some as interfering in the day-to-day management but what we are doing is looking for agreement on a national programme, an annual programme, which can form part of a five-year programme, which limits the capacity that the company might have in a given situation to dispose of lands.  The Minister is entitled to act on behalf of the citizens of this country who have invested large sums of money in forestry.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil The Workers' Party Deputies were concerned that the wording of this section would enable the Minister to force the company to sell land and I promised to look at this.  I have since obtained further legal advice and these fears are groundless.  The Minister cannot force the company, under this section, to sell land.  The company can put up a programme of nil sales and that will obviously be acceptable.  The Government are clearly committed to forestry.  The forestry action programme in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> demonstrates that the record planting targets which have been set will be achieved and that there will be large support for forestry. In a situation of scarce resources, we have targeted forestry as a major developmental activity.</P>
    <P>We are now about to establish Coillte Teoranta.  The funding for this body will be as generous as possible over the next five years and will permit significant planting programmes.  The annual planting programmes for public and private sectors will be decided in the light of situations then applicable.  The memorandum and articles of Coillte Teoranta will give it the power to plant.  Senator O'Toole said that 2,000 forestry jobs were promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The programme said that 250 job opportunities in planting would be created in 1987 and 1988 with an estimated additional 500 jobs in downstream wood industries over the next three to four years which could grow to 1,000 over the next eight to ten years. <Col N="1623" /> Obviously the bigger the forestry programme, the greater its impact on jobs, particularly in the downstream industries.</P>
    <P>Senators were concerned that the Dáil would review the performance of the company.  Section 38 (7) of the Bill allows the Minister to set financial and other targets for the company.  Section 31 (2) allows the Minister to include information on such targets in its annual reports.  These reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas who will thus be able to review the progress.  We fully intend to avail of these provisions. Section 23 provides that dividends received by the Minister for Finance will be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer and the Minister has no choice but to do this.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly was concerned that the company should have compulsory acquisition powers.  We considered this very carefully and we are satisfied that to extend compulsory acquisition powers to the company would give it an unfair advantage over other companies.  I, therefore, decided that the Minister should retain these powers for use at his discretion.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor said there was no overall increase in land under forestry in recent years because of reafforestation and the use of the land reserve.  Again, I think he has got it wrong.  What is one supposed to do with a land reserve? Would a farmer take land for 11 months and not put stock on it or not till it? Should the taxpayer buy land and not plant it?  All I am doing is ensuring that we plant on the land we buy.  I am not concerned about building up a land bank for the next 10 years which we do not plant.  Any funds available to me will be used to purchase land to fill in forest blocks.  The main concentration will be to ensure that the land we have is used. I cannot see why there should be any objection to that.</P>
    <P>With regard to reafforestation, we have a problem with interpretation. Some people understand reafforestation <Col N="1624" /> to mean planting all over the country and going back to the position of some hundreds of years ago.  I am not going to get involved in an argument about that but reafforestation in the modern sense means planting after a first or second crop has been taken.  To object to that is to misunderstand forestry which, in a real sense, is continuity.  If one harvests a crop one replaces it.  About 25 per cent of the planting last year was in that category.  I would love to reach the day when we did not require any more land, when all the land we would be planting would have produced a crop of trees.  Then we would be into the real cycle of forestry and harvesting between 3 million, 4 million or 5 million cubic metres, which is about treble what we have coming from our forests today and would be going back on that land again with a further crop.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor also said that the wood processing arm of the industry was in chaos.  I am delighted to be able to tell him that Finsa Forest Products in Clare are expanding their employment.  Medite in Clonmel also have a fantastic operation producing medium density fibre board for export all over the world.  They too are examining the possibility of expansion. The sawmilling sector, generally, has responded to the extra saw log output from our forests.  New technology has been introduced, dry kiln facilities have been provided and research has gone into stress grading and marketing to ensure that we have a good quality product.  I suggest to the House that we are seeing in private sector processing a new impetus. We have already gained substantially in the construction market which has grown from 13 per cent of the construction domestic market in 1981 to over 50 per cent now.  That has taken a lot of work by people in the Forest Service, in research and in processing, to break down the attitude which was solidly held by people throughout this country, including specifiers, architcts and others who would specify timber other than native timber. We are changing that but it is taking time to do it and a lot of effort has to be put into it.  We want to see further improvements, particularly as we discover the <Col N="1625" /> possibilities in the UK, our nearest neighbour. We must get into that market with a good quality product, hold our gains and improve on them wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris criticised the tender system.  We have tried to improve on that over the years.  There must be a tendering system when the demands that are there in the sawmilling sector cannot be satisfied. We have got to have some mechanism whereby the opportunity is given to people to tender for resources.  As well as the tender system we have introduced a quota system for sawmillers and processors who have an established record, have introduced new technology and are producing good products.  We are able to guarantee them up to 40 per cent of their supplies annually.  We are also having consultations with the Irish Timber Council with a view to introducing auctions where sawmillers and purchasers throughout the country will be free to pick and choose from the supplies available. We have updated our inventory. Not only have we used our own resources to do that but we called in international consultants.  We are able to give an accurate forecast not just for this year but for the next 10 years as to precisely what will be coming from our forests.  Those involved in the pulpwood sector who use thinnings, and those in the small and large saw log sections can know the types, quality and amounts that will be coming on stream.  They can plan in the long term and not just in the short term.  We are not giving figures which we cannot stand over.  These have been checked, and double-checked. We had forecast that we would take out 1.25 million cubic metres last year and we extracted 1.3 million; we were forecasting 1.4 million cubic metres for this year but we think it will be very close to 1.5 million.  Therefore I want to put into context our forecasts with the actual delivery.  I want to nail the lie that is circulating in relation to what is happening in our forests and the process by which timber is becoming available to the industry.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllistrim referred to the <Col N="1626" /> old chestnut, damage by the Forest Service to roads.  We are not the only contributors. We are not any worse than the juggernauts.  The Department of the Environment pay to the local authorities grants in lieu of rates on behalf of the various Departments.  However, I accept that we have a problem.  I do not think it is one that can be solved in the context of this Bill or, indeed, by the Forest Service. I would like to think that some way will be found to improve the country road network.  The question can be more appropriately addressed to a slightly taller Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack was anxious to know how the company will be staffed. Section 43 provides that the staff will come from the Department of Energy. He was also anxious that the company should report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have already included a provision for this in section 31.</P>
    <P>Senator Doherty was concerned about the closure of a nursery in Longford.  That is a regrettable development.  We have had negotiations with the unions and we are offering voluntary redundancies to a number of workers and the remainder will be deployed to other forests.  In a general sense, we are out in the open market and people can import plants into this country from the UK and France at considerably lower costs than we are producing them.  It is because of that that we have had to rationalise.  In the rationalisation programme we have had to concentrate on those nurseries which had the best soil conditions for the production of good healthy plants.  We plant about 50 million plants each year and we require for our programme 35 million plants.  The remainder is virtually lost in the system.  If you examine that closely you will understand that some of the soil where nurseries are located is unsuitable as it produces weaker plants.  The rationalisation is fundamental to ensuring that we have a strong nursery programme. I said last year, and I say it again, that I am not satisfied with a nursery programme which is confined to the domestic market.  In view of the health status we have, the disease-free status in <Col N="1627" /> international terms with no acid rain or real problems with regard to disease in trees, we should look at our nursery programme with a view to satisfying needs in any part of the world and not be confining ourselves to domestic demands.</P>
    <P>It would be nice for the time being to be able to satisfy that demand alone. Therefore, in our rationalisation we are talking about a stronger nursery programme which will cater not only for domestic needs but for international needs and will be strong and competitive enough to do that.</P>
    <P>As Senator Shane Ross spoke I heard tapping on the wall and any knocking I will do of his speech was being appropriately delivered by the building work as he spoke.  I thought that his contribution was quite extraordinary in many ways.  He interpreted some of my statements with an elasticity which was quite extraordinary.  He said that because of necessary procedures and so on in the Civil Service it was not always the best suited for commercial operations.  What we are doing is the same approach as in regard to BTE and An Post and those companies have been very successful. Civil servants transferred directly from Departments into the new organisations and nobody can say there was anything wrong with them before that or subsequently. Indeed, I want to acknowledge publicly the calibre, dedication and commitment to work in the Civil Service. I say that from experience in two Departments, apart from my knowledge in local authorities throughout the country.  They are second to none and we are fortunate to have people so dedicated.  There are officials here tonight and I do not think they will be able to charge for overtime or anything like that.  I would like to publicly acknowledge their work.  Any member who interprets my speech as conveying the impression that I have in some way played down the contribution that the Civil Service or those in the Forestry division have made is wrong.  I object to it and I will try to deal with that claim as best I can.  Within the Civil Service there are constraints and there <Col N="1628" /> are procedures which must be followed. We have reached the stage in forestry development where the people who have been managing and developing estates over the years have been pushing for a change in the organisation.  They see that there are scope and opportunities.  That is one side of the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of civil servants who in the past 12 months took voluntary retirement have gone into private enterprises.  They were very virtually sucked out of the system because of the ability they have which was acknowledged by those in the private sector who contacted them. There can be no doubt about that.  Something similar has happened in Aer Lingus and other organisations too numerous to mention.</P>
    <P>I said that this company would not just be another semi-State board but by some extraordinary convoluted interpretation of the English language Senator Ross interpreted that to mean that all semi-State bodies are inefficient.  I am glad that as a result of my sightline penetrating to the back seats, I can see it has got so hot that Senator Ryan is reacting even though I have not mentioned his name in any derogatory way so far.</P>
    <P>What I said does not mean semi-State bodies are inefficient.  Indeed, many of them, as we know, are quite efficient. What I said means that I am setting a special standard for the new company and there is nothing wrong with that. Why, in Heaven's name, should everything be the same?  If it is different I say it is different and we will make it different.  We have the confidence to do that.  It should not be interpreted as a reflection on civil servants who will be transferring to the new company.  Over the past 12 months the changes that have taken place make me feel happy that the staff who will be transferring will demonstrate that the company is special and different.  That is probably the only way to effectively answer the pessimism, the fatalism delivered by highly-rated Senator Ross.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, and the break-even date, the fact is that our forests are at a certain stage of development. <Col N="1629" /> We cannot realise profits until they reach a certain stage.  Even Senator Ross, with his unique capacity, cannot make trees grow any faster than they are growing. He should know enough about investment to realise that forestry is long term but that does not make it a bad investment. A private speculator would hardly pull out of a good investment just because it had not yet realised its full profit potential and hand it over to somebody else. Why should the State be any different with a very good investment in forestry which will give certain and substantial profits?  Therefore, the State, like a wise private entrepreneur, will continue to fund forestry.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made the point that it was wrong to say the new company might not run into profit in the next four or five years.  I am coming to this House, as I did in the other House, to state the facts. I know from the exhaustive examination we did, and from the consultants we called in to advise us, that it will not be profitable within that period.  What I am saying is that by having the new organisation the break-even date will be brought forward considerably.  I differ from Senator Ross fundamentally on this in that I see that as a saving.  To do otherwise and maintain the same programme we would have to draw on the Exchequer and, consequently, the draw on the taxpayer would be substantially greater.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of making a profit. One is to decide to take action today so as to reap the profits tomorrow.  The other is to decide to do nothing because if it does not happen tomorrow it is too late.  We cannot afford to be that pessimistic. Senator Ross referred to section 14 and I should like to emphasise that this it not a straitjacket on the company.  I have already emphasised that the section seeks to prevent excessive land sales.  The Senator also seemed to condemn section 44 which, as I understand it provides pensions and safeguards pension rights.  I do not know what he feels the company should do in relation to this.  The staff are as entitled to have these rights as they were while in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> I should like to put on record that the forestry development we have today is there largely because of the taxpayer. Between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs have been provided in that sector by successive Governments and the taxpayer.  I do not think Senator Ross should have reflected on that contribution.  What is happening in forestry at the moment, and I want to be the first to acknowledge this &mdash; there are very exciting developments taking place &mdash; could not have been taken were it not for the decisions taken a long time ago in difficult times by different Governments. The staff in the Forest Service, serving and retired, have made their contribution and we have a resource which we can develop.  It is certain, beyond any doubt, in spite of what Senator Ross said in relation to what the private sector would do, that that resource would not be there if we had to depend on the private sector to provide it.  I cannot say what will happen in the future but that is a fact.  I wonder where the 400 picnic sites and parks around the country would have come from or what private entrepreneur would have spent his or her money developing them.  We should acknowledge this publicly, and the staff involved in these developments can be quite proud.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also found something wrong with the staff in the service at the moment moving to the new company and, as he said, still holding the strings. We have more confident people today and I would like to think that when the organisation changes take place &mdash; some of the changes were made in advance of the formation of the company &mdash; they will indicate the commitment that was there in the past will be enhanced in the new company.</P>
    <P>We are not giving the company a blank cheque.  We are doing the best we can to ensure that it will have adequate funds to develop.  To say that because we cannot say exactly when it will be profitable is giving them a blank cheque is wrong. Many private company and enterprenurial decisions are taken without people being able to say exactly when the company will be profitable.  Given <Col N="1631" /> a certain set of circumstances, certain planting targets, market developments, and a number of positive improvements in those areas, which are quite likely, we can bring forward that day.  I do not think it would be proper, in the context of moving the legislation to set up the organisation, to get down to the nitty gritty of saying precisely when exactly the profit date will be.  We can make it as near as possible and leave it at that.  I do not agree with the implication that there is an assurance in the Bill that the company can, willy nilly, decide when it is profitable, when it is not or when it will go to the Exchequer for funds.  That is not the road we are taking.  I do not think the Senator should say that because we are not specifying the break-even date there is something fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not about checking the accounts line for line of a company not yet established.  It is to establish a new company to manage and develop our forests. Indications in regard to the cost of harvesting, the cost of planting, the increased amount of sawlog coming from our forests are that, organisation, following restructuring and other developments, in the future, we are creating an organisation which will prove Senator Ross to be quite wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan wondered why there had not been more development in the private sector, particularly in regard to farmers getting involved in forestry. The grants which are available now date back only to 1981, so that the incentives for farmers to become involved were miniscule.  There is, of course, an historical reason.  Conventional thinking on agricultural development encouraged farmers to develop land for conventional farming, which was highly unsuitable and quite expensive.  In fact, much land is overgrown with rushes following very expensive treatment.  The incentives were not in place.  There was the historical attitude to trees which were associated very often with failure, landlordism and the foreign occupier.  This view is changing now.  We have been working to bring about change through <Col N="1632" /> the farming organisations and the co-ops. I should like to thank them for the cooperation they have given to me.  There are very encouraging signs.  I have already indicated the growth in the private planting area over the last couple of years and I think that will be sustained.  We will leave the past to the historians and we will look to the future with more confidence.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also wanted to know why investors shied away.  One of the reasons was given by Senator Lanigan, the long term nature of the investment and the fact that people were not familiar with forestry.  There is still a shyness and I am doing my best to break down the barriers.  Other reasons included the fact that there were so many gilt-edged opportunities for investments which were safe and risk free.  I regret that we are not a little more willing to take risks.  I would like to see more risks being taken and we will encourage that as far as we can.</P>
    <P>Very often people had a bad experience in forestry.  It was because of the conventional thinking in farming that forestry was pushed into the hills, into inaccessible areas, into low-yielding forests. People got the wrong impression. However, with higher yielding forests coming onstream and a more positive attitude, we can change that thinking.  I should like to take this opportunity to invite investors who have spent their money abroad to think more in national terms of what forestry can do in regional and outlying areas and in creating employment.  We have ideal climatic conditions and ideal soil and happily much of the good land is in areas away from cities and industrial estates.  We can have better rural development, a better balance, and forestry can be tied in with farming, tourism, fisheries and developments of that kind.</P>
    <P>I was asked if we really know that there will be a return.  I was asked if there was doubt in the private sector because there was no possibility of profit.  I will take two yardsticks.  I hope forestry income here will have increased by 50 per cent in our first two years of office.  There is still room for improvement, both on the <Col N="1633" /> cost cutting side in management and in increasing the income limit.  That is a positive indicator.  This year we will be expecting 1.5 million cubic metres, by 1992 it will be two million cubic metres and by the end of the decade it will be three million cubic metres.  Then we can look forward to the day when we will reach break-even and the possibility for profitability.  Senator Brendan Ryan talked about 20 years hence &mdash; I do not know who will live to see it &mdash; but he will be proved wrong on that point.</P>

      <P>We cannot say exactly when that day will be.  I can only guess and that guess will be confined to my trusted self.  With regard to the headage payments, I do not understand the Senator's philosophy that we will be continuing to pay grants for stock that has left the land.  Let us get this straight, forestry is a long term business.  We are trying to get the farmers and landowners involved.  The attachment to land is incredibly deep.  Long before there were any foreign occupiers, scholars wrote in the 6th century and 7th century about the attachment to land.  It is difficult to get people to change from conventional farming into forestry, against the background of oppression, the use for military purposes and so on of the fine oaks that have been used all over the world.  It is one thing to get somebody to change if you can pay them within a year.  It is another thing to tell somebody who is 55 years of age that the real return will come when they are 85.  The national average lifespan for a man is something like 65; and, if you are happy and lucky enough to be of the other sex, you have a chance of about five years longer.  I hope all of you do well on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The headage payment is intended as a compensatory element for taking the stock off the land which is converting to forestry, but it is more important that he or she knows for 15 years after planting <Col N="1634" /> that they are sure of getting some income from an investment which would otherwise produce nothing in terms of income. I think it should be seen in those positive ways.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brendan Ryan in regard to heavy borrowing.  I have stated time and time again that I do not want to see the company lumbered.  It has got a good endowment and it can tolerate some level of borrowing, but it should be carefully monitored and it should not be placed in a position of any financial jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Senator has an objection to section 36.  Well, you have to object to An Bord Gáis and to the National Development Corporation, because it is a provision which is enshrined in all of those.  All it does is to expect the company to comply with what are national pay guidelines. Heaven knows, we have gone through enough on comparability.  We have gone through enough on all of these things over the years to have some sense of balance in all of this.  If one company sets the norm, what happens &mdash; the next one has to follow.  So, we have to have regard to national pay guidelines.  An Bord Telecom and An Post do not have the same provision enshrined.  If you look at section 110 you will see where they have to take directions from the Minister which could imply the same provisions, and there are also other sections which relate to having regard to pay guidelines. I think I have dealt satisfactorily with section 38, to bring you back on course again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add one other thing? If you read through that section you will see where we are talking about particular developments or specified developments &mdash; for instance, private grants.  The control of private grants will be held by the Minister for Forestry.  He will ask the company as an agent to operate these grants; otherwise it means that the Minister has to have the staff to go perhaps to Mayo, when there are technical staff in that area working for the company. <Col N="1635" /> Let us have a bit of sense.  It is not a directive to interfere every day.  It is just a managable provision which has a lot of weight, a lot of strength, and I think it is basically sound.</P>
      <P>Section 39 provides for the transfer of lands.  That is the main provision.  The subsection the Senator referred to is merely there to ensure that the Minister would issue a certificate where there was a doubt as to whether the land was vested or not vested.  It might otherwise be used in a situation where the Minister might for one reason or another decide to retain a certain piece of land.</P>
      <P>In the course of what I have said I have tried to answer as many of the questions as possible that were raised, quite genuinely, by Senators.  I was quite impressed &mdash; as I have often been in this House before &mdash; by the standards set, the research and the effort Senators went into to ensure that they had all the material necessary to improve the provisions of the Bill.  I look forward to having the final Stages tomorrow.  I would again like to thank all of you who have stayed on late to facilitate me in the passage of the Second Stage.  I look forward to continuing the deliberations early tomorrow.</P>
