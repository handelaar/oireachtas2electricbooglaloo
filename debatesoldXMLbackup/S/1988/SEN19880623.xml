      <P>I have notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intercede on behalf of the Sharpeville Six so as to ensure that their execution does not take place.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to increase the diplomatic effort at the appropriate level to secure the release of Brian Keenan, an Irish citizen held hostage in Lebanon.</P>

      <P>During the course of <Col N="1092" /> the debate on Committee Stage of this Bill, I agreed at Senator Robinson's request to review the powers contained in Part II of the Bill to suspend or revoke the authorisation of an insurer or to require information of undertakings from insurers with a view to making these powers more uniform.  The power to revoke or suspend an insurance company's authorisation is contained in several sections of this Part of the Bill and in section 38 in Part III which deals with revocations or suspensions after conviction of an insurer under section 36 and 37.  I have decided to bring all the procedures and requirements relating to the revocation or suspension of a company's authorisation into a new section 56 of the Bill, which also combines the existing sections 56 and 57.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 13, therefore, bring sections 17 (2) and 24 (1) into line with other sections of the Bill which require the furnishing of information to the Minister by a specified date.  Amendment No. 8 allows insurers to appeal to the court against any ministerial direction or objection resulting from his dissatisfaction with the qualifications of directors, managers or authorised agents.  This amendment brings section 20 of the Bill into line with other sections of the Bill where appeal procedures are provided for.</P>

      <P>Section 19 of the Bill deals with the question of prior notice and display of policy terms and premium rates.  Subsection (4) subjects the requirements laid down in this section to the provision of any Council Directive.  I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that there is no need to include this provision as all national legislation is in any event subject to Community law.  I thank Senator Mary Robinson who made the point during the course of Committee Stage for her valuable contribution.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 16 is to make it explicitly clear that the Minister can alter requirements both as regard amounts and percentages in relation to bonds for intermediaries.  The existing wording might not have allowed the percentage figure to be varied and I was concerned about that.  It is important that the Minister should have full flexibility to alter bonding provisions to take account of circumstances and possible developments in the future in the light of actual experience in operating a bonding system in this area.  I am anxious that the Minister would have that flexibility to amend the bonding figure.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister stated on Committee Stage he would consider the request of my colleague, Senator Hogan, that agents would have three rather than four agencies.  I think it is a very serious facet of the Insurance Bill.  It has serious implications.  If agents are allowed to have four agencies, both life assurance and insurance agencies, the danger is of insurance brokers who are working full time in the insurance business being inhibited to become agents rather than brokers.  I think the Minister should consider very seriously giving them only three agencies rather than the four allotted. My colleague, Senator Hogan, dealt with it very well on Committee Stage. There are many insurance brokers that have been working very hard in the insurance business and have cleaned up a lot of practices that have been going on.  It is essential that the brokers be given a fair chance to make an impact.  I do not think that agents should be given the same type of consideration as brokers. I feel that brokers have a better role to play in the insurance business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse what Senator Reynolds has said.  The Minister knows very well that it was the one area of real concern in the Bill.  There were others as well, but this one in particular took up quite a lot of time.  The Minister did agree, as far as I can recall either on Report Stage or before it went to the Dáil, that this matter would be examined again in the light of evidence that came to him.  I am sure Senator Reynolds and Senator Hogan will accept that that is the position.  The view of the House in regard to this problem is that there is no point going back on the history of it and so on, but the Minister said that either on Report Stage or before it went into the Dáil it might be examined or looked at in some detail again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in the course of Committee Stage that I was concerned to ensure that an insurance broker would be in a position to offer his clients a very wide range of choice.  For this reason I decided at that time to set a floor of five agencies for a person wishing to act as an insurance broker to make sure that clients would receive the professional service they expected of and deserved from brokers.  While in practice most brokers will hold more than the requisite five agencies I cannot, unfortunately, agree to a lesser number than that being enshrined in the legislation as the minimum requirement on brokers. While accepting this minimum figure of five agencies &mdash; and the figure I quoted previously supports this &mdash; the inescapable logic is that agents be allowed to hold up to four agencies.  Otherwise, there is a lacuna and there would be a &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo; situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators very much for their very helpful debate on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I did, as promised, have a very close look again at it to see how I could practically meet their points of view.  The more we looked at it the more we came back to the same conclusion, which was that if you accept that brokers must have at least five then anybody operating under any other hat has to start at the immediately preceding figure.  One <Col N="1098" /> has, first of all, to decide whether one moves to the figure five for brokers.  Are we prepared to say that somebody acting for less than five companies could genuinely offer a brokerage professional service? Anything less than that would have a very small share of the market.  Therefore, they could not be said to be independent professionals.  I say again that if we reach the five agencies then the figure four is automatic.  We cannot have a gap between the five and the four; you have got to drop down one.  If you say at least five for brokers, then you must set agents at four.  I have not been able to find a way out of this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I fully understand the Senators' point of view on it, but the logic of what they are saying to me is that you would have to reduce the number of companies that a broker would act for.  If we were to do that, then we would be having brokers who would act for a very small percentage of the market.  That would not put them in the business of being genuine brokers. Unfortunately, I have to stay with the Bill as it is at present drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is reasonably satisfactory.  This is a very controversial area.  I would ask the Minister if there is any further development in the coming months before the Bill goes into the Dáil.  Will he consider looking at any fresh evidence that might influence a change of heart in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One other question I want to ask: if we agree to brokers having five agencies, is it for legal reasons that the agents should then have four agencies?  When the Minister says that the brokers have five agencies, and that we have to start immediately under for the agents to have four agencies, is that legally binding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that this Bill has been around for a long time. It is time to make up our minds on it now. I would ask Senators to recall that there was no cap put on the agency system until this Bill came in.  There was a free-for-all. We have limited the scope of the <Col N="1099" /> freelance agent considerably, not, I appreciate, to the satisfaction of many Senators, but certainly as far as we practically can go at this time.  I am satisfied that this is a major step forward.  Regarding your final question, it will be legally binding once the Bill is adopted.  It is not a legal reason.  The logic of it is compelling. We say that there are brokers and agents. If everybody with five agencies upwards is a broker, and if we reduce the figure for agents, say, to two, what would a person be who has three?  He would not be an agent or a broker; he would be stuck in the middle.  It is just wherever you set the broker figure you simply logically have to have the next one.  It is like when you set a threshold obviously the figure underneath it is the other figure.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 27 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  An undertaking shall be responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter pertaining to a contract of insurance offered or issued by that undertaking, as if the tied insurance agent was an employee of that undertaking.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment places equal responsibility on an insurer in respect of his tied insurance agent as he has for his employee.  Under the provision now being replaced a tied agent was deemed to be the agent of the insurer.  If the agency agreement was narrowly drawn the insurers' responsibility for the actions of his tied agents could be correspondingly narrow.  The equating of the responsibility of the insurer for his tied agent with that for his employee broadens the insurers' responsibility for his tied agent, and further strengthens the consumer protection element in the Bill, which is something I am particularly keen to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess this is an amendment that I am quite happy about. As the Minister knows, I expressed great concern about the whole tied agency system.  I would have further wished that there would be guarantees of training for any agent of the tied agent.  As the Minister knows, what is happening is the tied agent employs, on a commission basis, individuals from particular areas where they work.  They give them crash programming in the insurance industry and let them off selling life assurance to an unsuspecting public and without the knowledge and training they should have. Certainly, this may have the effect of curtailing in some way the tied insurance agent at least from the point of view that the undertaking in question would be conscious of the fact that they shall have a clear responsibility to the tied agent and whoever he employs on a commission basis.  I presume that would be the logical conclusion of this amendment.  If it is, it is certainly one that I agree with.  The Minister and the Department have, as a result of this Bill, a greater insight into the workings of the tied insurance agent. I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to say a special word of thanks to the Senators who stayed here day after day and debated this Bill.  I do not want to mention particular Senators but perhaps the Seanad would understand if I thank Senator Hogan and Senator Fallon for their particular interest in the Bill and their assistance with it throughout the time we spent here.  It is a major piece of legislation designed to improve the insurance industry, improve the standing of the insurance broker and to give consumer protection. I thank the Senators for their passage of this Bill.  I have learned considerably as it now goes to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record my appreciation and thanks to the Minister for his work with us in this legislation.  It has been described as the most important insurance legislation for over 50 years.  I hope that in time it will prove itself to be important for the industry and that it will be of benefit to the industry and to the consumer.  It is primarily in regard to the consumer.  The role of the consumer in the whole insurance industry is vital.  Much of this debate deals with the protection of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been very fair with us. Naturally we would have liked additional amendments to be taken on board, but <Col N="1103" /> nonetheless he has gone a long way and we appreciate it very much.  The Bill is a far better Bill now than it was on coming into the Seanad.  The Senators accepted the fact that it was a Seanad Bill.  They studied and researched it well.  In particular, Senator Hogan was a most fair operator.  He realised that it was above the political system, that it was not a political matter and was one that all of us should involve ourselves in to get the best Bill possible.  I think we have got that. As I said, the question of concern was referred to by the Minister, the question of three rather than four agencies.  That was, of course, one area of contention in the Bill.  There were many others.  The result is that we now have a better Bill. When the Bill came in first the number of agencies was unlimited.  At least now it is tied to a particular figure.</P>
    <P>The agent must also have a consumer bond and he must have his own bank account within the bank system dealing with clients' money only.  We have come a long way.  The same applies to the broker who now must have a minimum of four agencies, a clients' account, consumer bond and a professional indemnity bond.  This is now tied into the legislation. The position of the tied agent has been tidied up better as a result of this legislation. There is the question of a greater awareness and a greater emphasis on the role of the auditor within the insurance company which was tidied up on Committee Stage with a fairly long amendment from the Minister and one which again will give further protection to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and the Senators who participated in the Bill, in particular Senator Hogan who is extremely helpful and fair at all times.  The Bill is far better now than when it came into the Seanad.</P>

This is very serious legislation and nobody has any political axe to grind.  It will be very good for the insurance industry.  I have no doubt that the Minister will come up against the question of the agents and brokers again in the Dáil and perhaps he will have to reconsider his thinking there.  I would like to ask the Minister a final question.  Is there any proposal that the legislation on building societies will come before the Houses quite shortly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall develop guidelines to safeguard <Col N="1106" /> against a degree of interlocking ownership between stations, or with other sections of the media, that would be against the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this new addition to the Bill arises out of one of the more disturbing developments in recent times in the whole area of media control, that is, the extent to which in a number of other countries large monopolies have grown up where two or three people have huge control over, not just as in the past, the newspaper outlets in a particular country, but also over radio and television.  We recognise that a certain amount of concentration of ownership is a fact of life and probably after 1992 will become an even more marked tendency.  There are great dangers in this; there are dangers to democracy itself.</P>
    <P>I made the point last evening about the different tendencies within the media. Specifically, there is the scandalous situation which pertains in Great Britain where large sections of the media are under the control of a small number of people and are totally biased in favour of one political party and ensure that other groups do not get a fair look in.  We are a long way from that and by and large &mdash; not completely &mdash; our newspapers are reasonably fair, our television and radio are also fair in their coverage of politics. Even here already we have a situation where one particular newspaper group already control 11 per cent of all provincial newspapers and probably has about 50 per cent of national readership.  I would hate to see a situation in which there was almost a stranglehold over sections of the media if there was an overconcentration.  I do not think we need bother about it in legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendment we are proposing is simply to establish guidelines to safeguard against a degree of interlocking ownership.  It is a warning shot, an indication that it is not in the best interest of the community as a whole, and that the Oireachtas certainly would never approve of such a situation.  I expect the Minister will agree with me.  I do not <Col N="1107" /> intend to push the amendment.  The views of the Oireachtas at this stage in the legislation about the dangers of too great a concentration of ownership in too few hands is something which is inimical to the overall interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope that nothing in the work of the commission will completely exclude local provincial papers from a share in the ownership of the various stations.  There is a danger of the livelihood of the provincial papers from this legislation.  They have, by and large, served the country well. Some of them are not as financially strong as they would like to be.  I hope in the share out, that the provincial papers will be given opportunity to participate and to make available the very large resources of news gathering, expertise and so forth they have built up over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to re-echo the views expressed by Senator Manning.  It would be important that we get the Minister's views on the record in this area.  We are trying to prevent what is now becoming <Col N="1108" /> common in a lot of areas, that is the concept of monopoly, particularly in regard to the media coverage, ownership of stations and newspapers.  It is in the public interest that there would be a balanced view.  The only way we can ensure that is by not having a monopoly in the hands of any particular grouping.</P>
      <P>We are coming up to 1992 when it will be more difficult for us to ensure that our common interest, our public interest, is served by preventing monopolies.  The Minister will probably respond by saying that there is already a procedure under the Monopolies Bill to prevent this.  We know that the powers under that Bill are limited.  The Minister may refer to them but we cannot influence their decision and they have to make it.</P>
      <P>At least it is a mechanism which is being suggested by the Minister at the moment in the area of Irish Distillers. We are concerned in this area of media communication that the Houses of the Oireachtas should at least express a view that would prevent a monopoly ownership of the airwaves, the media print and otherwise.  It would not be in the national interest that that would be so.</P>
      <P>I also share Senator Manning's view that provincial newspapers should have an opportunity in this area of community broadcasting to be involved.  They were invited by the local Muintir na Tíre grouping, associated with the national community broadcasting, to participate in presentations to the Minister and his predecessors in this area.  They did not respond, as they saw it as infringing on their rights to the supremacy of media communications that they already have. They found that it would be a new dimension to a problem in the area of advertising in particular.  It is appropriate that they should be able to be in partnership with other community interests involved in the area of communications.  There is nothing in the Bill to preclude them from doing that and I welcome that.  The Minister's view is important in the area of monopolisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up this section.  I am aware that the Minister <Col N="1109" /> is as concerned as any of us about the possibility of takeovers in the media and in the context of this new Bill.  I feel I should also add my voice of concern to that of other Members of the House in the context of the amendment put down by Senator Manning and to bring to the attention of the House the concerns that are being expressed internationally in relation to non-nationals.</P>
      <P>This is the area that I would be mainly concerned about.  In the context of what Senator Ferris said about provincial newspapers being involved in local radio and national radio, while I welcome that as a very significant development, if one looks behind the ownership of certain provincial newspapers, one finds that there is an increasing monopoly and an ownership moving towards a situation where there will be very little to distinguish the ownership of national or local newspapers.</P>
      <P>I accept that local newspapers should be involved in community radio. However, it is important that the public should be ever vigilant in relation to this significant development where we will now have number of local radio stations, a national television station and a national radio station which will be open to ownership by non-nationals because of our membership of the European Community.</P>
      <P>I have stated before and I wish to reiterate, that I am very seriously concerned at what I see as an attempt being made specifically by the Rupert Murdoch organisation to infiltrate into the media in this country.  They have set up an office to sell advertising through cable television. In Britain concern has already been expressed by very serious commentators. Aidan White, the International Federation of Journalist's representative writing from Brussels in a recent edition of <i>The Guardian</i> stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media should reflect the good health of a democracy by the transmission of a variety of opinions and views.  Increasingly, such ideas are made meaningless by the dangerous growth of concentration of ownership <Col N="1110" /> in the hands of single-minded entrepreneurs of whom Mr. Murdoch is the prime example.  The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by the failure of national and international political institutions to intervene in this process.  Indeed the recent EC directive on transnational broadcasting does much to assist the ambitions of Mr. Murdoch.  It defines broadcast information as a &ldquo;service&rdquo;, something to be bought and sold like any other commodity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murdoch's Sky Channel, is an example of what we can expect in this country in a very short time.  Mr. White goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Mr. Murdoch's Sky Channel has for a time been beaming into homes throughout Europe.  Parents and teachers in Sweden have been protesting strongly at one of its by-products &mdash; a sudden increase in the popularity of war-like toys among small children.  The advertising of these toys is banned in Swedish broadcasting, but advertisers have used the Sky Channel medium to bypass such inconvenient obstacles as parential preference and national laws.</P>
    <P>Mr. White also says in this letter:</P>
    <P>News and information is the natural literature of democracy, and not just another commodity to be bought and sold on the open market.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is fully conscious of the difficulties in this area but I hope that the commission, and in subsequent years, the Government, will continue to monitor the ownership of the media in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about going into the lobbies for a vote but it concerns me.  There is a great deal of unease among the print media, not because it introduces competition but because the type of competition it introduces might cause many problems for them regarding employment, etc.  In this respect it is right that we should be concerned about it.  That is why we are pressing it on the Minister, to see if he has thought it through fully or if he can throw some light on events that would protect that situation.  I do not know if one can in a competition situation because there when it really comes down to it one is into war.  If a person can take it on he will do so.  This is a danger we are worried about.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that there seems to be an absence of enthusiasm among potential broadcasting contractors.  One wonders if they do not want to openly declare themselves.  If that is the case it makes it a little more suspicious that the competition could be as dangerous as we fear it is.  On the other hand, it might just be that they have not got enough details as yet and they do not know the final mix.</P>
      <P>The reason we are supporting the amendment is that we are really concerned about how far competition can go.  I am not the greatest advocate in the world of the private enterprise system.  I am more into the mixed economy.  At the same time I can understand the rights of people in private enterprise, particularly when you see Super, Sky and other channels like that coming in off satellite.  We could have 15 or 20 channels available to us before long.  Perhaps the same people who use the media for advertising on the Irish channels would also be interested in Super and Sky.  A monopoly can take place in a couple of ways.  We are entitled to be concerned about that.  I hope the Minister can throw some light on the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can be of help <Col N="1112" /> to the Seanad on this.  I was very conscious of the exact concerns expressed by the Senators here this morning at the time I was drafting this legislation.  Section 6 reads:</P>
      <P>The determination of the applications for awards of sound broadcasting contracts.</P>
      <P>It lays down the criteria which have to be taken into account by the commission in awarding contracts.  Subsection (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>In the consideration of applications received by it and in determining the most suitable applicant to be awarded a sound broadcasting contract, the Commission shall have regard to the character of the applicant or, if the applicant is a body corporate, the character of the body and its directors, manager, secretary or other similar officer and its members</P>
      <P>and, very important here in relation to the monopoly question</P>
      <P>and the persons entitled to the beneficial ownership of its shares.</P>
      <P>We are not only looking at the shareholders, managers and everbody else, we are looking at the beneficial ownership of the shares.  Paragraph (g) states that they must look at:</P>
      <P>...the desirability of allowing any person or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue number of sound broadcasting services in respect of which a sound broadcasting contract has been awarded under this Act.</P>
      <P>There cannot be a monopoly on the radio side.  Paragraph (h) states:</P>
      <P>...the desirability of allowing any person or group of persons, to have control of, or substantial interests in, an undue amount of communications media in the area....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the television or radio, but also the print media so they are covered in the monopoly aspect of section 6 (2) (g), and 6 (h).  In getting a licence they <Col N="1113" /> must take into account the possibility of monopolies.  For example, if a group of individuals get a licence and then some major financier decides he wants to move into the radio scene and attempts to buy up the radio licences, buy the shares of the contractor, that is not allowed because any change in the shareholdings and the beneficial ownership of the shares has to be notified to the commission. The commission can then take that into account if it creates a monopoly situation in an area.</P>
    <P>I was also very conscious of the role of the local newspapers, which has been rightly emphasised by Members here this morning.  This is the fourth piece of legislation on this subject that has come before the Oireachtas.  We had the original Government Bill of Fianna Fáil in 1981, a Private Members' Bill put forward by Fianna Fáil and then the Coalition Bill of 1985.  In all of the three previous Bills local newspapers and national newspapers were debarred from applying for licences.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as do the Senators, the very important role of local newspapers in Ireland.  They have a very important function in their immediate areas; they supply information to counties or regions.  They have traditionally been the news gatherers and have been in existence for 100 years or 150 years and even longer.  It is wrong that they should be excluded from participating in some way in the local radio services.  I do not envisage that we would have stations where they would have 100 per cent ownership. That would not be right.  That is covered by section 6 (2) (h).  You cannot have a situation where the local newspaper also own the local radio because the local newspaper could be opposed to particular political parties or opposed to particular individuals.  We know that happens around the country.  It was referred to by Senator Manning last night.</P>
    <P>I believe they should have a role to play.  At least they should be entitled to apply, rather than be excluded.  Let us be quite frank about it.  The existence of radio will have an effect on the potential advertising revenue of some of the local <Col N="1114" /> newspapers.  It is important that they should have the opportunity to involve themselves, with their particular expertise, in news gathering, in view of the regulation regarding the 20 per cent requirement.  They should have the opportunity, being part of a consortium to apply for a licence.</P>
    <P>The question of the length of licence was mentioned.  Although it is not relevant to this amendment I will answer it now.  The length of licence is a matter for the commission but I would envisage a seven year term.  That is what I had in mind when I was considering it.  I assume the commission would be thinking along the same lines but that is a matter for themselves.</P>
    <P>So far as non-national ownership is concerned I share the concerns expressed but we are a member of the European Community and I have to draft the legislation in the way I did.  However, it is my desire to see that the ownership of these stations remains in nationals hands.  I believe that the criteria laid down in section 6 will facilitate that.</P>
    <P>There is no pot of gold for running these stations.  A couple of stations have a potential for a fair return on investment in the Dublin region and also possibly in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  In all other areas the stations will be operating on a fairly tight margin and there will have to be great local and community involvement for them to be viable at all in many cases.  I do not see the Rupert Murdochs coming for Senator Bradford's desired station in north Cork and I think the Tipperary one will be fairly safe as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's word on that.  In relation to national radio and television it will be a question of whether non-nationals will apply, but it is my wish that our own nationals will be running these stations because to survive the stations will have to depend on advertising. If they have not got an Irish ethos and are not targeting the specific Irish <Col N="1115" /> markets they will not get sufficient advertising. RTE have proven this.  RTE's success at the moment is on the basis that they have achieved nearly a 50 per cent rate of home-produced programmes on television.  The home-produced programmes are the most successful as far as advertising rates are concerned.  To compete, independent television must go after the same quality Irish programmes. That, by its very nature, suggests that the ownership, management and direction of it will be in Irish hands, because Irish expertise will know what the Irish market wants.</P>

      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's reply, especially on the question of the provincial papers, where he has gone all the way towards meeting the needs of that case.  I am struck though by the all-party cross-party concern about the dangers of a monopoly.  At this stage I have no intention of trying to hold up this Bill or asking the Minister to bring in further amendments to it, but he could meet our case by taking our amendment to section 14 and if this could be expressed to the Commission as being the view of both Houses of the Oireachtas and in drawing up guidelines, they would bear this in mind.  If that were done it would certainly meet the concern of all of us here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 7, after &ldquo;force&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the procedure for annual review under which a warning could be issued that the contractor is not complying with his obligations, and if the situation had not improved by the subsequent year, the re-advertising of the contract could be announced.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> This amendment is really in the interest of a certain amount of fair play.  A contractor may be falling below the desired standards and there may be special reasons for this which are capable of being rectified or, indeed, a contractor may not be aware that he or she is falling below the guidelines.  I do not feel too strongly about this but in the interest of fair play perhaps some sort of yellow card system might be brought into play so that at an early stage a contractor can be told that he is falling below the required standards and that he has three months, six months or a year in which to show that he is worthy of the licence he was given or otherwise we will have to move against him.  In that way there would not be a sudden arrival at the office one day telling the contractor that he is out of business.  The spirit of this will probably be taken on board by the Commission in any event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not see that there would be an annual review or a yellow card system.  I would see the relationship between the Commission and the contractor as being an ongoing day-to-day arrangement where there will have to be a certain amount of hands-on operation by the Commission at an early stage.  Many of these people will not have been involved in radio before.  By the very nature of it they cannot have been involved in legal radio before because we have never had a legal framework for local radio before now.  Therefore, there will have to be a certain paternal approach by the Commission to the operator. I do not see it as being a yellow card or a warning system but as all coming along together.  If a contractor is found to be violating the rules flagrantly he will be warned by the Commission.  There are procedures laid down as to how this will be done and they can take his licence and the contract from him.  If that is done in an unfair manner, which is the the point Senator Manning is covering, I suggest that there is recourse to the law at all times available.  A contractor should have recourse to the law and be able to go to the courts and say that he has been <Col N="1117" /> fulfilling the contract he entered into with the Commission and the Commission rescinded that contract unfairly and he should be entitled to get his contract back or entitled to compensation.  It is covered in many ways here rather than necessarily in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am basing my question on the experience that seems to have appertained in certain parts of the United Kingdom where, in the initial stages of application, an example of a programme schedule is attached to an application to the Commission and subsequently it is found that that programme schedule bears very little relationship to the actual schedule.  Could the Minister clarify if, in such an event, this section would then come into play and that would be construed as having given false or misleading information?</P>

The Commission could say to the contractor that he made a commitment to provide a service and is not keeping it and that if he does not provide a proper service they will take action against him.  It would only be as a last resort that they would resort to this draconian section and terminate the contract.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the thinking behind this section and what he has in mind when he says in line four of that section: &ldquo;to meet specific special interests&rdquo;.  Is he thinking about a situation of emergency?  I am thinking in terms of Dublin.  If a licence was granted to a station which was specifically engaged, say, in educational programming or, say, a station dedicated to covering youth concerns, or a station which was specifically about agriculture that, because it had one service in view it would not be required to fulfil the demands made by the Commission on the other stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This arose out of debates in the Dáil on Second Stage.  A number of Members expressed the view that there could be a very specialist type station in a town or local region, for example, in the southside of the city you <Col N="1119" /> could have a serious music station for a number of hours in the evening, or a jazz station for a number of hours a couple of evenings a week.  We will have a situation where they would not have to provide the news and current affairs coverage that is already being covered anyway by the national and other independents in the area.  For example, it would not be appropriate to split up an opera with news headlines and current affairs programmes. It is for specialist-type music stations or the educational station or others like that.  They are matters for the commission to look at.  The specialist music station was the idea behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assume that there would have to be a very strong case made to the commission, that this would not be something that would be given out to any special interest group, that the case and the proven capacity to put forward a programme of serious music or education or whatever would have to be made and that these would be given fairly sparingly? May I ask the Minister if any discussions are taking place between his Department and the Department of Education about the greater use of radio and television for educational purposes and if he sees a new role after this legislation for educational radio and television?  With a greater number of people taking early retirement and with more leisure the demand for access to continue in education is huge. I can see it already in my own constituency. I can see it right across Dublin and I am sure it is the same in the country. We would all like to see the new radio and televison services playing their full part in meeting this need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point.  As far as the educational aspects are concerned, I know my colleague the Minister for Education, who is primarily responsible in this area, is very conscious of it.  She is giving detailed examination to the potential not just of the new commercial stations but also of the role of RTE in the whole educational area and she is re-examining that whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> On the derogation from the requirements relating to news and current affairs programming, I can assure the Senator that there is no question of this being a sort of &ldquo;everybody is out&rdquo;, it is going to be applied very sparingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, could I ask him to clarify the position.  Is the thinking behind this section that the news and current affairs requirement would apply almost <i>in tolo</i> to the county style station, the first tier stations, but we will see a flexibility in the town stations and in the limited area stations rather than just the specialised stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the town stations also having to carry the 20 per cent news content but it could apply to a specialised type of station in a town rather than a normal station in a town.  It is in a very exceptional case that the derogation is going to be allowed.  It would be a very special type of station that would be allowed this derogation.  The normal criteria will apply across the board with the exception &mdash; I would say there would only be one or two, if there are one or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a requirement in the legislation that RTE co-operate with the private sector contractors in the use of some of their facilities.  We discussed this on Second Stage.  Senator O'Toole, in particular, raised the problem about RTE's ability to be able to charge for the use of their facilities because of the Minister's intervention.  I am not aware of the Minister's response to Senator O'Toole's point.  Why is the Minister interfering with RTE's right to charge?  I take it that the Minister does not interfere <Col N="1121" /> in the day-to-day running of affairs, or the charges for advertising in the medium.  The national radio station could make money from the use of their facilities but we have ministerial intervention in the process.  Perhaps there is a legitimate reason, the Minister may wish to ensure that RTE do not out-price their facilities in such a way that they would not be available to the private sector? Whatever the reason, I would like to have it put on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right to talk of the provision that RTE will have to co-operate with the new radio and television station by offering the use of their masts, site and other facilities but inevitably one wonders whether in the long term it would force them to carry the signal for those other stations?  Is that what this means?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A totally separate frequency will be available for the independent radio and television services. The key to having it in is that RTE by the very nature of the development over 60 years have had the particular choice sites around the country that are the centre of the co-ordinates for particular frequencies, and it will be essential to use some of these sites.  The reason for the arbitration system being there is exactly to cover the point made by Senator Ferris.  Obviously RTE are going to be in competition with the independent services. If there was no arbitration mechanism available RTE can say to the commercial operator, you can come in and use our site but you are going to pay £100,000 a year for it while the going rate might be £20,000 a year.  There has to be some mechanism for the independent operator to come to the Minister and say: <Col N="1122" />&ldquo;Look, this is ridiculous.  The £100,000 charge is not an economic proposition. Would you look at it and give us a reasonable price between what RTE are demanding and what we think is a reasonable price.&rdquo;  It is open to the Minister of the day to bring in outside consultants and arbiters to advise on a fair figure between RTE and the commercial radio. It is only commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <P>Is that a clear indication of the third TV channel?  There is no difficulty with the signal?  I am pleased with the Minister's reply.  It is a very serious consideration.  Without being facetious, to allow them to get to the stage of using the RTE signal would be tantamount to somebody allowing Guinness to distil whiskey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We just want it on the record.  I know that constitutionally the Minister would have to have regard to the overall good.  The Minister should ensure that our national media is not ripped off for the benefit of the private sector or <i>vice versa.</i>  There has to be an element of regard for everybody's interest in this.  The Minister will have to have regard to the fact that these facilities were provided by the public through the tax system, licence fees and all the other areas of public funding.  I am absolutely certain that the generous reciprocal arrangement that RTE must provide would not be so forthcoming if the situation were reversed.  I am positively sure of it because it has been our experience in the past that the private sector are not as co-operative in assisting the public sector especially when there is competition between them.  I am satisfied with the Minister's response.  I hope he will avail of outside arbiters if there is a large area of disagreement between the two sides.  The principle is appropriate. There are some of these major mast heads around the country and from a planning point of view it would be inappropriate to duplicate them in other areas when they could avail of them.  I think <Col N="1123" /> the balance is about right but I want to query it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am within the bounds of the section because there are two areas I would be anxious to hear the Minister's views on?  Community access is becoming increasingly important.  Is it envisaged in this section that if an approach is made by a community grouping. RTE would be legally obliged in commercial terms to give their facilities such as cameras, studios and technical expertise for the making of programmes for the independent sector?  Secondly, does the Minister foresee in the context of this section that RTE, if approached by the independent radio sector, be they the town stations or the next tier, for the provision of news and sports services could sell such services at the going rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is going to be great potential for RTE to sell their services on sports etc. in local areas to the local stations and there is nothing barring RTE from doing it.  It would make great commercial sense for RTE to get involved in selling some other news and shorts services, but there is no question of this section allowing community access to the extent of the use of their cameras and other equipment.  This section specifically relates to the use &ldquo;of any mast, tower, site, or other installation or facility needed in connection with the provision of transmission facilities for sound broadcasting.&rdquo;  It is only the transmission facilities we are talking about and not the actual programme content.</P>
      <P>In Part IV of the Bill however, the Senators will see that I have written into the Bill encouragement for the whole area of independent producers of programmes. I would hope that the job potential and financial reward from a national point of view of a thriving independent production sector will be taken up and will be encouraged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying they cannot be used.  I am not saying they have to be used.  They can use the RTE masts and facilities but they will pay for them. They can do it.  Also we have entered into arrangements with Bord Telecom, who have a series of towers all over the country and there is no difficulty in putting up an extra facility on the Telecom towers.  It is not a question of going through the whole procedure of planning delays that we went through with Radio Tara.  These existing towers around the country can be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the existing facilities owned by RTE, such as masts and lines? My reason for asking is that the provision of lines into RTE for news and sport are through the good offices of Telecom Éireann and it is their facilities that are used.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that RTE have to pay Telecom Éireann for that service?  From my experience in working in the outside broadcast field whenever I go to a location there is always <i>in situ</i> an employee of Telecom Éireann. I wonder if the Minister sees any conflict between Telecom Éireann and RTE in the provision of facilities as envisaged in this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will mean extra business for Telecom Éireann.  They are very happy to provide any facility and as Minister responsible for Telecom may I say I am delighted with the extra business that is going to come Telecom's way.  In relation to the television, the optic fibre system will be used to connect the MMDS towers around the country with the cable <Col N="1125" /> system and that will mean retransmission rather than using the transmission towers of RTE for the television.  The towers are owned by RTE.  The connection between them belongs to Telecom but the structures and the sites are RTE's and it is more the sites we are concerned about.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to assure Senator Manning that my foresight in this area as in so many other areas of public administration and public life is just spot on.  I can say that a number of groups in our society have indicated an interest in running a television service in this country and when this legislation is passed, as I hope it will be completed today in the Seanad, and when the service is advertised, I have no doubt that there will be further groups coming forward willing to provide the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that from an Irish point of view we have a further channel with an Irish ethos assisting RTE 1 and RTE 2 to tackle the flood of channels that will be coming into Ireland over the next couple of years.  Already it is happening in relation to the number of satellite stations we have and as you know Astra is going up and we are going to have more channels.  We have the BSB also going up with more channels coming in.  There is this whole flood of influence from abroad much of it very good, very <Col N="1126" /> enlightening, very rewarding and enriching but we need something else as well as RTE 1 and RTE 2 to try to change the balance from two against 15 or 20, to at least improve it to the extent of three, and to give the Irish viewers a choice of another Irish station is very important. To answer the Senator's question, I have no doubt it is not just a pious hope but a realistic expectation that we will have Channel 3 on air in October 1989.</P>

Is the Minister aware and what weight would he give to the view &mdash; which is expressed in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday &mdash; which is held by many of the more cautious people in RTE that such a third channel could do a great deal of harm to RTE 2 and we may end up with two fighting channels, RTE 1 and the independent Channel 1 and with a lame duck in between and maybe an extra drain on the Exchequer.

      <P>Section 17 deals with the question of contracts for the provision of <Col N="1127" /> a television programme.  I raise this not in a cynical way because we all know, as the Minister said earlier, that certain sectors of the media come down in favour of certain political parties or political options and so on.  There is nothing wrong with that.  In a democracy there is nothing wrong with that.  Because of the fact that such discrimination exists, when people are applying for contracts, it might be better if their intentions were publicly-stated beforehand.  It would place more obligation on the people seeking contracts from the Commission.  That is not to say I would want anybody to apply for the purpose of objecting; there are other opportunities in the Bill to do so.  The question of freedom of information if you like is akin.

      <P>I dealt with this question before.  That is after the decision is taken. Before a decision is taken &mdash; and we discussed this last night on an amendment in the name of Senator Manning &mdash; the position is that the advertisement is inserted inviting tenders.  Let us say four or five people apply and one is successful. The four, who are unsuccessful, could represent major groups with quotations on the Stock Exchange.  The fact that they are publicly associated with the failure of application can damage their share values.  All applications would be dealt with in the strictest confidence.  On any <Col N="1128" /> one application there could be a number of personalities in the existing electronics media area in RTE; there could be a number of them associating themselves with an application, without making it known to RTE, in strictest confidence with the Commission.  Let us suppose their application is refused.  Therefore, they will not be leaving RTE.  They will remain working in RTE.  If all of the details of their application were released to the general public, it could compromise them in their existing employment.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill which debars any unsuccessful applicant or applicants from making the details of his, her or their application available to the general public after a decision is made in relation to the successful applicant.  For example, if somebody feels aggrieved that the range of programmes being offered by them, their type of financial structure, the type of personalities involved merited greater support, that they should have been the successful applicant and not the one chosen by the Commission, there is nothing to stop them from making known to the general public and media the details of their application to the Commission.  The same applies to every other contract.  For example, if one tenders for a job to build a road, it will be the successful applicant only that will be published; the unsuccessful ones will not be.  That does not debar anybody who has made an unsuccessful application from making known its details.</P>

      <P>In preparing the legislation and in deciding on an alternative television channel, I looked at the position of RTE 2.  If I went down the road of making RTE 2 the independent channel, I would not have achieved my objective, which is to provide a further Irish-based choice for Irish viewers.  That would have meant there would have been two channels only rather than the three I am trying to provide.  RTE 2 have already <Col N="1129" /> responded to the challenge of the independent station.  What they are doing is this: they have re-examined the role of RTE 2.  I know that, from the autumn schedule on, there will be a totally revamped RTE 2 which will aim to cater for a major slice of the market even in competition with RTE 1; rather than being the baby brother it will become the full twin.  I have no doubts about the health of RTE 2 in this respect.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for his lengthy and detailed reply.  There have been a number of articles in the media in recent weeks, more specifically Colum Kenny writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 May, in which he made rather scurrilous allegations about the secrecy that might surround applications, about the Minister's role.  I am delighted that the Minister has clarified exactly what is his role and that of the Commission. Following on what the Minister said in relation to RTE 2 television, a little publicised fact is that earlier this year RTE announced that they were making a provision of £2 million to the independent film sector.  Obviously this, too, is to be welcomed in the context of what the Minister has said about the future of RTE 2 television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is in relation to <Col N="1130" /> what the Minister has said, that a reasonable amount of programming on the third TV channel should be of Irish and EC origin and that a reasonable proportion of that programming should be provided by independent producers.  Whoever is fortunate enough to get the franchise to run this new channel will be in a position to make a decent profit.  Unlike radio, television is the big growth field worldwide at present.  I want to make the following suggestion.  I support that a percentage of Irish programmes should be produced by independent producers, as is the case with Channel 4 in Britain.  This would in a way help in developing a new industry to provide many job prospects for our young people.</P>
      <P>The independent production sector in Britain has been given an enormous boost by the imposition of a 25 per cent quota on both ITV and the BBC.  This has led to a considerable increase in the number of people employed in the manufacturing of TV programmes there.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the notion of imposing a quota system on this new channel for Irish independent production.  Indeed he might also think about imposing a similar quota on RTE. The way in which this clause is worded is somewhat vague and could mean that a &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; of Irish and EC programming involved only the Angelus, the weather forecast and the news.  It would be a mistake if the Minister were to lose this once-off opportunity to help to develop this new technology-based industry.  It should be our responsibility to ensure that the jobs potential provided in this Bill is maximised and spread as widely as possible.  I ask the Minister earnestly to consider an amendment which would ensure that a minimum quota of Irish independent production will be written into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to this is that I have been very anxious and I share the Senator's concern in relation to independent production.  I was very anxious to see the independent production sector being encouraged here. That is why, in drafting the Bill, I asked <Col N="1131" /> for the purpose of ensuring compliance with its provisions it should read that the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service (a) is produced in the State or in another member state of the European Communities and (b) is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations.  That is specifically designed to encourage independent producers and our home producers.</P>
      <P>The reason I chose the phrase &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; was to keep in line with the draft agreements at Council of Europe level and EC level on this whole question of television services.  These two regulations are being drafted at present, one a convention in the Council of Europe and another, a directive, in the EC.  It is for that purpose that I chose the words &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; rather than a specific quota.  I am anxious to avoid quotas and use wording which will be consistent with European directives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of my interests in the question raised by Senator Cassidy in relation to section 18 (4) (a) and (b).  While I fully accept the Minister's response in relation to having to keep within the guidelines of our colleagues in the European Community &mdash; as the Minister is aware &mdash; I have expressed certain disappointment that, from an Irish viewpoint, perhaps we did not press harder, or perhaps we should not agree fully with the directive which is currently being formulated in Europe in relation to European programme quotas.  For the benefit of the House, the history of this is that the European Community in recent years, foreseeing the onslaught and anticipated invasion of the Rubert Murdoch-type extra-terrestrial channels, felt that there was a need for Europe to come together, to agree on a consensus in relation to programming so that the European identity could be protected primarily against pulp television from America.  There was a proposal originally that there be a quota imposed in relation to programmes originating within the European Community. This figure varied between 40 and 60 per cent and was something I welcomed.  I know that the Minister, from his discussions on this and earlier reply &mdash; holds that aspiration dear in relation to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it seems to me that &mdash; in the context of the two conventions which are the subject of review and will be completed before the end of the year, one emanating from the European Community and another from the Council of Europe &mdash; the concept of a programme quota of European programmes has been dropped.  I know that this phrase incorporated in this section &mdash; a &ldquo;reasonable <Col N="1133" /> proportion&rdquo;&mdash; is now the European norm.  I would hope that the Minister, in replying, might give some indication as to whether the Government's thinking in this area might change.  My reasons are that Ireland, as the Minister said earlier, through the national television station, is already operating a quota of home-produced programmes in the region of 40 to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would seem to me that there would not be a danger &mdash; if one perceives it to be such &mdash; of alien cultures coming into the Irish television network because we would be operating an acceptable quota of home-produced programmes; after all Ireland is part of Europe.  There seemed to have been a suggestion earlier that, were we to agree to a quota of European-based programming, we would be liable, or obliged, to import programmes from other cultures, in other languages whose costs would be prohibitive and also might not meet general approval on the part of our television audience here.  However, RTE are operating already a national quota of 40 to 50 per cent which comes well within the suggestions being made originally about a quota.  I saw the Irish Government's stance as being that if we were to argue for a quota in Europe it would mean that the independent television sector, the national television service and this new proposed national television service would be in a position to sell programmes of an Irish nature to our European colleagues who would have to adhere to a programme quota.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because European television stations have not been adhering to a European quota that they have now, in a sense, passed the buck and have introduced this rather nebulous term &ldquo;a reasonable proportion&rdquo;.  Meanwhile, the Sky channels, the Lifestyle channels and the various other channels that have been talked about will now go their merry way, will be broadcasting throughout Europe, cross borders, transnational.  The type of programming they will be transmitting, if one is to go on experience to date, of the cable television channels coming into this country &mdash; will be cheap American <Col N="1134" /> imported programmes.  I have nothing against the Dallas-Dynasty concept of television programming, which is an important aspect of any television schedule, but I would be concerned that standards would fall if there was not to be an imposed quota, that our identity as a nation, our culture, our ethos, all of the things that the Minister has quite correctly talked about throughout this Bill, may be diminished as time goes on and we in Ireland with our 4,000 year history could find ourselves in a very short time becoming part of this mishmash of internationalism and our Irish identity would be lost.  In that spirit I expressed my concern to the Minister originally that from an Irish view &mdash; point, it was in Irish interests to ensure that there would be some form of a quota or at least that there would be an aspiration &mdash; that is all this is &mdash; not only to protect the European identity but to give a very valuable platform to Irish independent film makers and Irish television producers to sell their wares in Europe.  Television creates a vorocious appetite and with 16 to 20 channels coming onstream in the next couple of years thece is no possibility that television contractors will be able to obtain the amount of new programmes they will need to satisfy their multinational audience and they are going to resort to repeats and to cheap repeats.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;cheap repeats&rdquo; I will give one little statistic.  I understand that the cost of buying in and transmitting a show like &ldquo;The Lucy Show&rdquo; which has been running for some 30 years now around the world would be no more than £10 per programme.  When one compares that with the costs that are being bandied around for the production of one hour of drama or of home-produced programmes which run into thousands of pounds, it give some idea of the temptations that will be there for transnational television operators to buy in the cheaper programmes whereas if a quota was imposed they would have to buy in the more quality type programmes.  I do not want to dwell on this but I think the Minister has got my point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify this for Senator Mooney and the House.  I accept fully what he wants and the principle of having as much of our own native programmes on our own channels as possible.  I refer him to section 6 (2) (e) which reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  In the consideration of applications received by it and in determining the most suitable applicant to be awarded a sound broadcasting contract, the Commission shall have regard to....</P>
      <P>(e)  the extent to which the applicant will create within the proposed sound broadcasting service</P>
      <P>in that case it means television as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>new opportunities for Irish talent in music, drama and entertainment:</P>
      <P>Section 18 (3) (a) provides:</P>
      <P>(3)  The Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under this Act shall in its programming&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
      <P>In putting it into operation section 18 (4) provides:</P>
      <P>(4)  For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  is devoted to original programme <Col N="1136" /> material produced therein by persons other than the contractor,...</P>
    <P>With respect, the Senator seems, to misunderstand the situation in relation to the quota.  Firstly, RTE does not have a quota provision.  They have received a target of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of home-produced programmes. The quota as defined by the EC and by the Council of Europe in deciding upon the 40 per cent or 50 per cent would exclude all news, all sport and all game shows; the 40 per cent would have to be on top of that.  If you take RTE's position and leave out news, sport and games shows, RTE's home-produced productions are down to about 20 per cent. It would be unfair to our own stations to put in a quota as such and to be as rigid as a quota.</P>
    <P>To return to the point I made on Second Stage, I mentioned again last night and today, for the channel to succeed it must be attractive to the viewers. It can survive only on advertising because it gets no State finances other than advertising revenue as its only means of support. RTE have shown that the only way to be attractive to the viewer in the main is by having Irish programmes, and Channel 3 must, in its own interest, concentrate on home quality programmes, otherwise it will not get the viewership. It will only be one more of the channels referred to by the Senator in his contribution; it will be one more other channel without any particular Irish ethos.  Its attraction to the Irish people will be its concentration on home-produced programmes meeting the criteria laid down here in relation to an encouragement of Irish drama, Irish entertainment, Irish culture and the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland, and the fact that, a reasonable proportion of its original material must be produced here.  I believe the road I have taken rather than the quota road &mdash; we both want to get to the same destination &mdash; is the right one and I ask the House to accept my judgment in that.</P>

      <P>Is there a great deal of untapped advertising resources in Ireland?  If not, then much of what Senator Mooney has proposed cannot be achieved, and therein lies the difficulty. I have not got the answer, but it is going to be quite difficult for the national station, with the criteria they have to function under, to generate enough revenue from this so-called untapped source of advertising. This element worries me in regard to this section.  We have to deal with the EC, and there is no problem with that.  I understand the necessity for the news and current affairs programmes etc. but the whole thing still boils down to whether in the final analysis the RTE national radio lobby will get a better whack out of this because there is no great resource of untapped advertising.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister said and it is important that it be put on the record of the House.  I do not wish to detract from what has been an excellent job in relation to our national television channel.  I was acting a little like the dog with the bone, not wanting to let go totally, and using this section to amplify and extend the argument into the European context and the very difficult ongoing discussions that the Minister was having with his European colleagues.  I am concerned that the ethos of our national stations across Europe could be danger and to that and I quote from the <i>Independent</i> newspaper in Britain in which Mr. Hurd, Home Secretary, with responsibility for broadcasting like our Minister here, has expressed some opposition to the suggestions being made both in the Council of Europe and in the European Community directive.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Britain also objected to elements within the EC directive which most crucially would attempt to force British television channels to broadcast Continental programmes and that the concern centred on programmes quotas which would seek to set an eventual 60 per cent of programme time on each <Col N="1138" /> television channel for European Community originated programming.  Further, the quotas would seek 10 per cent of programme budgets to go to independent European producers.  He believes that inflexible quotas will be impossible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>not for the national television channel</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;for many of the new satellite channels to meet.  Most of these which are British based are going to rely heavily on repeats of American programming.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we in Ireland must protect our own interests.  The Minister and I are at one on this and I want to make that perfectly clear.  Perhaps when these discussions come up again the Irish stand point will be stated clearly and there will be encouragement to the independent sector in Ireland and people like Neil Jordan will get an ongoing opportunity to develop their talents and sell their programmes into Europe.</P>

      <P>On the redefinition of broadcasting and the MMDS which is to be introduced under the amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, I would like the Minister to clarify a few points.  I understand that a Canadian study into the effects of microwaves had been sent on to his Department.  It was implied in this that fairly light exposure to microwaves caused problems with small animals. The MMDS is a multi-directional signal.  It sends microwaves into the atmosphere.  Apparently microwaves are absorbed by the body as energy and then converted into heat.  Is the Minister <Col N="1139" /> absolutely certain that there is no health hazard involved in MMDS?</P>
      <P>My second point is in regard to the use of MMDS for the relaying of television signals.  I understand that MMDS is a line of sight method of relay and that hills, buildings or vegetation can prevent the signal from travelling.  Many people in rural Ireland at the moment who are getting a multi-channel service will not get the multi-channel service under this system if they are in glens or behind hills where the line of sight signal cannot proceed. In terms of the type of investment involved, is it justified, when we consider that satellite technology is now developing, that because the technology is developing the cost of receiver dishes and so on would be reducing?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> We in the Labour Party are rather puzzled at the presence of subsection (4) in section 8 of the Schedule.  It seems to fly in the face of accepted practice in the matter of rights of workers.  I would ask the Minister to clarify for us why he thinks it is necessary to include that in the Schedule. Our reason for putting down amendment No. 10 is that we contend that the people who are involved in the contract end of the Commission's business, whether at local radio or television level, should be paid the same rates of pay and have the same conditions of service as people employed by RTE.  In general, our amendment relates to trade union representation and protection of workers' rights.  If this type of protection is not there, we could end up with sweatshops because many young people are very anxious to get into the media and broadcasting business.  We are very concerned that there is protected salary structure and that conditions of work are protected.  To refer back to section 4, does this imply that the contract of service would debar someone working for the Commission from his or her right to bring an unfair dismissals case before the Employment Appeals Tribunal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 proposes to remove the right of the Commission to remove a member of the staff from office.  That could not be accepted. The Commission must have such a right. It would be extraordinary, for instance, that the Commission would not be able to sack a member of their staff who is guilty of serious misconduct or fraudulent activity, and that is what is proposed in amendment No. 9.  The Commission will, of course, be subject to all natural justice requirements in relation to the dismissal of staff, including the Unfair Dismissal Act.  Amendment No. 10 is equally unacceptable. The normal industrial relations arrangements for terms and conditions of employment will apply to the staff of the Commission.  The terms and conditions of employment of the staff of contractors will be a matter of settlement between the parties concerned in the normal way. I have no intention of accepting an <Col N="1141" /> amendment which would impose the same terms and conditions as RTE are operating under.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's immediate response to what we are attempting in this amendment.  To say that the Commission may at any time remove any member of the staff of the Commission from being a member of its staff is provocative and draconian, and a totally unnecessary provision in the year 1988.  Nobody on the Labour side of the House or any trade union would suggest that any employer would not have the right to dismiss somebody who was guilty of an offence.  The employee would also have the right to go to an unfair dismissals tribunal and fight his case and possibly would lose it if there was an element of dishonesty or otherwise, but the days are gone for writing into legislation the right to hire and fire.  This House should recognise that we would feel that the normal employer-employee relationship should be there and nobody will remove anybody's right to sack somebody who is guilty of doing something wrong. However, this goes beyond that and provides &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;&mdash; they could decide in the middle of the week.  It is provocative as it is worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment is trying to ensure that with the privilege that the private sector are getting from the Houses of the Oireachtas in setting up stations which will be in direct competition with the national stations, the entitlements of employees in that area would be the same as prevails in a similar kind of business in a similar area.  When the IDA encourage industrialists to come in here, multinationals in particular, they always require them to recognise the right of a trade union to negotiate on behalf of the members who would be employed in the company.  That is an acceptable principle in Government when dealing with multinationals or anybody setting up a business here and it is in the company's own interest.  With very few exceptions, the norm is that people going into business recognise the accepted standards in an area and the <Col N="1142" /> desirability of a trade union dealing with problems.  Some companies have another structure which they claim is even better than trade unions and that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>We will all be depending on the trade union movement to support this industry. I said the other day that many of the NUJ representatives were already working in pirate stations, so it is obvious that the trade union, even recognising that they are pirate stations, represent workers in them to ensure that they are not exploited just because they are employed by pirates.  It is an essential concept.  We want to get on the record of the House our reservations about the use of such strong words &ldquo;that they may at any time remove&rdquo;.  We are not taking away the right to remove under normal working conditions but the phrase as it is here could be misrepresented.</P>

I agree with the Minister that it would be totally unrealistic to expect small stations down in the country to have the same conditions of employment, salary scales and terms as apply in RTE at present.</P>
      <P>One of the great challenges facing many of these stations will be to use their ingenuity and the enthusiasm of their workforce to get over some of the restrictive practices, which are only gradually being weeded out in RTE.  We have had cases in RTE of producers who have not produced programmes for years on end and yet are on full salary.  One could go right down through it.  In fairness, RTE have faced up to this in recent years. Normal procedures and the normal element of competition will ensure that the type of amendment which is being proposed will not be needed.</P>

      <P>For clarification, to help in this debate before it goes too far off the rails, what is written in here is exactly what operates in RTE.  The Broadcasting <Col N="1143" /> Authority Act under which RTE operate provides that: &ldquo;13 (3).  The Authority may, at any time, remove any officer or servant of the Authority from being its officer or servant.&rdquo;  Nobody suggests that that is improper in relation to RTE.  On the contrary, the further amendments ask me to do the same as RTE are doing.  It is being drafted to allow the Commission to do the same as the RTE Authority. There can be no argument with it.</P>

      <P>I have a certain sympathy for this amendment.  I do not understand why the provision is in at all.  The Minister might give us some help on this.  If it is in because it is copying the RTE legislation that is not a good enough reason for it to be in.  It is completely unnecessary to put this sort of stipulation into legislation.  I would have thought it went without saying.  I am not convinced (a) that it is necessary and (b) that it is normal.  I would be suspicious that this sort of thing is written into legislation and may used at some future date for purposes for which it is not meant.  In principle, I am opposed to writing powers into legislation which are there almost by implication already.</P>

      <P>I concede that any employer has the right to select his employees.  At any time if their conduct is prejudicial to the good interests of the company, he has the right to dismiss them.  Then it is up to their trade union to deal with the problem.  I accept the Minister's point that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not there.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used, but the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; nowadays, even accepting that it is in the legislation which governs the broadcasting authority, is not appropriate.  We have been debating the question of industrial democracy for many years.  We have developed as far as the two tier with the sub-board, and I hope we will develop further in this regard.  The time has come for change and now is a good time, with a Bill such as this, to say that it is not really necessary, although we need not delete it.  Every employer has that power.  The word used is not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, if it was, we would probably <Col N="1144" /> be going in and out of the division lobbies. The word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo; which is not positive.  The Minister has room to reflect that it may well have stood the test of time in RTE, but times have changed and we are dealing with a much more complex position now and the Commission are dealing with varied areas, smaller companies, groups etc.  It would be appropriate at this time to accept that that provision is the only real black feature of the Bill as a whole.  It is a good Bill and we are going a long way with it.  I doubt very much whether, if the Minister was an employer sitting across the table from people he was negotiating with, he would want that put into an agreement.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister telling me that if this subsection was not in here the Commission would not have the right to dismiss a member of their staff?  If that is the case we would not want to remove it.  Really it is unnecessary, and Senator Ross has summed up our views on the matter.  It is superfluous in that it is accepted that people, including employers, have certain rights.  We want to try to repair some of the damage that have been done in other areas because of the way people dig in their heels in this regard.  This is unnecessary legislation in 1988.  When the provision was introduced it might have been considered necessary. People even questioned the right of a previous Minister to abolish the RTE Authority, when he considered he had that right.  There are always people who will question what you do.  I want the Minister's confirmed assurance that without this section the Commission could never sack anybody.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I am assured that is the reality.  It is merely an enabling power.  The parliamentary draftsman in deciding on the form of the legislation insisted that it should go in.  It is not intended to be used other than in normal circumstances when the Commission must have some rights.  It would be extraordinary if it was not contained in the Bill <Col N="1145" /> and the Commission were unable to sack a member of their staff who was guilty of serious misconduct or fraudulent activity. I want to reassure the Senators here today and the House generally that the Commission will be subject to all natural justice requirements in relation to the dismissal of staff, including the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  On this whole question of relationships between employers, employees, the Government and trades unions, the relationship between this Government and the trade union movement is very close through the involvement of both in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the continuing negotiations and the monitoring process under that programme.  There is no question of any draconian legislation.  This is merely an enabling power.  I can assure Senator Ross of that.  It is there on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>

Natural justice will apply.  It is merely enabling legislation. Were it not there, their ability to hire and to remove would be in question.

I do not know what the draftsmen get up to.  I left school <Col N="1146" /> when I was 12 years old but a lot of people did not leave school until they were very much older.

I do not question the Minister's sincerity, but it seems quite extraordinary that he is saying that if this is not put in, anybody who commits fraud or a criminal offence, or gives justification for being dismissed, cannot be dismissed.  In other words, unless this clause is left in anybody who is employed by the Commission has permanent tenure for as long as they like. I find that impossible to accept.  I would have thought that the normal laws relating to an employer and an employee would apply to this automatically.  Surely the Minister is not saying that a person has tenure for life whatever his behaviour unless this clause is inserted?  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this. The Schedule reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a member of the Commission is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
      <P>(b)  nominated as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament, or</P>
      <P>(c)  regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the Act of 1984) of the Act of 1977, as having been elected to the European Parliament to fill a vacancy,</P>
      <P>he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Commission.</P>
      <P>On the schedule could we talk to the draftsman, as he is in the House.  All legislation that has come through this House in the past three or four years has been changed at the request of this House and the parliamentary draftsman was advised that this kind of section is unacceptable. First, I have no objection when a Member is nominated as a member of this House, because he is then a Member of the House.  I have no objection when a person is elected to either House of the Oireachtas or elected or nominated to fill a vacancy in the European Parliament. Once one holds office he should not be a member of the Commission.  Surely this inclusion by the draftsman of a nomination as a candidate is unacceptable to all of us nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You remove the opportunity for people to go forward for public office by having this written in, especially if a person feels they have something to offer and particularly having regard to the fact that outside nominating bodies for the Seanad do not necessarily require the permission or approval of the nominated <Col N="1148" /> candidate.  To compound it further, if somebody is nominated by an outside nominating body as a candidate to contest the Seanad election, their names cannot be withdrawn unless they die between then and polling day.  It is extraordinary then that the draftsman is insisting that people in that category would have to resign or no longer be a member of the commission.  That also applies to the staff.</P>
    <P>I will accept a Report Stage amendment from the Minister which excludes that but does include election, whether by nomination to this House or election directly to it or to the other House, or to the European Parliament.  They should be excluded from being members of the Commission.  Certainly, by being nominated as a candidate for election should not exclude them.  In any legislation that has been passed here over the last number of years, in the previous Government's time and in this Government's time, any clause like this one was changed and amended before it got to us.  The draftsman who is so anxious to include all of the references in the past, has made a cardinal error in allowing this to slip through.  I will be calling a vote on it, but I would prefer if the Minister amended it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not, but we have, in fact, a Member in the other House who had to give up his job on the basis of criteria of this nature.  It was a post office job.  Actually, there were two cases.  I am not suggesting that we would now have a majority in County Clare had that type of clause not been in operation at the time, but we did lose a very good representative in Clare, mainly because he could not go beyond the county council stage of being nominated.  A Member of the other House had to surrender his job on the basis, not of getting elected but of being actually nominated.  I believe that at this stage with the existence of the State for so long, that is a little out of order.  I agree that nobody should certainly sit on the Commission if they are elected, but it is going very far indeed to <Col N="1149" /> say that one should not get nominated.  If one is threatened with being a candidate now one cannot be selected to be a member of the Commission.  That is going a little overboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand why nominated Members of the Oireachtas are excluded from sitting on this Commission.  I could understand it if it was the other way round and if the legislation said that the commission shall not have more than so many members of the Seanad or the Dáil or the Oireachtas. I am not sure why it is automatic.  There may be a reason which the Minister can give us which will imply a conflict of interest.  I meant to mention this, but I am quite prepared to admit that I was not able to be here, which is rare in this House, on Second Stage.  It would have been far more appropriate if members of political parties were excluded rather than people who are in these Houses. It would be far more appropriate if the Minister said that no member of the Commission can be a member of a political party.</P>
      <P>It is well known that this Commission is in danger of being staffed, as has other bodies, with people who are loyal to political parties and people who are loyal to Governments.  What I am frightened of is seeing this Government nominate its own men or women to this Commission and then going on the sort of semi-State merry-go-round that we see so often. Had I been able to, I would have put in an amendment excluding members of political parties whose first loyalty is to a political party.  That would have been far more appropriate.  The Minister and the House know that there is already fairly intense lobbying and pressure for seats on this Commission.  Members of the Seanad or the Dáil, while not ideal people, should not be the first people to be excluded.  The first people to be excluded should be people whose loyalties are to political parties rather than to the Oireachtas itself.</P>

      <P>We talked about <Col N="1150" /> impartiality and political impartiality earlier in this Bill.  That whole area would be in jeopardy if members of the Commission are also going to be affiliated to political parties and are going to be candidates in an election.  It seems to me that as soon as a person on the board of a community group or residents' association is put forward as a candidate for a political party he is automatically debarred from holding office on those organisations. It would seem that that principle should almost definitely apply to the Commission and I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  I agree with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with this section and I do not put a tooth in it.  We have had this out, as Senator Ferris said, many times on other sections of other Bills in the past which involved setting up a board or a commission.  It seems as if there is some sort of taint attached to somebody who becomes involved in the political system by virtue of putting in a measure like this.  I do not doubt Senator Ross's bona fides in defending the position of somebody nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  I am very concerned about (b) there &ldquo;nominated as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know the number of nominating bodies to the Seanad, but in each of the five panels there are a number of nominating bodies.  Very many people take up those nominations and run as Seanad candidates.  As somebody who is the nominee of an outside body, I watched that section of the election with great interest.  Many of those nominated candidates fall like nine pins.  Some of them are not often serious candidates for a Seanad election.  The bottom line in all of this is that anybody nominated or invited to become a member of a commission must be so invited because of capability and capacity to serve on that Commission and to have a certain insight, knowledge or expertise, or particular insight, to bring to the workings of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity if somebody has an <Col N="1151" /> interest in political matters and is honoured by receiving a nomination as a candidate for election to the Seanad that they would, perforce, have to come off such a commission or become in some way suspect as a consequence of that nomination.  In the past we have succeeded in legislation which has had a section such as this in bringing sanity and reason to bear on that measure.  I am hopeful the Minister will omit the section whereby somebody would be excluded by virtue of their nomination as a candidate to either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the matter of elected status, I can see an argument for not wishing to see elected Members but I am not absolutely convinced of it.  It conjures up notions of people who are elected, either as Independents or as members of political parties, as having intentions, attitudes, loyalties or affiliations which bring their whole integrity into question.  As an elected parliamentarian and member of a political party, I am not happy that that should be the generalised view.  You get good and bad, and people with and without integrity, in every situation.  I hate a sort of blanket notion that those who have a party political involvement are in some way people of less integrity than others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Senator's last point in relation to members and active members of political parties. Living in a democracy with a party system, our democracy is stronger because of the participation of members of the general public giving of their free time to join in the political process by becoming involved in party political activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding membership of this House, of the Dáil or of the European Parliament, I believe it would be totally inappropriate that any Member would be also a member of a board or commission of this type.  Regarding nomination, somebody mentioned that we live in the real world and let us refer to the real world. Senators know the situation better than I do, and I hope never to learn it.  The <Col N="1152" /> situation in relation to outside nominations is such that it normally is a fair chase for an individual to get a nomination from an outside body.  To suggest that he or she is going to be nominated against his wishes by an outside nominating body, because that outside nominating body wants to get him off a commission or a board, or is going to purposely nominate him is ludicrous.  We have to live in the real world.  There is no amendment down.  Perhaps the Members want to vote against the particular section of the Schedule.  I will not be accepting an amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude.  He is the first Minister for about five years who has adopted this attitude or has put this section into legislation.  There are other boards, for instance, nurses boards, dental boards or any other board, on which I agree it would be inappropriate to have an elected Member of the House of the Oireachtas or an elected Member of the European Parliament to be jointly or at the same time a member of a board or a commission.  It would be almost incompatible. Senator Ross has a different view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section being written in as it is, will exclude any member who would be a member of the commission, from endeavouring to become a member of this House.  I think that would be against the whole democratic process.  They could, by that very nature, just lose their place on the commission.  It has happened. The Minister would want to live in the real world.  If the Minister is <Col N="1153" /> unaware of it, would he please check the resignations that had to take place when the board of ACOT and other bodies were set up, just because people were nominated?  They were not successful in being elected, and did not get back onto the board of ACOT again.  That is what you are suggesting could happen here.  A Member who you will be appointing to become a member of the commission will now be precluded from ever being a candidate even for election here.  That is what it means.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the section.  I am putting an amendment down for Report Stage, which will be taken now.  If the parliamentary draftsman does not believe us, perhaps we could have a &ldquo;Sos&rdquo; so you could check the other legislation to confirm what I am saying is true?  One Minister allowed the parliamentary draftsment to slip in with this sort of thing and the Minister only discovered it when we drew it to his attention.  There was a &ldquo;Sos&rdquo; and he made a change and the Dáil accepted it without debate.  They had not realised that it had slipped through again. We are listening to draftsmen and all the things they would like to do and have, such as continuity in legislation and so on.  This is unacceptable to me.  I oppose the section because of that and will put in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

Surely membership of that would give benefit to a candidate in a campaign above and beyond any other candidate in a campaign, which I know the Senator would not want to see happening. Somebody with such a high media profile, as a member of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, with all the potential coverage of their particular candidature during a campaign should not be involved in.</P>

Everything would be open, above board and decent and free from any taint or suspicion. That would be a reasonable way of going about dealing with this difficulty.</P>

I am very worried &mdash; and I also will put down an amendment at Report Stage &mdash; that the sort of unseemly behaviour that happened when there was a contest for the director-generalship of RTE last time would be repeated.  It is disingenuous for anybody in a political party to maintain that the RTE Authority are not politically appointed and politically divisive in some way.  It is unfashionable to say it but there was a very nasty contest for the last director-generalship of RTE which was based on political parties.  If I am right &mdash; and I am open to correction &mdash; one candidate was selected by the committee set up by RTE, and that candidate was very closely identified with the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refused to appoint him.</P>

      <P>I am not naming anybody, Senator Mooney, but thank you very much for your help.  That is the sort of situation I want to see avoided on this Commission.  We have not got any indication that this will not happen.  From what I hear and from what I see around, this is exactly what will happen on this Commission.  There will be a dog fight for seats.  The people involved will be closely identified with political parties and in this case, naturally enough, with the Government, because they will be appointing them.  Perhaps it should simply be that nobody who is a member of a political party should be able to sit on this Commission. The Minister might say that is unfair, and too broad.  Maybe he would accept an amendment that those who are on this Commission will allow their political record to be published.  They should have to answer specific questions which would show whether they had allegiances <Col N="1156" /> to parties.  I have no doubt whatsoever that this Commission will become a highly politicised Commission who will then be asked to make political decisions. Would the Minister accept some amendment which would by-pass this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intervened again to say that because it is going to be a very high-powered, high profile Commission that it would be inappropriate to have anybody in the House associated with it or involved with it.  Surely there are already regulations laid down on the code of conduct of contractors and all people involved in this.  RTE have a code of conduct.  There are people who are Members of this House who had to forego their employment, freelance or otherwise, in RTE during an election campaign. They were fortunate enough to be re-employed afterwards, which some people might consider unfair on a particular panel on which other candidates did not have similar facilities available to them.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the membership of the Commission and the membership of the staff of the Commission.  I am ensuring by my defence of the right to be nominated that that should not preclude you, as Senator Bulbulia said, during the course of the campaign.  You would be expected, in the normal course of events, to step aside and try your hand at it, but you should not automatically forfeit your right to be on the Commission by being a candidate.  Only if you are successful should the Minister's thinking in this regard come into play.  Then all of us will defend him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should check what I have said about previous legislation for the setting up of boards, high profile or low profile involving the same principle that in some you cannot be a member of a House of the Oireachtas. I accept that.  Particularly in regard to nominations for contesting Seanad elections, it is slightly different from the nomination process involved in the Dáil. We want to be totally impartial in this House and we say that any Member of <Col N="1157" /> either Houses who is nominated as a candidate should be disqualified immediately or automatically.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should remove section 10 (b) and section 2 (b).  Those are the only two that offend me.  All the others should stand.  I suggest that the Minister should do that on Report Stage.  I can assure him it will not be held up for five minutes in the other House as a result.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, would the Senators not accept what I have already said?  I fully accept that Senator Ferris has broadened the argument to talk about all boards, but I am talking specifically about this section, about the setting up of this Commission and the wording of this Bill.  Would the Senator not accept, as I have already said, that in regard to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which is a statutory body, and also to the RTE Authority, the wording is similar to that which is in this Bill?  That goes back to 1960 and 1961.  I do not want to delay the House.  I do not want to make a political football out of this.  I am asking Senators to accept that there is no radical departure in the provisions of this Bill from those in the other legislation which was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas to set up the existing broadcasting facilities.</P>

      <P>The Minister has failed to answer one or two questions.  He has not replied at all to this question, which is important.  I cannot find what the qualifications in the Bill are for the members of the Commission, but from memory they are very broad.  As I read it, anybody could qualify for membership of the Commission who had any experience in virtually anything at all, including administration, which is so vague.  I want to get guidance from the Minister on this. It is quite simple.  We must ensure that those who are appointed &mdash; and I am talking about future generations of Ministers not himself, particularly &mdash; are not simply cronies of the political party in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind making a political football of it if Senator Mooney does not want to.  This Commission and the quality of this Commission will become debased because those who get this job and those who get the licence, which is regarded in the commercial world quite simply as a plum, will be getting it as some sort of political reward.  It is no secret.  It is not very fashionable to say this.  I would like the Minister to answer whether he will consider that those who sit on this Commission, and indeed in future in the RTE Authority, should make an honest declaration of their political involvement in the past and their political affiliations. That would solve this problem and it <Col N="1159" /> would prevent any Minister in the future from nakedly appointing cronies to this Commission.  That is what I am worried about and that is why it would be useful to include it in this schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 (5) of the Schedule states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be appointed to be a member of the Commission unless he has had experience of or shows capacity in, media or commercial affairs, radio communications engineering, trade union affairs, administration or social, cultural educational or community activities.</P>
      <P>These are the criteria laid down.  It is outrageous to suggest that the total membership of the RTE Authority are in some way politically tainted.  The chairman of the RTE authority is Mr. Jim Culliton.  I mention him here and although I know it is not normal to mention individuals, I do so because attacks have been made on their capacity.  I do not know the man's political persuasion; I do not want to know.  He was not appointed by a Fianna Fáil Administration.  I would say he was picked by the previous Coalition Administration for the talents he has quite clearly displayed since he became chairman of that Authority.  It is outrageous to suggest that a member to be appointed to any board has to sign a certificate of whom he voted for at the last election or whom he has supported in a national collection when somebody called to his door or what political affiliations he has or does not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our democratic process needs people involved in the political process, needs active volunteers.  I believe to exclude such people from membership of boards, no matter what party they are members of, would be outrageous.  The Government intend that the people to be appointed by them to this commission will be people of the highest calibre, fitting within the specific criteria laid down. The criteria laid down now are not the criteria which appeared in the Bill's first <Col N="1160" /> draft in the Dáil.  I accepted an amendment in the Dáil to include trade union affairs as one of the criteria.  I assure Senators, that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a board of the highest calibre for the very sound reason that there will be such a high media perception of the board that membership will be scrutinised to see who are appointed.</P>

      <P>I was establishing that this will be the law for many years to come. It is very important that nobody is given the opportunity to abuse it.  This could be the law for 20, 30 or 40 years.  I have found out what the qualifications for the Commission are.  It is worth reading that into the record.  It is all very well to say that they should be of the highest calibre. It says nothing here about them being of the highest calibre.  It says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be appointed to be a member of the Commission unless he had experience of, or shown capacity in media or commercial affairs, radio communications engineering, trade union affairs, administration or social&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This to my mind covers everybody who has ever been born</P>
      <P>&mdash;cultural, educational or community activities.</P>
      <P>This seems to exclude absolutely nobody. That particular section means nothing.  It dresses up in particularly flowery language the sort of person who will be in there but for which anybody who is picked by the Minister at the time will qualify.  The section could be deleted and the Bill would not in any way lose anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not saying that all members of the RTE Authority had political affiliations. It is unfair to pick out one &mdash; the Minister should be ruled out of order on this &mdash; who patently has not.  I was saying <Col N="1161" /> that there are many people appointed to that Authority and to other semi-State bodies who have obviously got political affiliations and that their primary qualification for those jobs is that they have political affiliations.  It is rubbish and nonsense for people to protest that this is not the case because it is.  We only have to remember one of the most recent appointments, which I have already raised in this House, to see that political affiliations were a factor in appointments to semi-State bodies.  I am not asking the Minister to exclude people who have been members of political parties or people who have given money to political parties.  I am asking that those facts should be publicly known.</P>

      <P>Does that mean if you have a long extended history of radio piracy, that you are well equipped to be a member of the Commission?  I am not saying that he should not be a member of the Commission. I want to know if it will debar him or will all be forgiven?  We are dealing with the question of the pirate radio operators.

Will there be a cut-off point or will the alternative situation exist?

After that the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act comes into force and they must stop because all of the very severe measures come into operation at that stage.  The procedure to be followed is that following the passage of this legislation and signing by the President the Government will then appoint a commission who will carry out this initial trawl of interest that we talked about last night.  They will suggest the areas where they think licences should be given depending on frequencies and other factors.  We will decide where they should be.  They will then have to advertise for applications for licences for the particular contractors for those regions.  That should go on through the autumn and we should be ready at the beginning of the year for a <Col N="1163" /> lot of the areas.  All of them will not be immediately covered.

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) No person can be appointed to the Commission until he or she has made a full declaration of his or her past or present membership of a political <Col N="1164" /> party.  Nor may he or she be appointed without a full revelation of all contribution made by himself or herself or any company over which he or she has control to a political party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thank you for facilitating this amendment which is really putting into a formal form what we were saying about the Schedule just before the break.  The reason for this amendment is that control of the media is constantly a very sensitive political point.  It is a sensitive point here and it has been for years.  There are constant eruptions about the position of certain newspapers and the position and sympathies of RTE.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that I think there is a great danger that the membership of the Commission as allowed for, and the way they are to be appointed under this Schedule could lead to such a Commission becoming simply an arm of the Government.  In this case, basically the Minister and the Government have the power to appoint exactly whom they like, regardless of qualifications, to the Commission.  The qualifications &mdash; as we have already said &mdash; really cover anybody.  Regardless of qualifications, the Government have the power to appoint anybody they like and unless provisions are put in, this will automatically lead to the accusation and the suspicion that the Minister and the Government are appointing their own people to do their will.  It is for that reason that I put this amendment down.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Minister should be sensitive about this at this time.  It is an important principle that should be established for now and for the future because there is no doubt that, as the Bill stands, it is open to blatant corruption.  I should have put in as well an amendment to try to prevent the situation arising not only where the Government have control or too much control over the media but where one person also has too much control over the media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very narrow debate and the Senator should <Col N="1165" /> endeavour to stick to the terms of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If you Sir, knew what I was just about to say you would have understood where I was leading to.  I would have thought that no person should be appointed to the Commission who has not actually made such a declaration of political affiliations but also of interests in other parts of the media.  I do not want the Government to have too much control or one individual to have too much control over the media, and in that I include RTE, this Commission and any large circulating newspaper in the country. It is because that source of accusation is so sensitive that protections of this sort ought to be put in.</P>
      <P>I have been struck from that part of the debate which I have been able to read and listen to &mdash; I was not here for all of it, and I do not even maintain that I was listening to it all on the monitor as I was not here for it all &mdash; by the party political to-ing and fro-ing, the lack of warning about the dangers of party political control of the media.  I am astounded at the reluctance of the Minister to accept this amendment.  I am not asking for people to be excluded because they are members of political parties.  I am not asking for them to be excluded because they have given money to political parties.  I am simply saying that, if that is the case, it should be openly known and realised and declared to the public, I can see no objection to that.  The only objection to that would come from people who have something to hide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely right that such declarations should be made and those who want to oppose the amendment must presumably want to perpetuate a system which exists in this country which is wrong.  The system which I object to is the system of appointments being made to semi-State and State bodies such as this, because it is an acknowledged and well known practice on the part of the Government and the Opposition to change people on Commissions of this sort as their re-election comes up or as their re-appointment comes up, partly on <Col N="1166" /> the basis of their party political allegiance.  What happens and what will happen on this Commission is this. People will be appointed to it who have got better qualifications than in this absurd meaningless Schedule, especially in paragraph No. 5.  All other things being equal, and having these qualifications, part of the reason for their appointment will be their affiliation.  If one person appears on the list of candidates and another person appears on the list of candidates and they are vaguely equal, all other things being equal, they will be appointed on the basis of their political allegiance.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that this body will become an arm of the Government in a much more subtle way than we see it at the moment.  I would like to see the Minister accepting this amendment on the basis also of those who give money to political parties because there are many people in this country &mdash; indeed the system to a certain extent works like this &mdash; who are not paid up members of political parties but what they do for the political party is far greater than going around canvassing door to door at election time.  They give hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of pounds to the parties when it matters.  I do not want to exclude these people but I do not want this sort of a job being given to these people purely and simply as a reward for that and being seen to be purely and simply as a reward.  If this body is to have credibility &mdash; I doubt that it will gain that credibility &mdash; those facts and other facts of this sort should be known.  Those who oppose it should be asked why they oppose it and what they have to hide.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for the Minister to say that it is an unfair discrimination against members of political parties.  It is not and it is not meant to be.  It is just simply that they should be open about their allegiance.  It would make the Minister and successive Ministers more reluctant to appoint political cronies to these sort of bodies.</P>

      <P>I defend any Minister's right in legislation to appoint whoever he wants to boards.  It is appropriate that the Minister should have regard to all the qualities that are necessary.  I have no doubt whatsoever that people who are active politically can have these qualities, and in many cases probably have more of the necessary qualities than people who are not involved in politics at all.  First of all, I want to defend the right of ministerial appointments, although when we were in Government, we were at times subject to criticisms in the other House for making such appointments.  That arose from the appointment of the chairman of the Youth Employment Agency.  There was major controversy in the other House because he happened to have an affiliation to the Labour Party.  It turned out that he was the best man for the job and proved it by his work afterwards.  When our general secretary retired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was paraphrasing my attitude to the amendment as it is worded because it could be misrepresented.  Certainly, my view could be misrepresented. I have no objection to people having political affiliations.  I have no objection to people making contributions to political parties.  It is a way of ensuring that democracy, as we understand it, survives in the country.  We are able to go public and to look for subscriptions from people and to receive them.  Likewise, I see nothing wrong with people disclosing these interests.  As a matter of fact, the Labour Party are trying to ensure that disclosures, covered in the second part of this amendment, would be included in <Col N="1168" /> the Companies Bill.  It is appropriate.  I just want to make my position absolutely crystal clear.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross does not want to debar these people either.  All he wants is an openness and a frankness and that people would declare their interests.  That will remove a lot of the criticism that comes on Ministers when they make appointments because the known appointees can declare themselves a member of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party or the Progressive Democrats, or the Fianna Fáil Party which is most likely to happen in this case because I cannot see the Minister contacting our party to know if we have any suitable candidates for the commission.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with the people declaring their political affiliations.  We do it every day of the week and it is not held against us &mdash; hopefully, it is not held against us by anybody.  If we all were honest with everybody else in everyday life, in politics and otherwise, we would have a better society than if we have people who run around behind the scenes and try to manipulate things to suit themselves, whether financially or otherwise. That is the concept that Senator Ross is trying to get through in his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  I could not help being reminded when listening to Senators Ross and Ferris about when I was young and used to read in my history books about the tenant farmers, before the days of the secret ballot, lined up in front of the landlord on the day of an election; they had to put their hand up and say who they were going to vote for.  It seems to me that this flies totally in the face of the democratic traditions that we have created and nurtured in this country.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted, we are insisting that from here on in, as a precedent and for any future appointees, that the person should stand up and do something which under the Constitution they are not required to do when they mark a ballot paper in a local, general or European election.  Therefore, even on that one point alone, I would oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I must confess to being a bit unhappy in some ways about this amendment.  It strikes me as being excessively narrow and very much centred on membership of political parties or connected with funding, and donations or gifts to political parties.  In my view there are certain sinister and subversive groups in this country whom I would certainly not like to see represented on a commission of such importance.  I have in mind the sort of groupings who surface at the time of referenda dealing with constitutional matters; forces which we all know are active in our society holding the sorts of views that I would find distinctly worrying.  I would be happier if Senator Ross had seen fit to broaden the scope of his amendment to include references to those sort of groupings, which I know he himself finds unpleasant and abhorrent. I feel confident he is unhappy about the movings and manipulations of those sort of groupings in society.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with overt declaration of membership of political parties. I wish more people, apart from party activists, felt happy and comfortable about declaring their particular party allegiance or affiliation.  That is open, democratic, honest and upright.  That is the kind of activity and attitude we need to encourage in this society.  I am also personally in favour of full disclosure of donations and gifts to political parties because the absence of such disclosure is worrying and gives rise to feelings which Senator Ross gives voice to in the putting down of his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is perfectly correct in wishing to question the whole notion of cronyism.  It is no secret that in the past, and indeed even in the present, appointments have been made which in the public perception give rise to certain questioning or querying.  We should be moving into a more open, upright society which sets aside notions of rewards for services rendered being given to party hacks and cronies when everybody can see quite clearly and quite plainly that the reward of a seat on the board or a seat on something or other is what it is, and bears no relation to the capacity or capability of the person to fulfil a useful <Col N="1170" /> function on that particular body.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross in some way attaches a certain political virginity to the notion of independence.  He is very fortunate in many ways in being an Independent Member but the country does not run on the basis of a variety of Independent Members taking their seats in this House or indeed in the other House.  There is a party political system.  There is a suggestion in this, as I have said before, that there is something tainted or lacking in integrity or unworthy or ignoble attached to somebody who is a member of a political party.  I am unhappy about any such suggestion, however marginal, which I feel is in some way attached to this amendment.</P>
    <P>I would again make the point that I find cronyism totally unacceptable.  I find the notion of stuffing boards with party hacks completely abhorrent and I would never ever support it.  I feel that the amendment is peculiarly slanted in that it leaves out any reference to the kind of sinister groupings in society which we all know are there and which we all know are the sort of groupings who would love to get their hands on the media and in some way influence the dissemination of information and entertainment.  If we are to put down any amendment of this sort, we should certainly broaden it out to include those sorts of groupings in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very detailed debate in Dáil Éireann on the Radio and Television Bill and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill.  A warm welcome was expressed in that House for the criteria laid down as to the type of experience and capacity in the areas listed in the Bill: capacity in &ldquo;media and commercial affairs, radio communications engineering, trade union affairs, administration or social, cultural, educational or community activities&rdquo;. There was a general acceptance of the commitment of the Government to appoint people of the highest calibre to this Commission.  We are establishing a completely new framework for legal radio and television, national radio and <Col N="1171" /> television and local and neighbourhood radio throughout this country.  It will require people of dedication, commitment and high calibre to make it work.  There was no suggestion of corruption &mdash; a word used by Senator Ross. The word was never uttered or suggested, by innuendo or otherwise, in the Dáil.  I regret deeply that it has occurred in this House.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in this amendment is that we should all be of independent frame of mind and that nobody should join a political party and if they do, they have to declare it from the rooftops.  Does the same situation apply if you happen to be a member of the masons, the knights, or of a particular golf or cricket club where an application comes before you from an individual you might know.  We live in a small society with three and a half million people.  The political affiliations of people appointed to most of the boards in this country are known or they are well known because we live in such a small society.  I think it is absolutely unnecessary in the society we live in to put in such declarations as are required here.  If you carry it to its logical conclusion you would have to have a situation of them declaring which way they voted over the past couple of years.  We live in a democracy where the ballot is secret and sacred.  People gave their lives to have that democracy.  It is unworthy to make the suggestions that have been made.  I am glad that Senator Mooney, on behalf of the party, has indicated that he would not accept the amendment.  I could not accept it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's response to my amendment.  I will try to deal with it point by point.  First, he says that he is astounded that I used the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;.  I wish that party politicians and Ministers who come to this House were not so particularly sensitive about general principles being pronounced about certain Bills and legislation.  What I said and what I stand by, is that this Bill, as it stands now, is open to corruption.  It is.  I will spell it out even further.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a future Government from <Col N="1172" /> appointing card carrying members of their own party to implement their will. There is no suggestion on my part that this Government or this Minister will do that.  What I say is that this is open to corruption because of the principle which is established in this Bill.  I do not believe anybody can argue with that.</P>
      <P>The warm welcome given in the Dáil to the qualifications, as in Schedule 1 (5), may well be true.  But the Minister failed to tell me of anybody or any category of person who would be excluded from being on the Commission.  I maintain that that section is meaningless.  No one is excluded.  Putting in sections of that sort is purely a camouflage for justifying strange selections in the future.  I reject that section.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that this amendment was unnecessary.  It is extremely necessary.  We had a Freedom of Information Bill before this House not so long ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the point about disclosure of interests and it is purely supporting my argument.  Part of the purpose of that Freedom of Information Bill was that disclosures of this sort should be open to the public to inspect.  It is the public's right to know.  The Minister has not satisfied me here because he continues to support this policy of non-disclosure, which is fairly typical of most parties when in Government.  There is a tendency for them to switch roles at they switch from Government to Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that there is anything wrong with being a member of a political party.  I accept much of what Senator Bulbulia said.  But there is a place for members of political parties and there is a definite conflict of interest in being a member of a political party and a member of this Commission.  That is all I am saying.  This amendment in no way criticises people for being members of political parties.  Political parties have an extremely valuable, necessary and indispensable place in our democracy, but there are also certain roles they should not play.  One of the roles they should not <Col N="1173" /> play is to control television or newspapers under the guise of commissions which are called independent.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ferris said &mdash; Senator Bulbulia quite rightly said that she supports this &mdash; in the Companies' Bill there is an amendment down that there should be full disclosure of actual donations to political parties.  I do not know what the Government's view on this would be, but I suspect it will be the same stone walling situation, because it might prove embarrassing for this Government or for future Governments to state exactly who is on what board, who gave what money and what positions they now hold.  I am used to the sort of to-ing and fro-ing which goes on in this situation, but it is only realistic and fair that it should be pointed out that there are blatant political appointees on semi-State bodies, and it is quite obvious from this debate that there is an enormous reluctance on behalf of the Government to give up this particularly prized form of patronage.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Minister has said has convinced me that the appointments to be made to this Commission will be in any way a departure from the sort of disgraceful appointments which were made recently to the board of Irish Life, to the sort of appointments which have been made in the past to the board of Aer Lingus, which is regarded as a political plum.</P>

      <P>Finally, I find this response extremely discouraging.  These appointments, when they are made should be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny.  There is very little in what the Minister or Senator Mooney said which convinces me that these appointments will not have a large amount of party-political input.  I would like to see those members of the Commission appointed and say that I cannot identify X, Y or Z with the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government.  I am now not convinced that that will be the case. Indeed, I will summarise by saying this: I would place a small bet that certain members of that Commission, when appointed, will be identifiable with the Government.  That is what this amendment was meant to prevent, by forcing disclosure.  I am disappointed that the Minister does not allow this sort of disclosure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 41 and 42.</P>
      <P>There is a genuine reason for moving these two amendments.  Technically what that means is that, if a person is nominated to contest an election they would not be debarred from being a member of the commission or a member of the staff of the commission.  I want to ensure that if people are elected to either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament they would, automatically, be excluded from membership of the commission. I am concerned about nominated people only and I am particularly concerned with Seanad nominations, with particular reference to outside nominating bodies because of the peculiarity obtaining in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this at great length.  I have since had the opportunity to have this checked.  Amendment No. 3 is not required because there is no question a nominated Member of either House or of the European Parliament having to be removed from membership of the commission.  They can just stand seconded from employment; there is no question of them having to leave the employment.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 2, if I had not to go back to the Dáil and the Dáil was not breaking up next week, I would consider accepting it despite the fact that I still have these very strong views in relation to the position of this commission being different from that of normal State boards.  It is a high profile, media commission different from the one quoted earlier by Senator Ferris in relation to ACOT.  I am not in a position to accept it in view of the time constraint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that at least the Minister is responsive to my point.  It is a reflection on this House that, just because the other House is adjourning next week, what is a desirable amendment to a Bill cannot be made.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>Were it not for the fact that the other House cannot facilitate the Minister next week this amendment would be acceptable to him; in spite of the high profile, the principle is right.  As a result and in defence of this House and its right to make amendments, which it considers suitable, I cannot withdraw this amendment.  I am disappointed that the Minister, his Department, the draftsman and everybody else involved did not draw comparisons with provisions in other legislation and at least explain to us why the provisions of this Bill are different from any other legislation.  This House would be losing an opportunity to strike a blow for itself in respect of a candidate who might be nominated to contest <Col N="1177" /> Seanad elections &mdash; particularly through the outside process or panels &mdash; if we did not ensure that such nominees could not be members of the commission.  I am sorry to learn that the Minister cannot accept our amendment because the other House cannot facilitate us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is not necessary because a nominee does not lose his or her employment.  There is no question of their losing their employment; it is a matter of secondment. Nobody loses employment as a result of being nominated or otherwise so amendment No. 3 is not required.  I take the point made by the Senator in regard to amendment No. 2 but I still hold the view &mdash; in relation to the high profile media nature of this commission &mdash; that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed at the Minister's approach to this.  He says he accepts the principle, that were it not for the fact the Dáil is going into recess he would perhaps consider taking it back to the Dáil.  I know he does not wish to denigrate this House. Of course he would never ever state he would and I must accept that.  But the net effect of what he says is that something that he accepts in principle &mdash; which is felt in this House very deeply and strongly, because it directly impinges on this House <Col N="1178" />&mdash; cannot have the logical amendment made to it in this House because it would need to go to another House to have that amendment taken also so that the Bill could become law.  Therefore there is partial acceptance only of the principle.</P>
      <P>I do not really buy the argument that because this is a megaboard, a superboard or a high profile board, or whatever other adjective we use to describe it, it is, in some way, so different as not to have this principle taken on board.  It is an important principle; it has been argued during the day and Senator Ferris put the final touches to the argument.  Logically, if the Minister, despite his reservations, accepts the principle of what we are about, then a facility should be made for this amendment to be taken today and for it to be inserted in the Business of the Dáil next week so that it can become part of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a long process to get the legislation to where we are today.  The length of time has probably been beneficial because the legislation which we are now passing embodies the best of a consensus view as to where we should be going in, on the future of broadcasting.  It contains a possibility for enormously exciting and new departures both in radio and television.  In this Bill the Minister has shown a great deal of compromise and has gone out of his way to meet reasonable points that were made.  The process in the Dáil and Seanad is a very good example of how legislation can be greatly improved in the interest of the common good after free and open discussion.  I thank the Minister for his generosity and the manner in which he has gone out of his way to meet points of view from the Opposition parties and the extent to which the Bill was changed on <Col N="1182" /> foot of comments from various groups.  I cangratulate the Minister on getting this legislation on to the Statute Book and I commiserate with his officials who had to bear with this legislation for a very long period.  I believe that it is good and exciting legislation.  I hope it will stand the test of time and I look forward to a very happy era for those who are involved in broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with everything Senator Manning has said and I, too, compliment the Minister and his officials, not only on bringing forward this much needed legislation but also on the manner of its drafting and its execution through both Houses, particularly this House, and in the manner in which the Minister has been personally responsive to the many representations that have been made to him from various interested groups.  The Minister in concluding might confirm the statement that he made in the Dáil in relation to those operators who are now outside the law.  I do not wish in any way to give the impression that I am pillorying or crucifying them in any way.  I have always maintained that they have acted outside the law, but one could argue that perhaps the law should have been changed before now.  That is not the question before us, but I say in the interests of fairness that many people have deliberately and consciously stayed outside the illegal operation of broadcasting pending the passing of legislation.  The fact that legislation has taken some years to pass has not been the fault of those individuals.  Consequently, it seems now that they, as law-abiding citizens will be treated on equal terms with those who have, whether one likes it or not, not to put a tooth in it, broken the law consistently, maybe for the highest of motives &mdash; I am not taking away from their motives in any way but just stating the fact that they have broken-the law. However, having done that I would like to get confirmation from the Minister on a statement he made to a similar question in the Dáil that he will give preference to those who have stayed within the law rather than to those who have been outside the law, and he might convey those <Col N="1183" /> views to the Commission.  Overall I welcome this legislation wholeheartedly.  It is the most exciting development in broadcasting in this country since the foundation of the State and one can only wish the legislation well.</P>

      <P>Despite the reservations I have about the Bill, and they are legion, I would like to say that on the whole it is a very welcome initiative that this Bill should have come to this House.  I would like to welcome the relative speed with which it has been passed through this House and the other House.  I know the difficulties of getting this kind of legislation through and getting it drafted. Indeed the last Government proved that to us with a similar Bill which it had on the books but could not bring to the House because of disagreements. Despite all its faults this Bill fills a gap, part of the process which was started by the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  There is a very real need where the law is being openly flouted and where the forces of law and order and the State are allowing it to be openly flouted, that either the law should be enforced or the new measures which recognise a new situation should be brought to bear.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without making a few comments. This is a very historic moment in the history of broadcasting in Ireland.  We have reached a very important milestone. Like it or not, thousands of people around this country have been listening to a number of radio stations and these radio stations built up a huge loyalty and a huge following.  We cannot deny that. In Dublin radio stations like Sunshine 101, Q 102 and Energy 103 had huge listenerships and built up a substantial loyalty.  Many people will be sad that these stations are now passing.  That is a reality which we have to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have every confidence that the new stations when they come onstream in the new year will be able to pick up on the listenership and attract the people who have been listening to these other stations in the past.  It has dragged <Col N="1184" /> on for a number of years now and I congratulate the Minister on tackling the matter in a very effective way once and for all.</P>

It has been ten years coming and I must say I am very pleased to have been the Minister involved in guiding it eventually through these two Chambers.  I thank the Members of the Seanad for their cooperation and expressions of support in passing the legislation.  Finally, I thank my own officials in the Department of Communications who put so much work into three different Government Bills over the years eventually to see this one coming to fruition.  I believe the framework we have established in this legislation, warts and all &mdash; I am not claiming it is perfection &mdash; will provide the opportunity for a very exciting period ahead in the television and radio world. In two years' time the electronic media will be totally different from the media as we know it in June 1988 when we are passing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia that she wishes to raise the following matter: the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intercede on behalf of the Sharpeville Six so as to ensure that their execution does not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has made himself available to come here this afternoon to hear this matter which expresses the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intercede on behalf of the Sharpeville Six to ensure their execution does not take place.</P>
      <P>It is very important at the outset to sketch in the backdrop against which this execution is pending.  There is a massively deteriorating situation in South Africa. During the week we heard of incursions into neighbouring Botswana by South African commandos.  Such an incursion was, we are very thankfull, foiled by the Botswana security forces but it was nonetheless worrying and disturbing because it followed upon explosions in the capital of Botswana, Gaborone.  We have also witnessed the spectacle of hundreds of thousands of the majority population staying away from work to mark the 14th anniversary of the Soweto uprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that anything we see on our television screens or read in our newspapers about South Africa is <Col N="1186" /> there not by virtue of any will or wish on the part of the South African Government where there is a very strong censorship and a clampdown on news from that country.  Therefore, the situation is far worse than we perceive or read about.</P>
    <P>We have also seen this week offensive proposals from the beleaguered South African Government to give the majority population a say in government but without relinquishing control and as a sop there is a suggestion that a Bill will shortly follow for a top level all-race advisory council and the possible allowing of the majority population to have some members in cabinet.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have seen the disgraceful treatment of Mrs. Leah Tutu, wife of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was pulled in for a minor traffic infringement and subjected to appalling treatment from the South African police.  She was chained hand and foot and threats were made that she would be kicked in the mouth.  That is the backdrop against which is this looming execution of the Sharpeville Six.  Apart from the precious lives of the six concerned there is an overwhelming feeling that this incident could be, if it takes place, a flashpoint which would ignite South Africa itself and indeed the whole of Southern Africa. After the event, if it takes place and my intention here in putting this motion on the Adjournment is to ensure that it will not, there will, of course, be words of condemnation but these will be absolutely useless in a context where six lives have been cut off by the actions of that obscene regime.</P>
    <P>I understand the Taoiseach has given an indication that there will be further bilateral representations to the South African authorities and that such bilateral representations are under consideration. That is not enough, a Leis-Chathaoirleach, let me put to the Minister of State.  What we need are unilateral representations and action on sanctions, and specifically on coal importation. West Germany and the Netherlands are considering sanctions against South Africa if it rejects clemency appeals.  I hope the Minister in his reply today can tell me what actions we are considering by way of representations in relation to <Col N="1187" /> clemency and if clemency fails what follow-up actions are being contemplated to show our abhorrence and detestation of what may happen to the Sharpeville Six. Contemplating withdrawal of ambassadors is something that other nations are also considering but that does not arise in our case.  I want to know specifically if we have asked that the death sentences in this case will be commuted.</P>
    <P>I have been critical in the past, and I still maintain my stance of criticism of our approach to the whole issue of Apartheid. It is my firm belief that we seek cover in the thickets of diplomacy and we overlook the fact that as a small, neutral country with a proud tradition of having overcome oppression we could be a strong moral force.  We have no vested interest in South Africa.  We can stand out head and shoulders above other nations who seek to protect their vital interests on the one hand and proclaim their abhorrence of the evil racist regime in South Africa on the other.  We have seen that ambivalence coming from other nation states.  We know it and we recognise it and nobody in this country would wish our Government to be ambivalent on this issue and would want to see them taking where necessary &mdash; and it is necessary now &mdash; unilateral actions against South Africa.</P>
    <P>There is no place for equivocation, expedience or the niceties of diplomacy on this issue.  The issue of Apartheid is without doubt the greatest evil in the world, followed closely by the sorts of imbalances which see world starvation and hunger.  Our attitude to it is a moral imperative and I hope that attitude will be made very clear in the Minister's reply today.</P>
    <P>Our efforts in the face of the impending execution of the Sharpeville Six are crucial not only because six lives are in the balance but because these people are victims of a system which the Irish people as a whole deplore and reject.  I want to go back to the scene in 1984 when the Sharpeville Six were involved in this incident. It is important to picture a township, Lekoa, densely populated, full of shanty dwellings, hot sticky climate, mutinous crowd of about 100 people <Col N="1188" /> angry over rent increases which take place against a backdrop of poor wages and a virtual slave economy.  The Deputy Mayor, Khuzwayo Diamini was executed by the mob.  A legal expedient called &ldquo;common purpose&rdquo; was invoked to indict the six people involved.  Just because they were part of a crowd, they are <i>ipso facto</i> guilty of murder.  They were chosen at random.  Their guilt is not proven.  They were found guilty on the basis of a sort of collective responsibility.  It is contrary to all principles of international law and it is proof positive if, indeed proof positive were needed, that domestic law in South Africa is heavily weighted against the majority population, but of course they have not any say in the enactment of that legislation.  They have no voice, no input in that area.</P>
    <P>The Sharpeville Six are, in my view, sacrificial lambs.  They are victims who will be used, and I hope it does not happen, to appease the extreme right wing political groupings who are threatening President P.W. Botha in South Africa.  They feel that he is going too far, too fast and they are demanding sacrifice.</P>
    <P>There was an appeal to the Pretoria Supreme Court for a retrial of the five men and one woman.  This appeal was rejected.  It is fair to say that the world expected a different response.  The world continues to hope that, by appealing to better nature, by threatening sanctions or in some instances actually invoking them, this will in some way bring about a change of heart in that benighted regime, but it does not seem that that is the case, On 17 March 1988 a one month reprieve was given to the Sharpeville Six.  Then there was an application for a retrial which led to an indefinite suspension of sentence.  Just picture what all this must mean to those six people who are the focus of world attention because they have been on death row in Pretoria Central Prison since December 1985.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that what I am talking about in the context of this motion is not mercy.  Justice is what I am talking about; justice for those six people.  We must contrast the apparent stoney-hearted response of P.W. Botha with his recent intervention, an intervention this year which halted the trial of six South <Col N="1189" /> African army officers accused of murdering a veteran SWAPO activist in the township in Windhoek in Namibia or South West Africa.  If it can be done in the case of six South African army officers, it can most certainly be done in the case of the Sharpeville Six who are victims, who are sacrificial lambs and who, if the world does not rise up and shout &ldquo;halt&rdquo;, may very well meet the death sentence in order to placate, appease and pacify the extreme right in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to give me an assurance that everything possible is being done, that there is a very clear programme.  I want to know who he is contacting, who has been contacted, what steps will be taken and, in the horrible eventuality that this execution takes place, what follow-up swift, sharp action we will take to show our abhorrence, detestation and revulsion at the prospect of six people being denied life and existence in South Africa.  I look forward with interest to what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Bulbulia for giving me an opportunity to reiterate the Government's concern in relation to the Sharpeville Six.  I am very pleased at all times to make myself available to the Seanad particularly on a matter like this.</P>
      <P>The rejection last week of the application for a retrial of the Sharpeville Six marked a further discouraging stage in the development of this case.  Senator Bulbulia has very fully expressed the horror and revulsion we all feel at the renewed possibility that the South African system will take its course and the Six will be executed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Bulbulia will be aware, this affair was last discussed just three months ago here in the Seanad when the execution of the Six seemed imminent. The concern then expressed echoed the reactions in international organisations and parliaments all over the world. Appeals for clemency were made by every major world leader, by the Secretary General of the United Nations, by the Twelve member states of the European <Col N="1190" /> Community and by concerned organisations of every type and from many parts of the world.  Although &mdash; and this was referred to by Senator Bulbulia &mdash; Ireland has no diplomatic relations with South Africa, this country's concern was communicated to the South African authorities through their Embassy in London.</P>
    <P>This unprecedentedly universal appeal seemed in March to have some effect. The South African President, on the technical grounds that one of the key witnesses had admitted that he had committed perjury, caused the judge hearing the case to order a stay of execution to allow lawyers for the Six to submit applications for a retrial based on fresh evidence.  Any retrial could not relate to whether the Six had actually murdered the Deputy Mayor of Sharpeville &mdash; it had been clearly proved and accepted as referred to by Senator Bulbulia, that none of them took part in the actual murder.  What was at issue was whether persons present in a crowd where a murder was perpetrated can be regarded as guilty of the murder.  In fact, there is even some doubt as to whether two of the Six were actually present in the crowd on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The conviction of the Six was based on the legal doctrine of common purpose &mdash; that their mere presence in the crowd implied participation or connivance in the murder.  Such an application of the doctrine is, of course, unprecedented in western legal systems, on which South African law is based.  It seems even more at odds with common principles of justice. The upholding of the court's conviction on such an interpretation of the law is difficult for us to understand.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which Deputy Mayor Khuzwayo Dlamini was murdered were ghastly and cannot be justified in any way.  The Government by no means seek to condone the brutal attack and revolting killing of this man.  We believe firmly that his killers should be brought to justice.  However understandable it may be that the frustration and deep resentment caused by the iniquitous Apartheid system can result in such savage outbreaks of violence.  No injustice can be invoked to justify the taking <Col N="1191" /> of human life particularly in so dreadful a manner.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while we condemn unreservedly the killing of the Deputy Mayor, we can in no way accept that the execution of six people, whom even the South African legal authorities agree did not carry it out, can be justified in the terms presented.  Indeed, the action savours more of retaliation than of justice in accordance with accepted legal standards. We have already directed an appeal to the South African President and Government to spare the Six.  On behalf of the Seanad and all the people of Ireland I renew that plea today.</P>
    <P>In doing this I take into account the fact that all the legal means at the defence's disposal are not yet exhausted.  The trial judge has ordered a stay of execution until 19 July to allow for an appeal to the Chief Justice of South Africa, with a view to having the trial reopened before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, which is the Court of final appeal. It is only if this appeal should fail and if no direction of a fresh trial is achieved that the granting of clemency lies in President Botha's hands.  We must still hope for a successful legal outcome.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always had a policy of unequivocal opposition to Apartheid, a system of which this very sad case is one appalling result.  We believe that only the total abolition of the Apartheid system can bring to an end the violence that results in deaths such as that of Deputy Mayor Diamini.  To achieve the abolition of Apartheid we do not condone violence. On the contrary, our policy has aimed consistently at applying pressure on the South African Government aimed at persuading that Government by peaceful means to abandon Apartheid.</P>
    <P>As part of that policy we have marked our disapproval by maintaining no diplomatic relations with the South African Government.  This is not hiding behind the thicket of diplomacy.  We also seek to keep contacts to a minimum &mdash; as shown practically by our withdrawal of <Col N="1192" /> grants and subsidies from sporting or cultural bodies maintaining links with South Africa and by withholding official support for trade promotion activities.  We also comply fully with internationally agreed measures, that is, the UN arms embargo and the measures agreed by the twelve member states of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully and with great sympathy to the expressions of concern and grief by Senator Bulbulia here today. I can assure her that her sentiments are fully shared by the Government.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday in the Dáil in reply to a number of questions on this case it remains the earnest hope of the Government that these executions will not take place and that the legal procedures still available will be used successfully by the Six.</P>
    <P>As soon as the rejection of the applications by the Six for a retrial was announced, the situation was considered by the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, who issued a statement on 14 June expressing their deep distress and concern about the fate of the Six and urging the use of all possible legal options to prevent the carrying out of the death penalty.  In addition, the Presidency's representative in Pretoria was instructed to make immediate representations in the matter to the South African Government on behalf of the Twelve.</P>
    <P>The question of making further bilateral representations on behalf of the Six is being kept under close consideration. While I am satisfied that the South African authorities are under no doubt as to the views not only of Ireland but of the world at large, if at any time it appears that a further bilateral approach by Ireland might prove useful to the Sharpeville Six, Senator Bulbulia and other Senators may rest assured that it will be made.  We hope, however, that it will not need to be made, that commonsense will prevail and that a retrial will be ordered and that the Sharpeville Six will be found innocent.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.35 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 28 June 1988.</P>
