      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for the Environment to make financial assistance available to facilitate the introduction of smoke free zones under the Air Pollution Act in view of the very serious deterioration of air quality in Dublin City.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the serious lack of cancer screening facility for Irish women as compared to women in other EC countries, the need for the Minister for Health to indicate a countrywide cancer screening programme which would be consistent with his commitment to preventive medical care.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Seán Haughey of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to use his powers under section 22 (3) of the 1963 Planning Act to rezone the site at Red Rock, Sutton, County Dublin, from Type A (Residential) to Type F (Amenity) in the <Col N="542" /> Dublin County Development Plan, in view of the decision of An Bord Pleanála of 5 January 1988 in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The closure of Barrington's Hospital, Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Doyle, Kennedy, Fennell and Haughey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Doyle's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Kennedy, Fennell and Haughey may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of Business I wish to bring Members up to date on the repair work in the Seanad Chamber.  Senators will recall that when I informed the House on the first two quarterly progress reports by the Office of Public Works on the repair work on 22 July and 30 September of last year, I gave an undertaking to keep Members informed of the up to date position as quarterly reports by the Office of Public Works come to hand.</P>
      <P>I now wish to make an announcement for the information of the House in regard to the Third Progress Report by the Office of Public Works which was considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at their meeting this morning.  In their report the Office of Public Works state and I quote:</P>
      <P>Work on the contract to date has proceeded satisfactorily and no major unexpected problems have arisen.  It is hoped that the work will continue on schedule to completion towards the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having given this assurance, the Office of Public Works go on in their report <Col N="543" /> to deal with aspects of the work under various headings which I do not propose to go into in detail here.  Members who want these details can have them from my office.</P>
    <P>However, there are two areas which should be mentioned.  The first one is concerned with the noise factor of the work which is expected to be more evident in the next phase of the work.  In this regard the report states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In four to six weeks time, the major demolition and reconstruction works to the gable wall will commence.  Every effort is being made to have work scheduled so as to cause minimum possible interference to the operation of the Seanad and of Leinster House generally and this aspect is constantly being monitored.  The demolition work will unfortunately be noisier than anything that has occurred on the site to date but this is unavoidable.  The situation will be kept under continuous examination so that it does not become unbearable and the duration of the work will be kept as short as possible. The patience and understanding of Members of the Seanad during this phase of the work in particular will be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that a significant part of the previous Second Progress Report which I reported to the House on 30 September last was devoted to the noise factor of the work on hand and on that occasion I quoted at length from the letter from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance which sought the co-operation of Members to ensure that the project can be finished on time.  I do not propose to go into detail on this matter again as the record of 30 September speaks for itself.  I just want to give Senators a timely reminder of the request then made for their co-operation and for the co-operation of Members of the Dáil in view of the demolition work to commence in four to six weeks time.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in regard to the Seanad ceiling as I know Senators have been concerned about its <Col N="544" /> conservation.  The Office of Public Works have little to add to their previous report of 30 September as investigation into methods of saving the existing ceiling are continuing.  I will report to the House when I receive the next progress report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I think it would be appropriate if this House passed a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Seán MacBride.  Seán MacBride was a statesman of international standard.  His work for the underprivileged, not alone here but abroad, has been acknowledged through the world.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, it is intended to take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.  It is further proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, statements shall be made at 5 p.m. today on the proposed test at the nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd in north Wales and that the following arrangements shall apply: 1.  No statement other than the Minister's shall exceed 10 minutes.  2.  These statements shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 6.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I join with the Leader of the House on behalf of the Fine Gael group in the vote of sympathy to the family of the late Seán MacBride.  He was a man whose life was the light of this century. Few people can have had such a varied political career as he had.  Perhaps by conventional Irish standards his political career was not a great success.  He was a Member of the Oireachtas for ten years. The party he founded did not make a lasting impact.  Nonetheless, at almost every stage when he entered Irish politics he made a lasting mark; in his work in the courts in the thirties and in his work in the first inter-Party Government.  Most of all he will be remembered for his work in the international forum, his work for humanitarian, libertarian causes right around the world.  I will conclude on Seán <Col N="545" /> MacBride by saying I believe the measure of the man and his character is summed up in a story told to me by the late Todd Andrews.  He told me that when Seán MacBride won the Nobel Peace Prize the cheque which arrived with the prize was a very considerable one.  Seán MacBride merely looked at the cheque, signed his name on the back of it and sent the money to Amnesty International.  That was an indication of the depth of sincerity of Seán MacBride.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to thank the Leader of the House for the speedy way in which he has arranged that statements can be made on this matter of great concern across the Irish Sea.  I hope that the strong voice of this House will have some impact in changing that bad decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the tribute to the late Seán MacBride.  I am glad now I shared many platforms with him on such issues as the anti-nuclear movement worldwide, our own neutrality and our sovereignty.  His energetic commitment to these causes was remarkable.  His age and status gave such imspiration to young people. However, the absurd attempts at instant canonisation over the weekend did no service to his memory.  In Ireland we seem to lose all sense of proportion when a public man dies.  We take the injunction <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> to hypocritical limits in public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if we spoke less scandalously in private about the living.  In Seán MacBride's cause it has to be recorded, regrettably, that his contribution to the cause of peace at home, to the national debate on the North, was in inverse proportion to his service to peace worldwide.  It is a pity that his thinking in the area of this tragic problem remained dangerously simplistic to the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Descending to prosaic levels, on the Order of Business, may I inquire of the Leader of the House when it is proposed <Col N="546" /> to proceed with the Debate in the Seanad on the Constitution?  I understand there was general agreement in principle that this is the appropriate Chamber to debate this matter.  We are now in 1988 and the Progressive Democrats have circulated their draft Constitution.  Even though it proposes to abolish this House &mdash; indeed because it proposes to abolish it &mdash; it seems that this is a renewed time of relevance to debate the Constitution.  It will not go away and this is the place where it should be debated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with the Leader of the House in extending our sympathy to the family of the late Seán MacBride.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to say that we mourned his passing and shared many platforms with him, particularly in connection with Amnesty International and the Anti-Apartheid Movement and many other such international causes in the area of peace.</P>
      <P>Many words have been written and spoken about the man over the past number of days.  We feel incapable of expressing our sadness at his passing but it is worthy of his memory to record the immense input he had in all sections of public life, whether as a politician, as a barrister, or as an international peace emissary.  We were fortunate to be honoured by his presence as part of the Tipperary Festival of Peace which is a convention which is trying to promote peace worldwide and, indeed, peace in our own land.  Seán MacBride at that time, two or three years ago, accepted immediately the opportunity to attend that small forum in the whole process of peace.  His contribution in Tipperary at that time will not be forgotten.  It is appropriate that this House, as part of the Oireachtas, would remember his passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House for giving us the opportunity to discuss the proposals of another sovereign State in connection with a power plant across our waters, which proposals could endanger all our lives, particularly <Col N="547" /> those living on the east coast.  It is appropriate that this House should have an opportunity to express its view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself strongly with the remarks of my colleague, Senator John A. Murphy, despite the fact that I would not wish any disrespect to the sensitivities or feelings of the family of Dr. MacBride at this time of mourning.  Bereavement is a common human experience and one must always be sensitive to the feelings of the family &mdash; Dr. MacBride was a highly controversial character.  In Irish public life it is foolish that in this House almost every single day we are asked to stand in memory of people who are sometimes from a highly coloured and controversial background.  If this practice is not to be brought into disrepute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, when it is proposed to take item No. 33 which concerns an amendment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  The reason I ask for this to be taken as a matter of urgency is that it will, I think, receive support from members of the Government party, including Senator Haughey who has attempted to place on the Adjournment today the matter of the Red Rock development.  This problem would be cured if the suggestions contained in item No. 33, which came originally from the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, were implemented and the expenditure of £800,000 as a result of a decisiom in this matter would have been obviated, a sum <Col N="548" /> of money which would have paid for the retention of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would briefly like to mention a matter on the Order of Business for today which will be extended into next week.  Thanks to the letter of the Independent Member, Senator Joe O'Toole, to <i>The Irish Times</i>, I learned that there was a calling of the faithful to the Seanad this afternoon.  Having got over that initial shock, I then arrived here today to find that this matter, the one affecting Northern Ireland, would be debated tomorrow, which is Thursday, a day on which I have an operating list.  I thought then that I would be able to make my contribution next week.  Unfortunately, I gather that Budget Day is Wednesday of next week and that this debate is now scheduled for Thursday.  It does require quite a lot of reorganisation in the hospital in which I work.  Before Senator John A. Murphy went to America I knew that he was a very tolerant person.  However since he came back I have cause to suspect that he may have had some conversion because I understand from this afternoon when the request was made to him that the day of the debate be changed, that there will be no joy whatsoever about that matter.  I would like clarification as to when the <Col N="549" /> debate will take place.  If it takes place next Thursday on the matter affecting Northern Ireland, that is, that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to clarify its policy on Northern Irelan, I would very much like to speak to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>As a fellow sponsor of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement along with the late Seán MacBride, I would like to pay tribute to his memory in so far as he touched the African Continent and the issues in South Africa and, indeed, in South West Africa.  He was a strong supporter of Namibia and he was appointed UN Commissioner for the former West German colony of South West Africa which is currently illegally held by South Africa.  He had an empathy and an ability to get on with Africans and understood the problems of that Continent and of that benighted region of South Africa.  The world and this country in particular owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.  I mourn his passing and I sympathise with his relatives.  I am unhappy at the tone of some of the remarks that were made here this afternoon. No doubt many of them were made in good faith.  There is a time for analysis, there is a time for assessment, there is a time for an adjudication on the life's work of a person and there is a time for criticism but now we mourn the person, we pay tribute to the individual and we extend our condolences to the bereaved family&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He was a public man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who was a public man and who will be adjudicated upon in time when there is a pause for reflection, time for analysis and time for a coming together of minds on the life's work of this man who served this country and the causes he represented to the best of his ability.  I did not always agree with the late Seán MacBride.  I was amazed at his stands on the two recent referenda but I hope I have the ability to separate the thoughts and concerns of an individual <Col N="550" /> on issues from the person himself and that is what is required of us this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Constitution.  It was the Leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Manning, who first mooted this idea at the time of the anniversary of the Constitution.  We have persistently called for a debate on this issue and it is timely in view of another party's launching of a review of the Constitution and specific proposals.  It is important that we in this House should look at the Constitution and in particular at our role as outlined in that Constitution and now under threat from another party, from a sort of populous bandwagon, from members of the press who have in many instances an ill-informed and unthinking attitude towards this House which, in my years of experience in it, has served very well indeed the legislation which it processes.</P>

      <P>Ní fheadar cad tá ar siúl ag daoine anseo.  Níor chuala mé a leithéid riamh faoi dhuine a cailleadh le déanaí agus na rudaí a dúradh faoi Sheán MacBride.  Bhí an-aithne agam air.  Cuid mhaith rudaí a dúirt sé níor aontaigh mé leo in aon chor, go mór mhór mar a luaigh an Seanadóir Bulbulia, an dá reifreann a bhí againn le déanaí.  Nevertheless, I do have to accept the fact that Seán MacBride had a capacity to inspire young people and that is not my testimony.  The best testimony I have to Seán MacBride's record is from the young people who spent nearly two years outside Dunnes Stores in Henry Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and what they had to say to me about Seán MacBride had nothing to do with the areas of his record where I and many other peole would not have agreed with him but his capacity to get through to people who were in the middle of a struggle on some issue is a far better testimony to the man's convictions than any amount of detached analysis.  I had the great privilege on 10 December last, United Nations Human Rights Day, of sharing a platform with him, probably <Col N="551" /> one of the last public platforms he ever spoke on in this country before his death. He spoke on two issues: human rights and homelessness.</P>
      <P>Seán MacBride over recent years showed a willingness to take part in issues and campaigns that won no great popularity for him in this country.  Like others of us here, he opposed the Criminal Justice Bill which was popular with the public when it was going through the Oireachtas and he got no popularity for doing so.  When he espoused Amnesty and the anti-apartheid movement they were not as fashionable as they are today. They were minority issues and they were seen to be way out liberal issues and it was a source of great inspiration to the many involved in those campaigns and, similarly, in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, that somebody of his stature was prepared to identify with issues that were singularly unpopular.</P>
      <P>That is why he deserves the tributes which have been paid to him, not because he was perfect.  There are no perfect human beings.  There are no perfect human beings amongst the independent Senators, the Fine Gael Senators, the Labour Senators or indeed the Fianna Fáil Senators for that matter.  Therefore, it is suggested that because a person was less than perfect or that we disagreed with him, he is unworthy of tribute. Whether or not I agreed with him a man with the record of Seán MacBride deserves the tributes which have been paid to him.  I want to be associated fully and without qualification with the tributes paid to him here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to associate myself with Senator Lanigan's proposal of sympathy on the death of Seán MacBride. Some of the contributions and some of the interruptions have been distinctly unhelpful.  We are debasing the Seanad, as Senator Norris rightly said, if we continually propose votes of sympathy to people in this House for no apparent reason.  If we do propose a vote of sympathy it is only right that it should not <Col N="552" /> pass on the nod and we should not canonise these people, as Senator Murphy said, in the Seanad on the day.  It is only right that constructive criticism of someone like Seán MacBride should be uttered here on the day but not in a malicious way or in a nasty way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand exactly what we are doing.  What was said by the proposer of this motion and by Senator Bulbulia was very material about the life of Seán MacBride.  They were entitled to say that and you did not interrupt or pull them up for doing so.  Those on this side of the House should be entitled to question some of the ideals of Seán MacBride while this motion is going through and I do so now.  While he was associated with many worthy causes it should be noted that he was a controversial figure and was also associated with many very doubtful causes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the family of Seán MacBride and to endorse what has been said by Senator Bulbulia and the Leader of the House.  I too offer my sympathy to his family.  He was his own man and a great international figure.  We always seem to knock our own.  He was a great international figure and I respected him.  His father was born very close to where I live and he also had a great record.  The stock was good and I see nothing controversial about him.  I do not think this issue should have arisen here today and I humbly offer my sympathy to his family and relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to put on the record of the House that no speaker stood up today to dissociate himself from the tributes which have been paid.  Each speaker, in his or her own way, picked out aspects of Seán MacBride's life which they referred to in associating themselves with the vote of sympathy.  That some Senators picked <Col N="553" /> out aspects of Seán MacBride's life which perhaps were unpopular and unacceptable to some people shows the honesty of the speakers.</P>
      <P>However, there is a particular point that we need to address, that is, that first we should decide whose passing and in what circumstances should be marked with a vote of sympathy in this House and secondly we should decide the appropriate way in which it should be done. Should it simply be a vote of sympathy to the family or should it allow people to go into a discussion on their lives?  It is unfair for Senators to suggest that speakers were not associating themselves with the vote of sympathy and nobody inferred or said that Seán MacBride was unworthy of tribute.  That word was not used by any of the speakers.  People used their own way of saying it and I think that should be clearly seen in the record.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise again the question of a debate on the Constitution.  It seems extraordinary that one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Seanad, which is infinitely suitable for a debate on the Constitution &mdash; a matter which has been touched on time and again on our Order of Business &mdash; has not had this matter put before us for a debate.  I want it put before us in a way that will not cause difficulty for the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party, if that happens to be their problem.  We all have contributions to make on this matter and I do not think any Government can be responsible for the problems in the Constitution. Every Government can learn from a debate on the Constitution.  We have a clear duty to debate the Constitution and I urge the Leader of the House to give us an opportunity to do that.</P>

I should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the relatives of Seán MacBride. The greatest tribute that could be paid to his memory was the huge attendance at the removal of his remains and his funeral.  I agree with Senator Bulbulia that this week is the time to sympathise with his family.  We can judge him at a later time.</P>

      <P>It is because of my special interest in the needs of the handicapped &mdash; I am aware that the Cathaoirleach and other Senators have an interest in that area &mdash; that I should like the warmest congratulations of Seanad Éireann, of the voluntary organisations and associations for the handicapped, to be extended to Christopher Nolan, the 22-year-old Dublin author, who has been paralysed from birth, on winning the prestigious Whitbread Book Award for 1987 worth £18,750 for his autobiographical book &ldquo;Under the Eye of the Clock&rdquo;.  Christopher summed up his achievement in his own brave words when he said: &ldquo;Tonight, crippled man is taking his place on the world literary stage&rdquo;.  The judges described his book as a unique, moving and powerful account of a young, gifted author crippled since birth.  In my belief, Christopher serves as an inspiration, as a symbol of hope for the handicapped people of the world. We should extend our congratulations to him, to his father, Joseph, his mother, Bernadette, and to his family.  I am aware of the Cathaoirleach's special interest in this area and that many Senators have a deep concern about the needs of the handicapped and I am sure all would like to join with me in extending the congratulations of the House to Christopher Nolan on his magnificent achievement.</P>

      <P>I would like very much to be associated with what my colleague, <Col N="555" /> Senator Kennedy, has said.  It is appropriate that the warmest congratulations should be sent from the House to Christopher Nolan.  I was very moved this morning at his acceptance speech, read by his mother, and I should like to make one comment on it.  He referred in it to crippled man taking his place but in my view it is far broader than that because Christopher Nolan will come to be regarded as somebody who is capable of being recognised as an artist in his own right.  He has managed to make the tag of his disablement completely irrelevant. I should like most warmly and forcibly to be associated with this tribute to him.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of having a debate about the Constitution I should like to tell the House that we have not decided not to have a debate on the Constitution.  It was impossible to have such a debate in the last session because, as Members will recall, we had to deal with a lot of Government business.  In fact, we dealt with more Government business in that session than ever before.  I should like to tell the House that a debate on the Constitution will take place as soon as possible and I suggest that the Whips <Col N="556" /> meet to arrange the form of debate.  I must point out that it will not take precedence over Government business. Government business will have priority and that will be borne in mind when we are arranging for a debate on the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Senator Robb suggested that the Order of Business should be changed to take his motion.  I should like to tell him that a debate on the topic he is concerned about is scheduled to commence at 3.30 p.m. tomorrow and will conclude on Thursday week.

      <P>The Appropriation Act was passed at the conclusion of the last session.  Today we have an opportunity to speak on the terms of the Act in general. I suppose what we are about is largely something of an academic exercise because the Act has been passed and the moneys have been well and truly allocated. Nevertheless, it is important that we should have an opportunity to range over the issue of Government expenditure and perhaps hone in on particular programmes which are of interest or concern to us and to raise and highlight areas where we feel there is room for improvement in policy, breadth of vision and wider thinking.</P>
      <P>At the outset it is useful to take stock of Government financial policy and examine the state of the nation's finances, the management of which has been entrusted to a minority Fianna Fáil Administration.  The purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental estimates for the supply services both non capital and capital, including Supplementary Estimates, which were necessary during the year and, of course, the 1987 Appropriation Act follows the usual format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last year has seen something of a political and, indeed, an economic revolution. The revolution or the complete turnaround has been largely &mdash; indeed solely &mdash; on the part of the party in Government, Fianna Fáil, who have conducted a series of dizzying U-turns leaving backbenchers and, more important at this stage, supporters, winded and in <Col N="558" /> many instances in need of systematic debriefing by senior personnel.  It has been a most extraordinary about turn. While I am glad about it in the sense that the fiscal policy being pursued was put before Fianna Fáil by Fine Gael, nevertheless what saddens me and leaves me somewhat disheartened is what this U-turn or about turn has done to the body politic and the whole political system and to people's belief in the integrity of politics. It has in many ways damaged whatever trust and credence they had in the politicians who run this country.</P>
    <P>I find that worrying and disturbing, but I console myself by saying that my own party, Fine Gael, will never treat themselves or the public with what I regard as contempt.  We will not make liars of ourselves.  It gives me no pleasure to say this; I do not like to have to say it but it is a fact.  The Minister may shake his head and look rather anguished, but I remind him of posters such as &ldquo;Health Cuts Hurt the Old, the Poor and the Handicapped&rdquo;. I remind him of the about turn and the savage swingeing, unthought out, bludgeon-like cuts which have been visited upon our health care.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach in his first major interview since taking office on &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; the Sunday before last.  The astute interviewer, well practised, confronted him with this whole question of the about turn and the complete change in economic attitude and handling of the nation's finances.  I listened with bated breath to hear what the response would be.  Frankly I found it specious and I am most unhappy about it.  It was a half baked excuse and totally transparent in my view, in that a cliche ridden sentence or two were trotted out to the effect that &ldquo;of course circumstances had changed and when we got in we really saw what the books were like; circumstances alter cases&rdquo; and all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I must say I was less than convinced as, I was interested to see, were the political analysts who had a good look at this long awaited interview and subjected it to fairly hard criticism.  In my view they were right.  What is being played out is a <Col N="559" /> political game.  I am confident that such a game will never again be tolerated by the electorate, and it should not be. Whatever Fianna Fáil say to the electorate before the next election, however soon that may come, I imagine will be treated with a good deal of disbelief by a long suffering electorate who could quite rightly feel that they cannot believe a word said to them by that party.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to some provisions in the Appropriation Act that are of interest to me in particular, ones which perhaps we do not normally have an opportunity to cover in a debate on the subject of finance.  The items are very carefully listed and the supply grants and the Appropriations-in-aid are spelled out very clearly.  I know that in the main Senators use the opportunity of the debate on the appropriations to range wide and free, perhaps to ride pet hobby horses, to raise particular concerns, to point to areas of gratification and satisfaction and to areas where there is a need for remedy or improvement, additional financing or wider policy initiatives.</P>
    <P>One area I would like to cover is listed as item 6 in the Schedule to the Appropriation Act.  It might not be seen as the most significant sum but I would like to draw the attention of the House to it and discuss it for a few moments.  It is &ldquo;For the salaries and expenses of the National Gallery including certain grants-in-aid.&rdquo; The supply grants have been listed at £803,000 and the Appropriations-in-aid at £1,000.  It is important that we look at this.  The sums involved are patently inadequate.  I am very disturbed indeed by recent reports that paintings in the gallery are deteriorating.  They are flaking, cracking and warping because of failures in what has now become a most obsolete air conditioning system.  I am indebted to John Armstrong reporter with <i>The Irish Times</i>, who spelled out the situation in no uncertain terms in an article on Friday last, 15 January.</P>
    <P>I refer to the air conditioning system which is so important when we talk about picture conservation and conditions in <Col N="560" /> the gallery.  This system breaks down frequently and because there is no refrigeration plant the rapid change and fluctuations in temperature levels and humidity cause the wood or the canvas backings of some paintings to crack and warp.  The Director of the National Gallery, Homan Potterton, who I am sorry to say has announced his forthcoming retirement from the post, has gone on record and described conditions in the National Gallery as a national disgrace.</P>
    <P>Homan Potterton is not an alarmist. He is not given to exaggeration and he is not a self-seeking publicist.  He does care very deeply about the gallery and about its contents and he has done a tremendous job in his time in promoting the gallery and attracting people to it.  His successful mounting of exhibitions has certainly ensured that he will have a very firm place in the history of curators and directors of the National Gallery. Because he is about to leave this post, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to him for all he has undertaken in the most adverse of circumstances and to thank him on behalf of all those people who have enjoyed the gallery while it has been entrusted to his care and directorship. I would like to wish him well in the future in whatever area he pursues his career and furthers his talents.</P>
    <P>Homan Potterton, in speaking on the gallery and the collection therein described the condition of some pictures, due to damp, as extremely distressing.  I was distressed to read this and I think it is important to draw the attention of the Minister to the situation.  I know funds are short and we have certain agreed parameters of expenditure but still it is important that Ministers should know what is going on, where the difficulties lie and the costs involved.  They should give some assurances that the facts are known and that matters will be taken in hand.</P>
    <P>I want to spend a little time on this problem because it is important to put it on the record of the House.  There will be no point when some of these pictures are damaged beyond repair in involving <Col N="561" /> ourselves in a great hand-wringing exercise. That would be too late.</P>
    <P>A number of the gallery's most important pictures, including Murillo's &ldquo;The Holy Family&rdquo; and Titian's &ldquo;Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione&rdquo;, have had to be removed from the walls for repair and restoration and gallery staff say that several other paintings, including at least three in the Spanish Room, are showing visible signs of &ldquo;bloom&rdquo;, a cloudy discolouration of the varnish caused by damp.  Visitors to the gallery have also noticed spots of paint flaking off various other important paintings and in the case of the icons, some of these precious artefacts have become so badly warped that large gaps are now visible between the paintings and their frames.</P>
    <P>Daily measurements of air humidity and temperature in the gallery for the month of January and throughout last year have regularly exceeded both the upper and lower danger limits set out in the UNESCO specifications for art galleries and museums and the measurements have gone off the scale for class II galleries recommended by the scientific department of the National Gallery in London, one of the acknowledged international authorities on gallery environments. A spokesman for the Office of Public Works said yesterday that they accepted that the air conditioning and humidifying system in the gallery was not operating effectively.  The Office of Public Works are quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 January 1988 as saying, &ldquo;We just don't have provision to satisfactorily modify the system or to replace it.  We accept that a new system is desirable.&rdquo;  I understand that recently the Government postponed indefinitely a major £5 million refurbishment plan for the gallery which was to include the installation of a new air conditioning system and the thinking now is that it is hoped to implement this plan within the next few years subject, of course, to the availability of funds.</P>
    <P>We have all been overjoyed with the munificent gesture on the part of Sir Alfred Beit who bequeathed his <Col N="562" /> extremely valuable, indeed priceless, pictures to the nation and presented them to the gallery.  This has given added urgency to the problems in the gallery. We might have allowed the thing to tick over and to have turned a blind eye to it had not these gifts been presented by Sir Alfred and Lady Beit.  I do not think it is too much to ask that a small fraction of the value of that gift should be spent to fix the place up so that it would be a fitting home for the paintings that are already in it and for the Beit collection which we are privileged beyond words to have received.  The Beit collection is valued commercially at between £50 million and £100 million and it is currently hanging in room 28 on the ground floor, next to room 30 where some of the largest humidity fluctuations have been recorded.  That is why I have taken pains to deal at some length with the problem of air conditioning, the humidity and the effect that this faulty, obsolete and useless system is having on the paintings and artefacts which are the treasure of the nation, which belong to all of us and which have been solemnly entrusted to the Government to maintain, care and house in appropriate and fitting circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to use the opportunity of my contribution on the Appropriation Act to draw attention to that and to the urgency which has been pointed up by Sir Alfred Beit's gift to the nation.  I would ask the Minister to take it to heart and when this debate is being replied to I hope he will find it possible to say that strong consideration will be given to allowing funds, if necessary from the national lottery, to help out in what is a severe problem in the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>I want to change tack completely from a domestic issue to a global matter.  Our aid to the Third World is an issue which is dear and close to the Irish people.  It is listed under Vote 45 &mdash; Contributions to International Organisations and for certain Official Development Assistance, including certain grants-in-aid.  I was privileged to have been a guest at the film &ldquo;Cry Freedom&rdquo; which was given a premiere in Dublin last week and the <Col N="563" /> proceeds of which went to the Third World organisation, Trocaire.  The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Calleary, was at the premiere and was pleased to be there.  However, in the course of an interview afterwards he was asked if he felt happy at the diminution in funding which is now to go to Ireland's official development aid in view of the impression made on him by this film.  This film was obviously used as a vehicle to prompt the question.  I felt sorry for the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, because I felt his heart was not really in the reply.  I know the Government would wish to see our contributions at least kept at the rate that they had been at and not cut.  I am disappointed that they found it necessary to cut so drastically £11 million approximately out of the Estimates for overseas development aid.  What I find most disturbing of all is the fact that the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs has been increased by 3 per cent and so the whole brunt of the cut in this area falls back on development aid, which is an area close to the heart of Irish people. They have demonstrated that in a very factual and practical way by an outpouring of generosity to campaigns in the past, most particularly the campaign which was orchestrated, led and prompted by our own Bob Geldof.  While we are discussing this matter, it is important to make a plea in the context of the Estimates for 1989 that there should not be cuts of a similar magnitude because the net effect would be a dismantling of Ireland's bilateral aid programme and I think the public would not countenance that.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the actual effect of these kinds of cuts on the personnel in the field, the volunteer workers, the people who devise programmes, the individual indigenous people in the area served by these programmes who are subjected to a stop-start, uncertain, doubtful programme.  It is difficult to work in a Third World situation as the climate is very often hostile and conditions are bad but to add to those factors and to have the situation blighted <Col N="564" /> by an uncertainty of funding is very often the last straw.  It is easy to lose heart when one is working in an area of deprivation, with very basic materials and with people who are oppressed, who need to be given heart and who need to have practical financial assistance.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to consider very strongly the feelings of the Irish people in relation to Third-World expenditure. The largest cuts have fallen on bilateral aid, that is, the aid the Irish Government give directly and voluntarily to the Third World.  Our bilateral aid programme is concentrated on four priority countries, Lesotho, Tanzania, Sudan and Zambia.  This bilateral aid has been reduced by 29 per cent, from £14 million to £10 million.  Three of these countries are on the United Nations list of the 40 poorest countries in the world, with a <i>per capita</i> GNP of around $200 compared to Ireland's $5,000.  The cuts we have implemented are affecting the poorest of the poor.  Anybody who has been to a Third World country and who has experienced at first hand the living problems of other human beings, when returning to Ireland is subjected to an extraordinary culture shock because by comparison we are so much better off, so much better, so much better nourished and so much better cared for.  I am deeply unhappy about cuts in this area.</P>
    <P>The disaster relief provision was a derisory sum given the alarming reports from many parts of the Third World and the very real threat of a fresh outbreak of famine in Ethiopia which, of course, is being portrayed again on our television screens.  I would like to think that somewhere there is money that could be used if pressure is put on us and if the situation in that country deteriorates.  I hope that does not happen but I would like to feel that, in an area where we have a moral responsibility to our fellow human beings, we would have that little bit of fat somewhere in the kitty to give to the poorest of the poor in the world.</P>
    <P>The contribution of £1.5 million to the world food programme which provides food aid in famine situations and which the Government pledged in March 1986 <Col N="565" /> will not be paid according to the Estimates. For all the reasons I have mentioned, the case for maintaining and even increasing Third World aid by the Government needs to be restated, underscored and emphasised.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to repeat that I am keeping very firmly in mind our economic crisis and I am aware of the very painful adjustments which have had to be made in so many areas of public expenditure in this country.  Notwithstanding all of this, we must remind ourselves that we are still the 25th richest country in the world. Along with the other members of the OECD, we have accepted a responsibility to contribute towards the alleviation of mass poverty in the Third World which leaves 500 million people seriously undernourished.  The situation in the Third World, and particularly in the Sahel or the sub-Saharan area of Africa, has deteriorated dramatically in the eighties. There are a number of reasons for this.</P>
    <P>There has been a complete collapse of commodity prices to their lowest level in 30 years with the resultant fall of 15 per cent in the purchasing power of Third World exports between 1980 and 1986. There is a massive burden of Third World debt which now exceeds one trillion United States dollars.  It is incomprehensible and difficult to conceive of that kind of debt and it certainly puts our debt in sharper focus.  There has been a virtual disappearance of new voluntary commercial lending and stagnant ODA which resulted in 1986 in an outflow of resources of over 30 billion United States dollars from the Third World.  All these matters, along with increasing malnutrition and tremendous political instability, particularly in the frontline states in southern Africa and in South Africa itself, must highlight the very real plight of so many of these people.</P>
    <P>The need for ODA has never been greater and it is so sad that at a time when the need is greatest we take out our pruning shears and snip £11 million off that budget.  If enough people were aware of the facts there would be an outcry.  We discussed the whole area of development <Col N="566" /> co-operation a great deal in this House during the last Seanad but now the Government have seen fit not to reconstitute the all-party Committee on Cooperation with Developing Countries, and therefore the question of debating reports of these committees does not arise.  The whole issue has slid to the edge of the table and has dropped off.  This may suit in the context of the cuts that have been made but it is not moral.  A debate on the Appropriation Act gives me an opportunity, which I grasp willingly and readily, to enunciate my fears and my concerns about the absence of funding which the developing countries which we assist have been forced to cope with.</P>
    <P>I hope I have done justice to that area. It is an area about which I care very deeply.  The primary reason for giving aid to the Third World is a moral and an ethical one.  It is important to keep that firmly in mind, although there are reasons of self-interest which I am sure are not lost on Government.  Deputy Lenihan has spoken in the Dáil on this matter and I would like to quote him because if people do not buy the moral and the ethical reason for funding developing countries they might buy the arguments which follow the self-interested model.  I quote from the Official Report of 8 November 1983 when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said:</P>
    <P>Any reluctance or fall-back by the developed world in regard to its aid programmes can lead to the disadvantage in practical economic terms of the developed world by depriving itself of a market and, looking at it at its bleakest, the gradual overwhelming of the Third World by a huge deprived population ... who will not live indefinitely in that sort of deprived situation, making for enormous political and ideological upheavals in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Indeed, that is so.  That is an incontrovertible fact and, as I say, if we do not buy the moral and the ethical reasons and the correctness of the action, then perhaps through self-interest or fear or <Col N="567" /> anxiety we will keep our contributions up to the level which we have given in the past even if we are not able to increase them.</P>
    <P>When I mention the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I would like to send him good wishes for a speedy recovery.  I was sorry indeed to hear that he was hospitalised.  He was in this House a great deal during the last session and I wish him a speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to discuss is the area of cuts in funding for women's organisations.  I gather that some money has now been made available through the Department of Health and that organisations are entitled to make a case for themselves and apply for some small funding.  I am not sure that this information has got out to the necessary quarters because a habit had built up of approaching the office of the Minister of State with special responsibility for women's affairs over the past four years. Women's groups and organisations had liaised effectively and to very good effect from the financial point of view with this office.  They found that their requests were met with understanding and sympathy, and if not with the amount of money they asked for, at least with some funding or with some practical assistance from the Minister of State and her officials.  Now, the whole thing appears to be subsumed into the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has some sort of co-ordinating role in ensuring that legislation and areas affecting women will come together and will have a particular or single policy thrust or will be monitored in some way.  I am unhappy about that because if responsibilities are spread around several Departments and if the person who is responsible for monitoring is not given a centralised area and funding, it sometimes ends up that nobody is really responsible.  I have a list here of information which was requested by the all-party committee on women's affairs from different women's organisations and it makes fairly bleak reading <Col N="568" /> as to how these groups will be funded in 1988.  They fared badly in 1987 and they faced a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety as to their funding.  Many of them wondered if they would actually be able to continue to exist.  Here I come to a general criticism of what Government is about.</P>
    <P>I know we know there is an emphasis on fiscal policy and I know we know that it is important to get the nation's finances under control and that it is necessary to cut Government expenditure and offer inducements to people to resign from their public service jobs.  Apart from getting the finances under control I see very little else in the way of policy thinking, broad strategy &mdash; other than that of sheer political survival &mdash; co-ordinated responses, breadth of vision targets.  I really fault the Government for this because they spent their four years in Opposition denying a reality which they now accept and they entered office absolutely bankrupt of policies.  This is starting to show.</P>
    <P>When they realised that cuts of a certain magnitude were needed in the public service and in the funding of Government Departments and services to the public generally they went wild.  There was a disorderly riot.  There was no attempt at an evaluation in any sphere or in any area.  I think even they would concede that they hope, in 1988, they will have at least a planned, co-ordinated, evaluative response to the problems and to the cuts which I do not deny are necessary but which I would criticise roundly and soundly on the basis that they were poorly thought out, ill-conceived and not particularly diplomatically handled.  It is not that it is ever easy to cut.  Of course it is not.  It is never easy to take anything away from anybody, even a child who has a lollipop.  There are ways of doing things and this Government when they took office and did their about turn and their U-turns did not enjoy the confidence of the people precisely because they were publicly seen to renege on all they had said over the past four years, on all their election promises and plethora of posters <Col N="569" /> and all the rest that they asserted they stood for.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the public feel a massive and enormous discontent and that the backbenchers and supporters of Fianna Fáil, in particular, are feeling so restive, and so unhappy.  There is talk of constituency revisions and boundary changes in order to enhance the political popularity of the party who hold power by the slimmest of minorities and, indeed, hold it by virtue of the political responsibility and concern for the country of the Fine Gael Party.  We will be watching with interest what will be put before the Dáil on 27 January.  Many of us remember another January when the budget was followed by a certain change of direction and thereby hangs a tale or two.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the women's organisations to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  The National Association of Widows in Ireland is a grand organisation, a great bunch of women and they are there a long time providing a counselling and information service for widows.  They are one of the earliest of the women's self-help organisations. They raise funds through raffles, sales of work, jumble sales and cake sales.  Now, is not that just grand?  I would love to be introduced to the men's organisation that raises money with cake sales and jumble sales.  I know they have raffles but by and large they tend to get a greater degree of Government funding than do women's organisations.</P>
    <P>In particular I would like to make the point that the National Association of Widows in Ireland over the past 20 years received only £5,000 approximately from Government sources and that is a pretty lousy track record, and a pretty poor one I would think.  They are under tremendous stress through lack of funds and will shortly have to consider if their head office can be maintained.  That is just one women's organisation feeling the pinch keenly, one that provides an important service to widows.  It must be remembered that, statistically speaking, men die earlier than women and there are a large number of widows in this country, many <Col N="570" /> of them of quite a young age with young families to rear.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and Their Children.  They are normally funded by the health boards, Government Departments including the Departments of Health and Social Welfare and the Department of the Taoiseach, membership subscriptions and the Health Education Bureau &mdash; now subsumed into the Department of Health.  The got a once-off grant of £6,000 from the Department of Social Welfare and they can only remain open, it seems, until perhaps the end of the year.  They have a recurring need for finance of £23,000 approximately. Health board grants in the past have provided £13,000 but they urgently need a further £10,000.  They are the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and Their Children.</P>
    <P>Does anybody remember the referendum? Does anybody remember the furore that aroused and the cant, the hypocrisy, the soft talk and sweet words directed towards the unmarried mother and her child?  We are great, just great at words.  We are great verbalisers, but when it comes to funding, maintaining, succouring, preserving, conserving and cherishing, we fall short.  In funding that organisation, it is manifestly proven that we have done very little indeed and that all our lip-service has not been matched by practical generosity.  For the AIM group for family law reform, there is no funding available, and without funds it will have to close in April 1988.  That group provides information, counselling and services to people who really have nowhere else to turn.  They operate throughout the country.  There is an active, small group in Waterford to whom I have referred people, and from whom I have from time to time sought advice and information.  I am very disturbed that so many good voluntary groups in the country are facing the prospect of closure.</P>
    <P>The Rape Crisis Centre has got publicity. It does a tremendous amount of good work.  Incidence of rape appears to be on the increase.  Some of the cases <Col N="571" /> which have been reported have been terrifying. The Government need to put resources into organisations and groups who are prepared to cope with counselling and dealing with the aftermath of horrendous crime, such as rape.  Rape crisis centres should be able to get funding. More importantly, they should know that the funding, however small, is available.</P>
    <P>The Waterford Rape Crisis Centre received a grant of £500 per annum from the South Eastern Health Board in 1984, 1985 and 1986, but it is now dependent on voluntary contributions and fund-raising. I happen to know of the work that body is doing because I live in Waterford. I realise that apart from the actual sum, which is small, the feeling that the State was behind them, and was prepared through the health board to fund even that small amount of money, was important and significant.  Apart from the money itself, the actual support of that kind of backing was good and useful.  In Waterford, new premises is an absolute priority but unless there is some injection of capital the situation looks bleak and pretty hopeless.  That is one area I choose to illustrate because it is one that I know of intimately.</P>
    <P>The umbrella body for most of these organisations is the Council for the Status of Women.  It has 60 affiliate organisations. With its present cuts, it expects to be the sole supporter of half the population of this country.  The Council for the Status of Women is a prop, which gives information to and concerns itself with the needs of more than half the population.  It is very important at a time when cuts are being made in health, particularly as they impact on womens health &mdash; and my colleague, Senator Nuala Fennell, has a request for a debate on the Adjournment on the lack of cancer screening facilities for women &mdash; that a body such as the Council for the Status of Women would be able to oversee, comment on, criticise and draw attention to cuts in spending on health, education, social welfare and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> The estimates which this body submitted to the Department of the Taoiseach have been severly cut.  Maybe it is a very mean thought on my part, and perhaps I should not voice it, but I am going to.  I wonder is it because a lot of these organisations are critical and point out shortfalls and gaps, that they are finding the squeeze coming on them, in the same way as independent bodies like An Foras Forbartha, the National Social Service Board and the Health Education Bureau suddenly found themselves under threat?  What are the Government afraid of?  Are they afraid of independent voices?  Are they afraid of criticism?  Do they want to dampen down voices that will be raised when there is an attack on an area of deep concern to them?  I am fearful lest this become a pattern.  I am watching it and I notice that many people made criticisms along those lines when the National Social Service Board, the Health Education Bureau and An Foras Forbartha were given the chop.  Many people expressed that view and it is certainly one that is giving concern.  I would hate to think that a pattern of some sort was being laid down.</P>
    <P>I will leave the issues of the women's organisations now, except to say that women, so far, have not received particularly advantageous, sensitive or special treatment under this Administration, in sharp contrast to the awareness of their position under the last Administration, when it was certainly a policy signal and an actual fact of policy that cognisance was given to the fact that there had been and that there was an imbalance in the way in which men and women were treated both under the law and in terms of funding for their areas of particular concern in this country.  It is disappointing that on so many fronts the whole area of women's affairs has been put on the back boiler or, as I have said before, has managed to slip off the table. Again, I would just like to voice my concern and my disappointment at the way in which funding has been given to them.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 3 is for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, including certain cultural and <Col N="573" /> archival activities and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.  Here I would refer to an archival matter.  It really is an archaeological matter, but I expect it could be covered under Vote No. 3, if not under another one.  It is an issue of funding which concerns recent valuable archaeological finds in Waterford city.  I will use the opportunity of the debate on the Appropriation Act to draw attention to it.  We were particularly pleased in Waterford when we were included in the special designation under tax and rates for city centre development.  Our ambitious and far-seeing city council and our fine City Manager, Mr. Michael Doody, immediately set about organising the best possible utilisation of this breakthrough which we had achieved.</P>
    <P>We have three sites in the city centre which are now the subject of development and upon which building will commence, it is hoped, in April of this year, but we have come across a problem which is unique to Waterford, which is why I want to draw attention to it.  We have found that in this whole area which we wish to develop there is a treasure trove of archaeological remains.  So far, £130,000 has been expended and the only State subvention in all of this has been £10,000 from the Office of Public Works. We need to complete this archaeological dig because posterity will not forgive us if we deal with it as we dealt with Wood Quay, and we are not going to do that. We want to see that the artefacts are uncovered, the layers fully explored and the whole operation done properly and that we have the best possible people on site.  We have now discovered that to complete the archaeology further digs must be undertaken, particularly in Olaf Street &mdash; that is a fine Viking name &mdash; and, indeed, in the Peter Street area of the city.  Buildings have been demolished and the dig will commence.  It is thought that it will take up to 16 weeks or, indeed, less if possible.  It is important to get this done in the timescale which I have indicated because if we delay the construction work then there could be very serious problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> A particular point which I want to make relates to the cost of all of this and further excavation of corporation sites, which will be about £70,000, making a grand total of £200,000.  To all of this must be added post-excavation work which is at present being estimated but could be up to another £40,000.  This involves cataloguing and describing all finds, cleaning and storing and preparing a detailed report on the digs.  It is entirely appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works should be here this afternoon, which is another reason which prompts me to raise this matter.  I do hope he will have an opportunity to reply to this debate and to indicate that he has taken very careful note of what I have said.</P>
    <P>The developer in this instance has been extremely generous with the corporation. As part of his planning permission, he has agreed to build a special basement in his development to house St. Peter's Church, which was uncovered in the excavations and which is, I understand, a national monument.  The developer has informed the corporation that this will cost him a minimum of £370,000, excluding fees.  Great credit is due to him.  That is extraordinay generosity and it will be a most pleasing feature of the complex when it is completed.  I am confident it will be unique.  If you add in that £370,000 which the developer is generously giving to preserve St. Peter's Church and the other sums I have mentioned, the grand total of the cost of archaeology on this site comes up to £600,000.  No State grants have been made available up to now, except the £10,000 mentioned.</P>
    <P>We are the first city to hit this particular problem.  It has not happened in Limerick, in Galway or in Cork.  If we regard our past as being important and significant, worthy of conservation and preservation, if we do not want official vandalism of this priceless remains, if we in Waterford are confronted with what is an embarrassment of riches, we should be able to look to central Government for help and assistance in all of this.  I hope the Minister is going to be able to say that he will find it possible to get the <Col N="575" /> money from somewhere &mdash; maybe the national lottery again, I do not know. That seems to be the great swag bag you dip into if the situation is sufficiently important and it is in this instance.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the case not only for Waterford but for the whole country because it is a part of what we were.  It tells us who we are and it is necessary that something should be done.  It is suggested that State grants to cover the cost of archaeology undertaken to date and yet to be undertaken, including post-excavation work, to a total of £240,000 should be made available.  Waterford Corporation have passed a resolution seeking £240,000 to assist in this area &mdash; and, of course, the developer will still give the £370,000 minimum which he has so generously agreed to provide.  Again, it is a large issue in a local matter, but it is peanuts in terms of the State's expenditure. Waterford should be able to look with confidence to the Minister and I am so very pleased that just the right Minister is here this afternoon when I am speaking on the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I could cover but many of them my colleagues will address themselves to and on many of them I have spoken before because we have, in the Seanad, debated the health cuts, the education cuts and the cuts in the Department of the Environment at great length, in particular specialised debates.  I do not see any great merit in opening up these areas which will be dealt with more than adequately by my colleagues. I am obviously pleased to have had the opportunity to address myself to the few areas that I covered.  I hope I did justice to the particular difficulties that I decided were worthy of airing and that the Minister has taken it all to heart.</P>
    <P>I realise that the budget which will be put to the Dáil on 27 January next is unlikely to be one that will make us all snuggle back in our armchairs and feel happy.  That is not today's fiscal climate. We all recognise that.  I really would like to see evidence of thought, of policy, of planning, of evaluation, of sensitivity, which has been so sadly lacking in the <Col N="576" /> cuts in so many areas to date.  I recognise it is not easy to effect cuts in health expenditure but it should be easy to have a planned health policy.  It should be easy to decide that we are not going to cut the frontline people who deliver health care, that we are going to spread this evenly.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary to have people panicking, as they are panicking today.  I understand the association concerned with spina bifida and hydrocephalus are demonstrating in a number of health board areas because they are fearful of the long term illness scheme and of what is going to happen under that.  It should not be necessary to disturb these people who already have a sufficient burden to carry.  People who objected to the refund of drugs scheme, and quite rightly so in my view, were subjected to 24 hours of acute distress when the Labour Party, presumably on a tip-off, or on inside information, or whatever, decided to launch the notion that this programme was under attack. I heard the most distressing interviews being given on radio by people who were riddled with anxiety, on top of their physical illness, at the prospect of an attack being made on this particular programme which was vital to their health and well-being and their mental and emotional sanity.  Please, can we have a situation where there are no more kites being flown, no more scares &mdash; no more than is necessary.  Quite obviously, it is necessary to do harsh things, but I think people would accept it better if there was evidence of co-ordination, planning, thought and evaluation.  On that, I will conclude my remarks on the Appropriation Act.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad Chamber and to congratulate him and the Minister for Finance on the tremendous work they have been doing over the last year in ensuring national recovery and bringing about sanity in the public finances.  I was slightly dismayed to read media speculation that the Minister for Finance may be considering <Col N="577" /> opting out of Irish politics.  I would sincerely hope that that is not the position and that he will continue to play a role in the great work in bringing about national recovery.</P>
      <P>On a few points that Senator Bulbulia made, she mentioned, as many Fine Gael Oireachtas Members have mentioned, U-turns and turnabouts by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not want to say too much about that, but what I would say is that maybe the Senators in the Fine Gael Party would consult <i>The Way Forward</i> brought out by the last Fianna Fáil Administration in 1982, which called clearly for the public finances to be brought under control and the budget deficit to be eliminated in a short period of time.  I would also draw the Senator's attention to another interview which the Taoiseach gave this time last year, in January, just when the general election was about to get off the ground.  I remember that time very well.  He gave an interview at that time suggesting the absolute necessity to curtail public expenditure. That was in the context of a general election. All Fianna Fáil Governments of recent years have been firmly committed to the task of bringing about fiscal rectitude and bringing about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been referring to both the previous Fianna Fáil Government and the present Fianna Fáil Government.  Getting back to the motion before us, last year was a very fascinating one.  It was a decisive year.  First of all, the Single European Act was endorsed by the people and in the process they showed that they were committed to an integrated Europe.  That more than anything else brought about a radical change in the attitudes of the people and it showed that they were prepared to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> In the economic field also there was a radical change in attitudes.  The Government set out in a decisive manner to bring about a change in attitudes and a change in the economy.  They challenged the existing attitudes and mentalities and they did so in a very decisive way. Although there were massive cuts in public expenditure there was a broad consensus that it was the right way to go about achieving national recovery.  It is fascinating to watch.  We are living in extremely interesting times.</P>
    <P>The media comments on what is happening are also interesting.  For example, one Sunday national newspaper, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, said this is the best Government Ireland has had since the minority Government of Seán Lemass 20 years ago.  That is certainly interesting coming from that newspaper.  What I am saying is that the Government have changed the economic climate radically, that they have turned around the economy decisively but, more than that, they have changed attitudes.  The attitude that you can get something for nothing has now been rooted out of the Irish mentality. When the history of 1987 comes to be written all of this will be seen in the context of the overall development of the economy.  This is a great time to be observing what is happening in the political field and Ireland is now setting about the task of economic recovery for the first time.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the idea of a mixed economy where both the State and private enterprise play a role.  A mixed economy is best suited to our needs but over the last decade or so we got the balance wrong.  What the Government have done &mdash; I do not know whether or not they would agree with this &mdash; is injected a quick sharp dose of free enterprise into the economy and that is very welcome.  We got the balance wrong and this quick sharp dose will bring us back to our senses and make us more efficient. A mixed economy will bring about the best economic results.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government have had a number of major achievements <Col N="579" /> over the past year.  First of all, I congratulate them on bringing out the Book of Estimates well in advance as this enabled people to debate them.  Bringing out the Book of Estimates well in advance was a very good precedent to set as it enables each sector to know exactly where they stand and to make adjustments. The major achievement of the last year was that confidence has been restored.  That is the one element that had been missing over the previous five years during which there was paralysis of Government.  Confidence has now been restored not just in the business sector but in all people.</P>
    <P>People accept that we are living in tough times and accept what the Government are doing in the hope that it is the right thing to do.  I am confident that what they are doing is the right thing to do. Our exports are rising rapidly and our interest rates have declined and that is very important.  Once interest rates come down economic activity can begin again. There is now stability in the national debt and the budget deficit is under control. There has been growth in the economy for the first time in a number of years and the economic predictors are forecasting a growth rate of either 1 or 2 per cent this year.  I hope that that increase will be achieved.  Inflation is at an extremely low rate for the first time in a number of years and that will lead to an improvement in our competitive position and boost economic activity.</P>
    <P>Now that the base for economic recovery has been laid growth and employment should be our major priorities.  We should now start looking towards the creation of employment.  I represent the north city of Dublin where the unemployment rate in some estates is between 50 and 60 per cent.  I hope the Government will look at a number of areas in this regard.  The IDA and our industrial policy must now be looked at in a critical way in order to see whether the measures the IDA are introducing are the ones to bring about an increase in employment.  All institutions must be examined in a radical way and <Col N="580" /> Bord Fáilte must be looked at very critically to see if they are serving our needs and creating employment and growth in the tourism industry.  As I have already said, the measures introduced by the Government over the past year have the support of the vast majority of the people and will continue to have it.</P>
    <P>Another major achievement of the past year was the signing of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed between the Government and the social partners.  That charts the way for the next three years and will be extremely successful if the commitments given are implemented.  It augurs well for the future of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with social welfare.  As I said at the outset, I represent the north city of Dublin in the Dublin City Council.  Unemployment in these areas is extremely high and social welfare is of great importance to many people.  I suggest that the Government have acted in a responsible manner in relation to social welfare.  I note that £1.61 billion is to be spent on the implementation of social welfare schemes and services and this is an increase of £12.7 million over the 1987 Estimate.  The Government have had to come to terms with that huge expenditure and in doing so they have protected those most in need.  Everybody accepts that rationalisation of the system was necessary. In particular there was a need to stamp out abuse.  Everyone I come in contact with in my daily political duties says that there is abuse in the social welfare system and that something has to be done about it.  The Government have set about doing something about it while at the same time maintaining the basic fabric of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Woods, for introducing measures to stamp out social welfare abuse.  I also congratulate him for maintaining the basic fabric of our social welfare system. For example, 30,000 of the long term unemployed were brought into the free fuel scheme.  In addition, dependent spouses of insured workers can now claim dental and optical benefits and this was <Col N="581" /> a major issue for the wives of insured workers.  The Christmas bonus was paid at the same rate as last year and I congratulate the Government for finding the £19.8 million to do so.  It was very much appreciated.  Finally, the Government paid the 1987 increases in July rather than in November which the previous Fine Gael Government had contemplated doing.  That demonstrates quite clearly that the Government are committed to protecting those in need and to maintaining the basic fabric of our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>There is a misunderstanding, to say the least, in relation to social welfare abuses. On one side of my electoral area in north Dublin which includes such estates as Artane, Darndale, Coolock and so on, there are people who &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; are middle class, have their mortgages and are working or in some houses there are two people working. On the other side of the constituency there are huge corporation estates with 60 per cent or 70 per cent unemployment, a great dependence on social welfare and the administration of social welfare schemes.  It would be fair to say that there is no understanding whatsoever by the people in middle class homes with their mortgages and jobs of the plight of the person who is on social welfare.</P>
    <P>There may be a general tendency to think that everybody who lives in a corporation estate is cheating the system and getting money they are not entitled to. That, of course, is not the position.  Only a small minority of people cheat the social welfare system, and a very small minority at that.  Unfortunately, that is not the perception.  I know from my daily contacts in those areas that many people believe social welfare fraud is rampant and that the people living in corporation estates are cheating the system but that is not the case.  We will have to educate people on the true position.</P>
    <P>There is dire poverty among certain families in Dublin.  We must work towards alleviating that severe poverty and bringing about an improvement in living standards.  It would be of benefit to all concerned if social welfare fraud was <Col N="582" /> stamped out.  It will only affect a small minority of people but everybody will agree with such action.  It will bring about a change in attitude and will be to everybody's advantage.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements could be introduced in the social welfare system. We need a more efficient system.  There is nothing worse for a person whose social welfare book has run out than having to wait for the arrival of a new social welfare book and having to call to the post office daily to check on it.  Those people may be left in severe financial difficulties for three or four days.  We must eliminate that delay and the books must be delivered on time.  We need a more efficient system.</P>
    <P>Appeals to the Department of Social Welfare should be decided on more speedily.  People who have been cut off social welfare must wait a number of weeks before a decision is made on their appeal.  We must improve on that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance to continue the alleviation payments introduced in relation to the social welfare equality directive.  It is hard to imagine that at one stage a Government contemplated reducing the income of a family on social welfare by up to £50. However, at the end of the day right prevailed and alleviation payments were introduced under that directive.  It is important that those alleviation payments continue in the context of overall social welfare increases.  They could be implemented over the next few years so that there would be no fall in the real income of people affected by this directive.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been made in relation to the Commission on Social Welfare and the Government should look at them in a calm fashion, decide on those that are practical and set about implementing them.  That is all I have to say in relation to social welfare. I should like to congratulate the Minister who is doing a great job.  I am sure that if he is given the time he will introduce <Col N="583" /> further reforms and ensure that the system is made more efficient.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say a few words about expenditure by the Department of the Environment.  We discussed this in the Seanad some months ago on a motion by the Labour Party.  It is important to see how the cuts in expenditure in the Department of the Environment have operated.  Everybody agrees that we need to get value for taxpayers' money.  There has been a decrease of only 11 per cent in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  Everybody agrees that waste must be eliminated, in relation to local authorities in particular, and that economies have to be effected.  There is also the problem in relation to duplication by local authorities.  We have local authorities implementing services side by side with similar services in adjoining counties.  That must be looked at in the context of trying to achieve efficiency in local government.  Duplication by local authorities should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have to play their role in trying to achieve a more efficient and more productive Ireland.  Dublin Corporation cut their budget this year by £6 million and I watched very carefully how that was implemented.  Certainly, I have seen no deterioration in the services provided by Dublin Corporation over the past few weeks.  There have been voluntary redundancies within the corporation; 300 people or so have left the corporation but that has not resulted in a major deterioration of services.  Management have set about redeploying staff, providing services in a more efficient way and that is to be welcomed. When local authorities have trimmed their budgets we should set about reforming the structure of local government. When local authorities are providing services in an efficient way we should examine reform of local government and make the system more efficient.  We are proceeding well along those lines.  The cuts in the rate support grant for local authorities were necessary and that move will <Col N="584" /> be to the advantage of all local authorities. In the next few years efficiencies will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Health, I should like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, on finally opening Beaumont Hospital in north Dublin.  It is a very welcome facility in the area.  It is an absolute disgrace that that hospital was lying idle for a number of years, at a cost to the taxpayer, I might add.  The people of north Dublin &mdash; Beaumont, Coolock, Artane and so on &mdash; are delighted that that hospital has been opened.  It was great to see the Minister opening that hospital, a much needed facility for north Dublin.  The Minister for Health has done an excellent job in his Department.  Health service expenditure in 1974 was £146 million, in 1986 it was £1,298 million &mdash; which represents 19 per cent of expenditure &mdash; and in 1987 it had increased to a massive £1,314 million, £16 million more than in 1986.  One can see from those figures that health expenditure had gone out of control.  I congratulate the Minister on rectifying that matter.  He has the broad support of the Irish people and, indeed, of many of those in the health services. When one talks privately to nurses and doctors they say that there was massive waste in hospitals and in the health services and everybody knows that is the position.  I congratulate the Minister on taking firm decisions which will be to the benefit of all people.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the interest of the Cathaoirleach, as was mentioned earlier, in the plight of disabled people.  I am delighted that the Minister for Health has made available £150,000 from the national lottery to the Irish Wheelchair Association.  They are very appreciative of that money and it will allow them to continue to provide the much needed services which they provide.  There is speculation in the media at present regarding the VAT and excise duty in relation to disabled people buying cars, that the administration of that scheme may be transferred from the Revenue Commissioners to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The bodies representing disabled people are not happy that that has been proposed.  The Minister will not give any indication of what may or may not be in the budget next week, but I appeal on behalf of disabled people that the administration of excise duty and VAT remission in relation to cars for disabled drivers should remain with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that that scheme remains in existence.  I hope the Minister will bring my remarks in that regard to the attention of the Minister concerned.</P>

      <P>Let me say one brief word about the Department of Labour. I would like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Ahern, on the amalgamation which he has brought about in relation to the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO. He has taken a very important decision. Unemployed people were very much disheartened when they had to go to these three institutions in order to try to obtain suitable employment.  The amalgamation of these three bodies into one institution called FÁS is a great development. Unemployed people in particular will be delighted with it.  Much unnecessary bureacuracy has been removed and I hope this new institution, FÁS, will deal seriously with the problems of unemployment and obtaining jobs for unemployed people.  I wish the new institution every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia made a very eloquent case on behalf of the National Art Gallery, women, Third World aid and archaeological developments in Waterford. I fully accept that these are all very genuine cases and interests.  However, in bringing about stability in the public finances the Government have to take into account the common good of all interests concerned.  They cannot just specialise in two, three or four different interests.  The Senator appreciates that and I know she is genuinely concerned about the four issues she mentioned, but the Government have a common duty not to favour any special interest group. <Col N="586" /> An ingredient of their success during the past year is that they have taken the greater good into account and have not been influneced by any single pressure group.</P>
    <P>With that I conclude, I hope the Government will continue on the course of action they have initiated.  If this <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is carried through, Ireland will be ready for the next century to play its role in the world as a fully developed economic nation.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, is cúis áthais dom bheith ar ais arís i Seanad Éireann don chéad uair san bhliain nua.  Guím athbhliain faoi shéan is faoi mhaise daoibh uilig agus táim ag súil go mbeidh bliain eile shásúil i leith eachtraí polaitíochta agus airgeadais ár dtíre againn go léir.</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann facilitated the passage of the 1987 Appropriation Bill immediately before the Christmas recess on the understanding that time would be made available as soon as possible after Christmas to enable Senators, particularly those who did not have an opportunity to participate in the restricted preChristmas debate, to discuss Government expenditure policies and the performance of the economy generally.  The purpose of the motion before us is to facilitate this discussion.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry is heavily engaged at present on the preparation of his financial statement to be presented in Dáil Éireann next week, he is unable to be here today. He has asked me to say, however, that he will be following closely the course of the debate today and tomorrow and will be most interested in hearing what Senators have to say in their various contributions. I am looking forward to these contributions also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister addressed the House before Christmas the end-year Exchequer returns have been published. They demonstrate clearly the effectiveness of the Government's management of the public finances in 1987. <Col N="587" /> The current budget deficit for the year was £1,180 million, or some £20 million below the very tight target set in the March budget and over £200 million below the previous year's outturn.  Overall Exchequer borrowing for capital and current expenditure combined was £1,786 million.  This is £72 million below the budget target and almost £360 million below the corresponding figure for 1986. What is especially remarkable about these figures is that they were achieved, to all intents and purposes, in the nine month period April-December 1987. Spending for the first quarter of 1987 followed the pattern set by our predecessors.</P>
    <P>Significant savings totalling a net £44 million emerged on non-capital supply services &mdash; the day-to-day costs of running the country.  These expenditure savings emerged over a wide range of services but the principal areas involved were Education £24 million, Agriculture and Food £8 million, Defence £7 million, Labour £5 million and Environment and Tourism and Transport £4 million each.</P>
    <P>The outturn on non-capital supply services is all the more satisfactory when account is taken of the fact that the Government financed the payment of a social welfare Christmas bonus costing almost £20 million last year and paid out £8.5 million under the public service voluntary redundancy package, neither of which had been provided for in the budget of 1987.</P>
    <P>There were savings of £42 million on Central Fund services, some £16 million of which was due to a saving on our contribution to the EC budget.  The balance of the saving was accounted for in the main by savings on foreign and domestic interest payments.</P>
    <P>Significant savings also emerged on capital expenditure.  The Exchequer-financed public capital programme was some £28 million below budget.  Savings were achieved right across the spectrum of expenditure.  Capital spending for the Finance group of services was down by £7 million mainly because of lower than expected expenditure by Fóir Teoranta. <Col N="588" /> On the Environment group, savings totalling £13 million on house improvement grants more than offset excesses on sanitary services and other housing grants.  There were also savings on industrial grants, commercial harbours and shipping investment grants.  Exchequer-funded non-programme outlays out-turned at almost £32 million less than the £75 million provided in the 1987 budget. The overall Exchequer savings on the expenditure side of the capital budget were, however, offset to some degree by a small shortfall in Exchequer capital resources.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side of the budget, the 1987 outturn was below expectations. Tax revenues, particularly indirect taxes, were below the budget targets reflecting weak consumer spending.  Even though buoyancy under other tax heads made up for part of the shortfall, overall tax revenue was some £76 million short of target.  Non-tax revenues on the other hand were slightly above target for the year after taking account of the £8.5 million received from the Central Bank under the arrangements for the financing of the public service voluntary redundancy package.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, the Government's successful management of the public finances during 1987 is cause for considerable satisfaction.  The results achieved are all the more impressive given the fact that the late introduction of the 1987 budget greatly narrowed the time-span for the achievement of the targets set.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with recent developments in the economy.  As the Minister for Finance said in this House last month, 1987 was a good year for the economy in many respects.  Most of the main economic indicators were positive throughout last year and this gives us great encouragement and hope for the future.  The growth rate for the year is now estimated to have been higher than in previous years and, indeed, higher than economic forecasters had anticipated at the start of the year.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this higher growth was the very strong growth in exports. <Col N="589" /> Export growth was most buoyant in the high-technology sector, especially electronics. However, other sectors also did well.  Food output, as the Minister mentioned when speaking in this House last month, was up by over 10 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared with the first nine months of 1986 and the traditional manufacturing industries, like textiles, clothing and wooden furniture, overall saw steady growth for the second successive year.  On the services side, tourism earnings were up substantially. Output and export growth was fairly broadly based last year and this is a very positive sign for our economy.</P>
    <P>Another important development last year was the further substantial improvement in the balance of payments.  This is an important economic barometer for a small economy like ours.  As the trade balance has improved over recent years, so too has the balance of payments.  The trade surplus virtually doubled last year, an all time record.  The balance of payments deficit also showed a substantial reduction.  While final figures are not yet available for 1987, a small balance of payments surplus is the likely outcome.  I note that many economic commentators share this view.</P>
    <P>Agriculture also did well last year. After two bad years, farm incomes recovered strongly.  There were a number of factors operating here &mdash; the favourable development of prices was the main one. Output prices were better than in 1986 while input prices fell.  At the same time, the volume of farm inputs also fell because of the better weather conditions. Overall, there was a substantial recovery in incomes &mdash; the Central Statistics Office estimate an increase of 13½ per cent compared with 1986.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware of the improvements in other areas.  Inflation was only 3¼ per cent last year, the lowest inflation figure in 20 years.  One of the most significant developments was the dramatic fall in interest rates from their exceptionally high levels when the Government took office in March 1987. Since then, key wholesale interest rates have fallen by up to 5½ percentage points <Col N="590" /> and the prime overdraft rate of the associated banks has fallen by up to 5 percentage points to its lowest level for ten years.  These reductions in interest rates reflect the progress already made in reducing Exchequer borrowing; the continuing improvement in the current account of the balance of payments; the low inflation rate to which I have just referred; the significant increase in the level of the official external reserves together with the inflow of funds into Ireland; and the level of interest rates internationally.</P>
    <P>The reduction in interest rates achieved is a clear endorsement by the financial sector of the Government's prudent handling of the public finances.  We have taken tough but necessary decisions to prune public expenditure and reduce Exchequer borrowing.  Furthermore, we have secured the co-operation of the social partners in a strategy to further reduce the annual borrowing requirement which will help create the climate for even lower interest rates in the future. Lower interest rates will encourage investment and growth and help to generate much needed employment.  It is hoped that wealth creators in the private sector will respond to the new atmosphere of confidence generated and take full advantage of the improved climate for profitable investment.</P>
    <P>Despite the overall positive outturn last year, developments in some areas were disappointing.  The building industry remained weak and personal consumption was virtually unchanged compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>Average registered unemployment in 1987 was 10,900 above the 1986 level and its reduction remains a central objective of Government policy.  While acknowledging that the average number unemployed rose again last year we can take heart from the fact that in the 12 months to end-April last, the live register rose by 18,400 but in the 12 months to end-December 1987 there was actually a small fall of 100.  This was the first such fall for December this decade.</P>
    <P>The Government remain absolutely committed to tackling the deep-seated <Col N="591" /> problems of the public finances and to creating the conditions for a return to sustainable growth in the near future. The difficulties which confront us are of such magnitude that we must look to sustained action over a period of years to deal effectively with them.  It is unrealistic to expect that corrective action in one budget or, indeed, one year will suffice.</P>
    <P>Our objective for 1988 is to build on the progress achieved last year.  Impartial commentators who have studied our situation support the broad thrust of the Government's expenditure strategy for 1988 as set out in the abridged estimates volume and summary public capital programme and which were discussed in this House last November.  The OECD also endorsed the main lines of Government policy in their recent survey of the Irish economy.  We are, in fact, building on the consensus which emerged in the NESC Report, &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo; and which was carried a stage further in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed with the social partners late last year.  The Government's policies are clearly recog-nised as being the right ones and they are already contributing to a major improvement in our economic prospects.</P>
    <P>Despite the effect of the expenditure reductions on certain elements of domestic demand, gross domestic product is likely to show some further &mdash; albeit modest &mdash; growth next year.  Much will depend on the domestic response to lower interest rates and improved confidence. On the external side, while there are of course major uncertainties regarding the pace of growth in our trading partners next year, I am confident that, given a reasonable international environment, we can achieve a further substantial expansion in the volume of exports again this year.  Inflation is likely to remain moderate at under 3 per cent and there are good prospects that the balance of payments will move further into surplus.  Competitiveness should improve further reflecting the modest level of wage increases provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Next year unemployment is expected to rise again but somewhat more slowly than in 1987.  The Jobsearch programme will continue to help the unemployed and FÁS &mdash; the new manpower authority &mdash; will continue the work of providing the unemployed with job experience and training to enable them to acquire the skills demanded in the labour market. The Government's fiscal and monetary policies, together with the development measures set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, will together provide the soundest possible basis for achieving and sustaining the considerable potential for umployment growth which exists in this country.</P>
    <P>The scale of the budgetary adjustment envisaged for 1988 inevitably means, however, that it will be a difficult year. Nevertheless, the potential of the economy to respond positively and quickly to lower interest rates and improved confidence should not be underestimated. Government policies have already created the conditions in which the economy can take maximum advantage of the real, if modest, growth expected in the international economy next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that I will be finished by 5 p.m.  I do not want to talk, although it is traditional, about much of the details of what is in the Appropriation Act but, it needs to be said, and said unequivocally, as Harold Macmillan said close to his final years, that whenever he had found the Establishment was unanimous about anything it was almost invariably wrong.  We are now in that classic position: we have an <Col N="593" /> Establishment of the Government, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats who, notwithstanding the shadow boxing, are unanimous about the economic strategy for this country.  They have the good fortune, which I suspect Harold Macmillan or the British Establishment did not have, of having the virtual unanimous support of the media as well.</P>
      <P>One can understand the unanimous support of the private sector media because after all they are products of the same philosophy based on the same ideology as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, but one cannot understand the extraordinary commitment of the national broadcasting service to a particular political and economic ideology, the consistent espousal of a particular economic view and the deliberate choice of Right-wing economists to produce what are ostensibly independent views on our economic situation. I can absolutely assert that whatever independent economist appears on the budget programme next week by our broadcasting organisation he will agree with the Government's economic strategy. There are many independent, equally well qualified economists who will not so agree but they do not count and they do not rate.  If Radio Telefís Éireann want a list of independent economists who do not agree with the present strategy I will give it to them, but they obviously do not want such a list.  They know as well as I do where these people live.</P>
      <P>The country deserves and needs a fundamental dialogue on what is going on at present.  A number of things need to be said.  First the present strategy will result in a position where in the forthcoming year &mdash; and this is built on this year's expenditure &mdash; the single greatest contribution will be interest repayments on debt.  If we did not have those interest repayments on debt we could reduce income tax by 60 per cent and pay for all our public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying assumption which lies behind the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat view of the economy, which is that we have awarded ourselves a standard of living and a quality <Col N="594" /> of public services beyond what we can afford, is wrong because the standard of all those services is not out of line with our development.  Many countries developed more comprehensive services than we did at a time when they were less developed. The United Kingdom initiated a comprehensive national health service and a comprehensive welfare service immediately after the war.  At that stage the United Kingdom, in terms of economic development, was well behind our present position.  Their standard of living was considerably less than ours.  It is ridiculous to suggest that somehow we are now being penalised for a splurge on our own behalf to give ourselves services we could not afford.  That is simply not true. The cost of services, of health, welfare, education, security, housing, industrial development, etc. is not a particulalry heavy or onerous burden.  The problem is the scale of debt repayment that has to be topped up on that.  Consequently, when people tell us that we must cut back public expenditure, to say the least, they are being less than honest because they are, first of all, saying that close to 40 per cent of public expenditure, that is the area of debt repayment, is absolutely untouchable. That is not to be examined, scrutinised, questioned or challenged.  That is an absolute which must not be touched.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the close to £700 million which is spent on security.  The same independent, unbiased, unpolitical economists will ignore that area of expenditure. They have consistently done so, as have the present political structure. Suddenly we discover that close to 50 per cent of public expenditure is actually sacrosanct in the minds of this consensus Establishment which has persuaded the Irish people that they must do penance for their sins.  The one thing that needs to be said is that whatever the Irish people have got out of the last ten years of mismanagement, it is not an excessively high standard of living, it is not an excessively developed education system, it is not an excessively developed health service and it most definitely is not an excessively developed welfare system.  What they have got is mismanagement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> One of the intriguing aspects of this mismanagement is the way those on the Right, in other words, those who sit in front of me with the exception of the Labour Party and the entirety of the people who sit over here, with the exception of my honourable friends on Independent benches &mdash; the overwhelmingly 85 per cent Right-wing majority that now rules our country &mdash; pick certain items as the items on which we spend too much. They will tell us, for instance, that we took on too much in the area of welfare and that half the welfare bill represents the excess of expenditure over income, or they will tell us that the education bill represents the excess of expenditure over income.  They will never tell the people that it is the £2.4 billion in interest that represents the excess of expenditure over income.  They pick the soft target and blame that soft target for the country's budgetary problems.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are now paying 5 per cent real interest on the national debt when ten years ago we were probably paying an interest rate which was less than the rate of inflation is never adverted to.  If interest rates had remained as they were in the seventies, at rates which were less than the rate of inflation, this country would not have a problem because interest would not have run way ahead of national income.  That is not a problem of gross mismanagement, it is at the very worst, a problem of misfortune and at the very best something that we should confront.  The fact that close to £0.5 billion has been paid in 1987 to the Irish commercial banks to repay lending given by them to the Irish State needs to be adverted to.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that this lending is absolutely secure; it is absolutely guaranteed repayment.  A serious question should be raised as to whether those sort of absolutely secure lendings justify or need real interest rates of the order of 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  I do not believe that anybody investing in an external enterprise could actually look for a return on investment in the medium term or in <Col N="596" /> the longer term which would be guaranteed to be 6 per cent in excess of inflation. That would be regarded as an extraordinarily good performance for that sort of investment.  I am not talking about the sort of investment that is made by multinationals who talk about a 26 per cent or 27 per cent rate of return.  They are far more a reflection on our national generosity in tax breaks than they are in any way a reflection of their real peformance. The truth is that it is safer, more lucrative and more profitable for the Irish financial institutions to loan money to the State than it is to loan money to genuine enterprise, particularly the only kind of enterprise that is worthwhile, enterprise in manufacturing industry, in the production of goods or enterprise which involves internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>Let us forget about all the small petty entrepreneurs who are involved in the provision of services which simply consume the wealth created by other people, or in some cases simply suck imports or imported services into the country.  The only real form of enterprise is the enterprise which creates wealth and the enterprise which draws wealth into the economy, that is, internationally traded services and manufacturing industry.  We have failed singularly and completely to identify those two areas.  We have paraded entrepreneurs, some of whom can have two pages of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> devoted to their alleged virtues but whose contribution to this economy has been negative.  Because they have made money they are called entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>The real entrepreneurs, of course, make money and I have no great objection to people who take risks and work hard and produce wealth and sharing in that wealth. But I have an objection to the term &ldquo;entrepreneur&rdquo; being extended to those who, by opportunistic manipulation of the financial markets, by opportunistic investment in something like speculative land deals, make an awful lot of money and because they make a lot of money they are somehow classified as entrepreneurs.  Equally, I have no time for our financial institutions which regard <Col N="597" /> that sort of investment as somehow acceptable and are far more prepared to invest in the person than they are in the idea.  All that needs to be said in order to deal with the philosophy which lies behind the strategy of the frightening consensus that exists in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>No later than 6.15 p.m. It is with a degree of sadness that I rise to speak on this issue.  I am delighted the Minister was able to take time off to come in on this debate which I consider to be a matter of grave urgency and interest to the Irish people as a whole.  For many years now we have listened to people proclaim how safe the nuclear energy industry is, but equally we have listened to people who claim that it is one of the most unsafe industries in the world. Around this industry there are a lot of myths and a lot of truths involved.  Unfortunately it is very hard to get at the truths of the nuclear industry because it is an industry which is not readily understood by the ordinary person in the street.  It is an industry which has a lot of experts who control it and who claim they are the only <Col N="598" /> people who can speak on behalf of the industry.  Because it is an industry of experts it is essential that at all times those of us who have to live in this world today should learn as much as we can about what goes on in the industry and try to protect ourselves from the excesses of the so-called experts.  Equally it is incumbent on us to ensure that anything that we do or that the experts do, or the so-called experts, does not effect the living standards or indeed life of the coming generations.</P>
      <P>Too many times in the past have we read of near misses, of minor incidents and minor accidents in the nuclear industry, some of which have been well tabulated and which the world press has taken up.  Unfortunately we do not know how many near misses there have been and how many accidents there have been in nuclear stations around the world. Indeed it is one of the most protected industries in the world.  I have noticed over the past number of years &mdash; particularly in the past two years &mdash; that the Central Electricity Generating Board in England and the nuclear energy industry in England have mounted what must be the most prolonged, the most expensive and most professional public relations job on behalf of that industry.</P>
      <P>The current problem we have in Ireland is that an out-of-date electricity generating station, built in the fifties in Wales will be going out of service within the next few years and it is intended at this stage to do the experiment of closing down the plant on a temporary basis to see if there be any repercussions from this.  It is a horrific thought that they are closing it down to see if there be any repercussions.  Unfortunately there are generations of people in Ireland who might be the sufferers.  We cannot allow this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has taken as many steps as are possible at every level to ensure that these tests do not go ahead.  I am delighted that he has been in touch with Clinton Davis, the EC Commissioner who is involved in the nuclear industry, and has appealed to him to ensure that the tests do not go ahead. <Col N="599" /> He has also been in touch with the Minister for Energy, in England, Cecil Parkinson and has conveyed the message to him that the Government and people of Ireland are totally at one in their demands that these tests do not go ahead.  It is interesting that the type of operation intended to take place on the 12th of next month is the same as the experiment that took place in Windscale &mdash; as it was then called, it is now called Sellafield &mdash; in 1957 which was the cause of a major fire and which arguably has caused many health problems for generations of Irish people.  I have no doubt that if this particular experiment does take place the same type of problems could arise.  We have had enough from the nuclear energy industry in Great Britain and it is time to cry stop.</P>
    <P>Not alone are the Irish people interested in and objecting to the procedure which it is intended to take place but the county council in the area in which the nuclear station is based have told the Government in Britain that this test should not take place.  There is not an environmental group throughout Europe that has not asked to have this experiment stopped.  Indeed, were it not for the workers at the plant I do not think we would have been informed that this experiment was going to take place.  We are informed that experiments of this nature have taken place in the past. Because of a leaked document from the staff of Trawsfynydd we know what is going to happen.  The workers in the plant have stated quite categorically that, because of cutbacks in staffing levels, the safety levels at the plant are no longer what they should be.  There have been cutbacks in overtime and reductions in the number of people working there.  It has been stated that there have been cuts and reductions in asbestos supplies and that tanks are not being emptied as they should be.  The Magnox reactor now operating in this plant is out-of-date and therefore, the plant is out-of-date.  There was not anybody in this country, apart from Mr. Turvey himself, who was not disturbed yesterday morning when they <Col N="600" /> read that Mr. Frank Turvey of the Nuclear Energy Board had suggested that this experiment was safe.  I was horrified that he should go against the wishes of the Irish people and the indications on safety levels.  I am delighted the staff of the Nuclear Energy Board have come out and stated that this view was not correct and, that as stated in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i>, its enunciation came close to a national sell-out.</P>
    <P>The situation was highlighted again in <i>The Irish Times</i> by the Science Correspondent when he said that Britain makes both electricity and a lot of money from the nuclear energy industry and that at best they will disregard any protest we make because of the fact that they make both electricity and money, and money is at the root of this problem.  In Britain they do care about what we say.  They will go ahead unless we can get the backing not alone of the people of Ireland but of an increased number of people in Great Britain.  I am delighted the Minister has taken it up where it really counts, and that is at EC level.  I am glad that this is an all-party motion.  I sincerely hope that what is said by the Members of the Seanad and by the Minister will be taken into account by the Thatcher Government and that Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis in the EC will be able to persuade the British Government that this is an unwarranted experiment from a safety point of view and that it should be banned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House this evening. Indeed, we are lucky to have Seanad Éireann in which to discuss this important subject.  I am sure that everybody who will speak after me will agree that this experiment should not take place on 12 February as common sense dictates that the experiment is too dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are aware of the problem but they do not know enough about it. There is much talk in the media about the nuclear industry but many people in this country are not fully aware of what would happen if this experiment went wrong.  For many years when people discussed the nuclear industry and preached <Col N="601" /> what could happen if things went wrong, the standard reply was that things would not go wrong, that it was a false alarm to discuss some of the problems that could occur.  Unfortunately we had the Chernobyl accident and overnight that showed us what would happen if things went wrong.  Because of that, we can speak with a more knowledgeable voice now, and our concerns must be noted more seriously.  Irish Governments during the past number of years have made strenuous efforts to ensure that the British nuclear industry tidy up their act but, unfortunately, we have not been listened to.  There is an ongoing difficulty at Sellafield. Week in and week out difficulties at that plant are mentioned and we have statements from politicians calling on the British Government to close it or at least to raise the safety levels there, but nothing seems to be happening. However, Sellafield is a problem that we can at least discuss for the next few months, but in relation to the Trawsfynydd plant the emergency is almost upon us.  Beginning on 12 February, there is proposed an eight hour experiment.  Those eight hours could be a most dangerous time for our people and indeed for the people of Britain living in close proximity to that plant.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a plant that is only 100 miles from Dublin.  If it was a plant in Donegal or in west Cork there would be a huge outcry about this.  Yet this plant is just as near as these places to our capital city and, accordingly, we must express concern about it.  The plant is 23 years old.  When it was built originally it had a life expectancy of 20 years. It is obviously now in a state of repair which is far from perfect.  It is strange that none of these experiments took place during the ordinary life expectancy of that plant.  It is unreasonable for any Government to talk about experimenting on that plant at this stage.  There have been calls during the past few days, not only for these experiments to be stopped but for the plant to be closed down.  These calls make common sense.  Every nuclear plant has only a certain period during which it can be considered to work safely <Col N="602" /> and as far as the Trawsfynydd plant is concerned that period has now expired. It is living on borrowed time and the people of this country have a right to expect that they should not be the victims of any experiment to see how this plant is now operating.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the disappointment felt by all of us at the statement of a senior member of the Nuclear Energy Board that the experiment should take place.  That statement was quickly corrected by many people in the Nuclear Energy Board, and I am glad to see that the Minister took that man to task pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>It must be made quite clear to the British Government that nobody in this country accepts what the Central Electricity Generating Board in Britain are about to do.  Protest must be taken to the highest possible level.  We must continue with our efforts.  The cry from us here this evening, and indeed from the Government, must be to have this experiment halted immediately.  We are not just experimenting with some minor power station, where if something goes wrong it can be cured overnight.  We are talking about something which, if it went wrong, the disaster would be with us for years to come.  We are talking about wiping out men, women and children overnight and about ruining a whole agricultural area for years to come.  That might have sounded exaggerated last year but now after the Chernobyl disaster we know the effect when things go wrong and we must ensure that things do not go wrong.  As far as the Trawsfynydd plant is concerned, we must insist that the experiment does not take place.  I am sure the Minister will do his utmost in that respect, and I am sure he will have the support of every Member of this House and indeed every sensible person in this country.</P>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to that.  I know everybody else will talk along much the same lines.  I would like to say to the Minister that he has the full support of our party in his present endeavours.</P>

      <P>It was reported fairly recently that there was a very serious mishap at Trawsfynydd on 21 February 1986, that was two months before Chernobyl.  According to the report, a pressure valve on the cooling system on one of the atomic reactors shot open.  It seems that about 12 tonnes of radioactive carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere before a worker managed to shut the valve manually. That worker ended up in hospital suffering from radiation effects.  If on that occasion the man in question had failed to close off the valve, the plant would have gone out of control, which is what happened at Chernobyl, and this was very close to being a major disaster.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the authorities did not raise the alarm until noon although the accident had happened at 8 o'clock in the morning, their way, no doubt, of preventing panic among the workers and their families.  This is also what happened at Chernobyl.  This example gives some indication of how unsafe this Welsh nuclear station is and the threat it poses for us here in Ireland.  I have been informed that that station is not earth-quake-proof and earth tremors have not been unknown in Wales in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the stand that he has taken and I can assure him that both he and the Government have the support of most, if not all, of the people of this country in the stand <Col N="604" /> that has been taken in relation to Britain's nuclear energy policy.  May I remind the Minister that some scientists have expressed a view that the nuclear submarines operating around our coasts pose an even greater threat to the safety of our country and I ask the Minister to try to do something to ensure that these vessels are prevented from hunting in our ocean waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably fair to say that the reaction to this proposal of the CEGB in Wales is an underreaction, if anything.  Clearly, I can see that people do not realise the difficulty that we are getting into on this issue and I would certainly like to compliment the Leader of the House on raising this matter and the Minister for taking such a clear, strong and committed stand on this issue. Indeed, we have often argued on various issues but it is great to see unanimity and a certain sense of purpose on this issue. Because of that, I raise immediately the only aspect of the Minister's involvement which worries me slightly and which I would ask him to clear up, that is the statement of yesterday morning which has been referred to twice already, by the deputy senior executive of the Nuclear Energy Board that &ldquo;We cannot bend the truth for political purposes&rdquo;.  Certainly, there is a clear implication there that the Minister was in some way trying to interfere with the work of the Nuclear Energy Board, which I am sure is incorrect. However, I want the Minister to take the opportunity of adverting to that matter and making it absolutely clear that these are an independent group &mdash; not very well guided it would appear but, nevertheless, independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, we are now looking at science gone mad, science gone out of control.  We have a situation where a group 100 miles away from us, as has already been said, intend carrying out an experiment to find out what would happen if there were an accident.  Just because an accident has not happened, they are going to create that accident.  It is a total nonsense, totally illogical and the danger to which they are exposing us <Col N="605" /> and their own people is totally and utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Government's commitment on this issue, but they should be clearly seen, at whatever international cost, to speak out as a Government.  We should make it clear, as a State, that this is unacceptable, that it is an unfriendly act, that it is something that will damage relations between our two countries and that endangers and threatens the atmosphere of the environment and the people of both countries.</P>
    <P>In my election address during the Seanad elections, there was a major point that this country should declare itself a nuclear-free zone.  The Government would not disagree with this at the moment, but there is not much point in our declaring ourselves a nuclear-free zone if people who are completely out of our area of control and influence jeopardise that state.  What we are seeing is a clear effort to invite disaster.  It is the old scientific effort to stumble on a solution, to try to create some form of serendipity. It is very clear that this sort of &ldquo;It will be all right on the night&rdquo; attitude is the only guideline that is being used in the decision to set up this experiment.  It should be clearly stated and understood and tabulated once and for all that this reactor has a 20-year life span when it was set up.  It is now 23 years old and it is proposed to extend that life further. We have been in danger from it for the last three years beyond its life expectancy and every year and every day that it goes beyond that brings further danger.</P>
    <P>As Senator de Buitléar has outlined, the accident in February 1986 could have been much worse and only by chance did they stop a more major accident taking place.  People should understand what exactly is the risk here.  The scientists are saying that they are conducting this experiment to see what happens.  They have not done it before, therefore they do not know what is going to happen.  At the same time, another body of scientists, many of them in our own country, are telling us that nothing will happen.  On the one hand, they are saying that they want to conduct this experiment to see <Col N="606" /> what will happen and on the other hand, telling us that nothing will happen.  They should be perfectly able to conduct this experiment under laboratory conditions using computerisation, without having to go to the actuality of the event.  The scientific knowledge is there to do that right now.  What they are doing is unacceptable and it is misguided.</P>
    <P>It should also be made clear to our people here what exactly will happen if the experiment goes wrong.  Where exactly will we be?  There are really only two options: one option is that the thing goes right and we hear no more about it; the other option is that something goes wrong.  If something goes wrong, it can go wrong in two ways.  The equipment can either blow up or melt down and to us living 100 miles away it does not make much difference which of those two it is going to be.  We are going to suffer, our people are going to suffer and our State is going to suffer.  We have a duty to the people we represent and to people in the wider global sense not to allow this experiment to go ahead.</P>
    <P>We are talking about risking a disaster similar to Chernobyl.  That is what is on the cards.  Therefore, our responsibilities are very definite and very clear.  There have been many accidents and near accidents in this nuclear station up until now &mdash; August 1987 and February 1986, to mention but two.  Last year one of the workers in the factory, a health physics monitor, actually quit his job in that station because he said that the work practices were slipshod and the monitoring was only superficial and he called for the plant to be closed.  Coming from a worker who was monitoring the safety of the plant, that kind of warning cannot be ignored.  I would also question why, if this experiment is so safe and is not going to cause us a difficulty, why our Government were not officially informed.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Burke, did visit and talk to his counterpart within the last six months, and Mr. Parkinson at that stage, I am sure, gave him particular undertakings.  There was a breach of trust on Mr. Parkinson's part at that time that <Col N="607" /> he did not indicate what was going to be carried out.</P>
    <P>It seems that we were not officially informed because they were afraid that they could not give a proper explanation and the reason &mdash; this is important &mdash; that this information has been made public is that it has been leaked by people working in the nuclear station who were afraid themselves of the reaction and wanted the world and the public at large to know the risk that was being taken on in this proposed experiment.  We have been given a clear warning, a clear indication and we have a duty to respond to it.  We must say without hesitation, with total unanimity, that this is unacceptable, that we will not put up with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I want to make.  First, I call for the closure of all old technology plants across the Irish sea, of which Trawsfynydd is one.  Secondly, I make a plea for planning permission at international level when it is proposed that any nuclear installations be expanded.  In relation to Trawsfynydd, the question is: why has this station not been closed down?  It had a 20 year life. It has old technology.  It is unreliable, unsafe and accident prone.  It has outlived its usefulness and its expected life span. These old technology plants are no longer reliable.  They are more accident prone and they should be shut down.</P>
      <P>I now want to turn to Sellafield which is the cause of particular anxiety in this country.  The Magnox reactors at Sellafield which are 20 to 25 years old should be shut down.  These reactors at Sellafield are very near our shores and are outdated. They are more accident prone but they are kept in operation to extract the last pound of profit from them.  Speaking of Sellafield, apart from the anxiety caused by the old technology reactors, I understand that there is in place the provocative proposal that a major expansion he undertaken there.  Reports suggest that billions of pounds in reprocessing orders are already in place. These orders will be filled when the new plant comes on stream at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> I have a further question in relation to our own position.  Why should the onus be put on other countries, particularly Ireland, to justify the environmental effects of nuclear power stations in Britain?  Surely the onus for that, justification should rest squarely on the shoulders of the British Government?</P>
    <P>With regard to my point about planning permission I urge that the proposed expansion at Sellafield should be the subject of planning permission at international level.  Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, with which the Minister is obviously familiar, goes some way towards meeting planning requirements but it just does not have enough teeth to ensure that proper controls are enforced. Clearly, the provisions of article 37 of the Euratom Treaty should be strengthened so that we, in common with other members of the Community, can be protected.</P>
    <P>Again, in the context of the EC I am very glad to have this opportunity to compliment the Minister, Deputy Burke, for the excellent work he has been doing at that level in pressing for the implementation of Article 34 of the Euratom Treaty.  This article is concerned with the control of various types of nuclear experiments. Like the Minister, the European Commission is now beginning to act and is pressing individual countries for the implementation of this Article concerned with nuclear experimentation.  We can name the countries.  France and Britain in particular are very slow to comply with the requirements.  Hopefully, through the type of pressure that the Minister is exercising with other countries the Commission will push forward and bring offending countries into line with European policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to technology &mdash; I am not an engineer &mdash; no technology is perfect. The consequences of accidents in nuclear technology can be horrific.  That is an important distinction between one type of technology and another.  Chernobyl or indeed Windscale, in the case of the fire in 1957, which is much nearer home illustrate the horrific consequences of accidents at nuclear technology stations. <Col N="609" /> Senator Lanigan referred to the nuclear lobby.  It is wealthy and they are particularly skilled in public relations.  The British Government are obviously making money from Sellafield and other power stations.  That is the bottom line.  Electricity generation is clearly important but also money dominates as a consideration in relation to the power stations.  I suggest that money is at the root of the responses and reaction which our Minister is getting from the British authorities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to encourage the Minister to press that much harder at European level.  Collective action at European level offers the best propsect for control of the acquisitive interests of individual members of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the opportunity to make a statement about what has been proposed by the British authorities in regard to Trawsfynydd and indeed to compliment the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach for identifying the protests and the hostility that have built up in this nation of ours following the decision of the technological experts at Trawsfynydd to carry out what they term an experiment.  This type of experiment is not alone unacceptable but is, as our party leader Deputy Spring has said, a hostile act.  He has been accused by the British media of overstating the situation, but what the British authorities intend to do at Trawsfynydd could not be termed otherwise than as a hostile act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout Europe but especially here in Ireland there has been a new awakening in relation to our environment and whatever complacency there may have been about the dangers of nuclear power and its long term threat to the health and safety of all the people we represent has been truly swept away in the aftermath of Chernobyl.  That concern has been particularly evident here in Ireland due to our closeness to many of these power stations and those on the Welsh coast in particular.  Anyone who feels that we should have no input into this matter because we are a different <Col N="610" /> sovereign state is not living within the ideals of the European Community we all aspire to.  Surely, the Single European Act puts a responsibility on Britain to ensure that where tests of this nature are carried out that they be carried out in accordance with European standards?</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that Deputy Spring in the past was instrumental in seeking to set-up a forum within the European Community.  He had discussions with the previous Minister in Britain dealing with this area on the setting up of a responsible authority that would co-operate with independent inspectorates and which would operate within European standards in the area of nuclear power.  If that kind of fail-safe system was in operation we would all accept that at least somebody with an independent view on this whole matter would be involved.  There is widespread concern and alarm in regard to nuclear power amongst those who live on this island mainly due to the bungling, the incompetence and the dishonesty of those who manage nuclear power.  It is impossible to believe any of the information that one gets from the authorities involved in the operation of these plants and it was only by seeking and asking for further information that some of the facts and figures were disclosed.  It took another country to discover that there was a problem at Chernobyl.  It took other countries to discover that what they were doing at Sellafield was unacceptable.  The proposals for Sellafield and Trawsfynydd and for the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea were never disclosed to us.  It was as if we did not live in the same Community.</P>
    <P>Britain should stop treating us as a neighbour on whom they can dump their refuse.  The Minister will have the support of every Senator in this House and indeed all Members of the Oireachtas in whatever campaign he wishes to launch and continue at European level to ensure that the British authorities treat us as a friendly nation and not subject us to what Deputy Spring has referred to as a hostile act.  The Minister will have the full support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Col N="611" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing that could unite the people of Ireland it is their abhorrence of what nuclearism stands for.  Having said that I have first to ask, how is it that we have an Irish Nuclear Energy Board?  Is there, in fact, some sort of contradiction here?  Is this a hangover of the proposals there once were to have nuclear energy in Ireland? I make as my first proposal that the Minister should seriously consider whether the time has not come to create an alternative, the Irish alternative energy board.  Obviously, we have got to take into account the ecology of Ireland in the context of global ecology and the principles that surround it.  If we are going to do that, and if we have not in our present method of using our energy, or the energy availability of the country, a way that is not destructive, then we will be forced ultimately to do what other people have done, rely on nuclear energy.  Long before the emergency faces us we should be directing our energies as a people into alternative energy.  We should take away the resources being put into the Irish Nuclear Energy Board and place them firmly in an Irish alternative energy board.</P>
      <P>I am sure Mr. Turvey expressed the truth as he saw it but is it not high time when we are dealing with so much power that Mr. Turvey, and people like him, be much more amenable to accountability? Science can be constructive, science can be destructive, but it is because it has now got such tremendous potential that scientists can no longer be allowed to be totally free in a society which has as part of it so many other people who may or may not be scientists, many of whom are not.  The ordinary people want to say, &ldquo;we want a right to determine or shape the direction in which science is going to take us&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is said that Mr. Turvey is correct then, I would say, what about English public relations?  Is it not the height of arrogance for another country, knowing the fears that are being generated throughout the world, and Europe in particular, as a result of what happened at Chernobyl, to inflict with such short <Col N="612" /> notice this experiment, the result of which will be felt most acutely in Wales and the spin-off of which is bound to be felt in Ireland?  Let us say the experiment is successful, then surely again that emphasises that the fear generated by what has been suggested only proves the arrogance of the people responsible for the experiment in the first place.  This comes back to Senator Hillery's point, there is now an interdependence of nations.  Sovereignty can no longer be absolute in a nuclear age or in a high tech age.  If there is an interdependence of nations and we have the power to blow mankind to oblivion, there is certainly a demand at the very least that there should be an international agency which gives out planning permission and provides the checks and balances that are required to have the necessary safeguards for plants such as the one at Trawsfynydd.</P>
    <P>Mankind in general is going to be faced with this dilemma.  If we pursue nuclearism, then almost certainly we are on the line of apocalypse.  The alternative to that is some transformation in the human species, some new way of looking at life; if you like, a pro-life philosophy.  It is because I feel so intensely that the people of Ireland should be trying to give to the world a pro-life positive neutral way of conducting our affairs, that I reject out of hand the direction that takes us down the nuclear way.  Nuclearism should only be the last resource of mankind.  If we are prepared to conserve and share the resources we have, I am quite convinced that with a new politic and a new awareness we should have sufficient energy in the world from the alternative sources that are available to us to equip mankind with all essential needs without resource to nuclearism.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in his dealings with Mr. Cecil Parkinson.  Whether one lives in County Down or County Wexford it matters not because if there is a mistake made at any of these plants, if there is a Chernobyl effect, it will not matter.  It is high time the English authorities were reminded of their international responsibilities in such a sensitive area as this.  If they ever again want to go in for some <Col N="613" /> such experiment they should spend months of time preparing the way, explaining the implications, so that at least we will be able to evaluate for ourselves in as objective a fashion as possible what is involved.  Having said that I, for one, cannot see that nuclear energy as a source of global energy will ever be safe for mankind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robb has outlined the civilisation we would have if we were free of nuclear power.  We all would like to see that but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  An experiment is scheduled to be carried out at Trawsfynydd on 12 February and no one is 100 per cent certain what effect it will have on the people of Wales or the people of our country.  We also have the serious problem of Sellafield, as Senator Hillery mentioned.  I visited that station on 10 October last to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the terrible fire there in 1957.  In that small area I counted at least 14 cranes carrying out the extension programme for keeping nuclear waste on the site.</P>
      <P>There was a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week by their Science Correspondent.  I agree with the view expressed in that article that British Nuclear Fuels are making millions of pounds out of Sellafield, a reprocessing plant that deals with nuclear waste from all over the world.  The Cumbrian people are being well paid as a result of this investment.  It was very obvious from the attendance at the demonstration on 10 October last &mdash; for me it was very frightening because about 250 people turned up and I expected thousands would turn up &mdash; that the Cumbrian people, and the people of Great Britain, want to know nothing about the dangers of the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem for us as a nation is that first we must get the European Commission to help us get independent inspectors on the site and have international planning regulations for nuclear power stations.  That is one way.  The only other way is to educate by some means or other the British people about the danger that exists to themselves from this <Col N="614" /> nuclear problem on their shores.  On the occasion of my visit there there was only one public representative, a local councillor, and he did not want to give his name.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous difficulty as far as we are concerned.  All the talks the Minister will have with Mr. Cecil Parkinson and Mr. Spicer will have no effect whatsoever.  They are not interested in stopping the processing of nuclear waste at Sellafield, but if the British people demand that it stop it would be a different story.  We will have to use all the means necessary, we will have to involve key people in Britain, to bring the British people around to that way of thinking. We have succeeded in other issues, the Birmingham Six etc., and we can succeed again on this issue.  Even if it means putting advertisements in the British papers, so be it, but we must find some means of educating the British people to the danger that they live with and which we have to live with as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because a number of points have already been made and I know that other Senators feel very strongly about this issue and are anxious to get in on this debate.  I congratulate the Minister on the strong, consistent stand he has taken in relation to British nuclear energy and I assure him that this House, all Members of the Oireachtas and, indeed, the entire nation north and south are united behind him in his efforts to protect this nation from the ill effects of nuclear energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Nuclear Energy Board.  That board have not served us well in relation to nuclear energy.  I appeal to the Minister in no uncertain terms to abolish that board in the very near future and to bring in new legislation to set up the new national <Col N="615" /> radiological protection board.  That fundamental step must be taken.  The Nuclear Energy Board have been seen in the past to be pro-nuclear, to be promoting nuclear energy.  That is simply not good enough and they certainly do not represent the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Let me digress slightly and go on to the issue of Sellafield which, by its existence, is an outrage to the Irish people. Not alone is it involved in nuclear reprocessing but it has a military aspect and as neutral country we must be totally opposed to that.  Plans to expand the nuclear reprocessing plants in England and throughout the United Kingdom are also an outrage to the Irish people.  In particular I am thinking of plans to build new stations and expand stations in Scotland. The military aspect I have mentioned and the fact that they plan to expand and promote these plants even further is an outrage to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>However, the main concern to Irish people is health.  Nuclear plants in England represent the biggest threat to the health of this nation.  That is a fair comment. Everything possible must be done to phase out nuclear energy in the United Kingdom and put pressure on the British Government to do that.  That is the most important thing that we must do now.</P>
    <P>As a Dubliner I am particularly anxious that these tests in February do not go ahead.  The Minister must do everything in his power to stop them.  Fact or fiction, there is a general belief by the citizens of Dublin that nuclear energy in England is causing cancer in Ireland.  I know from talking to people that that is a commonly held belief and I am fairly convinced that cancers in Ireland are caused by British nuclear energy and nuclear energy plants further afield, and I am talking about Russia and other countries.  I assure the Minister that we are fully behind him and in the immediate future I appeal that he do everything possible to ensure that these tests in Wales do not go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I was in Maine in the United States and the public <Col N="616" /> debate there which occupied people's minds some months ago was whether the Maine Yankee nuclear power station in Maine should be closed or replaced by conventional sources of electricity, and the related question was whether Maine, if it indicated continuing sanction for Maine Yankee, would then be seen by the United States Congress as an appropriate dumping ground for nuclear waste.  In the event, the referendum showed a strong two to one majority in favour of retaining the nuclear plant and poor Nebraska, because it has no clout or relatively little clout in Washington DC, is to become the home of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>The whole debate served to illustrate to me how enormously powerful are the forces behind nuclear energy, how difficult it is to combat the resources they have in a referendum campaign and how people are convinced by arguments such as nuclear generated electricity is cheaper, that if you close down the plant it will throw people out of employment and so on.  All these arguments, it seems to me, are very relevant to the British situation, if we look at it from the point of view of those who live in Britain and who have all these interests and considerations before their mind.  It served to remind me that nuclear power is a Frankenstein, that it is there whether for military or civil purposes and it will haunt mankind until it devises some way to deal with it.  I told the people of Maine that, though I certainly would have voted against the majority, nonetheless at least they were fortunate they could make a decision because our country, while having no direct vested interest, is at the receiving end of other people's vested interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern and indignation of my colleagues and there is no more to be said about that.  I share also the satisfaction that the Minister is here to reply to this debate and enlighten us perhaps about some of the rather contradictory and puzzling things that have been going on in the past 24 hours.  It appears that Mr. Turvey has complained, or someone has said about him, that the reason he is being abused is simply that he is in the <Col N="617" /> position of a messenger who simply tells it as it is.  Is that true?  What about the position of <i>The Irish Times</i> Science Correspondent today who also would seem to share Mr. Turvey's views?</P>
    <P>However the issue at Trawsfynydd is not the only part of the story because the Minister knows that this is an ongoing situation and the argument will be fraught with the kind of post-colonial tensions that exist between the United Kingdom and ourselves.  I share the anger of many Senators who, in effect, bore out Parnell's observation to his brother John that the only way to deal with the English is to stand up to them, but perhaps the day for that is over and we cannot afford in so many senses to be confrontational with the British.  Surely there must be several levels at which this general issue can be resolved, at the level of ordinary people, at the contact of Members of Parliament and Members of the Oireachtas, and at voluntary bodies such as the British-Irish Association to which I belong?  I ask the Minister to indicate to us the channels in the Anglo-Irish context where we can begin to educate our English neighbours, as has been said here tonight, because instead of standing up to them, our process is the uphill and interminable task of educating them in the reality of Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>Finally, does the Anglo-Irish Agreement provide some kind of scope for the long term discussion of our concerns in this matter with our English neighbours? As the Minister will remember, the phrase &ldquo;totality of relationships&rdquo; was invoked in 1980.  Surely such a vital matter of life and death falls within the scope of our two Governments ongoing concerns.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his speedy reaction to this move by the British nuclear board.  One would think that this happened overnight and that the Minister for Energy, Deputy Burke, had not been monitoring this entire situation since he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to elaborate on a few of <Col N="618" /> the points the Minister made as far back as March and April of last year when he commented on the old Magnox reactors. He said that all of them should be phased out.  In particular, he outlined the operation of the reactors in the Sellafield region, such as Caulder Hall and Chapelcross. The reactor in Trawsfynydd was mentioned also in the Minister's deliberations. We will have to be wary about nuclear power and energy, especially when it is right on our doorstep and, in particular, since the incident at Chernobyl. The Minister, on behalf of the people of Ireland, should be concerned about these tests and he should get guarantees that the tests that are about to take place will not harm the people of Ireland.  At his meeting with the EC Commissioner, Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, the Minister outlined Ireland's position and he got an assurance from the Commissioner on that.</P>
    <P>All the relevant points that should have been made in this House today have been made and I hope the Minister in his reply will elaborate once again on the stand he has taken since he became Minister on having nuclear power stations so close to our shores.  I am sure he is acting on behalf of the people of Ireland and I congratulate him on the stand he has taken since he became Minister and, in particular, the stand he has taken over the past number of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in congratulating the Minister on his continuing and persevering stand on behalf of the people not only of this island but also throughout the globe in facing up to immense pressure levelled against individuals by the interests of the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious situation.  There can be no doubt whatever that the people of this country have what legal persons would call <i>locus standi.</i>  We have a clear interest in what happens 100 miles away from this capital city of Dublin.  There is no doubt, as Senator Haughey said, that many people are convinced there is a serious impact on the health of the citizens of this city.  There seems already <Col N="619" /> to be demonstrable a clear correlation between the existence of some of these installations and an increased incidence of malignancies, leukaemia and particular kinds of tumours.  Although this is not cast iron it seems to be clear that there may be a direct casual relationship and obviously this is something that would worry many people.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also at the use of the word &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; because it is clearly what it is.  It is not just a test; it is an experiment.  The people being experimented upon are not just the people of Cumbria; they are the people of at least the eastern seaboard of this island.  I do not wish to be one of the British nuclear industry's guinea-pigs.  I would not wish to be even if I could trust them and it is perfectly clear that we cannot trust them. It is perfectly clear that they engage the services of paid liars.  Recently, I recall hearing on a news broadcast a representative of the British nuclear energy authority claiming that one of my colleagues in the university, a distinguished nuclear scientist, had made certain statements supporting their attitude.  Within ten minutes that colleague of mine was on the radio publicly contradicting the spokesperson for British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  That causes me great concern because it suggests that we cannot trust a word out of their mouths.</P>
    <P>I have to say that the statement clearly made by Mr. Turvey was ill advised. There should be some chain of command, some consultation and some consistency and it appears that Mr. Turvey has broken ranks.  However, I am concerned at some of the things I have heard today such as the statement that the views of Mr. Turvey &ldquo;go against the will of the Irish people&rdquo;.  I believe that scientific truth should not be amenable to this kind of pressure.  I would like to know and to be able to believe what our experts or indeed international experts have to say on this matter and if they are telling the truth then I want to hear it.  However, I want it to be done in a considered way and not in a rushed telephone interview which can be then used, twisted and <Col N="620" /> abused by interests who do not have the welfare of this country at heart.</P>
    <P>There is a very heavy burden of responsibility on many countries and not just on England.  We are all aware of the fact that, for example, the French Government have licensed and connived at the crime of murder against citizens of New Zealand who are campaigning in the Green Peace Movement.  That worries me.  They connived recently at the departure from agreed detention of persons convicted of murder.  There is a very curious standard of morality surrounding the whole nuclear industry.  I am glad, and I welcome the fact, that we appear to have quite a high standard of morality in this regard.  Long may it last.</P>
    <P>I remember, and I am sure Senator Brendan Ryan remembers also, when those of us who were against the proposal to install nuclear capacity at Carnsore Point were branded as Luddites.  I am grateful there has been a conversion in the electricity generating industry.  I hope also that this principle of taking a very high moral tone will continue into the debate which is promised on mercury soap because it is precisely the same thing.  The people of Cumbria have an investment in jobs, manufacturing and so on with a heavy investment in plant, equipment and employment and these are precisely the arguments that are used when we manufacture noxious substances for export.  We should bear that in mind when we are discussing the issue of mercury soap.  We cannot make this clear distinction and then reserve all our ire for the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>The economic argument is fallacious. Anybody who considers that Sellafield or Trawsfynydd are an economic advantage to the areas in which they exist should ask the people of Chernobyl what economic advantage they had.  We have a vested interest in that.  I am sure the Minister will recollect that after the incident at Chernobyl we, as a principal meat exporting country, experienced great difficulty and great reticence in countries ranging from Latin America to the Arab states, with regard to the acceptability of our meat products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> I will conclude because there may be other persons wishing to come in &mdash; everybody has been very generous in confining their remarks &mdash; and simply say that it seems there is some degree of disagreement between specialists.  I am not a specialist; I am an ordinary citizen who is concerned, worried and grateful to the Minister and to the Government for taking the very direct action they have.  I hope they will pursue the question of Article 34 of the Euratom Treaty.  We have a possibility there because there are teeth there that are not being fully exercised. Perhaps we can press on this issue. I am not an expert but I know the old adage and it is applicable in this instance: &ldquo;When doctors differ, the patient dies,&rdquo; I certainly do not want to be one of the patients who die.  If we have to die in a nuclear way I would prefer to be cleanly atomised.  One of the most repulsive things about this experiment is that we will not even be cleanly atomised; we will just be microwaved slowly out of existence.  I congratulate the Minister on his foresight and I encourage him to take the strongest possible stand with the British Government.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Ryan I just want to remind the House that two speakers are offering and by agreement they will share the remaining time.  The time allocated to each speaker was ten minutes so in this case the two last speakers have agreed to share that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be precisely three minutes.  Contrary to my reputation in this House I can be brief when I choose to be.  The first thing that needs to be said &mdash; I do not like brandishing one's academic credentials but I say this as a professional engineer &mdash; is that the assertion by a senior member of the management of this power station that the experiment to be conducted was 100 per cent safe was untrue.  No engineer could ever assert that there is such a thing as a 100 per cent safe process.  There is no such thing as a 100 per cent safe chemical process, nuclear process, or any other <Col N="622" /> kind of process.  It is all about risk assessment and what is an acceptable degree of risk.  We accept risk in our lives.  We accept motor cars and so on.  In each case what you are talking about is a risk which is regarded as acceptable because the risk is proportional to the benefit to be derived.  In this case the risk from something like this experiment going wrong is infinitely greater than any benefit either to us or to the British people.  The risk could involve in extreme cases large scale devastation of a large part of this country and of Wales.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have been assured that nothing can go wrong is of no use to me because we were also assured that Seveso, Bhopal, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl could not happen.  Let it be said that in terms of even the best run, safest of industries there are no absolute certainties.  Therefore an overwhelming reason must be produced to justify what is being done in north Wales and there are no overwhelming reasons.  As has been said earlier, the only one that one can imagine or envisage is the fact that the British are now reluctant or unwilling to undertake the possibly enormous cost of shutting down nuclear power stations that have outlived their useful lives.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that if the cost of security of maintenance of dead nuclear generating stations for hundreds of years is added on to the hypothetical cost of nuclear power, nuclear power will become uneconomical.  Therefore it is necessary in order to justify the nuclear industry that these stations be kept going and hence the experiments and endeavours. We are at risk.  Perhaps the risk is not enormous but the scale of what we are exposed to is so enormous that I want to congratulate the Government on the firmness of their stand and invite them to consider recourse to the world court and to various international legal fora to prevent this experiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take up the allocation of time that I understand has been allowed.  I simply want to intervene in the debate to support what has been said.  We could go on saying <Col N="623" /> this for a very long time.  The concerns expressed on all sides of the House are widely felt by the people of this country. They have been heightened by the recent revelation of the proposed experiment in Wales.  They are deeply felt concerns which have existed for some length of time about the nuclear industry in England, about the spill over effect on this country and about helplessness in that regard.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister what degree of attention is being paid by his Department and by the Government generally to taking this matter up effectively in the various legal fora, as Senator Ryan has mentioned.  To what extent are we pursuing the possible legal remedies that are open to us either under the Euratom Treaty, under the European Community provisions generally, or under the other international arrangements and agreements? It would be very helpful if the Minister could summarise for the House precisely what legal actions or potential actions are being considered.  I do not believe that any pleas or expressions of concern in this House or by the Irish Government speaking formally as a Government will be listened to for the reasons that have been outlined.  There are far too many vested interests and far too much money and employment prospects in England.  Britain gains much revenue on foot of reprocessing in the nuclear industry and so on.  Unless we have legal leverage, unless we can actually be effective in a legal sense at European Community level, I do not think we are going to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if it is innovative and speculative I think it would be worth commencing legal action and we should place a heavy concentration on that.  If we could bring a case before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg or before the world court which would highlight this matter it would be a much more effective way of operating than simple expressions of concern, however deeply felt, either by elected representatives or by the Government as a whole.  I would welcome some indication from the Minister as to what steps <Col N="624" /> have been taken in this regard and I would urge that there should be a focus on what we can do by way of legal action to supplement any political representations which may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate in the House.  I would like to thank Senators on all sides of the House for their generous comments on my efforts to date in relation to the British nuclear industry.  I can assure Members that I share their concerns about the CEGB proposal to carry out experiments at the Trawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station.  I would like to re-echo the Government's complete opposition to the proposal as expressed both by the Taoiseach and myself over the past few days.</P>
      <P>The Government's view is that the old Magnox reactors, including Trawsfynydd, in the UK should be closed. These plants, most of which are over 20 years old, do not meet modern safety standards.  The UK authorities themselves have said that these plants &ldquo;were not designed to and cannot be expected to meet the latest standards&rdquo;, and in a 1986 safety review of the reactors at Bradwell, which are similar to those at Trawsfynydd, the nuclear installations inspectorate identified 17 points of concern. These statements have served to confirm the complete opposition of the Government to the continued operation of the Magnox reactors.  I have taken every opportunity to express the Government's view that they should be closed.</P>
      <P>The proposal to carry out experiments to see if Trawsfynydd can be kept even longer in operation is repugnant to me. The price of any experiment going wrong is too high to allow for the risk being taken.  The station has had a history of accidents and is now well past its original expected lifespan so that the dangers inherent in experimentation are increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of reports of accidents the British Cabinet papers relating to the 1957 fire at Windscale <Col N="625" /> clearly demonstrates that the UK authorities were involved in a cover-up on that occasion and that their assurances of safety measures since then leave a lot to be desired to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>The Government are opposed to the continuance of the activities of the UK nuclear industry because of the threat it poses to the health and safety of the people of Ireland.  In April last I wrote to the then Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Walker, expressing these views and in September I met with Mr. Parkinson, the present Secretary of State, to reiterate Ireland's attitude to the UK nuclear industry.  I have in addition developed close ties with the authorities in the Isle of Man and the Nordic countries who share our concerns on the hazards of UK nuclear installations.  I have also had discussions with EC Commissioner Stanley Clinton Davis in relation to the appointment of an inspection force at a Community level, which is a very important and high priority item.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited the United States in support of the Government's policy to develop the business of the ESB.  While in the US during the course of meetings it become obvious that no further nuclear capacity is to be added before the turn of the century at the earliest, and probably not even then.  I am glad to have the opportunity of putting this on the record because I would not like to think that the example of Maine as given by Senator Murphy is the only example in America. On that occasion, the people of Maine made one decision, but the people of many other surrounding states have made a different decision.  For example, the anti-nuclear feeling is so strong among responsible people that plants which have been built, for example, at Shoreham, Long Island and Seabrook in Massachusetts have not yet been allowed to operate or to come on stream.  A major nuclear plant which was operating at Pilgrim, Massachusetts, has been shut down there by the regulatory authority.  These plants are not small plants; they are larger than the plant we have at Moneypoint which has over 900 megawatts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The United States is not the only country involved.  To suggest that the operation of nuclear power plants is necessary to meet world energy requirements is essentially wrong.  In fact, since the Chernobyl accident in the USSR, the trend is quite the opposite.  For example, Sweden has decided to phase out its nuclear power stations.  Austria had decided not to commission its nuclear stations.  The Netherlands and Italy are reconsidering their nuclear programmes and recent legislation in Switzerland may also affect the future of nuclear power in that country. I have already described the situation in the United States.  Furthermore, the Government are gravely disturbed at recent reports of the disappearance of nuclear materials in Belgium and in West Germany and it is the subject of a major scandal and probable legal action in the EC.</P>
    <P>The point has been raised by a number of Members of the Seanad as to why the Government do not take legal action etc. I assure Senators that, uniquely, this Government have taken legal action.  We have joined in a case which is already well advanced between Luxembourg and the state of Saarland in West Germany against the French Government &mdash; because they constructed a particular plant &mdash; to stop it coming on stream.  We took this action of going that way and joining with the Luxembourg and Saarland case because the legal process is so far advanced.  Rather than initiating at this stage a separate case we have joined on this particular case which is already going through the courts.  In the history of this country in relation to nuclear matters this is unique and we are already involved in the legal process.</P>
    <P>To those outside this House who would question our right to be involved in opposition to nuclear matters, we, the Government, have a right and a duty to oppose the construction and operation of nuclear plants which constitute, in our view, a menace and a threat to the health and safety of our people.</P>

      <P>As regards the specific problem of the tests at Trawsfynydd, I wrote yesterday on my return from the United States to Mr. Parkinson expressing the Government's concern and requesting an immediate meeting with him.  Today I spoke to Commissioner Stanley Clinton Davis, who told me that he has written directly to Mr. Parkinson to remind him of the provisions of Article 34 of the Euratom Treaty.  Article 34 provides that where a member state proposes to carry out a particularly dangerous experiment it shall obtain the opinion of the Commission.  For the benefit of Members I have been given a copy of the statement by Commissioner Clinton Davis released yesterday in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>A number of Members have commented on the intervention of the Assistant Chief Executive of the Nuclear Energy Board into this debate.  I wish to inform the Seanad that I had discussions yesterday evening with the Chairman and the Chief Executive of the NEB on this matter.  I am glad to assure the Seanad that the Board disassociated themselves from his comments.  In fact, they had already done so prior to my discussions with them, which answers the point made by a number of Senators in relation to the independece of the organisation. However, when I mention the independence of that organisation, I want to say that I feel no compunction whatsoever in bringing to my Department any officials at any level who are running counter to Government policy to ask for an explanation on any matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future of the Nuclear Energy Board referred to by Senators Robb and Haughey, the Government have taken a decision to dissolve the Nuclear Energy Board.  That board was established at a time when the possibility of building a nuclear plant in Wexford was under consideration.  I do not need to assure the Seanad that it is now national policy that no nuclear plant will ever be built in this country.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, the Government have taken that decision.  I want to assure the Seanad that the Government intend to proceed with legislation as a matter of urgency to establish the national radiological protection institute.  I will be bringing the necessary legislation before the Oireachtas in the coming session.  I also take the opportunity to assure the Seanad that whatever attitudes may have manifested themselves in the past in the Nuclear Energy Board, a pro-nuclear approach will in no way be reflected in the charter of the national radiological protection institute.  I can further assure the Seanad that the duties and terms of reference of the new institute will be very much in accord with the present climate of opinion in Ireland surrounding the nuclear industry and the realities of the world in which we live.  Finally, I want to assure Members that I will be publishing details of the national emergency plan shortly and I look forward to the contribution of all public representatives on that subject.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to Sellafield in the course of the debate. While my understanding was that this debate is restricted mainly to the question of Trawsfynydd and the experiments there, I welcome the support of the Members of the Seanad in our efforts to close Sellafield.  Senator Doyle made the point that we would get nowhere merely by making representations and putting pressure on.  I believe that in a democracy the only way you can succeed is by continuing to put on pressure.  I will go to the United Kingdom to see my opposite number there and I will go to address any groups there.  I will go to any part of Europe or the world to highlight not only the Government's view but the view of the people of Ireland.  I take the point that Senator Robb made.  It is one issue that unites all the people of Ireland.  I will continue to lobby in a democratic way to secure the closure of Sellafield.  It may not happen in the short term but in the medium to long term it will happen because the world is turning against the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also take the point made by Senator <Col N="629" /> de Buitléar in relation to the submarines. Oh, that I could do something about them, Senator, but unfortunately, as long as they are in international waters I can do nothing about them.</P>
    <P>The unanimous call of all those who contributed to the debate here this evening reflects the Government's view that the Trawsfynydd experiment should not go ahead will be of great help to me in my efforts to make sure the experiment does not go ahead.  I will take the opportunity first thing in the morning to bring to the notice of the British Government the view of Seanad Éireann and also to bring to the notice of the EC Commissioner and Commission the view of Seanad Éireann in relation to the responsibilities under the Euratom treaties. I very much value the opportunity that has been provided to me here to state Government policy on it and I thank Members once again for their expressions of support.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to get an opportunity of having a discussion here in Seanad Éireann on this very important motion.  It is important that we politicians should encourage our people to buy Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are importing a large amount of foreign goods which could be produced in Ireland.  Hopefully in the near future we will endeavour to produce many of the goods that we are importing, so that we can give employment to young people.  In the past there were many campaigns to encourage our people to buy <Col N="630" /> Irish.  Some were successful and unfortunately some were very unsuccessful. Our party on several occasions launched a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and several other groups tried to promote the purchase of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>A very important step was taken a number of years ago by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his junior Ministers, Deputy Albert Reynolds and Deputy Mark Killilea.  They took a space in a Dublin hotel and all the imported products that they were using in their Department were put on display.  They invited manufacturers and young people who were in vocational schools to come along, and told them, &ldquo;We import this product, maybe you can produce it, maybe you can manufacture it&rdquo;.  I was there that evening and a good number of people turned up.  As a result of that display in Dublin many young people in Dublin started to manufacture products that were being imported by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at that time.</P>
    <P>The IDA then copied that example and took a space at all the agricultural shows and all the industrial shows around the country displaying products, and saying, &ldquo;We import this product.  Can you manufacture it?&rdquo;  The IDA representatives on several occasions told me they were very successful in getting many of the products on display in those shows manufactured in Ireland.  We should have a campaign such as that again.  It could prove very fruitful.  We have a new Minister of State who is trying to promote Irish goods, and to prohibit the importation of goods. Maybe this suggestion might be taken up by him.</P>
    <P>We import a large quantity of every type of clothes.  There is only 10 per cent VAT on clothes in Ireland.  There is 15 per cent VAT in England.  Without contradiction, I can claim that the clothes we manufacture in Ireland are as good as the clothes manufactured anywhere in the world.  Our designers are as good as in any place in the world.  When our designers faced international competition, they have proved better than anyone they had met internationally.  They produce very <Col N="631" /> good clothes and we should encourage our people to purchase Irish clothes in general.  More than 60 per cent of the clothes on display in any draper's shop here are imported goods which could be manufactured at home.  We should encourage Irish people to purchase Irish clothes.  They would not be purchasing an inferior quality, but good quality, very well designed and very well presented clothes.  Anybody that has been abroad and seen clothes on display in drapers' shops in Brussels, in Germany, in France and even in London will know that clothes are much cheaper in Ireland and that the quality is better.  We should do everything in our power to encourage our people to buy Irish clothes.</P>
    <P>People cross the Border every week to purchase goods and they travel in the ferries to England and Wales.  Taking what it costs them to travel into account, they would be much better off if they purchased ordinary goods at home.  Perhaps a few cheap products are displayed every week, to encourage people to go abroad, but in general clothes are just as cheap at home.  People also cross the Border and go abroad to buy groceries and liquor which we have at home.  Irish people should be asked to buy Irish goods in these times when so many of our young people have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>We should develop a more aggressive export marketing plan for Irish goods. We are not aggressive enough in our marketing. Our marketing has fallen down in the past.  Strange as it may seem marketing is very keen within our own country. We have a very progressive and successful agricultural co-operative society in County Kerry, the Kerry Co-op. Most people in Ireland do not realise that we have four co-operative societies in Kerry dealing in milk and milk products. Kerry Co-op is paying a lesser price than any one of the other three co-operatives in County Kerry.  I can assure the House that the aggression in County Kerry, with sales of butter and milk products in general, is amazing.  Our marketing abroad should be more aggressive in future.  We should be more aggressive <Col N="632" /> at home, and say to our people, &ldquo;Buy Irish goods because it will keep our young people at home and it will give more employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In general we import a lot of food.  We have some of the best land in Europe and we have an ideal climate for growing certain vegetables.  Most food can be grown in Ireland.  We imported £85 million worth of vegetables last year and £54 million worth of fruit.  All those vegetables could be grown at home.  At one time they were home grown vegetables; we did not import any, but something happened with our farmers here.  I suppose they adopted a more specialised type of farming.</P>
    <P>In my own county they go in for dairying; they do not grow any vegetables and they do not go in for tillage.  I was speaking to a farmer from my own vicinity the other day who told me that he would be growing ten acres of onions next year and I am amazed at the profit that he thought he would make out of those onions.  I think that is great.  In my county we have the Maharees, which is the greatest onion growing place in Ireland but even though we grow them fairly extensively, a great deal of onions are imported into Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not need to mention all the types of vegetables that are imported.  Our farmers should be encouraged to grow these, to present and market them properly. Housewives today will not walk out of a grocer's shop with a couple of carrots or a head of cabbage hanging out of their hands.  All those items have to be packed in plastic bags; they have to be nice and clean.  We will have to move with the times.</P>
    <P>I claim that the quality of the food that we can produce here is the best in Europe and our farmers should take that opportunity. Indeed, our different Departments in Government, especially the Department of Agriculture and Food, should encourage them to grow vegetables so that we would become self-sufficient in vegetables and almost so in fruit.  Out of the £54 million worth of fruit that we are importing, we could grow, maybe, £10 million worth here.  It would <Col N="633" /> be at least something.  We should encourage fruit growing.</P>
    <P>As regards dairy products, the Munster counties are our greatest dairying areas and they produce large amounts of milk and excellent dairy products.  If you walk into any of the supermarkets or any of the grocer shops today you can see all the imported dairy products for sale, all the different types of cheese and other dairy products, even though we are producing these here.  The home quality is better than what we are importing and still our people often go for the imported products because they think that if it is Dutch or Canadian it is better.  I can assure you that any of the cheeses that we produce taste much better than anything we have imported.  I have tasted cheeses in my own county that are produced by individual farmers and there is a great sale for this type of product.  The cheese produced by one farmer in north Kerry is the type that should be available.  If our people became accustomed to eating that type of cheese, they would never again eat any imported cheese, or any other imported dairy products.</P>
    <P>This is a country that can produce dairy products, I would say, more cheaply and easily than any other country because our cattle do not have to be housed for long during the wintertime, about three months, whereas in other European countries they are housed for six months. Our people should be eating Irish dairy products and not products from any of the European countries.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about dairy products I did mention Kerry Co-op.  Kerry Co-op was a great example to this country in the way our dairy products can be handled because I can assure you that any of the products produced by Kerry Co-op are not going into intervention. The chief executive of Kerry Co-op has a marketing manager and strange as it might seem to many people, that marketing manager is a veterinary surgeon. He is so good at his job that he has been in the US since Christmas, selling products from Kerry Co-op.  The devaluation of the dollar has caused him a little bit of a problem at the moment, but I can <Col N="634" /> tell you that the co-op are so aggressive in their sales there that they are tremendously effective.  They are a headline to the rest of the country as to how we should market products here.  Mr. Goodman has taken over a dairy concern and we hope that he will be as progressive as Kerry and, indeed, that we will not have the importation of dairy products in future.</P>
    <P>We are importing a great deal of fish which is a disgrace when so many fish can be caught in the seas around Ireland. More grants should be made available for boats here.  Our processing plants should be updated and I was delighted to see recently that a big boat was purchased for processing fish out at sea.  We are also importing potatoes and can anyone imagine importing potatoes into Ireland? There is nothing better than an Irish potato, but there is a problem here.  I suppose that we are not growing the right variety because when the month of March comes some of the Irish potatoes deteriorate but Golden Wonder is a type of potato that lasts up to June.  It is a shame that we import potatoes from Cyprus.</P>
    <P>We also import many shoes.  I saw in my own town two shoe factories close down and one has closed down in Killarney. In any shoe shop, 90 per cent of the shoes on sale are foreign shoes and, indeed, the Irish shoes that you can buy in any of those shops are as good as and often better and will keep out the water much better than any of the foreign shoes that are imported.</P>
    <P>We should encourage all our people to buy Irish.  All the parents should be motivated to encourage their children to buy Irish, which will create jobs for themselves. All the teachers should be motivated to encourage their pupils to buy Irish because it is so important for those children to create jobs in this country. We as politicians should play a very important role in encouraging our constituents and the people generally to buy Irish.  There is a new form of patriotism or nationalism and that is to buy Irish and to make ourselves self-sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this topic because it is very important that we use every possible opportunity to spread the gospel of buying Irish.  It is only really within the past ten years that people have become aware of the fact that the buying of Irish goods is so important and that is, maybe, ten years too late because now, as we confront our dreadful unemployment problem and the problem of mass emigration on a scale which has been unprecedented, we realise that unemployment rests with us at home.  One simple solution is the buying of Irish goods and services.</P>
      <P>When we try to devise solutions to the great problems which face the economy we always seem to look for complicated solutions.  Common sense seems to have disappeared from the Irish way of thinking at present and this is a great pity because the ordinary man and woman are just as capable of solving the problems as any of the economists sitting behind their desks.  To buy Irish is a message we must spread from every podium and in every town and village.</P>
      <P>Senator McEllistrim made the important point that we must ensure that young people are made fully aware of the importance of purchasing Irish goods. The Young Ireland movement are doing a great job in this regard and deserve every tribute we can give them.  I remember while in national school that at the back of the copybooks we used to buy &mdash; perhaps they are still there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Copybooks are but I am not so sure about the message on the back page.  They used to carry a very simple but effective message about the importance of buying Irish.  I think it said that we could not afford to lose at home. In fact, they used to advertise it on television using soccer footage.  John Giles who was Irish soccer manager at the time was the main man used in the advertisements. Small things like that were effective.  If you can win the battle with <Col N="636" /> children you will have gone a long way towards winning the war.</P>
      <P>We must admit there is something in the Irish mentality that always leads us to believe that in some way our own goods and services are not as good as those provided by foreigners.  Perhaps that has been bred into us but it is about time that we tried to get rid of it. Undoubtedly, the quality of goods now available on the Irish market from Irish suppliers is not just up to top-class international standards but in many cases is better.  We face competition we have never faced before and as a member of the European Community we must realise that we cannot bend the rules or change the game to suit ourselves.  As a member of the European Community we must face competition from the other member states who have free access to our markets.  We have free access to their markets but we must not shy away from the need to promote Irish goods as best we can.</P>
      <P>We have applied the European rules very fairly, perhaps too fairly up to now, and it is most interesting to read from time to time how some of our European partners can get around and bend the rules by holding up goods in warehouses and by delays in allowing the goods to come onto the market shelves.  This problem must be tackled at Community level. We never seem to be able to get around the rules while our European partners always seem to be able to get round them.</P>
      <P>If one looks beyond the European Community at countries such as Japan and South Korea who export their goods to the European Community and the rest of the world they also seem to be able to escape the scourge of foreign imports. Again, they claim that they are not blocking off their markets to the rest of the world but they bend the rules and use delays to their advantage.  I am sure this is a problem the Minister and the European Community are trying to solve.  It is most important that every player on the international market plays by the same rules and starts from the same point.  At present we seem to be at a slight disadvantage in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> One thing which we could try to do is to ensure that Europeans buy European goods.  One notices on some European products from time to time the &ldquo;Made in Europe&rdquo; symbol on them.  It would be no harm to spread the message to buy European throughout Europe because in the long run that will help all of us.  While we cannot blatantly advertise Irish goods as strongly as we would wish, we must make a renewed effort within the European Community to promote European goods and try to increase the sale of European goods within the European market because, the stronger the European market is, the better it will be for all the countries within the Community.</P>
    <P>In regard to the selling of Irish goods at home and the attempts being made to increase the share of Irish goods being bought in this country we need to recognise that a new media campaign is necessary. Given the new rules in Europe and given the passing of the Single European Act I am not sure of what the position is in relation to the promotion of Irish goods at home but the powerful campaign of four or five years ago seems to have died and something new is now needed in this respect.  We must use both TV and radio as best we can to promote the sale of Irish goods on the domestic market.  I am not sure how far we can go but I hope we will be able to go the extreme limit.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllistrim referred to the food industry and if he was not pressed for time he could have gone much further. Obviously, when you think of buying Irish you must think of the food market.  From time to time, we get a bit carried away with the figures for imports which do seem high.  A figure of £80 million or £90 million has been mentioned in regard to the import of food products but many of these imports are due to the fact that Irish tastes have changed so much over the past ten years that we are not satisfied with the same diet, such as bacon and cabbage, which would have satisfied our parents.</P>
    <P>Many of the fruits and vegetables that are being demanded by the Irish consumer now and which are common on many tables today simply cannot be <Col N="638" /> grown at home.  While I accept that some of the fruits and vegetables being imported could be grown at home it will always be necessary to import £30 million or £40 million worth to make up the balance. The previous Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hegarty, made great strides in the promotion of Irish fruit and vegetables and an improvement in standards was noticed.  The present Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, is also doing good work in this regard but it will be another five or six years before the full spin-off effects are felt.  We must continue with the promotion of Irish foodstuffs. I noticed for a week or two before Christmas within the Oireachtas an effort was made to increase the consumption of Irish potatoes, which were supplied from a chip factory in Donegal.  That was a small but welcome step.</P>
    <P>The food industry &mdash; as typified by Kerry Co-op &mdash; can prove to be of tremendous benefit to the whole economy and in the search for employment. It is an industry which has scope for development and obviously if it develops to its full potential the vast majority of what it produces will not be sold here on the Irish market but will be sold abroad. We must ensure that Irish people are helpful to the Irish food industry by simply buying the foodstuffs it puts on the market.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllistrim also referred to the clothing industry and this is an industry which today is only a tiny fraction of what it was 40 and 50 years ago.  I know that the clothing industry throughout Europe has suffered as a result of technological advances in Asia and some of the Third World countries but, while we cannot compete at the cheaper end of the clothing market there is a growing awareness now throughout the European Community of the new found fashion design sense that has emanated from here.  From my own town of Mallow has come Mr. Michael Mortell who has had a major impact on European fashion trends.  He is our best known fashion designer today, but there are many more <Col N="639" /> like him who may not be as well known but whose work is being appreciated more and more throughout Europe.  We must use the potential of these people to the maximum and give them every assistance possible to ensure that their work and goods are promoted fully at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The fashion industry has not been developed as it should have been over the years.  I hope it will receive more Government attention and aid, if at all possible, over the next few years because it is an industry which can take off and can create extra employment at home. Irish tweed, famous the world over, always held its corner of the market but Irish tweed on its own will not keep our fashion industry going.  It is important that we try to interest as many people as possible in the whole fashion design industry and give them every possible assistance.  I am glad to note that more design schools than ever are offering courses to students.  That is a very encouraging trend.  I hope that if in ten years time we are speaking about the clothing and fashion industry we will hear that the industry has gone from strength to strength.  As a country with such a young population we are ideally geared to be world leaders in the fashion and clothing industry in the nineties and as we approach the next century.</P>
    <P>We could spend all night stressing the importance of buying Irish but it is a simple economic reality that the more Irish goods bought at home the more jobs we will create for our families over the next number of years.  It is a commonsense solution.  It will not put 200,000 people back to work but it will certainly help not only to put a proportion of them back to work, but to keep many thousands of people in their jobs.  I hope the message will go out from this forum and, indeed, from other for a throughout the country that there must be a renewed drive to promote Irish goods, not just on the European market but at home.  From time to time we feel helpless when we see a crisis such as exists today with unemployment and emigration but part of the <Col N="640" /> solution is in our own hands.  It is in the hands of the person who goes into the local shop and supermarket day in, day out, to spend money.  If we could get them to realise that by spending an extra few pence per day on Irish goods and services they will create jobs, it would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their attention and to thank the Senators who tabled this motion.  It is timely and while it may not produce results overnight it is important in that it keeps the buy Irish campaign in the public eye.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, as the last speaker has indicated, to raise this matter and to continually highlight the importance of buying Irish.  Listening to the debate &mdash; I am one of the signatories to the motion &mdash; one wonders what we will achieve.  We will not achieve very much if the Minister, and his Department, do not start a sincere campaign among young people spelling out to them clearly what buying Irish means to them. Our motion this evening is very frivolous in comparison to the high powered campaigns by multinational firms manufacturing goods on an international scale and dumping them wherever they can find markets.  They can afford a loss in an area when introducing products.  They can afford very substantial losses until they achieve a footing in a country such as Ireland.  This is not an industrially developed country and industrialists who manufacture here on a small scale believing they have a market at home find themselves in a very difficult situation. They will get good assistance for training, for establishing themselves, their buildings, their plant and so on but when they put their products on the market they are in direct competition with well established firms who can compete long enough to make life difficult for the small person starting up to supply the home market.  This vast area has been discussed in a haphazard way under different headings such as &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and money up-front for suppliers but they indicate what it takes to succeed and sustain a footing in the market at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> There has been an interest in this by the Government, and by the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, who has got the message across.  He is known to many people, I compliment him on his work.  Most people know that Deputy Brennan is in charge of the Department responsible for marketing and that in itself is an achievement.  The task is enormous and it is made that much more difficult &mdash; I find this very hard to stomach &mdash; by our national media which cost the State a lot of money to establish and maintain, despite the fact that we might be told they are making a profit, day in, day out, 365 days of the year, promoting imported goods.  They are misrepresenting the facts continually.  I wrote to Gay Byrne about this and I got back a sarcastic reply.  He used the national media to tell me publicly that I did not know what I was talking about and that I referred to one little item.  He made skit of it.  He went on the refer to various items, using valuable radio time which an ordinary business person selling a product would have to buy at a very high price.</P>
    <P>I ask this House, the Minister, and everybody concerned about our future if they have ever heard a person on a current affairs programme, a chat programme, a morning programme, or on any other programme trying to be fair or to highlight the difficulties for Irish manufacturers selling their products at home in competition, and I mean fair competition?  Not very many days ago I was talking to the manager of a small industry in Strabane on general topics, about difficult times and how hard it was to survive.  The general economy of the country north and south was being discussed and he said to me.  &ldquo;My company have an industry in Strabane and also an industry in Donegal Road, Ballybofey in County Donegal.  The manager of the industry in Donegal Road, Ballybofey, has a Mazda 626 which cost £4,000 more than my Mazda 626 but the rates on my building here are £8,000 and the rates for a similar building on Donegal Road, Ballybofey, are £2,000.  When we lump the manager's car and the rates together, <Col N="642" /> the business overheads, rates and manager's car put together are cheaper in Donegal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how many know and take time to be fair and not to misrepresent the situation on the ground?  It is time to take a very serious approach at primary and secondary school levels and the young people will have to be told their future is at stake.  In County Donegal we have nearly 20,000 young people going out on the streets leaving secondary school and they are unaware of the importance of buying Irish-made goods that are available at a competitive price. The high powered salesmanship of advertisements on television that never stop, whether for cars, dog food or whatever, demonstrates that the multinationals are highly equipped with resources for a hard sell.  Television advertisement is a very powerful selling agent, and I ask the Minister to take some positive action to see that RTE are not being used to discredit those in this country who are making an honest effort to sell goods of a high quality at a fair price.  Television is a very strong medium in selling and our media are being used at home and abroad to brainwash young people into forgetting about their future.  We have reached a crisis.</P>
    <P>When we go out this evening after this motion is passed will we have really achieved much?  I just hope we achieve something. At least we will have highlighted a problem.  It is so easy to misrepresent the situation.  On Sunday week last a multinational store in this country carried a page or possibly two pages of advertisements of items at very competitive prices.  One item advertised was four stone of potatoes at £1.99.  The farmers producing potatoes in this country are only breaking even at best.  There was uproar for days afterwards and the IFA were asked to respond to this advertisement but they did not respond in a very positive way or in a way that would convince anybody, housewife, producer or anybody else.  I want to take this opportunity to respond.  The advertisement for four stone of potatoes advertised by Dunnes Stores &mdash; and I am, right <Col N="643" /> or wrong, naming the chain stores who put it in &mdash; could mislead people and misrepresent the facts.  I went to that store and I found out that one stone of Kerrs Pinks is on sale at £1.49 which is nearly £6 for four stone of good quality eating Kerrs Pinks.</P>
    <P>Potatoes might not be the be all and end all in buying Irish, but there is a little lesson to be learned here.  Dunnes Stores were not underselling as accused by many people; they were making more than 100 per cent profit.  I grow a few acres of potatoes and I know what I am talking about.  Dunnes Stores misrepresented the position and they advertised another brand of potatoes at £1.99 for four stone. That led housewives to believe that first quality potatoes &mdash; though that aspect was not referred to &mdash; cost £1.99 for four stone.  The poor producer was panicked into believing that he faced disaster, and the IFA did nothing to explain.</P>
    <P>I am using this opportunity here when we are discussing a related subject to ensure that the producer and the purchaser are getting a fair crack of the whip in regard to goods produced or manufactured at home.  We are discussing something which is very near the heart of everybody and very important for the future of our young people.  Young people leaving school must be told that their jobs are at stake if they continue to be sloppy and careless about what they buy and where it comes from.  I want to say to the Minister here, Deputy Séamus Brennan, that there is an outcry in the nation urging him to take more aggressive and positive steps because he can achieve a future for our young people who so desperately need a bit of encouragement today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The last hour or so has seen extraordinary sweetness and light in this Chamber between the unanimity expressed when we were debating the Trawsfynydd power station issue and again on this motion.  I come along rather in the spirit of someone who used to enthusiastically follow a football team at a period in the past when that team had <Col N="644" /> some hope of success.  Though it has now fallen on bad days and its success is now extremely unlikely, I still give it what allegiance I can.  I am in favour of this issue but frankly I think it is rather a lost cause.</P>
      <P>I think I have some moral right to speak on this issue because I have always made it a central part of my political philosophy.  Anyone who cares to leaf through the Seanad Official Report since 1977 will see that I made regular contributions any time there was a motion on the question of giving support to native products.  I remember that on one occasion I asked my fellow Senators did they really put their money where their mouths were or did they put the clothes on their backs where their mouths were. I am delighted to see that the not inexpensive suit which was bought for me by the good woman who claims to be my wife is not alone made in Ireland but &mdash; and this should gladden Senator McGowan's heart &mdash; it is of Donegal origin.</P>
      <P>I remember that on those previous occasions &mdash; and maybe we were not long in the European Economic Community &mdash; we still had some of the traces of the economic nationalism which was so much part of our central national philosophy for so long.  People like Vivian Murray of the Irish Goods Council would regard such Seanad debates as very important. However, it seems that the whole atmosphere has changed.  The thing now resembles a lost cause.  You can hope to influence public opinion to buy Irish only if there is something other than material incentives.  For some strange reasons people's own material self interest is not going to be enough to make them buy Irish.  There has to be some wider spirit in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were periods in Irish history when people bought Irish because it was the patriotic thing to do.  The volunteers of the Protestant nation in the late 1770s had great fervour about buying Irish woollens and Irish textiles in general. There was also the fervour of Gaelic League at the turn of the century.  We should never forget that the body which <Col N="645" /> took upon itself to hope to revive the Irish language was the same body which was responsible for much of that spontaneous industrial revival.  Again in the 1930s, in the last heyday of protectionism, there was something of the same spirit.  It was a spirit which expressed itself in fairly narrow partitionist terms.  During that period Mr. de Valera had no intention of extending any special concessions to his separated brethren in Northern Ireland.  For him the interests of the protected industries of the 26 counties came first.  However, these periods have been few and far between.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether we are now in a different kind of period entirely and whether what we are talking about here tonight is philosophically in conflict with our membership of and our commitment to the European Economic Community. No matter what Senator Bradford says or what Senator McGowan advocates, we are legally strapped.  We cannot spend Government money in giving preference to our national goods because the EC is now in conflict with the whole idea of giving preference to a national community. We are supposed to be as fond of Italian shoes as we are of Dundalk footwear and thereby hangs a tale.  I doubt if the Minister, for all his enthusiasm for this motion, can really devote the resources of his Department to the kind of propaganda that was the rule before we joined the Community.  As well as our legal position, it now seems that our moral case to buy Irish is now immeasurably weakened because the European idea is that you are supposed to be as devoted to Italy as to Ireland and at best all you are permitted is to show a regional preference, which would in the old days be comparable to saying: &ldquo;I prefer to buy Cork goods to Dublin goods&rdquo;.  That is where we are at now.  We have little national or moral right for the kind of campaign which is being advocated here and which I support but I support it as I support a good many lost causes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the <Col N="646" /> debate on this motion.  As previous speakers have said, it is a motion with which no one could disagree.  All of us in this House and the vast majority of people outside recognise the link between buying Irish goods and the preservation and creation of jobs in Ireland. Since that is the case we must ask ourselves why the numerous &ldquo;buy Irish campaigns&rdquo; which have been conducted over the years have not been nearly as successful as they might have been or why they have not had the lasting effect which they should have had.</P>
      <P>Indeed one would have to ask why a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign should be necessary at all.  One would imagine that patriotism or self-interest or a combination of both would influence Irish people to purchase goods of Irish manufacture or goods produced in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Surely people should automatically be biased in favour of goods produced or manufactured in their own country.  I am satisfied that this is the situation in other countries.  French people will buy French goods whenever possible and likewise Germans will buy German goods. Anyone who has driven in Britain cannot but have noticed the predominance of British manufactured cars on the roads there.  It is a measure of the sense of pride which British people have in things British that a native of that country told me recently that he would feel a sense of guilt if he were to drive &mdash; and by drive he meant own &mdash; any make of car other than a British manufactured one.  If this is the case so far as other countries are concerned, why should it be so difficult to convince Irish people of the importance of buying Irish and of supporting Irish produced goods?  Yet it would appear that we have not succeeded in doing so or at least not succeeded to the extent that we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year hundreds of millions of pounds worth of imported goods are purchased in Ireland by Irish people in preference to goods of Irish manufacture, or goods produced in Ireland.  We must ask ourselves why this is the situation and why does this happen.  We must ask ourselves also why so many Irish people buy <Col N="647" /> imported goods and why they do not buy Irish goods on every possible occasion. The only justification for someone buying an imported item is that that particular item is not produced or manufactured in Ireland.  However, the list of such items is getting shorter all the time and in this regard I would like to compliment the IDA and all concerned for having identified, during the past number of years, many items which were being imported and which could be produced in Ireland. As a result of this many of these items are now being produced here and I am sure that we would all want to see this campaign continuing and proving effective m bringing about a reduction in the quantity of goods which we import.</P>
    <P>Frequently we are told that the Irish produced item is inferior in quality to its imported equivalent.  I am satisfied that this is not so in the vast majority of cases. From the point of view of quality and finish Irish manufactured articles compare very favourably with their imported counterparts.  However, as previous speakers have said many Irish people seem to have an inferiority complex about the quality of Irish goods <i>vis-a-vis</i> those of foreign manufacture.  As a nation we seem to have allowed ourselves to be brainwashed into believing that certain imported goods, particularly those of German or Japanese origin, must be vastly superior to what we can produce in Ireland.  As I have said, I do not believe this is so and I am satisfied that it is not so.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in the past some goods manufactured in Ireland were not of an acceptable quality and standard and the image of Irish goods generally suffered as a result.  I certainly would not expect anyone to purchase an Irish produced item which is inferior to the imported item.  However, my own experience is that goods bearing the Guaranteed Irish label are, as a general rule, of much better quality than their imported counterparts.  Certainly I would have to concede that it is very difficult to blame anyone for buying the best value they can get, especially in these difficult times.  At <Col N="648" /> the same time, I appeal to people never to purchase an imported item without having compared it to its Irish counterpart on the basis of both quality and value for money.  One should always keep in mind that what sometimes looks better value at first glance does not always prove to be better value in the long run.</P>
    <P>I would now like to dwell for a few moments on another aspect of the matter we are discussing.  Sometimes Irish manufactured goods, even though they are available and are comparable in quality and price, are not stocked in particular stores or shops.  In other cases they are not as favourably displayed as their imported counterparts.  There is no justification for either of those situations. Just as I believe there is an obligation on each of us as individuals to purchase Irish goods whenever possible, I also believe that people involved in the retail trade in Ireland have a responsibility to play their part in promoting the sale of Irish goods and they can help to do this by displaying them in the most favourable manner possible.</P>
    <P>In recent years, too, we have seen a growing number of non-Irish chain stores opening up retail outlets in this country. Some of these stores appear to have a policy of not stocking any Irish goods and this is very regrettable.  Any retail outlet operating in Ireland which does not carry a stock of at least 50 per cent goods of Irish origin does not deserve to be supported and should not be supported. It should, of course, be particularly obvious to the people to whom I have been referring that in the long term they will benefit more than most from any increase in the sale of Irish goods.  Therefore, it is in their own interests to promote and help to increase in any way they can the sale of such goods.  By doing so they are helping to preserve and create jobs in Ireland and very often in their own localities.  They are helping to keep down emigration and are contributing to the growth of a prosperous Irish economy which will mean more money in circulation and more people in employment resulting in more consumer spending. That is why I say it is very much in the <Col N="649" /> interest of the owners of stores, supermarkets and shops generally to promote Irish goods.  In the final analysis they are the ones who have most to gain financially from a strong and prosperous Irish economy and there is no better way in which they can contribute to achieving this than in the way I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Of course Irish manufacturers can assist very considerably in this regard by ensuring that the design, packaging and presentation of goods are of the very highest standards.  The main point I am trying to make is that it is not sufficient to aim a Buy Irish campaign at the consumer alone.  To be effective it must be aimed at all the other interests involved.  Side by side with any Buy Irish campaign there should be a sell Irish campaign, a promote Irish campaign and a make Irish the best campaign.  In this way we would be involving all the interests concerned in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>In the past many of the Buy Irish campaigns have been organised to coincide with the pre-Christmas shopping period and consequently are associated in people's minds with that period.  For that reason I am pleased that the debate on this motion which began before Christmas has been carried over to the post-Christmas period.  Buying Irish and supporting goods of Irish manufacture and goods produced in Ireland are matters Irish people should be conscious of right throughout the year and not just at Christmas.  I know that in the run up to Christmas a huge amount of money is spent on gift type products and many such products of foreign origin are on display everywhere to the detriment of equally attractive or even more attractive items of Irish manufacture which in very many cases are far better value for money.</P>
    <P>One mistake which manufacturers frequently make is that their goods are not sufficiently clearly identifiable as being of Irish origin or manufacture.  There is the further problem that some goods of foreign origin are labelled in such a way with harps and shamrocks and even the odd bit of Gaeilge as to give the impression <Col N="650" /> that they are Irish goods or were manufactured in Ireland.  In order to counteract this deplorable practice all Irish manufacturers should strive to satisfy the criteria which would enable them to use the Guaranteed Irish symbol on their products.  This would be one of the most effective ways of dealing with the problem to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, because of our membership of the European Community we cannot stop foreign goods from coming into the country but, my view, the fact that they are available in the country is not the major problem. However, such goods should be easily identifiable as being of foreign origin.  If existing legislation is not adequate to deal with the problem of misleading labelling of goods I would go so far as to suggest that it should be amended or new legislation brought in if necessary to make it illegal to sell or offer for sale goods which are not labelled in such a way as to identify clearly their country of origin.  It could be argued that this would be very difficult to implement in the case of certain items such as fruit or vegetables but in the case of such items the containers or shelves used to display these items for sale should clearly identify the country of origin of the goods in question.</P>
    <P>Another obstacle which has to be overcome in any campaign to promote Irish goods is the situation which appears to obtain in certain quarters that in the case of some products one must choose foreign rather than Irish goods if one wishes to be fashionable or not to be perceived as a red neck.  This is particularly true in the case of ale and lager and also in the case of Irish holidays <i>versus</i> foreign holidays.  I suppose this problem could be described as the yuppie factor but certainly it is a factor and it should be seen as one which is not beneficial to the Irish economy.  If a Buy Irish campaign is to be successful it must reach into every school, every home, every office, every shop and every factory in the country.  It must have the support of all sectors of the population.  It must be aimed at achieving a continuing commitment on the part of all Irish people to the purchase <Col N="651" /> of Irish goods, not just in the period leading up to Christmas but throughout the year.  I believe that such a campaign can be successful.  It is simply a question of getting people to start thinking Irish and to keep thinking Irish.  I am very pleased to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be brief.  Much of what I would have liked to have said and proposed to say has been covered on a number of occasions.  At the outset I would like to refer to the comments made on the now vice-like grip multinational supermarket chains have on what effectively the housewife decides to take home from her day-to-day shopping spree to the local supermarket. Many people over the years have expressed concern, from the family grocer upwards, about this ongoing octopus-like grip that supermarket multinational chams have now got.  There is a difficulty at this stage in the game which has primarily offset any effort that this Government, or indeed others, have made to induce the public to buy Irish, and that is that quite often people cannot buy Irish because of this grip by international supermarket chains who have tied up local trades so that the local street corner supermarket or grocery shop as we knew it is virtually gone.  He may still exist physically on the street corner but nowadays he is obliged to buy from some one of the multinational cash and carry groups we have in this country.  I, in the pursuance of my own business, have occasion quite often to go to the headquarters of these cash and carry and it is no bother to go hundreds of yards, aisle after aisle, without finding an Irish product, simply because they are in the profit business and because quite often they own other subsidiaries in the UK or in the sweat boxes of Singapore, Hong Kong or wherever the product you are pursuing is made.  They have a specific interest in selling that product in Ireland themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion a few years ago in my capacity as chairman of a county development team to make an approach to a <Col N="652" /> specific supermarket group located in the Cork region.  At the end of one year we cornered their purchasing agent and said, &ldquo;Look, at present less than 15 per cent of the total throughput of your warehouses is Irish&rdquo;.  He did eventually concede that they would buy, and I quote one example, Laird's jams from Drumshanbo. We convinced them eventually that, instead of buying some product from the UK, Yardleys or one of those prepacked jams that you now get everywhere you go, they should buy that product in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>That is the difficulty we must address if we are to endeavour to solve this problem because there are in some places, strangely enough, people who are genuinely anxious to buy Irish where possible.  They might even be prepared, which they would be obliged to do on occasion, to pay a little over the top.  We will address ourselves to that aspect in a moment. Why should they have to pay more for an Irish product versus an equal product produced somewhere else?  Even conceding that the more affluent of consumers would be prepared on occasion to buy an Irish product, quite often they cannot get it because the particular shop that they frequent in the normal shopping expedition do not in the main sell Irish products.  That is a new dimension to this problem and until such time as we can create this groundswell &mdash; this is why I subscribe to much of what Professor Murphy said, although I certainly would not subscribe to what he appears to be saying that it is almost time to give up the ghost.  Quite often in the course of our debates we say in an nonchalant way that &ldquo;teachers should&rdquo; but that is very easy to say.  Maybe we are at a particular moment in our history in relation to first and second level education where there is &mdash; at least we are advised there is &mdash; a reassessment of the curriculum taking place at present in first and second level education.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully submit that one of the most fundamentally important things we could do in that assessment is to insert a specific item at national school level if possible &mdash; I am not a teacher and I do <Col N="653" /> not know &mdash; along the lines of a civics class.  We should get back to the time when we could convince children, and we had a lot of people in the national schools in my time who went to great pains to convince their students that they should be proud to be Irish and that they should be proud to buy Irish products where posible.  I do not know how often this is referred to nowadays as I have departed from that scene for quite a while, but I cannot say that I have heard my children adverting to it.</P>
    <P>It is important in reassessing our curriculum at present that, apart from the nationalistic considerations, which are secondary in this debate, for pure commercial reasons we convince these young people that if they are to have any semblance of a job when they leave school, eight, ten or 15 years hence, that it is essential to their wellbeing to buy Irish and to seek out things Irish.  We will have to address this problem.  We are at an opportune time in history for this reason. We have just about come out of the generation where it was an upshot of the affluence in the sixties and seventies that we should but Italian footwear.  They were more fashionable.  French attire for ladies and so on was more fashionable. We have come out of that cycle.  There is now an awareness &mdash; particularly in the area of fashion &mdash; that we have established a niche for ourselves in the international fashion market and we should build upon it.  There is an awareness now amongst Irish people that Irish clothes are indeed better and more fashionable than those of most of our European counterparts.  We must harness that change at heart and we can only do it by convincing the next generation of school leavers that there is a future for them in buying Irish and in seeking out Irish products and convincing them that they are as good as, if not better than, what we import.</P>
    <P>I touched briefly on a fact a moment ago and it is something we will have to look at.  I again refer to my own line of business.  When I contact my wholesaler for supplies for my hotel, by and large <Col N="654" /> most of the foreign products can be purchased cheaper, especially foodstuffs.  I can buy cheaper ham from Holland.  One has to ask the question, why should it be possible to buy hams in Ireland from Holland that are much cheaper than those produced at home?</P>
    <P>The wholesaler from whom I get my supplies does not even sell Irish hams anymore because he can buy them so much cheaper from Holland and import them and sell them to me wholesale or indeed retail.  In our anxiety to promote things Irish there is the element of competitiveness which is equally important. We have mastered the problem of quality by and large in Ireland in the area of foodstuffs, footwear, clothing and so on, but we most definitely have not mastered the problem of cost comparisons.  One point made by the purchasing officer we met from the multinational company was that they still had the problem, especially in relation to buying in bulk from an Irish company, of deliveries on time.  That problem apparently still exists.  When we address ourselves to the subject of absenteeism from work and so on it is no surprise that manufacturing companies have the ongoing difficulty of delivering on time.  He made the point that when they had in the past, in other areas of their business, endeavoured to buy Irish goods in bulk for distribution to their network of shops they quite often did not get their deliveries on time.  It is a factor.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, at the end of the day this recession can ultimately create the awareness in the minds of the Irish people that the time has come when they must consciously and actively seek out things Irish.  There are other aspects which we must address.  There is an acute awareness, for example, in Europe and America of the advantage of buying Irish products, particularly in the food area which has been addressed a number of times here tonight.  I received recently a copy of a survey which was carried out in an American supermarket chain in relation to why Americans should buy Irish fish.  Out of the 1,500 samples responded to, 1,100 referred to the fact that they could be absolutely certain that <Col N="655" /> the fish product coming from Ireland would be coming from a clean environment. We in Ireland appear to be somewhat oblivious to this edge.  It is important that we convince our consumers at home that Irish products are produced in a clean environment, which makes them safe to eat and so on.</P>
    <P>We should encourage Irish people to holiday at home because buying Irish holidays is another important aspect.  There are 80,000 people directly involved in our tourism industry.  We most definitely have lost our way in the area of the home holiday.  There are very obvious reasons why people are now encouraged to go abroad.  For example it is quite often less expensive.  There is an awareness in the industry now that Irish hotels, guesthouses, farm guesthouses and so on have to compete and that the golden goose has been well killed.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government requested the hotel federation to encourage their members to reduce their prices by 10 per cent.  They did this and I understand that the request this year is to hold them at the same prices and they are again responding to that.  We should be aware that costs have not stayed at the same level.  However, the reality of the marketplace is that if one is not competitive and is not prepared to take smaller profits and so on one will not survive.  The tourist industry know this.  It is vitally important that the public are now exhorted to respond to that overture by staying at home this year.  It is a very patriotic thing to do.</P>
    <P>We only have to look at the huge impact that President Reagan had in 1986 on the American holiday-maker when he went on national television and quite specifically requested American tourists to stay in America in 1986.  Apart from the request there were other reasons for the success of his appeal.  For example, terrorism in Europe at that time had a very high profile.  However, it had a huge impact on the number of American tourists who came to Ireland and it made a very significant contribution to the American tourism industry.  These are <Col N="656" /> examples of practical patriotism in which we can exhort people to participate. Apart from patriotism, people should-stay in Ireland because now there is an awareness in the industry that people must give Irish tourists value for money as well.</P>
    <P>Now that that overture made by Deputy Wilson has been responded to by the industry, the public should respond as well.  A most practical way of buying Irish is to stay at home, to spend one's money in Ireland and encourage a spinoff effect on the shops and so on.  It is a huge industry.  The Taoiseach stated recently that we have now got over £500 million in income from that industry. Tourism is everybody's business.  It percolates right down into every facet of Irish industry.  It is important and we must convince people to be more aware of the necessity to buy Irish in the tourist sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Callaghan referred to the buying of imported goods as did Senator Murphy, who said that now our hands were tied to a certain extent because of our membership of the EC, in that we cannot give preference to Irish goods.  Senator O'Callaghan spoke about Irish clothes and how some people did not think much of the variety and quality of the goods.  He referred to French fashions, to Italian shoes, to chic fashion and Bally shoes.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday I was in the RDS at the opening of the Irish Industries Fair by the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan. There were 185 stands.  I have an interest in shows.  I go to shows around Europe and there was nothing that would have surpassed the quality of the goods and the professionalism of that fair last Sunday. The most surprising thing of all, even though it was only a trade show, was the number of people present.  I was only there because I have an inquiring mind and an interest in shows for another reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the point of the problem of buying Irish goods, I want to tell a true story.  When Maguire and Paterson set up in Dublin to manufacture <Col N="657" /> Irish matches, they were in production for almost two months and the warehouse and every available space was full of matches but no matches were being bought. When it reached the stage that there was no more room and no customers the manager called in the staff and said to them: &ldquo;when you go home tonight and are handing the wages to your wife, tell her that when she goes to the shop tomorrow to buy the week's supplies, to take her list and when all the goods are ready for her, to then ask for Irish matches&rdquo;.  The shopkeeper will then say that they have no Irish matches and if she does not take their matches it will not worry him. However, what she should say is &ldquo;I do not want the groceries unless you can give me the matches&rdquo;.  That procedure was carried out throughout the city and on the following Monday morning there was a queue outside Maguire and Patterson for their matches.  They have never had any problem selling their matches since. That is nearly 80 years ago.  There is a moral in that story.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan spoke also about supermarkets and said that about 10 per cent of the multinational supermarkets do not sell Irish goods.  Senator O'Callaghan said that one supermarket manager spoke about delays in delivery.  That is only eyewash.  It is very easy to find an excuse when one wants an excuse.  The position is, unfortunately, that a lot of the multinationals do not pay the manufacturers for two or three months and the Irish manufacturer is lucky to survive when supplying the multinational supermarkets. The Irish people who are interested and the people working in the supermarkets should go into the supermarkets and if there are no Irish products on display they should leave the rest of the products and go where they can buy the Irish products.  This would make a big change and it would not contravene the EC regulations.  I like to buy Irish goods wherever I can.  I am parochially minded, and whatever I want to buy I buy in Killarney and I buy Irish.  I am glad to say I have a suit and shirt on me made in the Minister's constituency, at Ballymahon. Manford Clothing were out in <Col N="658" /> the RDS showing their products, and they were beautiful.  There is no reason why anyone should not buy them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan touched on tourism and the problems involved.  We have to give value for money.  Everybody expects to get value for money.  There is no reason why products one buys in Ireland should be any dearer.  In some cases where there is an advantage the goods should be cheaper.  I am from a town which is the Mecca of tourism.  The cause of the problems with tourism in this country is Aer Lingus, our Irish airline. They have taken more people out of the country on holidays than they ever brought in.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus had a cross-channel fare of £200 and the flying time to the UK was 45 minutes.  Then they would take you to the Canaries, flying time 4½ hours, and you would get a chalet or an apartment for two weeks for £250.  How could we get business in Ireland when you had that guaranteed sunshine, cheap flight, cheap accommodation and duty-free goods when you went out there?  Bord Fáilte, to my mind, have been a great organisation, but they are being crippled by Aer Lingus who have spoiled Irish tourism.  It was only when the competition came in that they changed.  Now you can fly to the UK for a fare as low as £66 depending on the day you are going and what notice you give, and the passenger traffic between Ireland and the UK has tripled.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus decided that Knock Airport was not the place for an internal flight and they could not see any business in it.  Many people thought that nothing could come of Knock Airport but then Aer Lingus woke up and found that 55,000 passengers had been flown through Knock Airport last year.  Ryanair had given that service to Knock.  The Minister, in his wisdom, decided to give the flying time to Ryanair and then Aer Lingus wanted to get it.  I am glad that the Minister resisted and did not give them the licence.  Now Aer Lingus can fly to Galway and to Sligo.  I understand rightly or wrongly &mdash; I am subject to correction on this &mdash; that Aer Lingus have two distinct services, one for <Col N="659" /> Galway and one for Sligo.  If you fly Aer Lingus to Galway, you have something like two hours and then you have to come back.  You would lose half an hour gettibng into and out of airports so it would give only an hour in Galway if my information is correct and it is probably correct. I cannot see why Aer Lingus would not fly to Galway in the morning, continue on to Sligo, come back from Sligo in the evening and pick up passengers in Galway.  They would have full loads and give plenty of time to people who want to do business or go the these places.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus staff are superb.  I have never met a better staff and I have travelled with all airlines.  The management in Aer Lingus could not manage a duck house, not to mind an airline.  It is a terrible reflection that these people can boast about profits this year and ask themselves what they are going to do, but the taxpayer will be caught one of these days for about £300 million to replace their fleet.  I would privatise Aer Lingus and then it would be run on businesslike lines and you would have competition and you would be getting results.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator O'Callaghan is in the hotel business and he is very concerned about it, and I know he would like to see many more people coming to Cork and, naturally they would have to come to Killarney after visiting Cork.  You have not been in Ireland if you have not been in Killarney.  It would benefit everybody because of the resulting spin-offs.  We have a very large number of guesthouses in Killarney and, in most cases, the wife runs the guesthouse and her husband has a job.  Perhaps at the end of two years, these people buy a new car.  If they had not that sideline in the guesthouse, they could not buy a new car out of the husband's wages.  The Minister, Deputy Wilson, is doing a good job.  He must face up to Aer Lingus and put them in their place because the management of Aer Lingus is the worst thing that has happened to this country since Oliver Cromwell.  I conclude with that.</P>
    <Col N="660" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion.  It is appropriate at this time to congratulate the Government and, indeed, industry in general on their magnificent performance in relation to their export drive over the past 12 months.  It was absolutely fabulous. The whole idea and emphasis of this motion should be to continue that good work on the home front.  Briefly, I would like to mention two points referring to what Senator Murphy said.  One I agree with and the other I disagree with.  The first point highlights the indifference of many people when buying goods as to whether they are Irish made or any other make.  I had occasion recently to be in the company of a number of people and the whole question of buying Irish came up.  I asked how many in the company were wearing Irish made clothes.  I am glad to see that Senator Daly and, indeed, Senator Murphy wear Irish made goods. A number of the people who offered to show the label on their clothes found out for the first time that they were not Irish made and quite a number of the others were not prepared to show the label because they did not know whether or not the clothes were Irish.  This highlights the indifference.  It has been said here on a number of occasions that there is great difficulty in getting across to people how important it is to buy Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point Senator Murphy made was on the difficulty we have in being a member of the European Community and at the same time trying to promote Irish made goods.  He mentioned, in passing, that he supported a certain football team.  I presume he was talking about County Cork football team. You could use the analogy that when we support a county team everyone is in total support of that team, but when it comes to club level it is an entirely different story each member of the club is at pains to do everything in his or her power to see that the club wins and to support that club.  We are exactly the same in relation to the European Community.  I am proud to be a member of the European Community but I am also very, very proud to be Irish.  I will do everything to ensure <Col N="661" /> that Irish made goods are promoted and supported.  The importance of buying Irish cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>The consumer plays a vital role in business and the problem is that the consumer as an individual does not appreciate the tremendous influence he or she can have on the type of products that are displayed and sold.  The whole purpose of production is to satisfy consumer demand.  It is important to specify that the consumer, in the instance of which we are speaking here, has a broader meaning than a private individual.  It also includes business firms and other organisations that buy various goods and services, and the Government, who buy a considerable quantity of consumer goods and services each year.  So, people and organisations act as consumers when buying goods and services and the same people and organisations act as producers when they are engaged in production and distribution of goods and services.  When buying goods, consumers are concerned about the price of the goods or service, the quality of the goods or service, availability, choice, availability of finance for the goods or service, after sales service, guarantees, legal remedies if goods are defective.</P>
    <P>Mention was made here on a number of occasions of supermarkets.  I was interested to read the advice one of our supermarket kings here, Fergal Quinn, was giving to shoppers prior to Christmas.  He said:</P>
    <P>Make clear the kind of choice you want.  Complain to the right people. Complain in the right way.  Know more about what you want to buy.  Get to know the people who deal with you. Praise when it is deserved.  You will be surprised to find, just how much you can change things for the better.</P>
    <P>That little bit of advice conveys in no small measure the tremendous influence the consumer has on the type of products which can be displayed and sold in all areas of business.</P>
    <P>Customers can play a much more active role in shaping products and services. They really do not appreciate the part they can play and do not realise their <Col N="662" /> strength.  Business should be teamwork between customers and the people who serve them.  Consumers should demand that they get the product they want and should not accept a substitute.  They should complain to the people who have given bad service instead of grumbling about it to their friends and neighbours. This brings me to the problem of getting the message across to the Irish consumer, not only to buy Irish but to demand Irish made goods.  The effect of switching even £1 per week per family from imported goods to home produced goods will be absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>I was given a figure in this regard quite recently and it really surprised me.  I was told that if a major manufacturer of Irish biscuits purchased Irish produced sugar and sweeteners it would lead to the creation of an extra 300 jobs and that is just in one industry.  The fact absolutely amazed me and that is just one example of what could be achieved if we could convince people to change over to Irish produced goods.  That is something which we should consider very seriously.</P>
    <P>How many of us even bother when purchasing goods to see whether those goods are Irish made or imported?  I gave the example earlier of people not knowing whether the clothes they were wearing were Irish made.  Those of us who specifically ask for Irish made products are definitely the exception rather than the rule.  People who demand Irish made goods are perceived to be some sort of eccentrics who just want to be awkward and cause inconvenience.  How many of us have witnessed a situation in a shop or supermarket where a person who wishes to buy Irish made goods is made to feel like someone with two heads even by the other customers?</P>
    <P>Irish people for some peculiar reason, and Senator Bradford referred to this earlier, have the dreadful notion that whatever we produce here must be inferior to foreign made goods.  Statistics in relation to our exports have proved that that notion is by no means correct. We do seem to suffer from some sort of inferiority complex and this may be due to the fact that we were dominated for so <Col N="663" /> long by a foreign power.  This attitude prevails notwithstanding the fact that the Irish Goods Council have been carrying on a massive campaign over the years to buy Irish and have been improving the quality of products continually through the Guaranteed Irish symbol.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the new legislation which bans below cost selling and the paying of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; which was introduced by the Minister.  I do not accept what the supermarkets have said, that the new law banning below cost selling will result in increased prices for goods and will specifically hit Irish made products.  We are all aware &mdash; and the Minister also referred to this earlier &mdash; that supermarkets who operate below cost selling increase their prices on other ranges of goods and that the logical thing to do now would be to reduce the prices on those other ranges of goods.  The paying of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and the other special demands placed on manufacturers by supermarkets put home producing firms at a tremendous disadvantage.  I am confident that the new legislation will be of great benefit to home manufacturers who heretofore could not afford to pay the enormous amounts of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; to have their products displayed on supermarket shelves.</P>
    <P>Another area which has great potential for import substitution is the subcontracting of work to larger companies operating in this country.  I have before me an extract from statistics supplied by the Irish Goods Council in relation to competing exports and it really gives food for thought.  In the food and non-food grocery area competing imports amount to £274 million.  Clothing and footwear imports amount to £206 million.  Furniture imports amount to £27 million and industrial sub-supply and and other manufactured goods amount to a massive £650 million.</P>
    <P>Let me give some specific examples in relation to that area.  We import £1.3 million worth of toothbrushes and £2.5 million worth of toothpaste and other dentifrices.  Although I do not have too much of a need for shampoo at present <Col N="664" /> we import £3.5 million worth of it.  We import £1.5 million worth of household gloves and £1.5 million worth of protective gloves for all trades.  I could go on and on.  We import £554,000 worth of floorcloths and hinges of all types to the value of £1.5 million.  What amazed me is that we import almost £10 million worth of crepe, household and toilet paper.  I am absolutely amazed that we import £10 million worth of articles of that nature.  We import almost £500,000 worth of hairbrushes.  The list is endless. What I am trying to emphasise is that there is a massive potential for subcontracting work in relation to many of the goods we import.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done to date in relation to this area and I also congratulate his Minister of State on the work he has done in the marketing area.  We have to get across to the people at large just how important it is that we buy Irish.  It is a question of how we get that message across.  Reference was made to the idea of promoting a campaign at school level and in this regard Senator Bradford mentioned the Young Ireland movement.  A tremendous amount of work remains to be done even within the schools.  I would suggest that, if it is feasible, the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Education should in the education for living or civics programme or some similar programme urge the need to buy Irish on students. Occasionally, being a teacher, I bring this point home to my students.  I am always amazed at the fact that they feel there is no great need to do this or that they feel they have no input to make in this area.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that parents should convince their children of the need to buy Irish.  I would urge the reverse. It is extremely important that children should influence their parents in what they buy.  After all, it is the parents who spend the money in the shops.  The children of today will be the parents of tomorrow.  There is fantastic potential for bringing forward some type of concentrated programme at both first and second level to highlight the need to buy <Col N="665" /> Irish.  School is a fantastic forum for introducing a campaign of that nature.  I have no doubt that if young people are convinced of how important it is to themselves as young Irish people to buy Irish especially in relation to the creation of extra jobs they will act in a very positive way.  I did not agree with Senator Murphy when he said we are closing the door after the horse has gone.  We can play a fantastic role.  Senator McGowan mentioned that it is not good enough just to debate this matter in the Seanad and to then go away and forget about it.  The initiative must be carried on.  We must draw up a definite plan which will lead to an increase in awareness of how important it is to buy Irish.  I am delighted to be able to support this motion and to have the opportunity to speak to it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Senators who put down this motion.  I agree totally with their sentiments. It is not good enough just to talk about this matter and to highlight it here and in the other House.  We must follow it through and make suggestions which will produce some better results at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>I followed with interest much of the discussion and I am surprised that such a negative note was apparently introduced by Senator Murphy who said we are closing the door after the horse has bolted. This is not and never has been an easy problem to tackle irrespective of which party were in Government.  A fair measure of success has been achieved over the past few years.  We should try to build on that success and not just fall back into the old trap of saying we are bolting the door after the horse has gone.  If we adopt that attitude across the whole spectrum of public life in Ireland we might as well float back into the Commonwealth as was suggested at a different time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the air of pessimism that permeates certain sections of Irish society.  I can never understand why people can even think of uttering things such as that especially when we look at the success Irish people have achieved <Col N="666" /> all over the world in whatever facet of business or in whatever walk of life they chose.  When they go abroad they achieve great heights in whatever profession or area they go into.  We are all pleased with the spectacular success of Irish exports to the most sophisticated markets around the world.  They created an all-time record this year of between £10.5 billion and £11 billion for a small country.  If we can do that on the export market why can we not do it at home?  This is exactly what this motion focuses on.  I should like to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate and I will take up any worthwhile suggestions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that we need continuous activity and perseverance by myself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, indeed, by the Minister of State for Trade and Marketing, Deputy Séamus Brennan. The Minister of State took another initiative today, with the Taoiseach, in launching a new national marketing group consisting of real practitioners in the business.  He wants to bring them together and let them have their input into how the State can play a more effective role in giving Irish industry an opportunity to sell more goods.  We have to be very realistic about where the weaknesses are, identify them and go after them.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna referred to the role of the primary school sector and I will take that suggestion up with my constituency colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, to see how it can be tackled.  In regard to young people &mdash; Senator McGowan placed a lot of emphasis on this &mdash; it is important to get across to them.  We need to stress the importance for them that more Irish products are bought because that will mean more jobs at home.  It is as simple as that.  One of the more effective messages I saw over the Christmas period was that of Guaranteed Irish, a voluntary organisation run by industry, who put a slip in the pay packet of everybody going out for Christmas with a short, clear and distinct message that a small amount of the wage packet spent every week on <Col N="667" /> Irish goods could create a job for their brother, their sister, their cousin, their uncle or whatever.  That is the type of message we want to get home and it is gaining more emphasis.  There is a greater awareness but we have to build on that and keep the message before the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan and I are fully committed to that.  We have taken many initiatives since we took office.  It is important that we should continue to go abroad seeking investment to create jobs here but, in my view, there is even greater scope for creating more jobs out of what is sold in Ireland whether it is in supplying industry or consumer goods.  It is slower, it is not as flashy as making an announcement about 200 jobs for a particular town but those jobs will be there longer and after the market has changed for some industries that are being brought into this country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has already been given some very important figures in relation to the level of imports into this country. Let me give the Seanad a few more just to put the matter into perspective.  In the European Community imports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP is 28.5 per cent.  The figure for Ireland is 53 per cent.  Overall, imported goods now hold a bigger share of the market &mdash; 57 per cent &mdash; than Irish goods, 43 per cent. That puts the whole scene into perspective. There we are lagging behind our partners in the EC.  To put it another way: every year Ireland imports an estimated £1.2 billion worth of products which could be produced by Irish manufacturers and Irish employees.  We lose out in two ways: first, by failing to channel a proportion of this spending into Irish enterprise and, secondly, by losing out on dramatic opportunities for establishing strong indigenous manufacturing firms which can use their home sales base to expand into the virtually limitless potential of exports.</P>
    <P>Between 1979 and 1984, the value of manufactured imports increased from £3.4 billion to £6.4 billion and the overall import penetration of the Irish market increased from 50.3 per cent to 57 per <Col N="668" /> cent.  This high level of import penetration exists in virtually every sector of the Irish market: clothing is 68 per cent, leather and footwear is 73 per cent, textiles is 70 per cent, plastics is 73 per cent, office and data processing is 81 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a major part of the problem is that Irish manufacturers face competition from countries where low wages enable products to be produced at prices well below what Irish firms could meet.  In some segments of the market, there is evidence of this and there are indications that, in these instances, the Irish consumer will sacrifice quality for a very low price.</P>
    <P>However, it would be misleading to see this as a principal reason for the high level of imports.  It is important to note that over 86 per cent of our imports originate in highly developed countries with a sophisticated manufacturing base and with a strong reputation for excellence. In most cases, Irish manufacturers are competing in the Irish market with the best in the world.  Five areas alone &mdash; the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France and the Netherlands &mdash; between them account for over 75 per cent of our total imports.</P>
    <P>Such a level of import penetration is not in our national interest.  There is a gross imbalance in the situation and as a nation we must strive to mirror the EC average.  The Government are fully committed to developing our indigenous enterprise so that we can contribute in a significant way to get a greater share of these imports.</P>
    <P>We must recognise, of course, that we live in an open economy.  Our membership of the EC and of GATT requires us to operate in a fair and competitive way.  That is not to say that we are hamstrung in every way we turn and that we cannot do a lot about the situation as we see it.  We can no longer hide behind artificial barriers to trade and expect second-rate goods to be accepted in the domestic market.  We must acknowledge the tough, highly competitive market situation that exists and operate within that scenario.</P>
    <P>Given the level of import penetration <Col N="669" /> that exists, there are a number of questions that need addressing.  Why does Ireland import such a high percentage of manufactured goods which Irish industry is capable of producing?  Why are we far behind most European countries in using a strong domestic market as a base for export expansion by a dynamic indigenous marketing sector?</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise Irish buyers for failing to give adequate support for Irish manufactured products and for using their spending power to build up industry and help create jobs in other countries but that is too simplistic a response and overlooks the fact that on the evidence many Irish buyers are supportive of Irish products and are fully alive to the fact that their spending can contribute to economic growth and job creation.  If we want to tackle the problem at the roots, we need to examine a number of related problem areas which, in combination, are responsible for the high volume of imports in the Irish market today.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; is a strong, simple, unmistakable message that evokes a very positive response from most Irish people and provides them with a means to make a personal patriotic contribution to the good of the nation.  So much seems to happen in the economic world that is outside the control of the average man or woman that there is an instinctive welcome for an opportunity to take action in an area where people can make a difference, where one does not have to be an entrepreneur to help to create additional employment.  The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; theme has been with us since the foundation of the State and, indeed, one finds echoes of it in Irish history, back to Dean Jonathan Swift and beyond.</P>
    <P>However, there is a sense in which &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; has become something of a smokescreen, obscuring fundamental problems and offering a slogan instead of a solution.  Prior to our membership of the EC, when high tariffs and low quotas effectively protected much of Irish industry from open competition, manufacturing was production rather than market-led and the Irish consumer was <Col N="670" /> often given the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; message as a substitute for quality and value.</P>
    <P>There was almost an unfortunate connotation of charity in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; appeal, an implication that, were it not for the Irish origin of products, the consumer would not ordinarily buy them in preference to imports.  With this in mind, there was a major shift in emphasis in the seventies.  The &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign, launched initially by the Irish Goods Council and now run by Irish industry, put the focus on product quality, value and service and specifically urged Irish shoppers to purchase Irish products only where they compared favourably with imports.</P>
    <P>This campaign has been successful in a number of respects.  Consumer research over the years has shown that the great majority of Irish shoppers believe that, in general, Irish products are as good as, or are better than, imports.</P>
    <P>This research also suggests, incidentally, that for most shoppers, quality rates higher than price in purchasing criteria. This confirms the only realistic direction for Irish manufacturing industry. In the main, Irish firms will not find their market niche at the bottom end of the market, where the competition is fiercest and where profit margins are tight but must build an image, a reputation, for Irish products in quality, service and all-round value.  Not only does this give Irish firms the best chance to win sales in the Irish market but it is the only way for them to develop a product line-up that will enable expansion into export markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to an international policy of fair and open markets is in our own self-interest because it frees Irish industry from the limitations of a tiny home-market consumer base and gives access to the virtually limitless potential of export-led growth.  But one country's import is another country's export and, in order to gain greater export access, we also have to open the Irish market to greater competition from the products of other countries and provide Irish consumers with more choice and variety.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> During the seventies two factors came into play.  First, many Irish firms were slow to adapt to the changing marketplace and the more intensive level of competition from abroad.  Second, Irish shoppers were attracted by the novelty of the wider choice and the new products coming into Ireland at highly competitive prices for the first time.  The inevitable result was a huge growth in manufactured imports.  In sectors like clothing, footwear, furniture and foods, competing imports doubled and trebled their markets share.  This import growth rate had mostly levelled off in the early eighties as Irish industry got its act together and began to fight back, but over the past two years there are disturbing signs that competing imports are on the rise again.</P>
    <P>In a situation where Irish products are failing to enjoy a reasonable share of the Irish market, any one or all of three factors must be considered: Irish people are not buying the products; Irish stores are not supporting them; or Irish firms are not producing them.  At present, all three factors are highly relevant.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; addressed one element.  Despite the strong evidence of consumer preference for Irish merchandise and recognition that Irish goods are fully competitive, this attitude often fails to translate into purchasing decisions.  There is a need for people to think a little more before they buy; to make a determined effort to seek out and ask for Irish products; to buy imported goods only after they have consciously checked if there is an Irish equivalent; and to make their views known to retailers, whose business depends on responding to customer demand.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly made an interesting point about Maguire &amp; Patersons and the affect that message has had.  It is that type of message that has to be driven home every day into the shoppers' minds, whether through the kids at school, to the parents and everybody else, that buying foreign products is exporting our money to create jobs abroad when we need them so badly at home.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that a much <Col N="672" /> more determined consumer attitude in giving Irish products a fair chance to prove themselves would in itself, shift millions of pounds of purchasing power from imports to Irish goods and give Irish industry the kind of support that European industry generally receives from its home market consumers.  A point made forcibly by many Senators who contributed here is that in Germany the people buy German and in France they buy French.  In Ireland for far too long, although it is changing but we will have to change it much more forcibly, supporting Irish and keeping our money at home is the best way the parents in spending their wage packets can contribute to the possibility of jobs for their young people.</P>
    <P>A bit more pride in Irish products by Irish people is not only needed but is fully justified.  It is ironic, for example, to observe the growing sales and popularity of Irish fashion garments in highly sophisticated world markets, while here at home we import over £1 million worth of clothing every single day.</P>
    <P>The second area to be examined is what has been termed &ldquo;sell Irish&rdquo;&mdash; the attitude of retail outlets to Irish firms and Irish products.  Obviously, this is a crucial area because, if Irish shoppers continually find that they cannot get Irish products when they shop, they are likely eventually to give up in frustration.</P>
    <P>Until fairly recently, it must be said that there was justification for the very serious concern about the high level of imports stocked by many department stores, supermarkets and speciality outlets. Irish manufacturers complained about the difficulties in getting their products on to the shelves or even getting an appointment with store buyers.  Small Irish manufacturers and new companies in particular found major barriers in the way of getting their products introduced on to the shelves.  I want to thank the Senators who mentioned the abolition of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and below cost selling. It was an initiative that I felt was long overdue.  The small manufacturers were being put to the wall by the completely discriminatory and unfair practices that existed in the minds of buyers in the way <Col N="673" /> they carried on their businesses.  Some action was called for, action was taken and I intend to follow up that action in whatever way possible.  Senator McGowan drew attention to the real problems in the potato industry at the moment.  In the last week or so the Irish Farmers' Organisation have been calling on me in relation to taking action in an area that they deem to be below cost selling.  I want to tell the Seanad here tonight that we have fully investigated it and, far from the existence of any below cost selling at all, it is a different problem. I would have expected the IFA as representing the producers to know exactly what the problem was and to point the finger in the right direction and have the real facts brought to the attention of the consumers.  In the interests of their own members I thought they would have done their homework before just glibly calling on the Minister to step in and take action. When I investigated it no action was called for on my part.</P>
    <P>As I said, until fairly recently there was justification for the very serious concern about the high level of imports stocked by many department stores but I can say that this situation has been significantly reversed in recent years.  For the most part, the Irish retail trade is now highly supportive of Irish firms and committed to increasing its stocks of Irish products. I would mention the Irish grocery sector as a case in point.  Orders placed with Irish companies as a result of marketing initiatives organised by the Irish Goods Council have increased from £2.2 million in 1984 to £8 million in 1985, £13.6 million in 1986 and £15.4 million in 1987.  The graph is certainly going in the right direction and we should keep it going stronger in that direction.  The major cash and carries, multiples and symbol groups have undertaken their own promotional support programmes for Irish food and grocery products and have organised seminars for small Irish companies to help them identify new product opportunities. There has been a coming together of the buyers through the efforts of the Irish Goods Council to relate back to manufacturers what the requirements <Col N="674" /> are going to be and where we see the market going.  That type of close liaison, close co-operation and exchange of market information can help small companies to avail themselves of opportunities they have not been aware of in many instances up to now.</P>
    <P>There has been a similar pattern of support activity by the trade in other consumer product sectors.  It is worth noting that last year saw the largest number of promotions ever undertaken by the retail trade to boost sales of Irish giftware, toys, food and other merchandise and already this pattern is continuing in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The third area may be the kernel of the problem: Consumers cannot buy, nor can retailers stock, Irish products that do not exist.  So are Irish products meeting the demand for more Irish products?</P>
    <P>From time to time, Irish industry comes under fire for some of its shortcomings, so the fact should be recorded that hundreds of Irish manufacturing firms are aggressively exploiting opportunities in the Irish market.  Particularly welcome are the growing signs that Irish manufacturing industry as a whole has become more marketing-conscious. More Irish companies are investing in marketing for the first time.  New and innovative Irish products are filling gaps in the market which have been almost exclusively represented by imports.  More new business orders are being vigorously pursued, both with the wholesale and retail trade and with industrial buyers.</P>
    <P>At the same time, however, many Irish firms are not effectively responding to the challenge of market opportunites.  The most important single reason for import growth is not the failure of the consumer to buy or the trade to sell but the failure of manufacturers to upgrade their marketing performance.  Poor marketing, as the Sectoral Development Committee's Report on Marketing noted, is the area in Irish industry most in need of improvement.</P>
    <P>A major upgrading in the marketing skills of indigenous industry is needed if the competitive performance of indigenous industry is to be improved and if Irish <Col N="675" /> firms are to win back market share lost over the past decade or so.  Survival and growth will depend on a two-stage drive to first establish consumer loyalty with Irish shoppers and develop from this into exports.  Few indigenous firms are likely to make an impact in export markets unless they first win their share and their spurs in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I think that there were some unfair criticisms made during the debate on this motion of the involvement of the State and its agencies in this area.  I would in particular like to refer to the work of the Irish Goods Council.  As the State agency with responsibility for increasing sales of Irish goods in the home market, the Irish Goods Council have in place a number of programmes to provide Irish manufacturers with the ability to strengthen their marketing capabilities and win new business sales.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing companies with individual marketing services in areas like market information, buyer introductions, product testing and marketing planning, the council operate a highly successful sectoral marketing strategy which brings together small and medium firms within the same sector for joint marketing and promotional programmes on a very cost-effective basis. By pooling resources, Irish firms are able to make a combined impact that would not be possible by any single one of them. Last year, over 600 Irish firms participated in sectoral marketing activities.</P>
    <P>Industrial purchasing has new business opportunities for Irish firms at least as significant as in the consumer product sectors.  Indeed, the potential for winning sales may be greater, given that Irish suppliers at present meet less than 20 per cent of the purchasing needs of Irish industry.  This was referred to by Senator Vivian O'Callaghan in his contribution. The Irish Goods Council's sub-contract opportunities programme has, in the eighties, diverted more than £500 million in new and repeat orders from overseas sources to Irish suppliers and the potential for further gains is enormous.</P>
    <P>To build up marketing power within <Col N="676" /> companies, the marketplace programme has, to date, placed almost 300 young marketing graduates in Irish companies which have not previously had in-house marketing personnel.  This has enabled these companies to identify scope in the market and exploit it with new products and marketing programmes.  The Irish Goods Council estimate that, over the next three years, there are realistic opportunities for Irish firms to increase their share of the Irish market and win an additional £400 million in new business sales.</P>
    <P>In addition to the valuable work on import substitution being carried out by the Irish Goods Council, I would also like to point out that I recently obtained the agreement of the Government to a series of proposals which I made on the matter. The proposals are aimed at ensuring that Irish companies get a fair crack of the whip when attempting to supply the public sector, which, after all, is the largest single purchaser in the country.  I intend to see to it that the ability of Irish firms to compete in terms of quality and price is fully appreciated by the decision-makers in public purchasing.</P>
    <P>I have enlisted the help of my colleagues in each Government Department to ensure that this takes place.  I first saw this possible opportunity in the development of the telecommunications programme in 1980 where the State set out to spend £1 billion in modernising the telecommunications industry and yet the input from Irish manufacturers was extremely low.  It was only by going out around the country, having seminars in various large provincial towns, getting small suppliers in and producing the opportunities, identifying the product that was needed and the quantity that was needed, when it was needed over a five year period, that created the opportunity for many small firms to take on additional lines and for new product opportunities to be exploited by new firms.  In that regard, it was amazing the number of jobs that could be created and the amount of money that was kept at home.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in various other <Col N="677" /> Departments of State and in the semi-State sector similar opportunities exist that have not been exploited.  It is too easy for people in the State sector to continue with their old habit of buying from suppliers who come in from abroad because they have no hassle and problems. That must stop.  If there are competitive Irish suppliers in the marketplace they have to be given a fair crack of the whip.  I can assure them that under this Government they will be given a fair crack of the whip and initiatives in that respect have commenced in recent times.</P>
    <P>I am also well aware that in major building projects, both in the health area and many other areas, consultants seem, for whatever reason &mdash; and I do not know what is the real reason &mdash; to specify products made in the UK and continental Europe in preference to availing of similar products made in this country.  With the various State agencies I am bringing together a product identification unit that will feed into one data base and have the same information available so that everybody will be able to tune into it and find out exactly what products are made in Ireland and what is available.  If they do not buy, they are going to have to explain to somebody why Irish firms were not given the opportunity.  This is the type of action I think Senator McGowan was talking about.  It is no good talking about something if you do not have a follow-up action programme.  I can assure the Seanad that there is an action programme being pursued by myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, in that regard and he is taking initiatives in various areas as well, not alone in the export field but in the home market also which can be the export market for many small Irish firms.  I intend to give Irish industry the ability to compete in terms of quality and price with everything that is bought in the public purchasing area and I have every confidence that Irish producers will be able to prove themselves in this regard when given a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Fitzsimon's comments in relation to the payment practices of State agencies.  I do not know <Col N="678" /> what specific ones he had in mind, but if he has specific cases in mind I will be only too glad to follow them up for him or maybe he could direct them to whatever Minister is responsible.  Suppliers should bring attention to instances of abuse, if there is abuse.  However, sometimes suppliers offer products on very long credit terms and then complain when they do not get paid.  That is not to say that State Departments are the quickest to pay, but where there is clearly an abuse it should be brought to the notice of the Minister concerned and it should be followed up. Cash flow can be vitally important especially to small firms because it keeps them in business.  In relation to any complaints that are handed to my Department, I can assure the Seanad that I will actively pursue them and report back on the individual complaints that are handed to me.</P>
    <P>I also obtained the agreement of the Government to proposals on the development of the concept of countertrade in our overseas purchases.  It is my intention to see that benefits accrue to this economy as a result of purchases necessarily made abroad.  Many times the State purchasing areas, whether they are State or semi-State, purchase large amounts abroad.  There is a growing trend worldwide in countertrade which is now becoming a real factor in doing business. We have been very slow and reticent in the past to even think or talk about it.  If anyone thinks I am talking against EC and GATT Regulations here, I am not. There was a very long and informative discussion in the European Parliament not so long ago about countertrade and in many countries countertrade now represents approximately 25 per cent of business. That is the level it has gone to in international terms.</P>
    <P>Recently I introduced countertrade in investment and purchasing being made abroad by some of our large State agencies. I found that the suppliers were forthcoming and half expected it and were surprised they had not been asked about it up to now.  They do not expect to spend millions of Irish money abroad without getting something in return and I can <Col N="679" /> assure Senators that so far as I am concerned it is a facet that will be developed to the largest extent possible.  By engaging in countertrade arrangements, the State will be in a position to attract additional business opportunities for Irish firms in return for making overseas purchases.  As this countertrade, or offset trading as it is called in other countries, develops, Irish exporters will probably find themselves in the position of being asked for it if they are doing substantial business abroad.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that the Government cannot run a Buy Irish campaign along the lines some commentators would suggest.  You may all recall the European Court judgment of 1982 under which the Irish Government were taken to task for financially assisting the Guaranteed Irish and the Buy Irish campaigns. Since that case, the Government have withdrawn financial support and the Guaranteed Irish organisation have established themselves as a private sector body funded by their members.  I met members of that organisation shortly after coming to office and they asked me to take certain lines of action and initiatives on their behalf.  I did that and at a Christmas luncheon to say thanks, I was highly impressed by the amount of time and effort that is put in by those people on a voluntary basis to try to promote the purchase of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>RTE have come in for a certain amount of stick and criticism but I want to put it on record that, when asked, they made available any spare time they had in advertising to encourage the purchase of Irish goods rather than using some unnecessary fillers.  I want to put on record also my sincere thanks to CIE for making space available on their buses free of charge to the Guaranteed Irish campaign.  They were also helping the economy.  The same goes for many other areas also.  In this regard, An Post are responding with a symbol on their franking machine for 1988.  That is the type of action programme the Members of the Seanad who contributed here would like to see me take in relation to keeping the <Col N="680" /> message in front of people and pushing it ahead as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Guaranteed Irish can indeed play a very important role in bringing home to consumers the message that quality Irish goods are available.  Since its establishment Guaranteed Irish has concentrated in bringing home its message to as broad a cross section of people as possible and it has also been working very closely with retail outlets.  Among the many national organisations with which it has co-operated have been Junior Chamber, ICA and Macra na Feirme.  I applaud the efforts of all these private sector bodies and hold them up as an example for all of us to follow in order to encourage the development of a strong indigenous sector, well positioned in the home market.</P>
    <P>Here I might add that young political organisations have taken up this theme and indeed have done their bit in relation to the Buy Irish campaign over the Christmas period.  The money that has been kept in this country as a result of their efforts, and all our efforts, amounts to a significant contribution at the end of the day.  I took the opportunity on two occasions, both on radio and television, of promoting the buying of Irish records at Christmas.  Now that we have attained such heights in the international field, why should we buy foreign records when all our Irish groups have made the grade internationally?  Why not keep our money at home?  I have heard since the Christmas period that there has been an improvement in that regard.  The game is far from lost.  If every one of us and every sector of this community continue to make that effort it will have a major impact on the size of the bills we have to pay.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to providing the right climate for industry cannot be questioned.  There have already been positive signs of an improvement in the situation.  Falling interest rates, lower inflation and curbing of Exchequer borrowing levels have all led to a greater degree of optimism among industrialists.  Indeed the results of the <Col N="681" /><i>Small Firms</i> Association's Fourth Quarter Survey of Trends issued before Christmas have shown a significant surge in small business confidence.  In the survey 41 per cent of firms stated that they were &ldquo;more optimistic&rdquo; for the forthcoming year &mdash; an increase of 29 per cent over the February figure.  Indeed, the same message has come from the quarterly meeting of the Council of CII held in the last week or so.</P>
    <P>It is up to industrialists to build this confidence into firm orders, a task that will benefit greatly by any increase in our rate of purchase of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on a more topical note. This year, the city of Dublin celebrates its millennium.  It is already evident that the millennium has given the citizens of Dublin a welcome opportunity for an enthusiastic expression of civic pride and sense of community.  It is an opportune time for a vigorous promotion of local industry.</P>
    <P>During the year, Dublin is expecting record tourist numbers, with thousands of visitors from all over Ireland as well as abroad, representing a major boost in shopping expenditure.  There is huge potential here for manufacturers and the retail trade to work closely together to ensure that Irish-made products are effectively displayed and promoted, As well as civic pride, there is every reason also to celebrate stories of local industry &mdash; both the long established firms and the newer companies which are beginning to build up a reputation.</P>
    <P>For the consumer, there is no more practical way of showing a community spirit than in supporting the quality products of Irish industry.  Greater support for Irish products by Irish shoppers will have a stimulative effect on retailers and industry. It will encourage the retail trade to continue its policies of commitment to Irish goods and will be a further incentive to Irish manufacturers to fully exploit market opportunities.  A millennium sales boost for Irish goods in Ireland's biggest marketplace would give us more to celebrate in terms of prospects for producers, increases in employment and a contribution to our national well-being.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> I thank the Senators for contributing to this debate.  It is a very important motion.  I certainly will do everything I can in my capacity as Minister or Industry and Commerce to help to boost the purchase of Irish goods.  In this regard there is, as I have said earlier, a very significant opportunity to increase job prospects here at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight and for the attendance of the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Air pollution is at its worst when atmospheric inversion occurs.  This is caused by a colder layer of air close to ground level being capped by a layer of warmer air above it.  Smoke and other pollutants which normally rise up into the atmosphere out of harm's way and are dispersed by winds cannot penetrate the boundary layer between the two masses. If the inversion persists for several days, smoke concentration caused by domestic coal fires and traffic fumes can reach near lethal levels, especially above large residential areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1982 Dublin experienced a very severe and prolonged smog outburst. A study carried out by two consultant physicians at St. James's Hospital showed that mortality rates among patients with respiratory problems were more than twice as high as normal for the month.  Dr. Luke Clancy and Dr. Ian Kelly undertook a study which was published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in 1984 after noticing a marked increase in the number of patients being admitted to St. <Col N="683" /> James's Hospital suffering from respiratory diseases.  Their conclusion was that this was due to the severe smog in the city at that time.  A subsequent computer analysis of Dublin hospital statistics confirmed that the phenomenon was not just confined to St. James's Hospital.  The same sort of pattern was evident in other hospitals throughout the city, with a marked increase in mortality and serious illness among patients with lung complaints.</P>
    <P>This problem raised its ugly head again in Dubin on 9 December last year.  On that date the meteorological services broadcast its first ever smog warning alert for Dublin.  Dublin was surrounded by choking smoke from thousands of coal fires for the second night in succession, with visibility in some of the worst hit areas reduced to 50 yards or less.  As the smoke clouded the city a leading respiratory doctor warned that a repeat of the smog of 9 December would double the death rate among the weak and the old.  Doctors treating chest patients in St. James's Hospital in the city centre monitored a notable increase in the number being treated for respiratory difficulties.</P>
    <P>While the EC limit on pollution level is 250 microgrammes per cubic metre, the following levels were recorded in Dublin up to midnight on 9 December last: Mountjoy Square, 981; Ballyfermot, 823; Rathmines, 676 and Dame Street, 472.  The seriousness of these figures can be judged by the fact that the World Health Organisation confirmed that an increase in deaths can be expected when levels reach 500 microgrammes per cubic metre.  As the Minister will have noticed, the figure for Mountjoy Square for that night numbered almost double that, at 981 microgrammes.</P>
    <P>In London and other major cities measures have long since been implemented to rid the environment of smog.  Although it took four years of pressure to achieve, the British Government finally introduced a Clean Air Bill in 1956 and as a result, London smog is a thing of the past and winter visibility in that city has <Col N="684" /> increased by 300 per cent.  Since September 1987 we have introduced our own clean air legislation under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  This measure had all-party support.  It would have been hard for many who suffered in the smog on 9 December last to believe this but the truth, of course, is that the Act is only enabling legislation and will take some time before it really becomes effective.</P>
    <P>The Act gives local authorities power to designate smoke control areas whereas, for example, the burning of certain fuels such as household coal can be restricted or prohibited but before this can be done the local authority has to carry out an exhaustive survey of the area in question and at the end of the day the Minister has to approve any smoke control order.  I am pleased to inform the House that Dublin Corporation have undertaken the initial steps in this matter and have carried out a door-to-door survey of 850 households in Ballyfermot which is one of the blackest spots in the city for smoke pollution, with EC limits repeatedly breached year after year.</P>
    <P>The survey is designed to establish the pattern of fuel use in the area.  Not surprisingly, the survey showed that the vast majority of people in this survey used coal as the main means of heating in the house.  I understand that the officials who carried out the survey were very well received by the residents of the 850 houses in Ballyfermot who realised there is a serious problem and they are anxious that something should be done to have it removed.</P>
    <P>In Britain and Northern Ireland the Government have given substantial grants to people in the lower income group areas to enable them to change over to smokeless fuel.  There is little point in designating an overwhelmingly working class area like Ballyfermot to a smokeless zone without providing people who live there with some incentive to change over to smokeless fuel.  This is the main reason I raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the Air Pollution Act, section 45, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make a scheme or schemes for the granting of financial assistance in relation to the whole or part of the cost incurred by the owner as occupier of a premises situated within a special control area in order to enable the premises to comply with the requirements of special control area order or notice under section 44.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has talked in the past about the need for more public awareness of the smog problem in Dublin, urging people to adopt a more positive attitude to buying smokeless coal in preference to ordinary coal.  I understand that smokeless coal is about £2 per bag dearer than ordinary bituminous coal and for people living on a limited income the price difference is still too wide.  It could be narrowed a bit further by removing VAT at 10 per cent from smokeless coal as proposed by several environmental groups.</P>
    <P>It would also help if the State was to give some example in this matter and if people who were to benefit under the free fuel schemes were to be given financial assistance to allow them to buy smokeless fuel.  In the last year Coal Distributors Limited have invented a grate for the burning of bituminous coal which has the effect of burning up its own smoke.  I understand that two of these fireplaces have been installed by Dublin Corporation, one in a flat and one in a house. They have proved very satisfactory for the residents in these two dwellings.  Now I understand that Dublin Corporation are commissioning the IIRS to carry out an examination of the emissions to see what improvement has been made.</P>
    <P>If these fireplaces are capable of burning up to 80 per cent of their own smoke as claimed by Coal Distributors Limited, then they would be worthy of consideration. I understand that the installation of such a fire grate would cost, for a backboiler £280 and for the installation of an ordinary grate, £120.  Again, this would cause certain problems for people living on lower incomes so it would be <Col N="686" /> necessary to grant-aid the change over so that there would be sufficient numbers changing over to the new appliance to make a real impact.  People should also be encouraged to change over to oil and gas heating.  Again, this would have to be grant-aided for people on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious we have a number of choices in order to remove the threat of air pollution from our atmosphere.  We were fortunate that since 9 December last the weather has been excellent but we cannot be complacent about the matter. We could easily experience the same atmospheric conditions as occurred on 9 December last with the same results.  I feel there is a grave responsibility on the Government to take action so as to prevent this situation happening again in the city of Dublin or any other city around the country.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of Dublin Corporation is to designate Ballyfermot as a pilot smokeless control area, using the powers available under the Air Pollution Act which came into effect last September. Clearly, however, this will not be a practical proposition unless the Government give some indication of what grants will be available to enable people to change over to smokeless fuel. I have tabled this motion tonight to highlight this very serious problem and to hear the Government's response, especially in relation to financial matters and grants that can be given in accordance with section 45 of the Air Pollution Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this important issue of air quality in Dublin and for giving me the opportunity to comment on it in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin smoke situation is by far the country's most serious air pollution problem and it is arguably the most serious environmental problem of any kind which our capital city now faces.  It is by no means of recent origin and its complete elimination, regrettably, is going to take some time.  I would assure Senators, however, of our determination to get appropriate and co-ordinated <Col N="687" /> countermeasures under way because of the seriousness of Dublin smoke pollution in itself and because a remedy is enjoined on us by the EC by 1993.</P>
    <P>An EC directive with effect from 1983 set ambient air quality limit values for smoke and sulphur dioxide throughout the Community.  The Directive, however, recognised that it would take time for remedial measures to be implemented and have effect in areas of high pollution.  Subject to these areas being designated by national authorities, it allowed a period of ten years, until 1993, for measures to be completed in these zones.  Dublin, together with a large number of other urban areas in the EC, was notified to the Commission as a zone in which the longer period would be required to achieve compliance with these limit values.  The difficulty in the case of Dublin related, of course, to smoke rather than sulphur dioxide.</P>
    <P>Under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 244 of 1987) &mdash; the first regulations made under the new Act &mdash; the Minister prescribed air quality standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide, as well as for other pollutants, which are similar to those of the EC directive.  Where as in Dublin these new standards are being exceeded, there is now a statutory duty on the local authorities concerned to take appropriate steps, using their powers under the new Act, to secure compliance with the standards.</P>
    <P>The recent smog episode in Dublin brought a strong media and public reaction which is also reflected in the raising of this issue here tonight.  This reaction was prompted by the inherently serious conditions which parts of Dublin experienced. It was also facilitated, however, by the fact that for the first time Dublin Corporation were able to issue monitoring results from certain stations immediately after the days involved and that the Meteorological Office incorporated this data into their forecasting.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed this earlier availability of representative monitoring <Col N="688" /> data but, in view of some of the inaccurate constructions placed on it, it may be helpful if I explain the way in which EC limit values and the corresponding air quality standards prescribed by the Minister operate.  Serious though it was, the December smog episode in Dublin, taken by itself and in isolation, did not breach any EC air quality standard.  It is highly probable that by the end of the &ldquo;air pollution year&rdquo;, that is by 31 March 1988, the episode will have contributed to breaches of these standards but, in itself, it was of insufficient duration to represent such a breach.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of a daily EC smoke pollution limit of 250 cubic milligrammes per cubic metre of air.  In fact this is only an input to air quality standards, or a building block in their construction, rather than being on air quality standard in its own right.  This level of pollution must be exceeded for at least four consecutive days &mdash; something which did not occur in December &mdash; before any standard is breached.  Alternatively, this level of pollution must be exceeded for at least eight days over a year, something which by definition cannot occur in one week alone.</P>
    <P>The lesson from all of this and, indeed, from the reporting requirements of the EC Directive which are yearly ones, is that smoke pollution has to be seen as a long term problem to which coherent long term strategies are the only answer. The sources of Dublin's smoke bear out this analysis.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 per cent of smoke pollution in Dublin has been estimated to come from domestic premises &mdash; almost entirely due to combustion of solid fuels; 15 per cent comes from vehicles and some 5 per cent from industrial and commercial premises.  The very dispersed nature of Dublin's smoke pollution sources means that the counter-measures required will be extensive and will take time to implement.</P>
    <P>How are these alternative arrangements to be put in place?  We should not forget that, despite the continuing serious smoke pollution problem, a number of developments already under way will <Col N="689" /> ensure longer term smoke reductions in Dublin.  Since 1983, when the relevant EC Directive came into force, use of natural gas in Dublin has increased almost fourfold.  Under current policies and incentives, this use is set further to increase and it will become an important element in smoke abatement strategy here in line with the experience of major urban areas elsewhere to which natural gas has been made available.</P>
    <P>Use of smokeless solid fuels has also been increasing in Dublin and is now tentatively estimated at possibly as much as 20 per cent of solid fuel use.  Much has been made of the higher price of most of these fuels and of the disincentive which this will represent to their wider use.  This point needs to be put firmly in perspective. For a start, some smokeless solid fuel is actually retailing more cheaply than top quality bituminous coal. Secondly, even where smokeless fuels are nominally dearer, they will have a higher calorific content considerably offsetting the real difference in price.  We have been encouraged by the response of CDL to representations of the Minister that they should use pricing to encourage greater uptake of their reactive smokeless fuel, that is, smokeless fuel suitable for burning in open grates.  CDL have now informed me that they have reduced the price of this fuel by 50p per bag.</P>
    <P>The strategy envisaged in the Air Pollution Act, 1987, for dealing with severe localised problems is the declaration of so-called special control areas, or smokeless zones, in which intensive remedial measures can be applied.  In the circular letter issued by my Department on 31 July 1987, local authorities were advised that, in areas where the relevant EC limit values are being exceeded, they should survey the incidence and casuse of air pollution as well as the systems used for domestic space heating and cooking, industrial and commercial needs etc., giving priority to areas of heaviest pollution. The purpose of such a survey would be to assist local authorities in considering the desirability of special control area orders and the appropriate <Col N="690" /> extent and phasing of these.  Dublin Corporation have now completed survey work of this kind in an initial project involving nearly 900 houses in Ballyfermot where the incidence of smoke pollution has overall been the worst in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of the Act permits the making of a State scheme of financial assistance in relation to the costs incurred by occupiers of premises in complying with a special control area order.  In view, however, of the considerable preliminary responsibilities of local authorities in this area, as outlined above, and normal budgetary considerations, we have not felt it appropriate as yet to make any announcement of such a scheme. Senators can rest assured, however, that I will bear in mind the views expressed here tonight in our further consideration of this matter.  I assure Senator Doyle that I will convey his views to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I have to remind Deputies that the smoke levels experienced in Dublin during the December episode, unacceptable as they were, had many precedents in recent winters and that more severe episodes were registered early last year.  Bringing these under control will require a wide range of co-ordinated measures which on the experience of smoke abatement programmes elsewhere will take several years to complete. We are determined to get these measures moving quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In regard to supplies of fuel, we need a more co-ordinated approach and if suppliers of fuel would take whatever action they possibly can, we will be in contact with them to ensure, as far as possible, that more smokeless fuel is brought into operation, I agree with the Senator that it is now a matter of urgency and has to be dealt with.  I am hopeful that all suppliers will be able to come together and that we will be able to work out a programme which will solve this problem to the benefit of everybody.  I would really appreciate that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is quite right.  The figures I <Col N="691" /> quoted were for one day but if those atmospheric conditions had continued there would have been very serious consequences.  I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to section 45 on financial assistance.  Local authorities like Dublin Corporation have very little finance available, even for the running of normal services, and to provide a smokeless zone in Dublin city would require finance from Central Government as indicated in section 45 of the Act.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for the Environment the urgency of giving this matter priority because I fear that the problem which arose in December could arise again for a longer period.  This could have serious consequences on the health of the citizens and probably, at the end of the day, <Col N="692" /> would cause the Exchequer greater financial strain through the medical services than the creation of a smokeless zone.  I ask the Minister to give priority to financial aid for local authorities.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Doyle, I will convey that point to the Minister for the Environment and will see what can be done in that respect.  I appreciate his concern about the health of the people and how serious the situation is.  I will bear all the Senator's remarks in mind.  We are favourably disposed and I will bring the matter to the Minister's attention as a priority.</P>
