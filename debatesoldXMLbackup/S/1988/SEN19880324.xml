      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Daly, that on the the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed selling off of IDA land banks by direction of the Government.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, may I raise something on the Order of Business which gives me some concern and which I am sure concerns other Senators as well?  It is the atmosphere in the room particularly when it is crowded as, for example, at the vote last night.  I am convinced that the ventilation is not sufficient and that the atmosphere in which <Col N="222" /> we work in the Chamber is not a healthy atmosphere.  I mean that in the actual literal and physical sense.  I note that there have been extractor vents put in the windows.  Does that mean that the windows cannot be opened.  Perhaps you have something to say to us about this.  I would like the matter to be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if that is a suitable place for it to be discussed further.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator raised the point because it is something which I have been dealing with since we moved into the new Chamber. These ventilators were put in and are not at all successful.  Those of us who are here all the time are more aware of the atmosphere.  I will again deal with the matter with Mr. Coughlan.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention behind this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, which consolidated all previous legislation relating to the ACC and is the principal legislation governing the ACC.</P>
      <P>The 1978 Act, which confines the ACC's lending activities to the agricultural, horticultural and fisheries areas, deals with the objects, constitution, functions and financing of the ACC and with the various charges which may be taken, not just by the ACC but by other banks, on land and other property as security for loans.  Before proceeding further, I would like to give Senators some background information on the ACC.</P>
      <P>The corporation was established as a State-sponsored body in 1927 for the purpose of providing a specialised credit service to agriculture, particularly long term credit.  At that time, long term credit was not readily available from the commercial banks and it was intended that the ACC would fill this gap for farmers and farm co-operatives.  Until the sixties, the volume of business transacted by the ACC remained small reflecting the general economic climate of those times, the traditional reluctance of farmers to borrow and the uncertainty of market opportunities in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This slow growth in ACC's business is reflected in the fact that, in 1961, ACC's total assests were only £3.7 million while annual lendings were at the modest level of £0.8 million.  Growing confidence in the agricultural industry in the latter half of the sixties changed the outlook of <Col N="224" /> farmers and led to an increased willingness to invest.  One factor which generated this increase in confidence was the prospect of Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community, with resultant improved market conditions and an increase in agricultural incomes. This change in farming had a major impact on the ACC.  Business increased and a network of district offices was established as the corporation developed to meet the new environment.</P>
    <P>The level of ACC's annual lending rose from nearly £5 million in 1965 to just over £17 million in 1972.  This growth was partly the result of two pieces of legislation.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, increased the authorised share capital of the ACC, raised its borrowing limit, allowed it to engage in hire purchase lending and simplified the procedures for taking land as security for loans.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1965, enabled the ACC to take deposits from the public.  ACC had up to then been funded by advances and equity from the Exchequer but, as a result of this new source of funding, ACC could expand its lending without drawing on the Exchequer.  Thereafter, with the impetus given to farming by EC membership, business expanded with increasing momentum.  New lending in the seventies peaked in 1978 at £132 million and total assets had reached £394 million by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The high interest rates which were a feature of the earlier part of this decade and the restrictions on EC market supports brought about a difficult period for agriculture.  Incomes fell and the confidence of farmers was eroded.  The ACC, being dependent on agriculture, also suffered. New lending business fell to a low of £85 million in 1983.  While it has increased again, reaching £162 million in 1986, this increase has been accounted for by new business in the corporate food processing sector and is not due to a recovery in the demand for credit by farmers.  The development of the agri-business side of its activities was the result of a commendable effort to lessen its <Col N="225" /> dependence on farmer lending and to give a better balance to its loans portfolio.</P>
    <P>High interest rates and CAP restrictions which had reduced demand for credit by farmers also affected the ability of many farmers to meet their loan repayments. This, in turn, led to a need for increased provisions against bad debts and these provision adversely affected the corporation's profitability.  The bad weather of 1985 and 1986 with its serious effect on farm incomes added to the difficulties farmers had in repaying loans. The need for increased profitability for the ACC is indeed the principal reason behind the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware from the annual reports and accounts which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, ACC's reported profits in recent years have been modest.  The results for 1987 are not yet available as the audit of the accounts is not yet completed. The outcome for 1987 depends on the level of bad debt provisions but preliminary indications suggest that there will be insufficient profits earned by the corporation to absorb these in full. ACC's experience in this area is not unique.  Indeed, it is the norm.  Banks both in Ireland and abroad have reported in recent years substantial additional provisions against their farmer loan books. Having regard to the experience of other financial institutions it is not surprising that ACC may experience a loss in 1987 bearing in mind the farm income situation, the adverse weather of 1985 and 1986 and the fact that it is a single sector bank.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline the main provisions in the Bill.  First, it is proposed that ACC should be empowered to lend to the non-agricultural area.  Secondly, it is proposed to increase from £20 million to £35 million the statutory limit on ACC's share capital.  Finally, it is proposed to increase from £10 million to £25 million the limit on the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.  I will now give some more detail on each of these provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> Section 2 of the Bill is divided into two parts, the first of which sets out the banking activities in which the ACC may engage on a universal basis.  I wish to draw particular attention to the fact that these banking activities must be for such purposes as are determined by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank and are subject to such conditions as the Minister considers appropriate.  The provision removes the restriction, contained in section 8 (1) (a) of the 1978 Act, of ACC's lending activities to the agricultural sector.  The second part of section 2 limits the amount of non-agricultural lending which the ACC may do to 25 per cent of its business with the agricultural sector, or to such lesser amount as may be determined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the proposal to permit ACC to engage in non-agricultural lending.  New loan business will increase profitability by reducing the corporation's dependence on the agriculture sector and giving it a better spread of business.  The corporation should also become more attractive to the general public as a deposit-taking institution.  At the moment, while the general public may hold deposit accounts with the corporation, the corporation is precluded from lending outside the agricultural area.  The change whereby loans may be granted for non-agricultural purposes should encourage more people to open deposit accounts with the ACC.  This, in turn, should have the beneficial effect of reducing ACC's cost of funds and, in time, of reducing ACC's lending rates.</P>
    <P>ACC's move into non-agricultural lending is not without precedent.  The French bank, Credit Agricole and the Dutch Rabobank provide two outstanding examples of agricultural banks which have diversified while, at the same time, retaining a first-class service to their agricultural clients.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that this proposed new activity by the ACC will take some time to improve profitability.  It is fully accepted by all concerned that the ACC should move cautiously until adequate experience has been gained in this new <Col N="227" /> area.  My Department will also be monitoring the situation closely.  There are, as I indicated earlier, provisions in the Bill designed to ensure that non-agricultural lending by the corporation is strictly controlled. The power of the Minister for Finance to control the amount of non-agricultural lending within the 25 per cent limit specified in this Bill and to lay down such conditions as he considers appropriate will achieve two objectives.  First, it will ensure that ACC will remain primarily an agricultural bank and will, therefore, be in a position to meet the demand for agricultural credit.  Secondly, it will ensure that the development of non-agricultural business will be approached with due caution.</P>
    <P>I should add that the ACC board and management are very conscious of the need to approach the new lending venture with due care and, like them, I am confident that it will prove to be a successful venture.  The agriculture sector who are and will remain the corporation's core customers can only benefit from a revitalised and stronger ACC.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is contained in section 4 of the Bill.  The extension of ACC's lending powers was the original purpose behind this Bill but, because the limit on the corporation's share capital has been reached, the opportunity is being taken to propose an increase in the limit from £20 million to £35 million to take account of growth in the corporation's business since 1978 when the £20 million limit was set.</P>
    <P>The question of whether additional share capital will be provided for the corporation is a matter which will be judged in the light of the corporation's needs and the other competing demands for resources.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase from £10 million to £25 million in the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.  This increase is being proposed because the existing limit has been reached as a result of guarantees of £4 million and £6 million given in respect of the 1984 and 1986 <Col N="228" /> accounts respectively to supplement the corporation's bad debt provisions in those years.  The new limit is the present equivalent of the existing limit set in 1978.  I should mention that, to date, no Exchequer money has had to be paid on foot of these guarantees given to the ACC despite the fact that the company has been in existence since 1927.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope I have adequately explained the purposes of this Bill.  If Senators have any problems with the Bill, I shall endeavour to deal with these in my reply to the debate.  I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister at the outset for the comprehensive detailed speech which he gave in introducing this Bill to the Seanad?  Fine Gael support the provisions of the Bill which, as the Minister says, will allow the ACC to engage in lending, subject to certain restrictions, outside the agricultural sector including horticulture and fisheries. I welcome the opportunity to speak on it in the House this morning.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to pay tribute to the work which has been done by the ACC over the years.  Everybody will agree that they have rendered sterling service to the farmers and the farming sector in general.  As the Minister outlined in his speech the corporation were established in 1927, specifically to cater for the long term credit needs of agriculture at a time when such credit was not readily forthcoming from the commercial lending sector.  For many years the corporation had a modest profile and that, of course, was in line with the virtual stagnation of the agricultural industry and an almost historic reluctance on the part of farmers to borrow in what was a most uncertain climate &mdash; both actual climate and commercial climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things changed with our entry into the EC and a general economic improvement changed the situation quite dramatically. Farmers were encouraged to develop and expand, to borrow in order to do so. The services of the ACC were greatly publicised and availed of by progressive farmers.  District offices were established <Col N="229" /> all over the country and were staffed with graduates in agriculture, specifically so that they could give specialist advice to those wishing to borrow from the ACC. In that period of time agriculture fared well.  Individual farmers prospered and, as a consequent spin-off, the entire economy of the country benefited.  We all remember that era with a certain nostalgia because things have changed so dramatically for the worse since then.</P>
    <P>In recent years the position has altered considerably.  Farming has declined.  In particular over the past five years there has been a marked disimprovement.  Currently farmers are feeling the squeeze. Many of them bitterly regret the halycon days and the scale and extent of their borrowing as they face a mounting burden of debt and pressure from hitherto benign sources of credit.  The ACC and the commercial banks were equally caught on the hop by this downturn in the agricultural scene.  Land prices soared and then they plummeted dramatically. The weather for a two year period was particularly bad &mdash; indeed it was atrocious &mdash; and there was a general economic decline.  High interest rates prevailed and the Common Agricultural Policy imposed restrictions which had been undreamt of in earlier years.  Many farmers faced receivership and farms which had been in family ownership for generations were put on the market.  It was all very sad.  Many people lived to regret bitterly the prophecies of bright economic futures which they had bought from over-optimistic advisers.</P>
    <P>In saying all this I realise that hindsight is a most exact science and it is very easy for all of us to engage in that sort of review of events.  I have had dealings, as I expect most of the Members of this House have, with farmers who have been caught in this plight.  One wonders if, in some instances, banks over-reacted and moved too swiftly when it might not have been absolutely necessary to come down on them with such rigour and vigour.  One is tempted to ask if it is moral to be flaithiúlach or generous in the good times and to withdraw support and finance peremptorily when the going gets rough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> I suppose that is a subject for another debate and morality in this country does not tend to hinge around financial matters. It is more usually seen in the context of subjects dealing with human sexuality. I question the degree to which the ACC and the other lending agencies exhibit the necessary flexibility and adaptability to cope with the new scenario.  Perhaps greater emphasis should be placed on restructuring loans and new interest rates and allowing repayments to be made over a longer period of time.</P>
    <P>However, to return to the Bill before us today, I welcome the new proposals to enable the ACC to extend and develop into the non-farming areas.  It makes sense that if the agri-sector is not profitable at the moment it should be possible to diversify into more profitable areas &mdash; the Minister spelled that out.  I also like the fact that the Minister underlined that there will be a certain caution in relation to the non-agricultural areas in which the ACC will involve themselves.  I am also pleased to see that the Minister, in consultation with the Central Bank, will retain control over the activities of the ACC.  That is as it should be.  Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying to the Second Stage of the debate here in the House, would indicate the areas which he feels would be important, in other words where he sees the ACC spreading their wings, into which sectors in particular, what areas would be important and what areas he would envisage would be of prime growth for the ACC.</P>
    <P>I cast my eye over the debate in the other House.  There was much concentration on the bloodstock industry arising from the Killanin Report on the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Breeding Industry. I do not propose to go over that ground again here in the debate this morning. The question was asked as to whether the asset value of bloodstock could be used as collateral against borrowing.  I wonder does the Minister envisage that the ACC will pick up the slack in this area and whether they are empowered to do so? Is land the only item that can be used as collateral or can valuable bloodstock &mdash;<Col N="231" /> many people who have bloodstock do not have land &mdash; be used as collateral?  I would welcome the Minister's clarification on this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point very well that the principal reason for bringing forward this legislation is the whole question of profitability, the need for increased profitability on the part of the ACC.  It is proposed to increase from £20 million to £35 million the statutory limit on ACC's share capital.  Finally, it is proposed to increase from £10 million to £25 million the limit on the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I wish the ACC well in their new fields of activity.  I am happy that the Minister will ensure that with a 25 per cent limit in the area of non-agricultural lending the needs of ACC's core customers &mdash; the farmers of Ireland &mdash; will be met and will in no way be eroded by this measure. Rather, by the increased profitability of the ACC the needs of the core customers will be enhanced and secured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before us.  In particular I welcome the provision which will allow the ACC to lend in areas outside of agriculture.  The expansion, the range, the size of the lending activities, the new type of personnel and the new type of client the ACC will now be dealing with are to be welcomed.  I have no doubt that the ACC will be able to demonstrate not only their commitment to the agriculture sector but also their ability effectively to serve the new developing needs.  I wish them well in their endeavours in this new area.  For them it will be adjusting to what are really changing circumstances in a very big way. That change, not just of the ACC but for other financial institutions, is likely to continue in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past it has been acknowledged generally that the ACC have had difficulties. That is common knowledge.  As a corporation they found it difficult to adapt to the changing conditions of the past ten to 20 years.  They were operating <Col N="232" /> a very narrow base in the main dealing with the buying of land and taking deposits from a particular one type client, mostly the farming people.  Certainly, it is my belief that the next decade will bring, as I said earlier, further change.  It is common knowledge to all of us who understand and know the financial sector of today that it is being heralded already in the building society sector and in other financial sectors.  The whole situation of banks, building societies and financial services institutions in this country has changed and will continue to change over the next few years.  It would be very wrong indeed, and almost inconceivable, if the ACC were left behind in this now changing financial world we live in.  For example, in the building society movement the greatest demand from the building society customers &mdash; that is once the industry is deregulated under the forthcoming building society legislation &mdash; will be to get books, money transmission and foreign exchange services.  ACC cannot afford to be left behind.  They must restructure and come in line with the other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker I would very much like to congratulate the indoor and outdoor staff and the directors of the ACC.  The Minister has given us an excellent background to the ACC and I certainly would like to pay tribute to them for the work they have done over the years.  The reality is that when it was impossible for farmers to get credit from the main lending agencies the ACC clearly filled that gap in the financial markets and provided the credit which allowed farmings to expand.</P>
    <P>This was necessary at the time and it clearly benefited not only the individual farmers but agriculture in general and in time, or course, the whole economy of this country.  In the meantime, as other speakers I am sure will also mention, I appreciate that as a result of what has happened and the difficulties that have occurred, farming is no longer &mdash; and the Minister has touched on this &mdash; the profitable activitity it was in the late seventies and the early eighties.  There <Col N="233" /> has clearly been a downturn in profitability. As the Minister again pointed out, 1985 and 1986 were two years of extreme bad weather.  There is clearly a decline in land values.  You have this combination of the items I have referred to, bad weather and lack of profitability and perhaps a lack of confidence also, and this has given rise to problems of arrears and problems of bad debts.</P>
    <P>In the late seventies when land prices rocketed &mdash; and indeed there is no doubt that they did rocket because at that time agricultural land was selling for £3,000 or more per acre &mdash; the motto clearly seemed to be &ldquo;Buy land at any price&rdquo;. Money was freely available.  Whether it was from the ACC, or from the banks, or from other financial institutions, it was there.  The availability of money, if you like, has probably caused some of the problems of today.  In the meantime, land values have declined drastically and of course this has added to the problems of arrears and problems of bad debts and the problems generally ACC find themselves faced with today.  It is not just ACC.  The same problem extends to other banking institutions in so far as they too, as I mentioned earlier, provided money for land purchases at prices which in retrospect seem to be exorbitant and now we have the problem of bad debts.</P>
    <P>This question &mdash; it was touched on by Senator Bulbulia &mdash; of arrears and bad debts generally meant that the ACC had to adopt tough measures, no tougher I believe than those of any other financial institution.  They certainly were prepared to meet the customer and to iron out his problems and, indeed, it is generally accepted that in this difficult time there is a tightening up on payment of arrears all over whether it be in banking or financial institutions, taxation or whatever. The whole matter of bad debts is probably the biggest source of problems for the financial institutions of today. Certainly it will continue for a few years.</P>
    <P>Going back to the Bill and to the provisions of the Bill, I am totally in favour of the fact that this very important farmers' bank, ACC, should be allowed to expand and to extend their activities.  I am not <Col N="234" /> against investment in the agri-business.  I am not against the ACC extending their activities as they see fit in this changing financial world.  I am amazed that there should be any suggested dilution, if you like, of their activities and that other political parties should in any way oppose what is being suggested in this Bill.  On the contrary we should give them every encouragement, every help to allow them to proceed and to take their rightful place in the financial market of this country.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Bulbulia I, too, would not like to see the ACC withdrawing from farming and going purely into the other aspects of their activities, forgetting that they are first and foremost the farmers' bank.  That is what they were set up as: that is what they should remain as.  At the same time, they should be allowed the opportunity to move into other areas, and, as the Minister said, there is evidence in other parts of the world to suggest that agricultural banks have diversified, at the same time retaining a first-class service to their farming clients. That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Bill has been to allow the ACC to lend in other non-agricultural areas.  The Minister has set it out quite clearly.  First, he has proposed that the ACC should be empowered to lend to non-agricultural areas.  It is proposed to increase from £20 million to £35 million the statutory limit on ACC share capital.  Finally, it is proposed to increase from £10 million to £25 million the limit on the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses.</P>
    <P>To me they are all admirable and all very appropriate aspirations at this point of time in the history of the company. This extension which the ACC are now getting has long been sought by the staff of ACC &mdash; and very understandably &mdash; so as to allow them to compete with other financial institutions for deposits and for loans.  The fact of life in this country, and I am sure in other countries, is that people tend to open share accounts or deposit accounts with institutions which might eventually be of benefit to them, which might eventually get then a mortgage, if <Col N="235" /> that is what they want.  With the land sales market very quiet over the past few years for reasons that we all know, ACC have suffered on the accounts that I have referred to, the deposits and the loans. They have suffered in comparison with other institutions.  Now they are brought on to more level ground and hopefully for them matters will improve.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very welcome.  It is right and proper that what is proposed in the Bill should be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again I congratulate the staff and directors of the ACC on the work they have done over the years and I wish then well in their new ventures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the fairly unanimous approval which has been given to this Bill.  I understand the reasons why both the Government and the Opposition are happy to see it go through fairly quickly and, indeed, I shall not delay it.  I do not think it is a good Bill.  What is contains is far too little and far too late.  It seems obvious to me that this Bill is a result of the performance of the ACC in 1987.  Although we have not got the audited accounts for 1987, the Minister has given us a fair indication that the ACC will come up with a loss in 1987.  How substantial that loss will be I do not know.  As a result of their seeing that a loss is coming, they have to do something about it.  It would have been far preferable if this Government or the previous one had some sort of philosophy for ACC and had decided that this Bill was to be introduced but in a far more magnified form in terms of vision, one year, two years or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill says that lending to farmers is not making money; we had better do something about it so we will let them lend to somebody else and see if they make money that way.  It is really quite simple.  It might have been wiser two or three years ago to have noticed and taken account of the moves, of the trend in the financial world, and said that ACC are not going to be able to live in isolation either; they should be able to compete on reasonable and fair, equal terms with <Col N="236" /> other banks in the private and public sector and should be allowed to go ahead on this basis.  In effect, unfortunately, what this Bill does is react to what looks like turning out to have been a disastrous year last year.  It reacts in a very small way and in a very cautious way.  I expect that we will see many more ACC Bills in the years to come as we begin to respond to the very small and minor effects of this one.</P>
    <P>I know very little about agriculture or farming but I wonder if it is necessary to have a farmers' bank at all.  I cannot see why we need an ACC, why we need a specialist farmers' bank, as such.  It seems that this is tying the hands of the bankers to a specific project, which is unfair.  The major commercial banks lend to the farming sector anyway.  Every bank I know of will lend to farmers if it is a commercial proposition.  They are competing with the ACC in their own territory, whereas the ACC cannot compete with the other commercial banks in their territory. That seems to be unfair.  It seems that it is not a commercial proposition and it also seems to me that just by extending non-agricultural lending to 20 per cent, you are not doing enough for the ACC.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the trend in financial institutions but I think it contains more hope than actual prophecy or prediction in that it hopes that, by allowing the ACC to go into 20 per cent elsewhere, in the non-agricultural sector, they will somehow make a profit.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister in his reply to give us more fundamental reasons why the ACC have not been running at a profit, certainly in the past year. If you say that the farmers cannot pay the money back because of high interest rates, to me that means it is a very bad loan, it is a very bad commercial decision on behalf of the person who lends them the money.  Every banker has to take into account the possibility that interest rates will go up when he is lending money. Were the ACC in the past in some way under pressure to give money to farmers who could not borrow money elsewhere? <Col N="237" /> In other words, were the ACC being run under special commercial criteria which do not apply elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Were they being kinder and softer to the farmers or were they not?  If so, they were doing them no favours because what has happened &mdash; it is quite obvious from the Minister's speech and from the accounts &mdash; is that they were lending money on projects and propositions which were not commercial and the individual farmers could not pay that money back.  That has landed the Government in trouble, the ACC in trouble and the farmers themselves in trouble.  It has done no favours.  What I would like to know is whether in the future there will be any guidelines given to the ACC for lending to farmers, whether the ACC are constantly under pressure to make loans to farmers willy-nilly, regardless of commercial terms, or whether there will be lending guidelines set for them.</P>
    <P>Finally, the extent of the ACC's new lending activities apparently is to be decided by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  This seems an absolutely appalling idea.  We are saying: &ldquo;You can lend to the non-agricultural sector but you have no freedom in that particular lending.  Every time you want to make a loan&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know if this applies to every specific loan &mdash;&ldquo;every time you want to branch into a new sector, you will have to consult with the Minister and the Central Bank&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Central Bank in this case can be nothing but an obstruction because they would not be there in the Bill unless they were to be an obstruction. It appears that this 20 per cent will be very limited.  It will be subject to bureaucratic, ministerial and Central Bank scrutiny and therefore obstruction and so the ACC, once again, will be lending to another sector but only with the approval of these two people or institutions and, once again, will be lending and competing on unfair terms with the other banks.</P>
    <P>The logic of this Bill should have been to open the ACC out totally wide. Senator Fallon touched on it when he said we are going to have a Bill for the building societies to deregulate them, to <Col N="238" /> allow them to move into the banking sector later this year, probably to go into insurance and into all sorts of other financial areas.  It would appear to me that if we are going to do this with other institutions the logic is not just to say, we will try 20 per cent and see if that works, because we are not making any money. What we have got to do is make an ideological and philosophical and serious decision that these types of semi-State banks will be allowed to compete in the private sector on equal terms.  This Bill does not do this.  This is purely a piecemeal measure and will be an ineffective Bill because no decisions are being made in it.  It is purely a Bill which rests upon hope to plug a hole that exists at the moment.  Unfortunately I cannot approve of it because I think the Minister will be back with a similar Bill in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to welcome this Bill before us today.  It is a new departure and it will certainly be of benefit to the borrowing public and, indeed, to the ACC also.  The Agriculture Credit Act of 1978 is the principal legislation governing the operations of the ACC.  It deals, amongst other things, with the various charges which may be made not just by the ACC but by other banks on land and other property as security for loans.  Under this Act, the ACC are limited to lending for the benefit of agriculture, horticulture and fisheries. The legislation now before the House will empower the ACC to lend in the non-agricultural area and so broaden the scope of their activities.  This is good for the ACC themselves and it will also create competition between the lending institutions who are competing in this area.  This can only be good for the people who are borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the corporation were established in 1927 they have provided a specialised credit service for agriculture.  Their advice and services have been sought by countless farmers who could not have developed their enterprise without the assistance of the ACC.  In the early years there was, of course, a reluctance on the <Col N="239" /> part of farmers to borrow mainly because of the poor profit in agriculture. However, as the years rolled on and the agricultural economy began to improve, farmers began to realise that, if they were to avail of the improved prospects now appearing on the horizon, they had to borrow to develop their farms, to improve their stocking rate, to provide housing for cattle, to carry out drainage etc and in many cases to buy those extra few acres of land to ensure viability in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>During all tht time the farmers of Ireland found the ACC most helpful and sympathetic to their cause.  Our entry into the EC opened up tremendous opportunities for Irish agriculture.  For the first time ever farmers did not have to depend on the British market.  They could sell their produce to mainland Europe and compete favourably with their European counterparts.  In the meantime the ACC were promoting themselves successfully as a lending agency and opened up a network of offices throughout the country. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1965 enabled them to take deposits from the public.  This new source of funding enabled them to expand their lending without drawing on the Exchequer.  As a result, annual lending grew from £4.5 million in 1965 to £17.5 million in 1972. This came to £132 million in 1978.  That year also the ACC's total assets stood at £394 million having increased from £3.7 million in 1961 &mdash; a remarkable success story by any standards.</P>
    <P>Of course, it has not been all plain sailing for the ACC and, like all lending institutions, they have had their problems in the eighties.  The decline of income and confidence within the agriculture sector resulted in a decline in demand for credit by farmers and also created difficulties with loan repayments.  This, in turn, meant that the corporation had to make increased provision against bad debts which in turn affected their profitability. In spite of that, their sympathy for and understanding of farmers who found themselves in difficulties because of over-borrowing must be acknowledged and <Col N="240" /> commended.  They made every effort, by restructuring loans etc., to tide farmers over a very difficult period.  There are still many farmers in serious trouble but I do not think it can ever be said that the Agricultural Credit Corporation used bully-boy tactics to force farmers to repay loans.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House increases from £10 million to £25 million the limit on the amount of loans in respect of which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the corporation against losses. This gives some indication of the difficulties the ACC have been experiencing. The other important change introduced in the Bill is the provision allowing the ACC to move into the non-agricultural area.  This is opening up a whole new area to the corporation and is, of course, keeping in line with other European lending agencies.  It will not, as the Minister rightly states, transform the ACC's profitability overnight.  It will in time make them more competitive and they should be more attractive to investors. However, I want to express a note of caution.</P>
    <P>The ACC are now entering a whole new scenario.  There are many quagmires out there, financial quagmires.  Businesses are coming and going overnight and the ACC will be competing with other more experienced banking agencies. However, the fact that the Minister for Finance will have power not only to control the amount of non-agricultural lending within the 25 per cent limit specified in the Bill, but also to lay down such conditions as he considers appropriate, will provide an adequate safeguard to ensure that ACC will always be in a position to meet the demands of agricultural credit.  It is very important that they should be always there to give their help and services to the agricultural sector because they are the people, more than any other lending institution, who understand the problems faced by the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>All the other financial institutions have changed over the years to meet the demands of the borrowing public.  It would be wrong to keep the ACC in <Col N="241" /> a strait jacket and not give them the opportunity to compete in the non-agricultural area.  For that reason this Bill before us today is very appropriate.  I see it as a great challenge to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and I feel they will meet that challenge head on.  It will create better morale within the staff of the ACC themselves, a staff who, over the past few years in particular in line with all the other institutions, have seen many of their members made redundant because of the contraction in the lending market. This is opening up a whole new area to them.  I feel they will meet that challenge head on and that it will be good for them and for the general public who will be using their services also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the concept of this Bill.  It is taking the opportunity to address the problem of the corporation's existing share capital target having been reached and it offers the opportunity to increase from £20 million £35 million the limitation placed on it by previous Acts. It also raises from £10 million to £25 million the amount of loans that will be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance in the event of difficult decisions having to be reached in the future.  That is why I fail to understand Senator Ross's reservations. He is an expert in the area of financial institutions but he is also to the right of most of my thinking in economic areas.  It amazes me that he has reservations about the Minister for Finance having overall regard to the national Exchequer when it comes to competition in private financing institutions.  In other words, he has forgotten that the ACC are a State bank, or a bank with State guarantee, set up under an Act of Parliament for a specific purpose which, from all our knowledge and experience, has been to a large extent successful in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the ACC are State sponsored and because the State considered in their wisdom in the older days that there should be a State banking system specifically for agriculture, there is nothing wrong with the Houses of the Oireachtas, and indeed the Minister, having access to <Col N="242" /> information on their accounts and their books and also having an overall view.  I fail to understand why Senator Ross has a reservation in that area because he usually expresses the view that we should be extremely careful about State funds going to anybody and that all funding should come from the private sector.  He is almost contradictory in his attitude to the Bill today and I am surprised at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe he has other financial knowledge at his disposal of which we are unaware.  The Bill represents a reverse procedure from what has happened in the Department of the Environment, which up to now had been a lending agency for specific categories of people for house purchase, house reconstruction and a whole lot of other areas benefiting people in a certain income category.  Up to now the Department of the Environment, the Minister, county councils and corporations were in a position to make decisions about lending to people.  The Minister decided with the financial istitutions before Christmas that, before councils could get into this area, the applicant would have to go through the private institutions &mdash; banks and building societies &mdash; and be rejected and have the trauma of rejection in writing. This Bill is a step in the opposite direction.  It liberalises lending by the State to a particular sector and I hope the Minister for the Environment will take a lesson from the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who today is doing the reverse and I wish them success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we decided to have a lending institution which dealt specifically with farming was the importance of the farming sector's contribution to the overall national economy, the amounts of money they generate through our export into the European Community, the employment factor and the contribution they make in the area of milk assembly. The State assisted farmers at producer level and at farm gate level because they <Col N="243" /> were special.  They were special in their contribution to the State but they were also special in their risks because, unlike other financial institutions, or other enterprises, farming is subjected to the most extraordinary risks over and above the normal risks in any industry.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest risks that cannot be controlled or determined in advance is the weather.  It is important that the farming sector should have access to credit with risks like that which cannot be underwritten easily, which cannot be insured against and cannot be predetermined. The disastrous summers of 1985 and 1986 are an example of how family farms can be wiped out as a result of weather which by its very nature brought people into difficulties not only with the commercial banks but with the ACC.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Senator Hussey said there were no cases of strong arm tactics used by the ACC.  There were cases and it is public knowledge that they went through the courts and procedures where by the ACC &mdash; by the restrictions we placed on them in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; were forced to make farmers redeem their loans.  Difficult and unpopular decisions were taken because the land of Ireland was always considered to be a treasure that could not be acquired, distributed or disposed of by cheque books.  It is a very important commodity. When you start putting people under pressure to dispose of their land for economic reasons the people of an area get disturbed, upset and distressed and they picket to show solidarity with one another in rural Ireland.  It is a good thing that people rally round others when in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The ACC were not exempt from putting people under pressure and we probably wrote the regulations and the rules for them to be strict in cases where there was non-repayment of loans.  From that point of view they have tried to act within the regulations laid down on a commercial basis.  It has not always been easy for them because of the risk factor involved in the area they were designed to <Col N="244" /> assist.  If we could eliminate the weather factor &mdash; which all of us say is the greatest risk in farming &mdash; and if the farmers had good weather all the time there would be no problem with farm production because, above all sectors in this country, they work the hardest.  They work the longest hours.  They get the least return on their capital investment.  They get the least return in credit or in credence from any other sector of the community.  Many of us are very quick to criticise them without realising the difficulties and the conditions under which they work.  If you add those difficulties to the difficulties of the EC, what its future has to offer to farming, the restrictions it has now put on the areas of production, whether it is in milk, meat or cereals, you realise that this sector will be contracting because they will be unable to produce the commodities which traditionally they have been able to produce more efficiently than people in most other countries. Because people in other countries were able to evade taxes and use imported cereals in increasing their production, the Irish farmers were at a distinct disadvantage over the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>I hope that, following the EC submission on the future price structure, the MCAs and the border taxes, the Minister will be successful in his negotiations.  If not, farming will take another backward step.  One of the reasons this country joined the European Community was to enjoy the benefits that were to accrue to agriculture.  Considerable credits have accrued to agriculture but they are becoming more difficult to obtain.  The gravy train has been derailed by the major net contributors to the Community.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is a special area of risk but it is important for us to realise its economic contribution to the country. We should have a special place for farmers in the area of State lending.  That is why I welcome what the Minister is trying to do, to increase their limit of the corporation's share capital.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental part of the Bill, which is the innovative part, is that the ACC are now extending their lending to <Col N="245" /> other areas.  I think this is a good idea.  I see nothing wrong with a bank which is national in its outlook &mdash; it is agriculturally biased if you like, which we all welcome &mdash; making itself available to other borrowers.  If the private sector financial institutions are worried about that, then so be it.  The financial banking institutions make colossal profits in this country the more competition, particularly from the State sector, is to be welcomed. I have reservations as to why there was a limit of 20 per cent imposed by the Minister on making available the funds invested in Ireland for use by people in Ireland.  Obviously they would not have access to it unless it was for productive purposes in some area or another.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are extending the Agricultural Credit Corporation's remit not only in investments but in lending. Over the past number of years, through a difficult period, when all financial institutions were trying to come to grips with inflation and lending rates and were trying to compete with the European Investment Bank and other institutions, often at a disadvantageous level, they convinced the ordinary investor that the ACC had as much to offer as any other private institution, and at times had much better terms to offer.  I think that was appropriate.  In the Bill before us today, the Minister is ensuring that not alone will awareness be heightened in people's minds that they can invest with the ACC, with additional financial backing from the State, but that they also can borrow from the ACC.  That is why I am surprised the Minister in bringing in this innovation did not decide that the ACC was no longer the proper name for this new corporation.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not suggest, or had he or his advisers not considered, defining what is, a national and agricultural credit corporation so that it would be available to other sections of the community.  That would possibly do more to convince people that what the Minister is doing today is the right thing and it would also convince people who have money to invest that that was the <Col N="246" /> right thing to do if we could convince them that it is no longer specifically designed for agriculture.  I would like to retain the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in any new name the Minister might consider.  It is important for the farming sector to know they have a place to which to turn.</P>
    <P>Basically, farmers are conservative and have not borrowed in the past unless they got advice to do so; much of that advice was given by the national agencies.  It is unfortunate, because of the changing times, that the advice given in all good faith, which was correct at the time, transpired to be disastrous afterwards.  Farmers believed in the advice they got and borrowed on the information and advice given to them.  That was submitted to the ACC as evidence of their efforts to increase production, to improve the status of their herd or to capitalise on buildings or other assembly units on farms.  Farmers are so conservative that at times even when they had money invested &mdash; because they like to have a nest egg for the rainy day &mdash; they borrowed and actually lost money in the process because of their conservative outlook.</P>
    <P>We cannot change that philosophy overnight.  They borrowed while they had money invested and the banks and other institutions made money out of this conservatism. Perhaps it was a good thing, and if everybody was conservative in their attitudes some of the problems we have today, about which the Government keeps reminding me, might not be there. God only knows.  We can only do our best each day.  I hope we will work our way through this economic crisis, that all of us, at all times, will have regard to the correct priorities and that we will not forget the people who are unable to help themselves in this whole process.</P>
    <P>I see nothing ideologically wrong with this Bill.  There is nothing politically wrong with it; there is nothing legislatively wrong with it.  The Minister is being a little over-careful if anything. Nevertheles, I would like if he would consider the possibility of changing the name so that people can understand that what we are doing is opening up the ACC <Col N="247" /> not only to investors but to lenders as well.  On behalf of my party I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Agricultural Credit Bill, 1987.  I want to take the opportunity to give some views on where I think the focus of attention of lending from the ACC should be operating for the benefit of farming and the benefit of our economy in the years ahead.  I support the move to give powers to the ACC to lend in other areas rather than being a single sector bank as it has been since its formation.  It is important for the ACC and its financial strength that it do so because we are all aware of the decline in the margins of income in the farming community over the past seven or eight years.  The exposure of the ACC in its portfolio and in its financial operations has been difficult.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the background against which the improvement in investment took place in the seventies.  With our entry into the European Community we had the ability to take up extra financial aids given to the farming community and the guaranteed prices that were available to them through the intervention pricing system in the EC.  This allowed many farmers, for the first time ever in the history of our young State, to carry out much needed improvements in their land, in their farm buildings, in their farm structure and indeed in their living conditions. The enormous hardship the farming community experienced down through the years, since our independence, in coming to grips with difficult markets for agricultural produce, differences in the emphasis by the State in respect of changing from one variety of enterprise to another is not well known or appreciated.  It was only in the seventies with the guaranteed markets and floor prices for our products that the first decent level of existence was given to the agricultural community to bring about higher living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many farmers took advantage of the improved economic climate and the improved confidence in agriculture, <Col N="248" /> in the middle and late seventies.  The ACC and other financial institutions felt &mdash; and the farmers themselves felt &mdash; there would never be a poor day again. The euphoria that permeated through rural Ireland at that time often meant that when land sales were taking place in the local community farmers went to the ACC and to the banks for money to acquire greater amounts of property or to make their holdings more viable and, in their eyes, more economical.</P>
    <P>In the late seventies and early eighties land values escalated out of all economic proportion and out of proportion to the direct income the agricultural community was likely to have to repay those loans.  It was a bitter experience for many farmers and a lesson they will find very difficult to forget when they seek to draw up plans and new proposals for the development of their farms in the years ahead.  It will take many years &mdash; perhaps a generation &mdash; for the agricultural community, who are basically a very conservative community when it comes to finance, to forget the experiences they went through in that difficult time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are still many farmers today who are caught in a tremendous grip by the financial institutions and who find that the light at the end of the tunnel may not be visible to enable them to get out of the existing difficulty in which they find themselves. The problems which they are now experiencing are due to factors outside their control and which were not foreseen at the time they obtained their loans from the ACC.  Interest rates went through the roof.  They doubled in two years with the result that repayments on those loans, also doubled.  Farmers who had budgeted to make their loan repayments at a particular level of interest were not able to meet the interest on the interest a few years afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in recent times all the financial institutions, including the ACC, have recognised that there is no merit in pursuing the strong arm tactics that were used, as Senator Hussey is well aware but he did not think it appropriate to mention it in this debate.  We should recognise <Col N="249" /> that all financial institutions who, in their day to day operation have to retrieve the outstanding loans made to any sector of the community, and the ACC in particular because of their exposure to one sector of the community, were in a very difficult position in trying to retrieve the money they lent.</P>
    <P>I noticed very little improvement in the provision for bad debts in the ACC's reports in recent times.  In the 1987 report &mdash; and the Minister referred to this &mdash; there is very little joy for the ACC in relation to the amount of money provided for bad debts caused by bad weather conditions in 1985 and 1986 and the limits on agricultural production imposed by the EC particularly in the dairy sector.  All of these factors will lead to a difficult time for the ACC in the immediate years ahead.  The ACC need the extra exposure to non-farming activity to balance the portfolio of loans and financial dispositions over the next few years.</P>
    <P>There are one or two areas I would like to refer to in particular.  Senator Ferris referred to the image of the ACC.  The image of the ACC is a financial institution and catering only for the agricultural community.  A large scale advertising campaign has been undertaken by the ACC to correct this image that the ACC are unfairly not seen by non-farming people as a place in which to place their money on deposit.  Senator Ferris is correct in stating that there is a need for a change in the name of this organisation so that it will be seen by the general public as an institution that can cater for non-farming activities and non-agricultural communities.  The ACC are a State organisation and it is in the best interests of the State to consider whatever changes are necessary to protect their image on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the attitude of the ACC and other financial institutions and the Department of Agriculture and Food and strong arm tactics being used in relation to the clawback from the rescue package scheme of 1982. As the Minister is aware, a number of farmers got into financial difficulties and <Col N="250" /> were the beneficiaries of a scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance between 1982 and 1986.  This formed the basis of a low interest subsidy over a period of years which gave farmers an opportunity to get back on the rails and to make their repayments to their financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I understand that approximately 600 farmers have been deemed by the Department of Agriculture and Food as ineligible for the 1982-86 scheme.  After the benefits have accrued to the farmers and the ACC or the banks, the Department now wish to recoup that money at this late stage when it was their officials, and the financial institutions involved, who sanctioned the application for the reduced interest scheme in 1982.  I ask the Minister to use his influence with the Department of Agriculture and Food and come up with a reasonable solution to this problem which is causing great anxiety to a small number of progressive farmers at present.  It is not fair to ask the agricultural community, the beneficiaries of this scheme &mdash; which was essential for their viability; otherwise they might have gone into receivership or liquidation &mdash; to pay up to £20,000 or £30,000 to the ACC or to the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the operation of the Euro currency loans which have been in existence since September 1986.  This was an important development for this country in that the Department of Finance sought the benefit of some of the low interest Euro currency loans in the European Community.  They borrowed through international currencies to benefit the agricultural community. I want to assure the Minister that this has made an enormous impact and has given tremendous confidence to the farming community because they have now a cheap source of finance for working capital at a lower rate of interest for many of the important developments they wish to proceed with.</P>
    <P>If a farmer has a loan with the ACC and has another loan with the Bank of Ireland, or any other bank, he will not <Col N="251" /> be in a position to benefit from a Euro currency loan from both financial institutions. In other words, he can only get the benefit of the Euro currency low interest loan up to £50,000 maximum from either the ACC or a commercial bank.  It would give a great service to many farmers and solve many of their financial difficulties if they were in a position to get the maximum Euro currency loans from both the ACC and the commercial banks rather than with either one only as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the greatest crisis facing the country in relation to agriculture in particular is the enormous depletion of our national herd.  Over the past three years the country has suffered a reduction in the herd because of the superlevy, as a result of which 100,000 female animals have been slaughtered.  It is projected by ACOT and other reputable bodies that over the next three years we will lose 200,000 more female animals.  This is going to sap the necessary energy out of the agricultural community, the raw material essential to meat processing, that is essential for employment and, above all, which is essential to maintain families on the land.</P>
    <P>Radical measures are now needed in order to boost the national herd.  Whatever is necessary should be done in order to ensure that we plan now for an increase in the national herd, rather than pumping money into meat factories which already have over-capacity in terms of the available raw materials.  It does not make economic sense for the State or for the Exchequer to put money, in the form of grants or favourable loans, into the meat processing sector at a time when the meat factories cannot get the necessary animals to fill their requirements on a daily or weekly basis.  Farmers are unable to supply the markets.  From speaking to a number of purchasing agents for meat factories in the south east, I can assure you that cattle are so scarce, the factories will have to close for most of the year. <Col N="252" /> They are, unfortunately, put in the position of having to use the social welfare system on a three-day week basis to prop up the wage bill for these factories.  This is also something I find disturbing.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation, by the extension of the powers we are giving them here today, are a vehicle for the farming community and all interested groups in agriculture who are interested in the future development of our agricultural industry.  The ACC should be to the forefront in providing the necessary loans in order to get the national herd boosted once more, which would provide extra exports, extra family farm incomes and extra employment in the agricultural industry.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Treacy to lend his support to whatever measures the Minister for Agriculture and Food might bring into operation, so that the ACC will be seen to assist in whatever way possible to fulfil the obligations and the objectives set out by the Minister.  It is a scandal that we have reached the stage where we have to consider the importation of calves.  Whether it is a revamped more liberal suckler herd scheme that is required it is essential that we do whatever is necessary and that we plan immediately at the eleventh hour to boost the objectives I spoke about.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's intentions in relation to this Bill.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation have served the agriculture community by and large fairly well.  While one could eulogise about the difficulties that the ACC experienced with their portfolio in the late seventies and early eighties, and are still experiencing, to a lesser degree by and large the ACC have certainly given good service to the farming community.  The ACC can resolve the bad debts if they just treat the farmer client with a bit of sensitivity, with some co-operation between the financial institution and the farmer, these difficulties which we now see can be overcome. I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Senators who have contributed very positively to the Bill before the <Col N="253" /> House.  It is indicative of the attitude here that people can see the merits and the reason a Bill like this should be brought before this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia opened the debate and referred to the need for the restructuring of loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This is being done on a continuous basis by the ACC, where the customer can make the case for it and where the ACC and their executives are satisfied that the person will be able to respond to the new restructured situation. The Senator also wished to ascertain the sectors to which the ACC would lend in the future.  The intention is that the ACC will concentrate initially on the personal lending sector.  By liberalising the opportunities for the ACC, we would expect that people from all sectors of the community, right across the board, would invest their money with the ACC, particularly in view of the great security that prevails due to the State equity.  By investing there they would then be in a position to avail of personal loans for their own personal needs in a variety of areas.  This will provide a new area of profitability for the ACC, it will also provide for new sources of deposits and further diversification by the ACC.</P>
      <P>Lending will depend on the ACC's new corporate plan which is currently being prepared.  Thereafter the housing finance area could be considered, and I am sure that the board, the executives and managers of the ACC will monitor the situation and be able to come up with proposals within that corporate plan and extend that corporate plan to avail of whatever opportunities are in the market place and to fill any niches to which they think the corporation could respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia also spoke about the bloodstock industry and said that consideration should be given to having bloodstock taken as security for loan purposes. The Senator also referred to the Killanin commission report.  The recommendations in that report relating to the use of bloodstock as security for loans raise complex, legal and administrative issues.  For example, who would be responsible in the event of error in the <Col N="254" /> register which would record ownership and charges against the ownership?  In view of the high values of bloodstock this is a significant issue.  Another issue is how to establish a watertight system of identification of horses on the register. The suitability of the existing passport system used by the Turf Club for the purpose of the register would have to be established and the need to give that system legal status would have to be clarified. Yet another issue is what arrangements should be made at bloodstock auctions to avoid the sale of an animal which is subject to charges.  These and other issues are being examined inter-departmentally. When this examination is completed the Government will consider sympathetically bringing forward any necessary legislative amendments to provide the opportunity for all financial institutions to consider bloodstock as security.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sean Fallon when he says that the ACC should not withdraw from being a farmers' bank.  The purpose of the 25 per cent limit &mdash; this was referred to also by Senator Ferris &mdash; is to prevent the ACC moving away from agriculture.  The Government want to create the flexibility and the versatility and the diversification opportunities for the corporation, but they still want them to have a primary role in agricultural lending and in developing the agricultural industry and further enhancing the opportunities for farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross, in a wide ranging speech, said that this was too little, too late and questioned the reasons for having a farmers' bank at all.  The fact that we have brought in the Bill shows that the Government's attitude is that no institution should be curtailed in their activities and that rather then being purely a farmers' bank and a bamk or a corporation that enjoy State equity, with that type of security they should be able to attract investment right across the board and in return should be able to consider lending the invested money in a variety of areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House and <Col N="255" /> in particular Senator Ross that this Bill was introduced in the Dáil five months ago, long before it could be known the exact position of the accounts of the Agricultural Credit Corporation for 1987.  It was with the parliamentary draftsman for some time prior to that, so this confirms the period the Bill was under consideration by Government.  There is less need for a farmers' bank now than in the past.  Other banks were most reluctant to lend to agriculture 60 years ago.  That is no longer the case.  It is for this reason, among others, that we are proposing that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be allowed to lend outside of agriculture. The ACC's profitability is modest because of factors which I have already outlined in my introductory speech; high interest rates, Common Agricultural Policy restrictions and other difficulties in the agricultural environment.</P>
    <P>The other banks were affected by these factors also but they had non-agricultural and business options to offset the difficulties in agriculture.  Consequently, they were able to maintain their profitability despite the fact that they encountered the same difficulties in the same areas of financial lending as the ACC.  Senator Ross also asked whether there were guidelines for the ACC lending to farmers.  I would like to inform the House that loan assessment criteria is a matter for the board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  From time to time the Minister for Finance provides broad guidelines for lending to agriculture in line with Government policy for the sector and in line with the needs of the agricultural sector, which Senator Hogan referred to.  I will be responding to that later.  However, there is no question of the ACC being told by the Minister for Finance or by the Government that they must lend where credit-worthiness is in doubt.  That has never been the situation and never could be the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also questioned why there should be ministerial and Central Bank supervision.  I think all financial legislation right across the board in every <Col N="256" /> area of activity has either ministerial and Central Bank supervision or operates under directions from the Minister for Finance or regulations controlled by the Central Bank.  The ACC are a financial institution and, as a State-sponsored body, would have to be under similar type control.  The Minister for Finance is the shareholder on behalf of the State and as shareholder, he is entitled to decide how in general terms the ACC should carry out their business.  It is wise for the Minister to consult with the Central Bank because of the expertise which the Central Bank have in supervising the banking system and the desirability of co-ordinating ACC activities with those of the banking system as a whole, to ensure that there is no conflict in the financial marketplace.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Tom Hussey, spoke in a wide-ranging way about the activities of the ACC and I thank him for his contribution.  He referred to the rationalisation in the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the past few years.  I wish to reaffirm to the House that all redundancies in the ACC over the past few years were purely on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris in a very wide-ranging contribution, as usual, referred to the strong-arm tactics by the ACC and Senator Hogan referred to that also.  I do not think the ACC have used strong-arm tactics; they have used the law where necessary when they were not getting co-operation. I want to assure the House that the ACC are most willing to accommodate a farmer or farmers in genuine difficulties and they have restructured several loans over longer periods for such farmers and generally have treated farmers sympathetically.  However, where a farmer seems able to meet his repayments but simply refuses to do so the ACC would be failing in their duty to the taxpayer and also to the farmers who pay their debts if they did not take appropriate steps to recover loans in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris made a comparison between the policy of the Minister for the Environment and the decision of the Minister for Finance to bring this Bill <Col N="257" /> forward.  I would like to clarify the former while we are still debating the latter.  The State, for years through the Department of the Environment, has borrowed vast sums of money for a particular segment of our population and re-lent this money to this segment of our population over long periods at a fixed interest rate.  To make this facility available, the State has competed with the ordinary consumer in borrowing these vast amounts of money and has helped to increase interest rates by being the main borrower.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has persuaded the lending institutions to provide money for this special market segment, but where the institutions cannot accommodate people in this segment of the market the Minister for the Environment, through the local authorities, will continue to provide the loans for both house purchase, house building and home improvements.  For too long the State has over-competed with the private sector to the detriment of the consumer. As a result of this new policy, interest rates have dropped from around 15 per cent one year ago to around 9 per cent today.  I am sure Senator Ferris's constituents with fixed home loans at 14 per cent at 12.75 per cent respectively, would love to be able to avail of lower interest rates and benefit from the efforts of the Minister for Finance and Minister for the Environment in reducing interest rates to the flexible figure they are at today.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan in a wide-ranging contribution spoke about the strong-arm tactics of the ACC.  I have dealt with that already.  It is true to say that the ACC have dealt very humanely, compassionately and sympathetically with the difficulties that farmers have encountered right across the board.  If farmers are prepared to come into ACC offices to discuss their problems, to put their cards on the table, they will get a sympathetic ear and, where possible, loans will be restructured.  However, where there is a total negative response, then the ACC have a duty to the board, to their shareholder and to their good creditors, to ensure that equity and equality of treatment prevails right across the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> The Senator also spoke about the need for the State and the Government to provide an opportunity to increase our beef cow herd.  I want to assure the House that very positive and active consideration is being given to this at present by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  With the co-operation of the financial institutions and the various meat processing outlets and the agricultural organisations, I am confident that before too long a suitable new beef cow incentive scheme can be brought about in the interests of all farmers of improving the cattle numbers and of increasing our economic activity.  This would make a major contribution to the development of our economy over the next year.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an acknowledgement by the Government of the need to allow the ACC to be more flexible in their lending portfolio, to allow them to diversify and indeed to be more attractive to investors and borrowers alike, particularly in view of State equity and security being available to the corporation and their investors. This Bill is only one of a series of measures being taken by the Government to create more equality of opportunity for all the financial institutions in order that they can compete on a more level plane.  The Government have other Bills of a financial nature under consideration at this time, in particular the liberalisation of both the building societies and the Trustee Savings Banks is currently under consideration.  The end result of all of this is more credit options for the consumer, keen competition by the institutions to attract customers and, ultimately, better services and lower interest rates for the consumer.  I am sure this House would wish to facilitate this type of policy by the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 says that in this Act the Principal Act means the Agricultural Credit Act.  Has the Minister addressed himself to the possibility of changing the title to the National and Agricultural Credit Act?  This would present the image we were talking about to the ordinary investor and borrower out there that, although the corporation would be specialising predominantly in agriculture, they are not ruling out any other sector.  As a result, this would become a national as well as an agricultural credit corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Senator Ferris on his creative suggestion that the board of ACC should consider, in the light of their now extended function, changing their name to reflect that new reality.  It seems to me that the ACC will always be considered in the minds of the general public to be solely for agricultural investors if the name remains the same.  It seems to be a very worthwhile suggestion made in the course of his speech by Senator Ferris.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not respond to it.  It could very usefully be taken on board and perhaps promoted and suggested to the board of the ACC by the Minister for Finance.  I hope the Minister will respond positively to what I feel is a very useful suggestion from Senator Ferris.</P>

It is not appropriate yet that the name should be changed because we are only <Col N="260" /> making a minor change in what the company can do.  If the ACC could lend on competitive terms with the other banks and not still be lending 80 per cent to the agricultural sector, this would be appropriate. Until that happens I do not think this should come about.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  I apologise to Senator Ferris for inadvertently failing to respond to this very imaginative suggestion.  I regret that I do not think I could take it on board at this time but it should be given consideration.  Taking into account the fact that the corporation are 61 years in existence and have made a major contribution to the development of agriculture and to the development of our national economy, and now that we are proposing to liberalise the company and give them an opportunity to diversify it is something that can be considered in the future.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to allow the name to continue, to allow the corporation to proceed as we propose.  I hope that we can come back in the not too distant future with other proposals to expand the role of the ACC still further as a result of the profitable operations of the company when they move to diversification.  Perhaps at that stage, when we have had an opportunity to consider their performance as an agricultural corporation and their performance now in their new role, we could consider rechristening the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I am quite serious.  Because 75 per cent of ACC business will deal with agriculture and 25 per cent will deal with other national interests I thought it was appropriate that it should at least be considered. I hope the board of the ACC will read this debate and take on board the suggestion.  It will be in their interests if we convince them that they are now more than just an agriculturally based operation.  I know the Minister did not mean to exclude me.  He was so obsessed with the good terms being offered by <Col N="261" /> the local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector, which are being supported here by Senator Ross, that he forgot this little item about the change of name.</P>
      <P>My worry about the other aspect is that, before people can benefit from the improvement in interest rates offered by local authorities, they have to suffer the trauma and the humiliation of going to the private sector to ask them first for consideration and to be rejected in writing. The private sector interest rates are about 14½ per cent or 15½ per cent.  When they are rejected in writing they can then turn to the Minister for his better terms. I was worried about the fact that we had put that proviso in, giving priority to the private sector and that this Bill was doing the opposite, which I welcomed.  I could never understand the other change.  The Minister has explained his position and I am satisfied that the Minister for Finance has a different attitude, that the ACC are predominantly agricultural and we are not ruling out anybody else.  You do not have to be rejected by somebody in the private sector before you can borrow in the high risk area of agriculture.  I was only drawing a comparison.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has not ruled out a change of name in the future.  Of course, Senator Ross will think that is nationalisation of the banks by stealth but that would not worry me.</P>

      <P>May I refer to something which needs to be urgently clarified? I have copies of the Bill as initiated and then as passed by the Dáil.  I also have the Minister's excellent speech.  There is some problem.  Section 2 (2) limits the amount of non-agricultural lending which the ACC may do, up to 25 per cent of <Col N="262" /> their business.  In the Bill, as initiated, there was talk about 20 per cent.  The Minister's speech today refers to 20 per cent.  Would the Minister please clarify the exact position?  Is there an error in his script?  Is it 25 per cent?  Is there an error in the Bill as passed by the Dáil? Before I proceed I would like clarification on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the script which was circulated carried the figure of 20 per cent.  The Senator probably noted that in my speech I referred on two occasions to 25 per cent.  The proposal in the Bill was to limit the on-lending to 20 per cent of the agricultural lending.  The Dáil amended that last night to 25 per cent.  The Minister for Finance accepted an amendment from the Senator's own party to change that to 25 per cent.  The Bill, as coming from Dáil Éireann to Seanad Éireann has been amended in the Dáil from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  I regret the inadvertent typographical error.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am gratified that my own party's amendment was accepted by the Minister for Finance last night.  We were in a difficult position because this Bill was not listed in the Whip we got this week.  It was announced yesterday that it would be taken today. It is hard for us to keep absolutely up-to-date with what happens in the Dáil and the difficulty in the Minister's speech did not help the situation.  I thank him for the clarification and I express my gratification at seeing the 5 per cent increase as a consequence of my party's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister indicate, under section 2, what he feels are the specific benefits of having an agricultural bank owned by the State?  He did not really touch on that in his speech.  I know it is a wide question but he may wish to give one or two pointers in relation to the specific advantages there are.  Perhaps he could allay some of the difficulties which Senator Ross appears to be experiencing. I want to know what the advantages are of retaining the ACC in the public sector. <Col N="263" /> There is a need to know what the long term thinking is in relation to where the ACC are going.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the other House there was talk about bringing all of these State banks together into a conglomerate.  Perhaps other people would have notions that it might be a good idea to consider in the long, medium or short term privatising such a bank.  The point has been made by people who contributed to the debate that farmers nowadays seek credit and funding from banks in the purely commercial sector.  Therefore, the question must be asked whether we need a purely agricultural bank.  With reference again to the limits on lending outside the agricultural sector, perhaps the Minister would like to give reasons as to why he feels there should be a limit.  Do we, in fact, need a limit at all?  It would be interesting to hear what he has to say on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement some of the things Senator Bulbulia was saying on this Bill.  To expect of the Government long term thinking is asking a bit much.  There is absolutely no long term thinking on this at all.  That is why we have got this piecemeal Bill.  What the Minister said in his reply &mdash; I apologise for not being here; he caught me unawares but I heard it in my office &mdash; is that the Bill was introduced in the Dáil five months ago and was not, therefore, a response to the 1987 performance of ACC.  I do not know very much about agriculture but I could have told the Minister five months ago what in 1987 performance of ACC was going to be like that it was not going to be a very good performance.  A Bill of this sort was probably going to be necessary.  I understand that the figures were not available but it was transparent at the time what the situation in the farming sector was like and what the ACC was going to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Bulbulia did actually touch on was a very interesting point as to why we need an ACC to all under this sector.  I think that is important.  The <Col N="264" /> Minister might comment on the suggestion made in the other House, first of all as to whether we need State banks, secondly, whether they should all be put into one bank and, thirdly, why we should have specific State banks lending to specific sectors in the State.  It seems to me that this is now anomalous in the present financial world and that at the least they should be brought together and should be able to compete with the banks on the same terms.</P>
    <P>There needs to be some serious long term thinking on this.  I do not think we should see a series of Bills of this sort in response to current events.  We should see a long, comprehensive Bill about State banks.  I would just like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  Before that, I would like to say that I certainly support and endorse the provisions he is making in this Agricultural Credit Bill.  The one great deficiency I see is that the State does not know exactly what the worth of the agricultural sector is at present.  It is high time that the Kilroy report &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; of the late fifties, possibly 1957, which was the last attempt at assessing the worth of Irish agriculture and Irish farmers, was looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate to which I listened very attentively many of my colleagues mentioned the difficulties and the experiences that farmers had, not only with the ACC but with the commercial banks, over the last seven or eight years.  I must readily admit that people in the banking business have had difficulties in getting their interest and their moneys back by virtue of the fact that there was a serious decline in agricultural incomes. Here we have a State bank and the sister bank, the ICC.  They both continue to do very good work.  They were established in the late twenties or early thirties, but even taking them in conjunction with the Central Bank, no effort has been made to my knowledge over the years to assess exactly what it is they want to enhance, or what particular percentage of capital <Col N="265" /> or worth they want to inject into the agricultural or any other sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not possible to do that unless one is able to make an assessment.  The State does not know at present how many farm holdings there are in this country, nor do they know the overall acreage. They do not know how many units, because many farmers have three, four, five and six different receivable orders in different parts of the land.  The whole thing is a mess.  The big problem is that the farming community are attributed with being a very wealthy sector when, in reality, the people living on the land and, indeed, the people working on the ground in ACC know very well that there is an acute cash flow crisis and shortages in regard to a large number of farms.</P>

      <P>Many thanks.  I would like to develop the point on subsection (1) of section 2.  I should like to ask the Minister if his Department have looked at the German experience, where the Bundesbank seems to grow in stature and in size day by day.  It seems to take equity in most of the companies it assists.  This means that the Bundesbank controls a huge percentage of the economy of the Federal Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the ground work done here, inasmuch as we have the Central Bank, the ICC and the ACC, but they have to paddle their own canoes.  I am very happy that here we are branching out a bit wider than the narrow agricultural sector.  I would hope that perhaps the ACC might consider very seriously, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, introducing a system of subsidised credit facilities, as opposed to State <Col N="266" /> grants for the development of agriculture. I would like to ask the Minister if his Department have given any thought to that.  The farming sector are looked upon by people who are not too worried about the incomes or, indeed, about the worth of the agricultural sector, as being a sector that are generously fed with grants and subsidies.  I would like to see the grants being dropped altogether and, perhaps, people getting credit at a rate they can afford to pay.</P>

The other point, for all my colleagues and not just for you, Senator Ross, is that there is a disadvantage sometimes.  There are advantages to being Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach but there is the disadvantage that when you would like to be on the Floor of the House participating on some Stage of legislation you cannot be.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach knows the rules.  I, too, knew he was drifting a little bit but I did not need your guidance, Senator Ross, on how far I should allow him to drift.

      <P>I want to get back to the Bill.  It is rarely one has a chance of getting one's own back on the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I could not resist it. I would like the Minister to explain how the process of consultation is going to work.  In section 2 at the bottom of page 2 it refers to all these particular things which the ACC can do.  It says:</P>
      <P>...for such purposes as the Minister after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland may from time to time determine and subject to such conditions as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that concerned me here was whether this will act as some sort of a delaying factor in the activities of the ACC.  In the commercial world it is very important that these decisions are made fast and quickly and that there is no delay. It appears that for some reason the ACC <Col N="268" /> are not being given their head.  I understand the need and the pressures on the Minister to monitor the specific activities of the ACC but it does concern me that this form of consultation, and the Minister giving it a certain amount of thought, and the bureaucracy behind it may act as a delaying factor on the ACC's activities and that they will not be again competing on fair terms.  How is this process going to work?  Is it going to work quickly?  Is it going to work slowly?  What is envisaged by the Minister in this area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is wonderful harmony in this House and I enjoy that harmony. Many questions have been raised by a number of Senators, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I will do my best to respond in as harmonious a fashion as possible.  Senator Bulbulia asked the reasons why we need an agricultural bank, and if the Minister would outline these reasons.  Senator Ross also asked a similar question during his Second Stage contribution.  Basically, in my Second Stage speech and in my response to the debate, I tried to cover that area.  The reasons for it today are not as important or as relevant as the reasons were 61 years ago, in 1927 when it was set up and when farmers were regarded as a very high risk credit and when the associated banks and the normal commercial banks were not interested in considering them for loans.  The State at the time, in order to stimulate economic growth and agricultural development, created the ACC.</P>
      <P>Many of the reasons are still relevant today.  Some of the reasons that I myself would regard as being important for the preservation of the ACC would be the specialised role that they play in the development of agriculture, the specialised expertise they have garnered over the years in dealing with agricultural matters and in dealing with individual farmers right across the country, and the store of information and resources they must now have available to further contribute to the development of agriculture.  They can also stimulate agricultral and economic growth through government agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> The Government can liaise, through the Department of Agriculture and Food, with the Agricultural Credit Corporation in specific, sepcialised areas.  I would see the ACC playing a key role in responding to EC directives and quickly responding to EC opportunities, providing specialised finance for specific agricultural projects or schemes and handling and administering EC financial aid and packages for farmers in special situations.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator McDonald raised the question of farmers availing of credit facilities rather than grants as subsidies from the Community or from the State through an institution like the ACC.  An opportunity has been provided in the past, but the percentage of farmers who wanted to use this facility was minimal.  It is something that the ACC are still in a position to consider through co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and with the individual farmers themselves.  The interest of farmers in a scheme like this does not seem to be too great.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked the question why this is an ACC at all.  I tried to respond to that before, but the fact is that it is there.  It is in legislation.  The ACC are active.  They are a corporation and are doing a job.  We cannot abolish them and there is no reason why they should be abolished.  They have a specific purpose to fulfil and we are enlarging the opportunities and the role they can play.  We cannot sell the ACC or dispose of them until they reach proper profitability.  It would be a disservice to the community and to the economy, and particularly to the agricultural community, if we were to impede the role which the Agricultural Credit Corporation can play in the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon spoke of identifying the role the ACC can play and the areas of lending they would consider.  Hopefully, after the House will have passed the Bill, that will create new opportunities for the ACC.  It will attract many more investors due to the fact that there is State equity and State security.  Personal investors will be able to avail of personal loans from <Col N="270" /> the ACC in a variety of areas and thereafter the ACC can consider other areas of lending such as house mortgage loans and various other loans.  We would see it as purely a matter for the board of ACC and their executives to constantly monitor and to be constantly aware of the needs and the financial opportunities that are in the marketplace and to come up with policies, and to put those policies before the main shareholder, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to section 2 (f) of the Bill and to the consultation role the Minister for Finance has with the Central Bank.  The situation is that the Minister for Finance is the main shareholder on behalf of the taxpayer and the State.  The Central Bank are the governors of banking in the country and the people who have expertise in this role. The Minister would have to consider proposals coming from the ACC.  If these proposals were very new or outside the scope of any activity which had been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, he would consult with the Central Bank to see that what had been proposed by the ACC's board would be feasible and suitable for a corporation like the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and that it would not be in conflict with the role they have to play in the development of our economy, and particularly the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We would see no conflict between the Minister consulting with the Central Bank.  That should not cause delay.  As far as we are concerned the ACC are an efficient organisation with particular expertise.  They should be able to respond to given situations quickly.  They should be able to put proposals before the Minister and to read the financial climate. Given a reasonable period of time, the Minister should be able to consult with the Central Bank and either give a positive or negative response to any proposals the board of the ACC would have.  This has been the position right across the board in all areas of banking in the country particularly with the ACC, which has key State involvement.  There should be no reason why there should be any delay. <Col N="271" /> Senator McDonald made comparisons with various other banks in the European Community.  The ACC were started by the State.  Many banks in member states throughout the Community were formed as farmer co-operative banks.  A number of these smaller co-operative banks, either on their own initiative, or with State initiative, or with State equity, formed new companies.  In France the Credit Agricole is now the biggest bank in France.  It is the ninth biggest bank in the world.  In Holland their bank is the second largest Dutch bank.  In Spain the agricultural bank, or the farmers bank, is one of the top banks in Spain and, indeed, in the Community.  The situation is the same in Sweden.</P>
    <P>Many of Ireland's European trading partners can boast of successful banking institutions which began as exclusively agricultural organisations.  Their diversification into other areas has not led to the withdrawal of credit from farmers but rather to the development of a healthy business whose base is broad enough for risks to be widely spread.  We believe that as a result of the passage of this Bill, similar opportunities will be created for the Agricultural Credit Corporation and that they will be in a position to re-finance agriculture in a better way through diversification and by providing opportunities for the many new investors we hope they will garner in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for that reply which was very helpful.  I would like to ask the Minister about the past role of the ACC, before we finish section 2.  We heard on Second Stage from Senator Ferris that the ACC had been very sympathetic to many farmers in the restructuring of loans.  I would like to hear the Minister's reply to my question as to what the priority of the ACC is?  Primarily, are they lending in an unprofitable and difficult sector?  If so, are they under pressure to lend willy-nilly to that sector, regardless of commercial criteria?  Are they more sympathetic than commercial agencies in their lending?  In other words, are they there to lend to <Col N="272" /> farmers?  Do they, therefore, feel that they are under an obligation to lend?</P>
      <P>The numbers of loans which have been restructured have been far too numerous. Restructuring of a loan of this sort means that the loan in the first place was a bad loan.  It was a badly judged loan.  There may have been factors which have intervened beyond the control of the ACC and of the borrower.  What I am not quite sure of is whether the ACC lend purely as a commercial bank, or whether there is a charitable element there as well, in other words, that they should lend to the agricultural sector come hell or high water.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat bemused at Senator Ross's use of the word &ldquo;charitable&rdquo;.  As a man who has tremendous financial expertise himself, he would readily admit that there is no charity when you are dealing with any financial institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the individual person you are dealing with.  The ACC are a State corporation set up to play a financial role in the development of the economy with particular emphasis on the agricultural sector.  We propose in this Bill to diversify and to make the situation more liberal for the ACC.  They must operate purely on commercial terms.  They take regard of serious individual cases and the circumstances of any borrower.  Sympathy and compassion only come in the same way as in any other commercial institution, associated bank, building society or whoever else, when a person finds himself in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC do not lend willy-nilly.  They do not lend without taking due cognisance of the commercial criteria under which an application must be scrutinised. The executives or managers make a decision based on the ability of a person to pay, on the collateral being put forward and on the request being made based on the amount of money and the <Col N="273" /> number of years being considered and, of course, the age of the applicant and after all other family circumstances have been taken into account, in a similar manner to the criteria being used by commercial institutions right throughout the country and the world.  The ACC have a role to play as a commercial organisation controlled by the State in order to stimulate economic growth and operating on commercial criteria.</P>

      <P>On section 3 I wish to ask the Minister a brief question about the articles of association and memorandum. These will obviously have to be amended in order to cope with the changed situation brought about by this legislation.  I wonder will the ACC have to wait until this is done before they can initiate extension of credit outside the areas to which they were hiterto bound, or can they act on the powers given in section 2?  In other words, will there be a time lag while the articles of association and memorandum are amended, or can they go ahead under the powers given to them in the legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, when the Bill is passed &mdash; hopefully today &mdash; the Corporation can then take the necessary steps on the policy field to move forward, but particularly immediately in the administrative field by amending their articles of association and memorandum. That would only take a very short period of time.  They cannot proceed to diversify until such time as they lodge those changes in their memorandum and articles of association with the companies office. We would not visualise any delay whatsoever. We would see the two moving together quickly &mdash; first, the changes in the Companies Act and then the policy changes.</P>

      <P>The Abattoirs Bill, 1987, has been passed by Dáil Éireann, with amendments, and I would like to explain those amendments to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 5 are cognate. Arising from concerns expressed to me that the period of two months licence continuance mentioned in subsection (2) <Col N="275" /> of section 13 might prove to be an insufficient period in certain circumstances following the death of a licence holder, I agreed to extend the period to four months.  Accordingly amendment No. 1 will do that in the case of abattoir licences while amendment No. 5 makes similar provision in relation to knackery licences. Senators will recall that, during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad some time ago, we introduced amendments to that section.  I have further improved the situation following concerns expressed by Members of the Dáil and I have, therefore, agreed to extend the period to four months to make it more reasonable for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 are related and refer to the refusal of abattoir licences and knackery licences, respectively. The purpose behind these amendments is to provide for an intermediate period, that is, 21 days notice of intention before the refusal of an abattoir or knackery licence takes place and, moreover, before formal recourse to the Circuit Court on appeal becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that during the passage of the Bill in this House last October, a number of speakers were concerned about the appeal provisions on refusal or revocation of licences.  Various proposals were then made ranging from an intermediate appeal body to an intermediate period during which aggrieved proprietors would be afforded the opportunity to state their case without the involvement of the Circuit Court.  The trade too had been concerned about the Bill's appeal provisions and were anxious to ensure that their members could have some informal procedure available to them before having to resort to the Circuit Court on formal appeal.  Because of the widespread concerns expressed at the time, I decided, in consultation with Members of this House, of the Dáil and of the trade, to have another look at the Bill's appeal provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill already contained a provision in section 15 and 30 that, where an existing licence was being revoked, 21 days advance notice would be given to the <Col N="276" /> licence holder.  I decided, therefore, to include this provision of 21 days advance notice in the sections governing the refusal of licences and the necessary amendments were welcomed by the Dáil and by the trade.</P>
    <P>They provide that, in the first instance, notice of intention to refuse a licence must issue at least 21 days before notice of actual refusal issues.  That is, a person will get 21 days notice of intention before the actual notice of refusal will issue. This added safeguard of 21 days advance notice will allow an aggrieved proprietor, who feels his case may not have been adequately reported on at the time of inspection, to represent his case more fully to the Department.  Furthermore, it will ensure that proprietors are not immediately catapulted into the formal appeal procedures involving the Circuit Court.  That should allay the fears expressed by Members of this House who were concerned about that point.  I did go to some trouble to allay those fears and ensure that we got this additional safeguard into that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 7 are cognate and are purely drafting amendments in that they tidy up a certain vagueness in the subsections to which they relate.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 3, the position is that subsection (2) (c) of section 14, as it stood, may have been somewhat ambiguous.  It might have implied that a premises which heretofore was not being operated as an abattoir could be allowed operate as such while the applicant for a licence was appealing the Minister's decision not to grant him one.  Accordingly, this amendment clarifies the situation in the case of abattoirs and amendment No. 7 does likewise in the case of knackeries.</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 4 and 8 are cognate and are purely drafting amendments to clarify the procedures to be adopted by the Minister in revoking licences.  In regard to amendment No. 4, subsection (2) of section 15 as it stood provided for the issue by the Minister of a notice of intention to revoke a licence, but did not make it clear that the actual decision to revoke was a separate matter and should <Col N="277" /> be notified separately.  The Minister could, for instance, in the 21-day period following issue of the notice of intention decide not to carry the intention into effect.  This amendment clarifies the matter in the case of abattoirs and amendment No. 8 does likewise in the case of knackeries.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 reduces from two years to one year the period during which summary proceedings for offences under this Bill may be instituted.  In the Dáil a number of Members expressed their concern about a two-year period, that things could drag on for two years and that there was no point in allowing that much time to elapse.  A number of Deputies suggested that the sooner matters are brought before the courts, the better for all concerned.  In this connection it was argued that the period of two years would only allow matters for an extension of time when the people concerned under this Bill would tend to forget matters and it would be preferable to have the matter decided as quickly as possible.  Recognising these concerns, I introduced this amendment which will provide a more reasonable period for the institution of summary proceedings.</P>
    <P>Lowering the period of time from two years to one will result in a better situation and will give a reasonable length of time.  Lowering it to less than one year would maybe have some serious repercussions and perhaps cases where extensive investigations are required might become statute barred if it were less than one year, so I think one year there is an improvement on the two years.  I commend these minor but important amendments to this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister back to the House with these amendments.  On your ruling, I will deal with all the amendments but just speaking once to each of them.  I think it is better to do it that way than to deal with the individual amendments and it will probably be easier to have a structured debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendments No. 1 and 5 I appreciate what the Minister has done <Col N="278" /> in this case following discussion of this Bill in the Dáil because we were concerned, particularly in the area of the death of a licence holder, and anything that can ease that situation is to be welcomed. Easing it from two months to four months is definitely a move in the right direction.  The Minister has been quite generous in allowing that and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 meet the real worry I had about plunging ordinary genuine people in the meat trade, village and town butchers, into a Circuit Court situation immediately without a period of time in which they could discuss matters with the licensing authority or come to some arrangement to set their house in order without having to go to the Circuit Court which would literally ruin their business and make criminals of them in the eyes of the public.  The Minister's move in this area removed that possibility and will allow time to the genuine people in the trade.  We all agreed that nobody would justify anybody in this area being anything but proper and having the right standards but we also wanted to be reasonable. The amount of time the Minister will give butchers to achieve the proper status and standards is sufficient time to allow genuine people an opportunity to put their house in order.  The other amendments are technical and I have no particular interest in them apart from their technicality.  They are drafting and clarification amendments and I welcome them for that.  I support all these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this.  I would just like to compliment the Minister on his reasonableness in dealing with the views expressed in this House and in the other House.  Quite a number of Senators were very concerned about the Bill as it appeared in the first instance but many of the objections we had to the Bill are being met in the amendments.  I would like to refer particularly to amendments Nos. 1 and 5 which deal with the death of a licence holder.  While it extends the period to twice what it was in the original <Col N="279" /> Bill I am not entirely happy with it.  At the same time the Minister has gone a long way to meet the wishes of the Senators and Deputies.</P>
      <P>At the time of the death of a licence holder a period passes when there are a lot of other matters to be dealt with. While four months is a great improvement on what we had in the original Bill, I would like to have seen it extended somewhat further to perhaps six months. However, I am reasonably happy with what the Minister has done and indeed with the other amendments dealing with appeals.  I think he has come a long way in meeting the wishes of Senators and I would compliment the Minister on being so reasonable in dealing with this matter. I wish we got the same co-operation with many other pieces of legislation.  I thank the Minister for a fine job in this regard.</P>

      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Senators for their co-operation in dealing with this Bill, not alone on this occasion, but also when it was first before this House. It is worth recalling that in the course of the passage of this Bill through both the Seanad and the Dáil we put down 15 amendments because of the concern and the homework which Senators and Deputies put into this legislation. The Bill reflects the consideration given to it by Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  It reflects well on the democratic process.  If there is a good intention expressed on the part of a Member of either House and if it improves legislation <Col N="280" /> I would go a long way to incorporate that. In this case the Bill is the better for the amendments I have included in it.</P>
      <P>I would also like to record my appreciation of the positive and constructive and non-contentious manner in which the debates on the various issues took place in both Houses because the basic purpose of this Bill, as agreed by everybody, is the raising of standards.  That raising of standards even though it is going to mean some expense and a great deal of difficulty for the trade, is supported by all Members of both Houses and by the trade itself.  I should not let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the role played by the trade, in particular, the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association and the Irish Master Butchers Federation. Numerous meetings and consultations were held with interested bodies in the formulation of the legislation and they will be pleased with the Bill as it has now finally emerged.  In the formulation of regulations under this Bill the same process of consultation will take place.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to thank and pay tribute to the Senators for their speedy endorsement of the amendments to this Bill today.</P>

These chapters explain clearly, and in a manner comprehensible to all, the meaning of the new terminology bandied about these days, i.e. computer hardware, software, peripherals, biotechnology, and so on.</P>
      <P>The report also analyses the technological capacity of Irish industry and looks at how it compares internationally. Some of the opportunities in new developing technologies are touched upon, and the role of the various State agencies relating to technology development is briefly but correctly explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Science and Technology, I have found that the terminology used in this area of work frequently frightens people.  Yet this area <Col N="282" /> is so crucially important to the development of our economy that it is imperative that people lose this fear of new technology. I would recommend that this report be placed in the library of every secondary school in this country.</P>
    <P>Some of the core messages of this report are that although technology is an issue of fundamental importance to the Irish economy, it still tends to be treated as a marginal topic; that there are major technological gaps, particularly in those technologies with the greatest rate of change such as engineering technologies resulting from electronic developments and that there are major skilled deficiencies in our indigenous firms, particularly with regard to the newer technologies but also in design, quality assurance and knowledge of material.</P>
    <P>I agree with this assessment, and indeed my objective since taking up office has been to tackle these deficiencies and seek to put matters right.  In dealing with the specific recommendations in the report I will make reference to some of the steps taken by this Government in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the specific recommendations made in the report, I would make the following comments.  As regards the opening recommendation, 8.1.1, the Government created the Office of Minister for Science and Technology last March in order to provide the central focus recommended in the report.  This single response has already been instrumental in securing progress across the wide front reflected in the other recommendations here.  In particular, and despite the difficult budgetary situation, a special science and technology development programme was initiated in 1987 with a budget of £2.5 million.  This will be a permanent feature from now on and further provision of £3.1 million has been made for the science and technology programme in 1988.</P>
    <P>The next recommendation, 8.1.2, relates to the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on science and technology.  I consider that this proposal has merit.  If acted upon, it would help to create a broader and clearer conception <Col N="283" /> among all political parties and the public at large of the importance of science and technology.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.1.3: With reference to the recommendation that a national technology forum representing Government, business organisations and trade unions should be established, I feel that the concern behind this recommendation has been met in the context of the talks between the social partners and Government.  As this particular forum deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with technology-related matters, there would be a certain element of duplication in creating a further forum.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.1.4: This recommendation relates to the central role of the National Board for Science and Technology as independent adviser to Government on policy for science and technology.  Since this report was written, this Government have initiated a number of significant developments affecting many of the recommendations in the report.  The Government decision to combine the functions of the National Board for Science and Technology and of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, in order to form EOLAS &mdash; the Irish Science and Technology Agency &mdash; is one of those initiatives.  This new agency is continuing the former NBST role of advising me on national policy for science and technology.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.1: I fully endorse the principle outlined in this recommendation on switching public support for industry away from fixed assets towards &ldquo;soft&rdquo; assets.  It has been Government policy since 1984 to make the switch.  The 1986 review of industrial progress points out that actual progress made over the proceeding three years towards achieving that objective has been limited.  I believe that certain actions taken by this Government &mdash; such as the establishment of the Science and Technology Development Fund &mdash; represent steps towards achieving this objective. While the present situation is not satisfactory, I intend to make every effort to <Col N="284" /> change it in the direction supported by the report.</P>
    <P>Recommendations 8.2.2 and 8.2.3: These recommendations have been overtaken by the merger of the NBST and IIRS.  EOLAS is now the agency with particular and central responsibility for co-ordinating the direction of State support for technology in industry.  The intention is indeed, as this report recommends, to streamline in as far as practicable the activities of the State agencies and to avoid duplications.  EOLAS has been asked to produce an annual national programme for science and technology. The new agency will place increased emphasis on assisting firms to be aware of the importance of and the role technology will play in the future development of the firm and will intensify its activities in consultancy, industrial education and the dissemination of information. In addition, the new agency will concentrate some of its resources in assisting the development of industrial sectors that are important to future economic growth.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.4: This recommendation advocates the extension of the Teaching Companies Programme.  This has already been done as part of the Science and Technology Development Programme started last year.  In 1987, 30 highly qualified graduates were placed in selective companies for a period of three years for the purpose of upgrading the technology knowledge within these companies. This programme is continuing in 1988 and further placements will be made.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.5: This recommendation relates to industrial design, an area in which EOLAS will use the capabilities of other State agencies to assist firms.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.6: This recommendation is that as part of any grant aid package for a company there should be provision for technological assessment within the company.  This recommendation has also been made in the context of a recent NBST review of the industrial R &amp; D grants scheme.  In future <Col N="285" /> this technological assessment will be provided by EOLAS.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.7: In 1987 the advanced manufacturing technology programme was put in place in four university centres.  This programme will be extended during 1988.  The centres are at UCG, NIHE Limerick, TCD and UCD.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.8: This recommendation is that Ireland should achieve and maintain a competitive position in the emerging biotechnology race.  I am very happy to say that Government have already accepted the biotechnology programme and during 1987 three national centres in biotechnology have been established. These are: diagnostics at UCD, cell and tissue culture at NIHE Dublin and food biotechnology at UCC.  The programme is being extended during 1988 and it is my intention to bring further university centres into the programme as soon as funding permits.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.9: Again, I have no difficulty with the thrust of this recommendation which is to make an annual allocation of £1 million to stimulate specific research projects.  To some extent, this recommendation is being met through the Science and Technology Development Programme.  I cannot pretend that I would not wish to increase the funds available to this programme and I will be pressing the case for this.  With regard to the recommendation that an annual prize for a national competition in product innovation be established, this is already the case and the scheme will in future be operated by EOLAS.  Our experience shows that the actual level of the prize fund is not the most important factor to competing industries.  The prestige of winning a product innovation award is far more valuable to them.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.10 and 8.2.11: These recommendations are related to EC-funded research.  The thrust of these recommendations is, as I understand, that we should, at a national level, be trying to get the ground rules in Brussels changed so that small firms in the peripheral regions would be eligible to participate more fully in Community Research Programmes.  This is something <Col N="286" /> that my Department are fully conscious of and our national representatives continually stress this point in the appropriate committees in Brussels.  In certain programmes we have succeeded in inserting at the outset, and against the opposition of the larger member states, certain stipulations that the programmes should benefit countries with a weaker technological infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.12: I fully endorse this recommendation that the non-specialist staff of all State agencies dealing with small manufacturing firms need to have a grasp of what new technology means for manufacture.  I will see that this report, and my response to its recommendations are circulated to all appropriate State agencies.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.13: I agree with and fully support the next recommendation which is to encourage a greater awareness amongst young people of manufacture as a career &mdash; particularly in an entrepreneurial or managerial capacity.  I have had a number of discussions with the Minister for Education along these lines.  As I said earlier, I will be asking the Minister for Education to see that this report is available in all second level schools.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.2.14: This recommendation relates to product testing at point of entry, the introduction of which will be considered in the context of a product safety Bill which is in the course of preparation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.3: Most of the recommendations under this section are for the private sector to implement. Work is already on hand relating to getting public service data bases &ldquo;on line&rdquo; to manufacturers, retailers and professional firms.</P>
    <P>I have tried to respond to each of the many recommendations in this report. Again, I would like to say that the body of this report provides an excellent up-to-date overview of the effects and responses to new technology at home and abroad over recent years.  Its conclusions and recommendations, in particular, identify most of the major concerns of the present Government and of my <Col N="287" /> Department in this area.  I am very happy indeed to be able to say that positive action has been taken on so many of the recommendations made during the short term of one year since this Government created the Office of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I would once again like to compliment the joint committee in its choice of topic for their Seventh Report.  I believe that their contribution will be very significant towards raising awareness in Ireland of the importance of new technology not only to small businesses but indeed to all businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Oireachtas joint committee that produced this Seventh Report on New Technology and the Small Business I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister, as I did last autumn in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, when we debated in this House the Sixth Report which dealt with the development and management of small business co-ops if he can use any influence to persuade the Government to set up an Oireachtas joint committee to deal with small businesses but with even wider terms of reference than the previous committee which everyone has admitted did excellent work.  In my opinion it is a disgrace that Joint Committee on Small Businesses was not reappointed, particularly when everyone acknowledges that small business is the cornerstone of industrial survival today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks back over the several reports that were produced during the past four or five years one will see there were quite a number of very useful ideas put forward by this committee under the various headings.  Some of them were taken on board by the previous Government and implemented for the betterment of this country.  I am asking the Minister to be specific in his reply as to whether there will be a new committee for small busineses set up under this Government and I would urge that the reply be positive if at all possible.  The <Col N="288" /> last committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Ivan Yates and vice-chairman Deputy Michael Lynch worked extremely hard and achieved a lot.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could use his good offices to try to have a new committee established.</P>
    <P>In relation to this report, the committee feels that the implications for our economy arising from new technology are such that it should have a central part in our economic policy formulation. However, all the evidence suggests that we are still well behind the more developed European countries in this regard.  While there are positive developments such as our modern telecommunications system, there is no central focus bringing together all the public education and business interests involved to develop a co-ordinated policy for technology in a way that will fully benefit the economy.</P>
    <P>In order to survive in this tough, competive, business world in which we live one would need to make use of the most modern technological devices and run a very streamlined organisation.  This, however, leads to loss of jobs as the more technology you employ the less need there is for people on the ground.  With the introduction of the computer and the micro-processor into small business you obtain a high level of efficiency and information with the minimum of staff.  Automation in the factory and office means that less skilled and repetitive industrial and clerical jobs become much fewer in number.  To some extent, these jobs would be replaced in the new technological areas themselves, such as computer services and software.  However, these jobs require a high degree of skill and high levels of education.</P>
    <P>We need to invest substantially in research and development in order to keep abreast of the ever-changing situation in technology today.  Sweden and Switzerland have been quoted as two countries who are among the most committed to research and development. Both of these countries have virtually full employment.  Other small European countries with a heavy commitment to <Col N="289" /> investment in new technology have unemployment rates of between five and 10 per cent, including Austria, Denmark and Finland.  Ireland has 18.3 per cent unemployment and it is rising.</P>
    <P>Although new technology has resulted in millions of new jobs in computer and computer-related industries and services, the net effect of technological innovation on industrial employment is firmly downwards. The following figures for manufacturing employment in Japan, West Germany and US which are three major market economies show the trend.  In respect of employment in manufacturing industry and as a percentage of labour force, Japan in 1973 had 14.4 million employed or 27 per cent: in 1985 it was reduced to 14 million or 23.8 per cent. West Germany in 1973 had 9.7 million or 35.8 per cent: in 1985, it was 8 million or 29 per cent.  In the US in 1973, you had 21 million or 22.9 per cent and this fell to 19.9 million in 1985 or 17.5 per cent. It must also be remembered that these three countries have enjoyed the fastest rates of growth among developed economies but that this growth has been insufficient to prevent a sharp decline in their labour force employed in manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>There are factors other than automation behind job losses in manufacturing industry, such as changing trade patterns, growth rates lower than in the past and a tendency for labour-intensive industries to locate in newly developed countries.  However, automated production due to the newer computer technologies is the major reason.</P>
    <P>If you were to trace the history of computers you would find that the first computer was developed in Pennsylvania University in 1946 covering 3,000 cubic feet, weighing approximately 30 tonnes and containing 18,000 valves.  The next step in computers was the development of the transistor and its progressive application in the 1950s.  Transistors were smaller and more durable than values and by 1964 some 18,000 computer systems were installed in the US compared with 244 in the mid-1950s.  The development <Col N="290" /> of micro-electronics and the miniaturisation of the transistor to the extent that thousands of them could fit on one tiny integrated circuit has brought about the greatest revolution in computer technology, known as the micro-processors or the silicon chip.  The development of the chip resulted in the first commercial micro-computer in 1971.  Throughout the 1970s the cost of computer hardware fell by 40 per cent annually.  Computers became an option for small businesses.</P>
    <P>There are three main types of computers. You have the mainframe, the mini-computer and the micro-computer. You now have enormous computer power available to small business at a relatively low cost.  Developments in computer hardware have been matched by the growth of computer software to the extent that software has become a major services industry in its own right. Falling hardware costs and the development of the chip, together with a variety of new software packages, have greatly widened the possibility of computer application.  These go right across all functional areas of business and would include for example, marketing, financial and personnel sectors.</P>
    <P>Being involved in the running of a company myself I purchased a desk top computer a few years ago.  This was specifically used for the production of monthly accounts, for forecasting, budgeting, payroll purposes, etc.  In order to survive in business one nowadays needs instant information at one's fingertips. The old days of getting information at the annual, end-of-year accounts or audit is no longer of any use.  Many companies are collapsing, in my view, because they do not have up-to-date information as to how they are doing. It is much easier to take the necessary corrective action if you know in time that something is wrong.</P>
    <P>For anyone to survive in business today it is imperative that they have a computer to give them the information they require.  Not being technologically minded myself, I sometimes have great difficulty in understanding how these <Col N="291" /> machines work.  The automatic teller machine &mdash; or the hole in the wall bank &mdash; has intrigued me from the beginning. It is in itself a computer terminal.  It is an unbelievable advancement in modern technology when one can insert a card with a personal identification number in one of these machines in any part of the country and obtain cash, make a lodgment, request the sending of a cheque book and get up-to-date information on one's present bank balance.  It makes life easier and reduces the need for carrying large amounts of cash on one's person, thus reducing the risk of cash loss due to robbery, as money can be obtained at any time, day or night.  This development has been achieved through the integration of telecommunications with computer technology.</P>
    <P>While this may be seen as a major advance they have of course gone one step further in other European countries. In Britain home banking services are being introduced.  One such service already exists in Nottingham.  Since last year customers of the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland are able to get information about their accounts; they can pay bills and make inter-account transactions using a terminal connected to their television and telephone.  It takes only 15 seconds to get information on any account.  The availability of this technology has led to the development of data-base services which will allow subscribers access to information of a general or specialised nature.</P>
    <P>In France the telephone authorities have distributed microprocessor-based terminals free to telephone subscribers. To date some 2.6 million terminals have been distributed and there are 800 different services, including home banking, news and retail.  In Ireland we are slowly moving in this direction.  Output from electronics and computer-related products in Ireland is now valued at £2,500 million annually, most of which is exported and accounts for 35 per cent of our total manufactured exports.  There are about 300 electronic companies in Ireland, employing 20,000 people.  This <Col N="292" /> sector of manufacture is almost entirely foreign owned.  We also have the indigenous sector which is heavily involved in traditional product areas.  Profitability is low and sufficient funds for re-investment are not being generated.</P>
    <P>All available material on the technological capabilities of indigenous Irish manufacturing firms points towards deficiencies on a scale barely compatible with a developed economy.  In 1985 the Sectoral Development Committee published a report entitled &ldquo;The Technological Capacity of Indigenous Irish Industry&rdquo;, which paints a pessimistic scenario.  On page 21 the report concluded:</P>
    <P>(i)  even in the growth areas such as electronics, plastics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and mechanical and electrical engineering, the indigenous component mainly comprises small firms producing low value added products, and with a medium to low technological capacity.  Growth is confined to companies of overseas origin and there is no sign of improvement in favour of indigenous firms;</P>
    <P>(ii)  traditional sectors such as clothing, textiles, printing and packaging are dominated by indigenous manufacturers and these sectors are in decline.  The technological capacity of these firms is low to medium and the inidications are that their decline will continue;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the innovative capacity of indigenous firms is low with a consequential negative outlook for future expansion;</P>
    <P>(iv)  there are major technological gaps, particularly in those technologies with the greatest rate of change such as engineering technologies resulting from electronic developments e.g. computer aided design and manufacture;</P>
    <P>(v)  there are major skill deficiencies in our indigenous firms, particularly with regard to the newer technologies but also in design, quality assurance <Col N="293" /> and knowledge of materials;</P>
    <P>(vi)  the lack of skills in the technological and technical areas is mirrored by similar deficiencies in market intelligence and information systems, poor marketing performance, lack of equity capital and lack of strategic planning.</P>
    <P>Some 90 per cent of all Irish manufacturing firms employ less than 100 people.  Fewer than 5 per cent of indigenous firms carry out any Research and Development work.  In addition the skills within many of these firms are so limited that it is extremely difficult for them to assimilate New Technology or to develop new products.</P>
    <P>The report tells us that the level of research and development by Irish industry is low when compared with most developed countries.  In 1985 industrial research and development in Ireland accounted for £62 million or 0.4 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.9 per cent in the US, 1.8 per cent in Germany and 1 per cent in the Netherlands.  Roughly half of the Irish research and development expenditure is on process development and improvement, rather than product development.</P>
    <P>The State assists development of technology in industry by incentive in two ways, first, direct grants from State agencies and second, tax incentives.  Direct incentives are provided by the IDA, by SFADCo &mdash; which is in Clare &mdash; and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  These incentives relate to equipment grants, feasibility study grants, research and development grants etc.  The taxation incentives relate to the extension of business expansion schemes, to research and development, which was brought in under the 1986 Finance Act.  An individual investing in a qualifying research company may claim tax relief at the marginal rate subject to a maximum annual investment of £25,000. The company must be engaged solely in carrying out research and development.</P>
    <P>Another area of tax incentive is patent income, which is exempt from income tax <Col N="294" /> to the extent that research leading to the invention is carried out in this country. The European Management Forum Report published in August 1986 which dealt with competitiveness in the 22 OECD countries ranked Ireland as a low 17th in terms of overall competitiveness. Several smaller European countries were in the first ten.  Switzerland was third; Denmark, fifth; Sweden, seventh; the Netherlands, eighth; Norway, ninth; and Finland, tenth.  In the crucial areas of technology, management, marketing and finance Ireland ranks near the end in the company of Portugal and Greece.</P>
    <P>The failure of Europe to keep pace with Japan and the US in the field of technological innovations and its market application has become a major cause for concern at European Community level. This led to the adoption by the Community in 1985 of a policy memorandum entitled &ldquo;Towards a European Technology Community&rdquo;&mdash; an indication of the relative decline of Europe, in that European chip manufacturers supply only about 38 per cent of the total European requirements.  The rest are imported from the US and Japan.  The report tells us that Ireland, as an investor in new technology and R and D, is very poor at 0.4 per cent of GDP.  As I have said, Europe, as a whole, is failing to keep pace with the US and Japan.  This will lead to severe difficulties in the future if this trend is not reversed.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses did excellent work and made a number of positive recommendations, many of which were implemented by the last Government.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to one of these recommendations on page 93 of this report.  It states:</P>
    <P>We recommend that a Minister of State with responsibility for Science and Technology be appointed within the Department of Industry and Commerce. This Minister of State would have a co-ordinating role in ensuring that Science and Technology activities of different Departments and State <Col N="295" /> Bodies would be in harmony with overall economic objectives.</P>
    <P>A primary objective would be to ensure that Irish manufacturing and service firms would be fully aware of the likely future impact of Technology on Business and that State policies would be geared towards gaining the maximum benefit from the opportunities provided.</P>
    <P>This recommendation included in the report was signed by the Chairman on 7 January 1987, approximately two months before the change of Government.  I was glad that the present Government accepted our recommendation and I have no doubt that the Minister was also pleased.  For this reason I again appeal to the Minister to use his office to have another Joint Committee on Small Businesses established as I believe it was a major role to play in the development of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the committee on their work on small businesses in general and in particular on this their seventh report on new technology and small businesses.  It is a very comprehensive and significant study at this stage in the country's industrial development.  This committee have been very active and productive since their inception in June 1983.  During 1984 and 1985 the committee published four sectoral reports as the fourth phase of their work.  The first four of these reports dealt with, (1) the manufacturing industry, (2) retail and distribution, (3) tourism, catering and leisure, and (4) construction.  The committee published further reports on the following topics: the insurance problems of small businesses, the development and management of small business co-operatives and the latest report on new technology and the small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker that they were a very progressive and productive committee.  The latest report is particularly significant at this time and it clearly identifies that for the future survival and prosperity of small manufacturing <Col N="296" /> firms in both manufacturing and the service sectors, they need to be aware that they must adopt and introduce new technology into their companies.  Failure to do this will result in a reduction in competitiveness and the possibility of companies just going out of business.</P>
    <P>The development in technology, particularly information technology, will make a wide range of Irish firms open to international competition.  Of course, in turn, these changes will give small Irish firms a wider range of opportunities than was previously available.  The ratification of the Single European Act will give Ireland access to European markets consisting of 320 million people.  This means that firms must adapt and become more competitive because the Single European Act will abolish over 300 non-tariff barriers which at the moment inhibit trade within the Community.  In 1992 when this comes into focus it will expose the weaker Irish companies to competition which we never before experienced.  The report suggests that changes need to be made to enable these small firms to make effective use of new technology to ensure their competitiveness into the 21st century and that they must adapt and realise that they have got to take on this new technology.</P>
    <P>The report states that in some instances the expression &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo; is used in this report as they are often interlinked.  However, the primary concern of the committee is with technology, which is defined by the dictionary as &ldquo;the systematic knowledge of industrial arts.&rdquo; This report goes a long way and will be of great benefit to small industry.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 traces the development of industry from the industrial revolution up to the present day and to the use of the computer.  It also explains in great detail how the computer has developed over the years.  The report has identified that, until the 18th century, all economies were based on agriculture.  Such manufacturing activities as existed were largely rural, often cottage based, and were geared towards very basic standards. From 1750 onwards the means of modern industrial production came about gradually through a series of technological <Col N="297" /> innovations such as advances in spinning and weaving equipment, improvements in iron and steel technology and the development of steam power.</P>
    <P>International trade expanded, developing both new markets and sources of raw materials.  The development of canals and railways made possible the mass transportation of fuel, raw materials and finished goods.  This, in itself, borught about a gradual displacement of people from agricultural based industries into the manufacturing sector.  Through the 19th century technological advances continued.  Electricity was developed. New processes were developed which resulted in higher quality steels and more flexible application of those steels.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to trace the development of the telephone, the typewriter, the motor car, all of which were invented before 1900.  The growth of the industrial base and of industrial employment saw a massive expansion in urban development.  The report goes on to deal with the advances in the social field, including health, education, housing and the increase in the standards of living for the majority of the workforce.  With the advent of mass production, motor cars and other consumer products became available to the public at large at an acceptable price.  At that time the conveyor belts system was introduced and also the specialisation of labour was developed.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the development of a vast range of consumer products which were developed in the 20th century which included radios, telephones, vacuum cleaners, washing machines and other household commodities.  The introduction of mass production led to major reductions in costs and brought the price range of these products within the reach of the average person which provided the continuing impetus for the new product development.  The major changes were brought about by multinational companies such as Ford, General Motors and other large firms.  This also led to the development of small manufacturing and service firms as component suppliers and producers of specialty products to service <Col N="298" /> these multinational companies.</P>
    <P>The trend is the same today particularly in the computer industry.  Many of the large computer manufacturers are sourcing and using small efficient Irish firms &mdash; and there is a great opportunity for small efficient Irish firms &mdash; to take advantage of this new development, just as in the old days small companies were able to take advantage of the development of the much larger and more traditional companies such as car manufactures.</P>
    <P>In the early part of the century the invention of the aeroplane assisted in the development of the tourist industry which was to become the biggest international service industry and also facilitated the enormous growth in business travel.  All of these developments were clearly the result of, and could not have come about without, the technological advances and developments which were made at that time.</P>
    <P>The report states that the term &ldquo;new technology&rdquo;, which at the moment is a buzz word, refers to none of the developments of the earlier industrial revolution. The use of the term &ldquo;new technology&rdquo; is mainly linked to applications of micro-electronics and computer related telecommunications technology.  This is a recognition that computer technology has a revolutionary effect in this and the manufacturing service sectors.  This term &ldquo;new technology&rdquo; also covers areas of manufacturing activities, particularly in biotechnology and new materials which are dealt with elsewhere in this report.  I will refer to it later because I have a particular interest in the use of biotechnology and genetic engineering for the propagation of plant life.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to give a detailed description of the computer and the various components which go to make up the workings of the computer.  The computer is referred to as hardware and the programme is referred to as software.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also that five or six years ago it was not an economic proposition for a small firm to buy a computer because while they might have been able to afford to purchase one the software <Col N="299" /> packages were too expensive, costing £2,000 or £3,000.  It is very significant that in a very short space of time one can buy similar programmes today for less than £100.</P>
    <P>The report also gives a very interesting account of the development of the computer. As the previous speaker stated &mdash; and it certainly caught my imagination when I read through the report &mdash; the first computer actually covered an area of 3,000 cubic feet, weighed 30 tonnes, contained massive amounts of valves and tubes and used substantial amounts of electricity.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to explain that with the development of microelectronics and the miniaturisation of the transistor to the extent that thousands of them can fit in something the size of the head of a pin. It is very difficult to comprehend how this science has developed over the years.</P>
    <P>The development and the mass production of computers and the reduction in costs in recent years have made them not only an option but an essential for small businesses.  They are so inexpensive at present that I would say every household has one, be it a very small type that children use or perhaps one to manage the household budget.  The computer business has been revolutionised and computers are available at a cost where anyone can go out and buy them.  They are now part of the school curriculum; every modern school has computer studies. The computer can also be used in the manufacturing process.</P>
    <P>When people referred to CAM-CAD applications I used to say: &ldquo;Yes, that is very interesting, very essential&rdquo;, but I have to admit that until I read this important and comprehensive report I did not realise that CAD means computer aided design and CAM means computer aided manufacture.  CIM means computer integrated manufacture.  These aids to manufacture have revolutionised the small industry who have had the experience, the knowhow and the money to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one company who five years ago were manufacturing products <Col N="300" /> by the traditional method whereby trained technicians would actually carry out the function in a very painstaking and laborious way.  That company after a lot of research invested in a computer-based laser cutting machine to do the work using this new technology.  This has transformed the company.  When I read through the report I wondered if the people in this company had prior knowledge of what went into this report or if the people who compiled the report got the experience of these very clever entrepreneurs who had the experience and intelligence to adapt their business to the state of the art technology.  Five years ago that company employed eight people.  They now employ 40 people. They have taken over a company in the UK employing an additional 40 people and they have geared themselves up to take advantage of the Single European Act and the market of 320 million people.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also, and this aspect is covered in the report, that this company can take a very technical call from anywhere in the world using this new technology, using the telephone they can send this information through a modem attached to the computer.  The computer will analyse the design and details of the order and it goes straight into the computer based laser cutting machine.  They actually have a turn around of 48 hours. They take in orders from France, Germany or elsewhere.  I am very pleased that this company have shown such initiative and are actually leading Europe.  Their business has grown out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>This is where the future of small Irish industry lies.  The IDA have a part to play and the Minister of State responsible for Science and Technology recognises that it is necessary to identify viable Irish industries and to give to them the necessary technology and machinery to enable them to manufacture a competitively priced product which will sell on the European market.  If we can succeed in doing this it would go a long way towards solving our unfortunate problem of unemployment.  Many of these small companies who as the previous speaker <Col N="301" /> has indicated, lack the necessary expertise, avail of distant markets in the Far East and in the Middle East.  The only reason they are operating and selling into these markets is that they cannot get access to the more lucrative UK and European markets.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the emphasis has switched and, because of the drop in oil prices and the war in Iran and Iraq, these markets are no longer expanding.  These small Irish companies are now very exposed because they have got to fall back on the home based market, which is not very buoyant at the moment, in particular in the services sector and they are finding it impossible to gain access to the more lucrative UK and European markets.</P>
    <P>This report, if one reads through it, clearly recognises this fact.  For that reason I am pleased the Minister has stated that it will be circulated to second level centres of education and, indeed, to third level centres of education.  It should also be circulated via the small business association to every small company in this country.  That is a priority because any company reading this report, analysing it and spending the time to go through it, will benefit greatly.  I would go so far as to say it could save them from liquidation.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 deals with State investment, services and incentives.  There has been a shift away from grant-aiding fixed assets towards what is now defined employment grants.  I would not disagree with this.  It does inhibit business in certain instances. I would like this approach to be flexible because, in certain instances, small companies need the more comprehensive grant package which traditionally gave grants towards fixed assets, rent subsidy grants, interest subsidy grants and in particular, and this is very important, training grants.  There is still money available for feasibility studies which are very necessary and there is also money available for the acquisition of new technology, which is very necessary.  The report clearly identifies that companies must avail of new technology.  I am <Col N="302" /> pleased to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has organised 250 industrialists from Europe to come to Ireland in the summer to meet with Irish firms with a view to forming joint venture agreements.  This would be one way of getting the necessary technology transfer into the small Irish companies.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to offer.  We have probably the best educated youth in Europe. They have proved themselves to be very adaptable and they have got the necessary training and education to adapt to new technology.  I am aware that very large Irish based American computer companies are amazed at the level of productivity of our young people.  I know that companies are prepared to expand their operations because of this level of productivity from our youth.</P>
    <P>I am amazed by the level of learning young people have attained.  I had better not speak about the educational system, but it is the envy of Europe and the United States of America.  This is our great natural resource.  We have a responsibility to our young people to implement every aspect of this report, because it is a formula for success.  If we implement the report in its totality, in a few years we will be able to provide excellent opportunities for our youth and then we will get away from the heartbreak of emigration.</P>
    <P>I want to speak briefly on biotechnology. I am particularly interested in this field because in the course of my travels I have been to many of the Middle East countries and I am aware of the disaster of famine.  There has been a very recent development in the field of plant biotechnology which is receiving particular attention at present due to its connotation as a food provider for the developing world.  It is reasonable to assume that this developing field could create, or would create, a substantial number of jobs but I honestly believe that is of secondary importance.</P>
    <P>The problem with plants is that traditionally constraints on food production derive from the traditional methods of cultivation and production.  Biotechnology is pushing back the horizons of <Col N="303" /> plant production and facilitating the rapid multiplication and hence the production of a wide variety of disease-free food plants.  These plants &mdash; and this is the point I want to make &mdash; are particularly suitable for growth in countries with scarce natural resources such as Ethiopia, Sudan and other Sub-Saharan countries. It is my earnest wish that this technology will be used, and that we will act swiftly in association with other world bodies, the EC, the United Nations, the World Bank and other agencies, to develop this new science of biotechnology particularly in the propagation of food plants and apply it in Third World countries to ensure that a disaster similar to the Ethiopian disaster is averted.  We have the technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised that.  He has set it up.  In my own constituency, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with responsibility for horticulture, Deputy Kirk, has recognised this and has set up a research unit in the University in Cork.  This research should be implemented and implemented quickly because there is a need for it as we all know.  To explain in a little more detail, for use in genetic engineering and biotechnology, it is possible to take very tiny parts from a plant &mdash; for example, let us take a date palm from one of the Sub-Saharan countries.  From the palm tree which is producing the choicest fruit year after year, it is possible with this new technology to reproduce clones of that plant which will produce exactly the same type of fruit with the same yield year after year.  It is possible to produce this in sterile conditions in a laboratory, and it is something we must move on.  I am disappointed that the world agencies have not moved to date, but I am confident that Ireland will act on this research.  We have the technology; now let us apply it.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I wish to speak on.  As regards the recommendations, it is obvious the Government recognise what this report is saying because the Minister has advised us that he has implemented them in one way or <Col N="304" /> another, or he is acting on the implementation of the majority of these recommendations. It is very good to have this commitment from the Minister.  I believe the new board which takes over from the IIRS and the National Board for Science and Technology, namely EOLAS is moving in the right direction under the right leadership of the Minister.  I take this opportunity of commending him for his initiative and his achievements in presenting this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, once again I pay tribute to the Joint Committee on Small Businesses and to its chairman on a very comprehensive and important report.  I am pleased the Minister has taken note of it and is acting on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I compliment the committee on formulating this report.  I would like to refer briefly to Recommendation 8.3.1 headed: &ldquo;Getting Public Service Data Bases On-Line.&rdquo;  This recommendation states:</P>
      <P>We recommend that the NBST prepare a study under the auspices of the EEC's star programme to devise an action plan for electronic business communication with particular reference to getting public service data bases, particularly those in the State Agencies and Companies Office &lsquo;on line&rsquo; to manufacturers, retailers and professional firms.</P>
      <P>One problem facing business today is the lack of access to a rapid and effective supply of information and training.  We should not allow agriculture to be excluded from this recommendation.  We must include agriculture units as small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional philosophical division is becoming irrelevant as farmers now are entering into the challenging era of raw material disposal.  This translates into added value and small industrial enterprises. I will cite examples such as dairying, that is the cottage cheese process; beef, leather and glue-making; forestry, furniture, wood processing and paper. All of these activities need effective access to up-to-date information, that is, <Col N="305" /> on the physical environment, soils, climate, water and land use, a management efficiency system, the demographic situation in a particular area, and the availability of transport and marketing techniques.</P>
    <P>At present, in my own constituency of Wexford a pilot scheme on the setting up of a natural resource and land use data base system is underway.  Expertise at the Johnstown Castle research centre is being applied to maximise the vast pool of knowledge and scientific findings that have been gathered there over the past quarter of a century.  Johnstown Castle research has done the surveying and mapping of soils and land use, nowhere else has this been done, and I urge the Minister that the Johnstown Castle scheme be incorporated in any plans for extra funding or upgrading of technological infrastructure in the south east.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I compliment the Minister and the Joint Committee on Small Businesses and I have no doubt that the Minister will bring these excellent recommendations to fruition.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been debated fairly well by the previous speakers.  They have covered all the details.  I do not have too much to say because I would be repeating what has been said already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for accepting the many recommendations in this report.  I also compliment the Minister for thanking the members of the committee, presided over by Deputy Ivan Yates.  The reason I am on my feet now is that I had the privilege and the pleasure of being a member of that committee.  I know that we issued more reports than any other committee.  Of course, it was a joint committee of all parties; we never had an argument, we never had hassle, it was a great committee.  On the change of Government I asked the Leader of the House at the time the committees were being set up &mdash; I think there was about <Col N="306" /> five or six of the previous committees set up &mdash; if he would use his influence with the Government to set up the Joint Committee on Small Businesses again, and he promised me he would do so.  He thought it would only be a matter of time.  I reminded him a few months later of this and he said he would do his best.  I appeal to the Minister to use his best efforts to set up this committee, in view of the tributes he paid to their work and to the reports they issued.  I do not think anybody could pay a greater tribute, and for that I thank the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Members of this House for the constructive comments which have been made.  I am glad to say as I said in my opening address, that the Government have had the opportunity to implement most, if not all, of the recommendations contained in the report. Members will agree that it is an achievement and quite unprecedented that this should have been done in the short space of time of just one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were various points raised by a number of Members of this House to which I would like to refer.  Senator Kelleher and Senator Jack Daly are anxious that we would set up a committee on small businesses with a wider mandate.  I do not want to give a specific commitment at this particular stage, but certainly it is something to which I would give very serious consideration.  I am most anxious to ensure that small businesses will benefit from all forms of help and advice and I can see the merit in the concept of a committee.  In regard to my own brief, I am particularly concerned that we ensure the new technologies are introduced into small businesses.  I am particularly concerned about our indigenous firms.  I am arranging through the aegis of EOLAS, the new Irish Science and Technological Agency, to ensure that we will have technological audits done on many firms to determine exactly the level of technology being used, because in my opinion &mdash; and this is confirmed in this fine report, and from all my investigations &mdash; that the <Col N="307" /> introduction of new technologies into industry is absolutely vital to ensure the continuing viability of industries.</P>
    <P>Companies must learn to plan ahead and in a position to generate new products and not to continue on the basis that the products they have today will satisfy the demand next year or the year afterwards. This is not so.  New technologies should ensure that companies that are producing products today will be in a position to put new and more advanced products down stream for the marketplace next year and the year afterwards and they should be planning one, two, three or four years ahead.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the introduction of new technologies into companies, I believe we will be able to increase the competitiveness of these companies, because if they do not have these new technologies they will not be able to compete with their international counterparts. They will end up going the sad old road of closing down.  If we can ensure that they introduce new technologies and new products as a result, they will maintain their competitiveness internationally, they will survive and be viable, and we will maintain the jobs that exist and ensure continuing employment for the people who are being employed by these companies up to now.  The other objective of the introduction of new technologies into industry is that they will help, as we increase our technological development on a broad basis, to create many more small start-up high tech companies and these will create jobs.  This is one of the objectives which the Government set out to achieve.  As Senator Kelleher said, we have looked at the examples of success in other countries. He referred to Denmark, Austria and Finland.  I would agree that they are good developmental models for this country.  I would like to assure him and the other Senators that we have extremely good contacts with their development agencies and their science and technological institutions and we have adopted some science and technological programmes <Col N="308" /> which have been started up in these countries, especially in Denmark.  We are not ashamed to admit that if we see something has worked successfully in another country, and that it is a type of programme that would be ideally suited to what we have here, then we have no hesitation in adopting that type of programme because, we are quite prepared to learn from the success of other countries, and we will continue down that road.</P>
    <P>I have had numerous discussions with my colleagues in the European Communities &mdash; the various ministers for science and technology from the EC and other countries.  We compare programmes on both a formal and informal basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher also referred to the need for companies to have up-to-date information.  I would totally agree with this viewpoint.  One of the functions of EOLAS is to create an awareness of information technology.  EOLAS is introducing a system of technology audits, whereby they will send experts into companies to advise them directly of their specific technological needs and to what extent they have developed in a acquiring up-to-date technology within their companies. During the next decade, the new science and technology agency will place increased emphasis on assisting firms to be aware of the importance the role of technology will play in the future development of the firm, and they will intensify activities in that area.  In addition the new agency will concentrate some of their resources in assisting the development of industrial sectors that are important to the future economic growth of the country, for example, the toolmaking industrial sector.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the European programmes.  The comprehensive framework programme on research and technological development adopted by the EC research Ministers offers Irish companies an opportunity of participating in the Community-wide research effort. The new science and technology agency will play a major role in assisting Irish firms to participate in these programmes <Col N="309" /> and bring their research capability in selected areas up to the European level. These programmes include ESPRIT on information technologies; RACE on telecommunications; DELTA on health care and the transport sectors; BRITE, and S &amp; T programme for manufacturing industry biotechnology; and SPITT which is an acronym for Strategic Programme for Innovation and Technology Transfer.  The new agency will place particular emphasis on assisting firms to build up their own capability in research and development so that the firms themselves have the capability of absorbing new technology.</P>
    <P>The first framework programme concluded at the end of 1986 and Irish firms did extraordinarily well in obtaining contracts. In fact they had twice the success rate of many of their European counterparts. We have agreed on the second framework programme, although there was an unnecessary hold-up because a fellow member state &mdash; the United Kingdom in fact &mdash; delayed proceedings for quite a while but it has been finally agreed.  The amount of moneys which are being offered in the various programmes in which we would have a specific interest are quite substantial, and I must say that we feel we achieved a lot in getting this framework programme through.  I anticipate that Irish companies will not alone do as well as they did in the first framework programme &mdash; the second one goes on until 1992 &mdash; but will do better in fact. In the last framework programme they gained something in the region of £30 million.  They can achieve considerably more from this programme.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher also referred to the poor innovative capacity of indigenous industry.  A key aspect of this, he said, is the lack of personnel with appropriate up-to-date information on new technology skills.  I can assure him that this is being addressed by us in a number of ways, through FAS, through teaching companies, through university-cum-industry co-operation in research.  There is no doubt that the innovative capacity <Col N="310" /> of Irish industry is improving.  Our programmes will ensure that this continues. We are aware of the fact that we have highly skilled personnel ready to get involved with these companies.  Our young people, from an educational point of view in terms of computer literacy, are more computer literate <i>per capita</i> than those of any country in Western Europe. They are more computer literate <i>per capita</i> than young people in the United States.  In the past, because we had not the infrastructure which we have since this Government were formed, many of our young people had to emigrate.  Even in the short period since we came to office, approximately 100 highly-skilled Irish graduates have been strategically placed in centres of excellence by our advance manufacturing technology and teaching companies' programmes.  They are now in the process of developing new products from which companies will benefit, but they are being employed in Ireland.  Were it not for what we have done, they would have had to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy referred to the miniaturisation of computers and the lack of development in this field.  We can be very proud of our achievements and of the degree of excellence as regards the development in the miniaturisation of computers which we have secured for Ireland based in the National Microwave Electronic Centre in Cork, which is an attachment of University College, Cork. It is a facility to develop computerised controls for the European Space Agency. At times we are inclined to minimise the quality of our people and our achievements. The skills here have developed to the high extent that, in the face of keen competition from other countries, the European Space Agency decided to locate this facility in Ireland, and, as Senator Kelleher will be delighted to know in Cork.  The standard of expertise there is at the highest level and would stand up to any international scrutiny. Our challenge in the future is to further the use of these technologies in industry. The level of research work in our third <Col N="311" /> level colleges is very high.  This is evidenced by the amount of moneys we have got from the European funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore raised the question of getting public service status on line to firms.  I would like to assure him that the Companies Registration Office have plans in this regard.  The National Board of Science and Technology were studying this and the new body, EOLAS, are studying it at present.  He mentioned the excellence at Johnstown Castle in Wexford. Being a Wexford man, I can compliment him on taking care of his local ventures.  I visited Johnstown Castle recently.  I was highly impressed with the work being done there.  There is potential for increasing development in many areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly, who is a very prominent member of the joint committee which produced this absolutely excellent report has, like Senator Kelleher, appealed to me to set up this special committee for small businesses with a wider mandate. As I said at the beginning, I will give it every consideration and will bear in mind the recommendations which have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for taking this motion.  I am glad the Minister who so ably dealt with the last Bill is here to deal with this matter.  I hope at the end of the case I am about to make he will treat it as favourably as he did the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> I raise the matter of the proposed selling off of the State land, the IDA land bank, by direction of the Government. Every person I have discussed this matter with was saddened that a new Government policy of no hope in the future and no faith that this country can ever provide gainful employment for the youth of this island is now being implemented by this Government in line with the record economic retraction and shrinkage in every other area of economic activity which has felt the brunt of reduced input and expenditure.  Without hope, life loses all sense and meaning.</P>
    <P>The most startling aspect of this Government's policies over the past year has been the policy decision to sell off the industrial infrastructure which was acquired by the IDA with considerable aid from the regional fund of the EC. How can this cost saving by the Government be reconciled with the fact that 50 per cent of the cost of assembling this crucial infrastructural amenity was paid for by the EC?</P>
    <P>We have, for example, a prime natural and national resource in the Shannon Estuary, offering the potential for major manufacturing industry.  It was a sign of the determination of a previous Government that the IDA built up a land bank of 600 acres to enable our country to facilitate even the largest multinational company who might consider establishing in Ireland.  The previous Administration had prepared their own Single Estuarial Authority Bill for the Shannon Estuary in order to promote its development.  When there was a change of Government, that Bill died.  I understand the Government are at the moment preparing their own Bill.  It would not be reasonable to think that they would dispose of this land bank before the Bill is passed.  Selling off this land bank when the value of land has gone down so much, and seeing that land was bought in the first instance when it was at its highest price, would be a recipe for bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I know he has a soft spot for north Kerry.  He works <Col N="313" /> through the recess and reserves his holidays for the Listowel race week every year.  He knows as much about north Kerry and the Shannon estuary as I do and I will not bore him with details of what he knows already.  However, I would like to say a few things for the benefit of the House.  The Minister will probably tell me that the Bill dealing with the Shannon estuary will not be too long delayed.  For that reason, if for no other reason, it would not be reasonable to think of disposing of this land.  To sell it at a time when prices are at their lowest and having bought it when land was at its highest price would be a recipe for bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>In the Leas-Chathaoirleach's constituency of Laois-Offaly land is to be sold as well.  I appreciate the financial difficulties of the IDA.  They are not alone in that boat.  Everybody in business is having a tough time with cash flow at the present time but that does not mean they should go and sell the silver.  This is not the time to do it.  This land bank was identified as being the best site of the estuary.  We can refer to the report of An Foras Forbartha, 1987.  There was a further report showing the water depth capable of takng vessels up to 400,000 tonnes with a depth of 25 metres of water offshore.  In a further report of 1984 it was pointed out that if the entrance to the estuary was dredged at a cost of £5 million ships of over 400,000 tonnes could come in.  Planning application for a smelter was applied for at that time.  A planning application for an oil refinery was examined at considerable expense by the Kerry County Council.  Information collected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair would be obliged if the Senator would deal with the question from a national point of view.  We are discussing the proposed selling of the IDA land banks by direction of Government policy.  The Senator might keep to the wider Government policy and not dwell fully on local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, you are <Col N="314" /> getting 20 acres taken away from you in your own constituency.  The whole point of my argument is that Tarbert and Ballylongford are the only industrial sites in the Republic adjacent to the exceptional facility of the deep water of the Shannon Estuary.  Those sites would be suitable for large heavy industry like a smelter, as the late George Colley envisaged when this land was purchased.  Also envisaged at that time was the plant in Moneypoint.  The plant at Moneypoint was provided with a large capacity to cater for industry on either side.  It will go from Kerry to Limerick, and into Clare.  As this sale is going to take place throughout the whole Twenty-six Counties, if you give me the time, a Leas-Chathaoirligh and if the Minister is prepared to sit and listen, I will deal with it on a national basis.  Have the Government abandoned all hope of ever attracting heavy industry to this country in the future?  Without hope, life loses all sense and meaning.</P>
      <P>The importance of having a land bank available for interested parties gives us a lead start over countries like Scotland, Wales and Spain, who have very attractive incentives available for industrialists. The recent Electricity (Supply Amendment) Bill will give Government authority to Moneypoint to import coal for wholesale purposes.  This should create a further interest in the estuary among shipping interests.</P>
      <P>The IDA grants given to people for setting up in industry were very valuable and were responsible for many industries, some of which could not have been set up without the grants.  If the IDA had given grants to people who, having got the grants did not develop and then offered for sale the sites which they bought and for which they were grant-aided, what would be the reaction of the Government?  Naturally, they would say that this is not on.  There is no game that two cannot play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that nobody in my native kingdom of Kerry has the aspirations of a monarch, yet most of us realise how we should be ruled.  That reality has been awakened in our minds <Col N="315" /> by a Government decision which, if carried out, could destroy the hopes and the visions of our youth for ever more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, immediately on their return to office last March, recognised the enormity of the task they faced in restoring a sense of confidence and optimism to the Irish economy after a prolonged period of recession.  They set about their task with vigour and enthusiasm and tackled wholeheartedly the single greatest deterrent to economic progress, the national debt.</P>
      <P>Because of the quick and decisive action taken by the Government in their budgetary policy the economic climate and outlook are now much improved. There is a new sense of optimism and confidence in the economy, so much so that business investment confidence has been restored.  This is evidenced by the fact that investment in manufacturing industry in 1987 increased by 5 per cent compared to an almost total lack of growth in recent years.  This change came about as a result of renewed confidence in the economy following the Government's decisive leadership which saw the following: a reduction of 5 percentage points in interest rates; a reversal of the damaging outflow of funds from the economy; inflation at below 3 per cent for the year, the best performance for over 20 years; industrial exports breaking all records with growth at 14 per cent in 1987 over the corresponding figure in 1986 leading to total exports for the year of £10.7 billion and an unsurpassed trade surplus of £1.5 billion; output in manufacturing industry increased by just over 10 per cent or three times the rate of growth in the previous two years with industrial production rising by 13 per cent over 1986.</P>

    <P>Comparing that with what Senator Daly said, whom I was delighted to hear speak about his native Kerry, would not lead anybody to believe that there is any <Col N="316" /> sense of hopelessness for this country or for anybody in it.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental concern which the Government had in implementing their economic policy was to ensure that all sectors should contribute their fair share to the process of national recovery, either through direct developmental programmes or through maintaining the quality and efficiency of services with reduced expenditure allocations.  In line with the sacrifice that has to be borne throughout the public sector, the Industrial Development Authority, must make do with less funding while continuing to discharge their responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>At the end of December 1987 the IDA had two million square feet of vacant advance factory space and 5,700 acres of land at various locations around the country. The Government took the view that some of this space was superfluous to our industrial development needs and that it could be disposed of without any adverse effect on industrial development while making a positive contribution to the Exchequer's finances.  In any analysis of that type of decision would any business man with assets of that size have them laying idle for so many years?  The land that Senator Daly referred to was brought in 1973, the first 100 acres.  That is 15 years ago.  The next portion was bought ten years ago.  Nothing has happened down there within the period but the land does not go away.  The land still stays in County Kerry.  The water does not change and the Shannon Estuary does not change.  That Bill will be coming along very shortly.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that unless every sector is seen to contribute its fair share in the process of national recovery, we cannot hope to maintain the consensus that prevails at present in relation to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is in this context that the IDA's programmes in support of industrial development are being streamlined with greater selectivity in the type of projects assisted and with more emphasis being placed on performance-related conditions to grant <Col N="317" /> payments and a greater use of repayable form of assistance.  All these measures are aimed at securing better value for the taxpayers' money and at a lower overall cost while achieving the targets set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>In relation to the sale of IDA land and buildings, the Industrial Development Authority have advised me that they have completed plans for the rationalisation of their property portfolio, on an evenly balanced basis nationwide, in line with the Government's direction that they should raise £5 million towards Exchequer financing in 1988.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the programme will involve the sale, after public advertising, of 19 sites totalling 1,622 acres of land and five factories with a total square footage of 73,850 sq feet.  The factories and sites have been carefully selected by the IDA on a regional basis and all IDA regions have been included in the first phase, including my own.  I should stress that it was the IDA and not the Government who identified the sites and factories to be sold.</P>
    <P>The sites were selected on the basis that there had been no major expenditure on services such as roads, water, sewerage or electricity connections.  Some of the sites are part of larger developments which are not now required by the IDA or are residual portions unsuitable for further development.</P>
    <P>Sites, both developed and undeveloped, are being maintained by the IDA in each of the regions to promote the establishment of new industrial enterprises as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The undeveloped sites being retained can be developed at more reasonable rates for the taxpayer-Exchequer than the sites being sold.</P>
    <P>The IDA have actively promoted the factories now selected for sale at both regional and international level without success.  These factories will represent an opportunity for the local business community and entrepreneurs to establish new enterprise and create jobs for the local communities.  Many times in the past advance factories were being sought by people in the distribution trade for <Col N="318" /> storage, distribution or whatever, could not be disposed of under legislation by the IDA.  This does give an opportunity for that type of development to take place.  The factories concerned are over five years old and have never been occupied.</P>
    <P>Arrangements regarding the appointments of local auctioneering firms are now at the final stages and these firms will act on behalf of the IDA to dispose of the property by public auction, public tender or private treaty as appropriate. This will result in the best price being obtained for the land and factories at this phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>After the disposal of the first phase of land and buildings the sale of further lands and factories will take place with the same criteria on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>The IDA will continue to actively promote their remaining land and buildings in favour of the establishment of new manufacturing industries and internationally traded services in order to secure the creation of approximately 37,000 first time jobs over the three year period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>In relation to the Kerry situation, I understand that a balance of over 100 acres, which is the equivalent of what was required in the first instance, is being kept.  It is the land beside the river, but I would stress again that I am debarred by legislation from getting involved or making any directives, good bad or indifferent, in relation to the day-to-day activities of the IDA.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, whether until his new estuarial Bill is debated and comes into force, he would put a stop on the sale of the land in the Shannon estuary?  I know there are 100 acres there.  I know that is being kept out of 605 acres.  There is no equivalent to the 500 acres in the country.  The Minister knows that.  I can see speculators coming in and buying this at a public auction.  I presume there will be no reserve.</P>

      <P>I am asking a question. Will this land be sold with no reserve?  If the land is sold with no reserve, speculators can come in, they can buy this land and sell it for ten times the price in the future.</P>

      <P>I have not said there will be no reserve.  The disposal is a matter of day-to-day operations for the IDA.  I am sure the Senator knows quite well and appreciates that I do not have <Col N="320" /> the authority or power in legislation to direct the stop of any particular sale.  The IDA are aware of the esturial Bill coming up.  I am not in a position to say what reserve or otherwise would be put on it, but I would doubt very much if a site like that would be given away for half nothing as some people might suggest.</P>
