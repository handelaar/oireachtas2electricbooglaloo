      <P>The proposal to withdraw school transport contracts from Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Shea as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and amendment No. 1 will also be taken with Item No. 3. The Minister has to leave at 12.30 p.m. so probably we will not take any more of the Bill today.  I will talk to the Whips about whether we will adjourn at 12.30 p.m. or start the Courts Bill.

      <P>Item No. 3 is a motion in the name of the Labour Party which would normally be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I have been discussing this with other Members of the House today and because it coincides with one of the most important national events in the sporting world, when Ireland will be playing the Soviet Union and in order to facilitate all the Members to be able to participate in what will be a victory I would like, if the House agrees, to change Private Members' Time from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. and thus allow people to see the match and resume afterwards.  Possibly from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. would be more suitable to allow the Adjournment debate to take place then.  I put that as a change not to the Order of Business but to the time we take the motion.</P>

      <P>I take it from what the Acting Leader of the House said that we will be attempting to take all or Part VI of the Companies Bill today and if we reach the end of Part VI we would then finish consideration of that Bill today.  If that is the case, I totally support that.  I have been asking all along that we would take a certain section or part of it per-week. I would welcome that.  The proposal is that we would work on the Companies Bill until 12.30 p.m. and finish <Col N="519" /> then or earlier if we have finished all of Part VI.  I want clarification as to what we are doing.</P>

      <P>As far as the suggestion made by Senator Ferris is concerned, I have no objection to it.  I agree with Senator Murphy that it is not a thing that we want to do.  The trouble is that, if we do this for one function, others will look for it afterwards.  Senator Murphy himself might, if Cork were playing Tipperary in the All-Ireland.  If we are to do it, from 6 o'clock to 7.30 p.m. would be the best arrangement.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 133:</P>
    <P>In page 87, to delete lines 13 to 24 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;245A.&mdash;If in the course of an examination under section 245 it appears to the court that any person being examined&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is indebted to the company, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has in his possession or control any money, property or books and papers of the company,</P>
    <P>the court may order such person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to pay to the liquidator the amount of the debt or any part thereof, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> (ii)  to pay, deliver, convey, surrender or transfer to the liquidator such money, property or books and papers or any part thereof,</P>
    <P>as the case may be, at such time and in such manner and on such terms as the court may direct.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is to section 98 of the Bill which, as Senators know, deals with the court ordering persons, if necessary, to repay debts to a company, property or so on.  The amendment is designed to tighten up in a number of respects the new section No. 245A that we are inserting here in the 1963 Act.  However, rather than having several piecemeal amendments we thought it would be preferably simply to substitute a new section 245A within the present section 98 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The basic purpose of this section, as presently drafted, is to strengthen the position of the liquidator in order to improve the efficiency of liquidations generally.  The section gives power to the court to determine questions relating to the property of a company in the context of an examination under section 245 and to order the delivery to the liquidator of any property or the payment of any debts which the court considers are due to the company.</P>
      <P>The amendments which are now proposed do not change the substance of the section as it is in the Bill.  They are designed to improve the operations.  The amendment will alter the section as presently there in three different ways. First, the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; is being extended to include any money, books or papers.  The reason for this is to ensure that the court has the power to order the return of any property of the company whatsoever, not just real property.  This is a distinction made elsewhere in the 1963 Act, for example, in section 236.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second change to the section removes the reference to an application being made by the liquidator.  It is intended that the court should have the <Col N="521" /> power to determine any questions relating to property of the company or indebtedness to the company in the context of an examination under section 245.  It will, therefore, not be necessary for the liquidator to apply to the court separately for such a ruling.  The object of this and like sections is to avoid a double process and to do complete justice in the winding up. It is only in rare circumstances and rare instances that a separate action should be brought instead of using the jurisdiction given by the section.</P>
    <P>The third and final amendment to the section is designed to ensure that the liquidator, in having any property of the company delivered to him, will actually acquire proper title to the property.  This applies essentially in relation to the real property of the company.  The section, as presently drafted, provides that the court may require that property be delivered to the liquidator.  This, however, would only entitle the liquidator to possession of the property without acquiring whatever legal title to which the company may have a right.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in a winding up the liquidator should perfect his title to the assets of the company as far as possible. The proposed amendment, therefore, provides that the court may require not only that property should be delivered to the liquidator but also that legal title to the property should be transferred to the liquidator whether by means of a conveyance or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. It strengthens what was intended by the section.  It also will have worried some of those people who are trying to find ways around the implementation of this legislation when it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on the record my appreciation of the work done by the ministerial advisers and the workers in the Department.  As the Chair knows, I rarely stand up here without complimenting public servants in some form or another, that being their sole vice very often.  Any complaints I have had over the past few months have never been directed at the excellent work done by <Col N="522" /> the people who have put together all the various amendments to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 98, as drafted, will have a bearing on previous legislation. This amendment is welcome.  It broadens the scope of the liquidator and gives him an opportunity to recover any outstanding moneys, properties or other such items.  I certainly welcome it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 98, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 99.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 134:</P>
      <P>In page 88, line 10, after &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the report attached thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (c) and (d) of the new section provides for a report to be made on the declaration of solvency by an independent person who, by virtue of subsection (3), must be someone qualified to be the auditor of the company.  Paragraph (d) requires that the statutory declaration must embody a statement by the independent person that he has given his consent to the issue of the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say by way of introduction, that section 99 of the Bill substitutes a new section for section 256 of the 1963 Act.  That section deals with the declaration of solvency made and delivered to the registrar of companies by the directors of a company in the members voluntary winding up.  It is this declaration of solvency that distinguishes a members voluntary winding up from a creditors voluntary winding up.  I should also say that the purpose of amendment No. 134 is to make it clear that the independent person, in giving his consent to the issue of the statutory declaration of solvency, is only in fact consenting to the inclusion of his report in the declaration.  It is that inclusion he is agreeing to.  He is not in any way to be taken to be consenting to the actual making of the declaration itself by the directors since that is really none of <Col N="523" /> his affair.  The paragraph, as it currently stands, would have this undesirable and unnecessary effect.  This amendment should clear that up.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 135:</P>
    <P>In page 88, lines 19 to 27, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The report shall state whether, in his opinion and to the best of his information and according to the explanations given to him&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the opinion of the directors referred to in subsection (1), and</P>
    <P>(b)  the statement of the company's assets and liabilities embodied in the said declaration,</P>
    <P>are reasonable.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to us that the requirement in subsection (4), as it presently stands, of the new section 256, which we are inserting here, would require the independent person to carry out no less than a full audit of the company's affairs before he would be able or indeed prepared to give the opinion required by paragraph (b) of that subsection, particularly since the independent person could be leaving himself open to personal liability under subsection (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly a requirement of a full audit would unnecessarily dissipate the assets of what is, after all, supposed to be a solvent company.  It would also far exceed what we want, which is basically some form of simple check on whether the directors are in effect telling the truth in their statutory declaration of solvency. Therefore amendment No. 135 will confine the duty of the independent person to giving his opinion as to the reasonableness of the directors' opinion about the company's ability to pay their debts and the prepared statement of assets and <Col N="524" /> liabilities.  This would go back to our original idea of a simple check on the making of declarations of solvency in members' voluntary liquidations while at the same time avoiding the unnecessary expense of what would amount to a full audit of the company's affairs before the declaration was actually made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear on the reason for replacing the words &ldquo;a true and fair view&rdquo;.  I understand that terminology but not the terminology &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I know that it is in the previous subparagraph and it has been used before.  Could the Minister explain to me the difference between &ldquo;a true and fair&rdquo; report and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, the type of criteria that would be employed to distinguish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;A true and fair view&rdquo; is a well known accountancy concept. You will not get any qualified accountancy personnel to declare that something reflects a true and fair view.  They will not really do that unless they carry out a full audit.  That would be the core of their professional approach.  Subsection (4) (b) says &ldquo;a statement of the company's assets and liabilities embodied in the said declaration gives a true and fair view&rdquo;.  You would in fact be asking people to find that it gives a true and fair view.  They would not do that without a full audit and it would seem unreasonable to get a full audit done at that stage of the company.</P>
      <P>We want here to ensure that, when the directors make a declaration that the company is solvent, some independent person has a look at that and says &ldquo;Yes, that is reasonable&rdquo;.  It was not envisaged that a complete audit of the company, costing perhaps thousands of pounds, would then again take place.  That would be unreasonable.  Provided a suitable person is prepared to declare that the opinion of the directors is reasonable, that should suffice.  The words &ldquo;true and fair&rdquo; have to come out because it is a whole new concept, which is difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the definition of &ldquo;true and fair&rdquo;, but I am still <Col N="525" /> not sure what &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; means.  That is giving me a problem.  I can understand the reasons for the exclusion of &ldquo;true and fair&rdquo; but I do not know what &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; means in this context.  I am not trying to be awkward here.  For instance, could the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; be determined by the type of information made available to this person?  I know the Minister tried to cover that earlier, but could he take me through that part of it again? Is there a possibility of a snow job being done on this person to try to get him to say it is reasonable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, a company proposing to wind up would statutorily declare they are solvent.  They would prepare a statement of affairs saying &ldquo;We are solvent&rdquo;.  We are trying in this section to make sure we have some check on that.  There was no check in the past.  It was in the 1963 Act.  Directors could say &ldquo;We are solvent.  Here is a statement of affairs&rdquo; and leave it at that.  We are now bringing in an outsider who says, &ldquo;You say you are solvent.  Let us take a look at it and make sure you are&rdquo;.  How far you go on that road is what we are debating. Do you go down the full road of a company proposing to close down or to wind up saying they are solvent and therefore winding up?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, they are two related amendments and they are fairly straightforward.  They are really designed <Col N="526" /> to improve the wording.  Subsection (6) of this section is supplementary to subsection (5) and provides that, where a court has ordered that a members' voluntary winding up should be converted into a creditors' voluntary winding up, then the person who held the office of liquidator before the order was made must deliver a copy of the order to the registrar of companies.  Amendment No. 136 is designed to take account of a situation which could arise where there would be no liquidator acting.  The members' liquidator could have resigned or died, for example, If this happened neither subsection (6) nor subsection (7) could work.  The amendment would rectify this by providing that in such a situation the obligation would fall back on the company to notify the Registrar of Companies as to any court order made under the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 137 is primarily consequential on the previous one to subsection (6).  The obligation created under subsection (6) to notify the Registrar of Companies will, as a result of amendment No. 136, now fall on the liquidator or, where there is none, on the company.  It is, therefore, inappropriate for subsection (7) to refer just to the company and every officer in default.  The term &ldquo;any person&rdquo; in amendment No. 137 is intended to cover both the company and the liquidator, whichever is under the obligation in subsection (6) to notify the Registrar.  They are two fairly technical amendments designed to improve the wording of section 99.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 137:</P>
      <P>In page 88, lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;the company and every officer of the company&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any person&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 99 is welcome as it closes up certain loose areas which enabled company directors to avoid facing up to the reality of the insolvency of their company by initiating a members' voluntary winding up based on a nonrealistic statement of assets and liabilities. This section also provides for the preparation by the independent person of a report stating that in his opinion the declaration of solvency is a true and fair statement of the financial state of the company at that particular time.  Directors making reckless statements regarding declarations of solvency and, indeed, any independent persons making a report on such matters shall now be personally liable for all or any of the debts of the company.  This strengthens the legislation as a whole and I welcome it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 138:</P>

      <P>(2)  The powers conferred on the liquidator by section 276 of the Principal Act shall not be exercised, except with sanction of the court, during the period before the holding of the creditors' meeting under section 266 of that Act.</P>

      <P>(a)  to take into his custody or under his control all the property to which the company is or appears to be entitled;</P>

    <P>(5)  If default is made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by the company in complying with subsection (1) and (2) of section 266 of the Principal Act, or</P>
    <P>(b)  by the directors in complying with subsection (3) of the said section,</P>
    <P>the liquidator shall, within 7 days of the relevant day, apply to the court for directions as to the manner in which that default is to be remedied.</P>
    <P>(6) &lsquo;The relevant day&rsquo; means the day on which the liquidator was nominated by the company or the day on which he first became aware of the default, whichever is the later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is aimed at a device or abuse which is known as centre binding.  Just to brief the Seanad on it, this abuse takes its nature from the UK case of Centre Bind Limited in 1967. What happened there was that the members of an insolvent company resolved to go into voluntary liquidation. They appointed their own liquidator and, before any creditors meeting had been held, they took immediate steps to restrain the Inland Revenue from proceeding against the company's assets. The judge held that the liquidator had been properly appointed and that he had power to act until the creditors meeting had been held.  Although the actions of the company and their liquidator in the Centre Bind case were done entirely in <Col N="529" /> good faith, the practice developed of calling only a shareholders' meeting in the first instance to pass a winding up resolution and, although the company were known to be insolvent, deliberately putting off for some time, or perhaps indefinitely, the holding of a creditors meeting.</P>
      <P>This, of course, would be in breach in our case of section 266(1) of the 1963 Act. However, it means that the controllers of a company with the aid of an unscrupulous liquidator could effectively sell off the assets at a knock down price to a buyer closely connected with themselves and the creditors would then be powerless to prevent it.  The way section 100 tackles this problem is to require ten days notice to be given of every shareholders' winding-up meeting, regardless of whether any other provision would allow meetings called at shorter notice or, indeed, would allow winding-up resolutions to be passed without having a meeting at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have since looked at how the UK tackled this problem in their recent Insolvency Act.  The UK approach seems, on balance, to be somewhat better than our own.  The exact UK reference is section 166 of their Insolvency Act, 1986. While our section 100 takes the approach of actually requiring a shareholders' meeting in every case of voluntary winding-up and, indeed, requiring a mandatory ten days notice of such a meeting, the UK approach is to allow a liquidator to be appointed before the creditors' meeting is actually held but to severely restrict its powers, for example, to dispose of assets in that intervening period. This will still allow a shareholders' meeting to be called at shorter than usual notice in an effort to preserve the company's assets.  It would also allow the company to have no actual meeting for the purpose of passing a winding-up resolution, but to avail of section 141(8) of the 1963 Act, which allows a company to pass a resolution without having a meeting if all the shareholders agree in writing. Thus, the amendment would have the effect of countering the practice of centre <Col N="530" /> binding by preventing the dissipation of assets before a creditors' meeting while also preserving the existing flexibility of shareholders to actually put their company into liquidation at a time of their own choosing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that this explanation is a bit long, but I want to try to explain as fully as I can the background to section 100 as it stands, as well as the reasons that amendment No. 138 would be a better way to tackle this identified abuse.</P>

      <P>Although these two amendments arise in different sections of the Bill, the background to them is somewhat similar.  They are both intended to ensure that notice of creditors' meetings are advertised in good time <Col N="531" /> in the newspapers.  I will take amendment No. 140 first; this would introduce a new section in the Bill, which would in turn amend section 266(2) of the 1963 Act, the section which requires a creditors' meeting to be called in a creditors' voluntary winding-up.  The company are usually insolvent in such cases.</P>
      <P>Section 266 requires notice of the creditors' meeting to be published in the newspapers, but it does not actually put any deadline on it and that is clearly a defect in the present legislation.  It has been strongly suggested to us that some companies have taken advantage of the absence of such a time limit by putting the advertisement only in the press on the very morning of the creditors' meetings, in other words, in the hope that they will not have to face too many angry creditors on the day.  Amendment No. 140, therefore, would simply require newspaper notices of creditors' meetings to be published at least ten days before that meeting.</P>
      <P>I am proposing a similar amendment, No. 139, to section 101, which amends section 261 of the Principal Act.  That section requires the liquidator in a members' voluntary winding-up to call a meeting of creditors if he forms the view that the company will not, as previously thought, be able to pay their debts in full. It has been suggested to us that in the same way as with ordinary creditors' meetings, the absence of a deadline for newspaper advertisements could be taken advantage of by the liquidator in a section 261 type case.  He might only put the advertisement in the press on the very morning of the creditors' meeting.  While these two related amendments are clearly important to avoid actual and potential abuse of creditors' meetings, it is also desirable to embody the best practice in the statute and for that reason it is important to put these time constraints into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 141 would insert a new section, 276A, in the 1963 Act and in effect, expands on our original idea.  As currently drafted, section 102 requires that the chairman of any meeting at which a liquidator is appointed must notify the liquidator in writing within seven days of the meeting, <Col N="533" /> unless the liquidator or his representative is actually present at the meeting.  While this section has been, generally, welcomed, some professional bodies have asked us to go further.  These people referred to situations where a liquidator is sometimes not aware of his actual appointment until well after the winding-up meeting and while section 102 certainly goes some way to rectifying this, it has been suggested &mdash; and we would agree &mdash; that a liquidator in any voluntary winding-up should be required to give his consent to act in advance of his appointment.  Such a consent is already required in practice in a winding-up by the court and amendment No. 141 will introduce the very same concept for these types of voluntary liquidations.</P>
      <P>As for the form of the amendment itself, we thought that, rather than amend the section in a piecemeal way, it would be simpler to replace the existing section 102 of the Bill altogether by a new version of the section and in the amended version only subsection (1) is actually new.  We are trying to improve the procedure in regard to the appointment of a liquidator by making sure that he gives his consent in advance of being appointed, and this seems reasonable.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 103.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 142:</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 103 of the Bill amends section 285 of the 1963 Act which deals with preferential payments in a winding up.  Liquidations can often be delayed in a situation where the liquidator feels that the position in relation to preferential debts is uncertain and he is afraid of a late claim.  In order to speed up matters this section provides that the liquidator can exclude any preferential creditors who do not come forward within six months of his advertising for claims. Amendment No. 142 is a straightforward <Col N="535" /> drafting amendment which simply substitutes the more normal word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; in paragraph (a) for the rather curious word &ldquo;intimated&rdquo;.  I do not know why we chose the word &ldquo;intimated&rdquo; in the first place but, reading it a second time, it does seem out of place.  Therefore, I think the word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; is better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The same word had me greatly confused as a student going to school.  I always got it confused with &ldquo;intimidate&rdquo;.  Consequently I have always found the word &ldquo;intimate&rdquo; very intimidating over the years.  I can see arguments for and against it in terms of the meaning of the word, and what it was meant to cover.  The word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; indicates a certain action, and semantically it does mean a written notification. I know the meaning of the word has changed nowadays.  I am not saying it could only be interpreted as written communication but that was the original meaning of it.  I presume, and I want this clarified, that the interpretation of the word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; could include &ldquo;told&rdquo; or &ldquo;faxed&rdquo; or any other way in which the person is informed.</P>
      <P>The objection I have to the word &ldquo;intimated&rdquo; is that it does not actually mean anything.  It could be a hint, a nod or a wink, or &ldquo;you owe me a few bob&rdquo; without any sort of clear notification.  The word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; means that it is clearly established that the person is informed.  It achieves clarity.  For that reason I welcome it.  However, I would not like to think we were closing down some forms of communication.  I would like to be reassured that there is no possibility that &ldquo;notified&rdquo; creates a problem.  The Minister said this is a drafting amendment and, therefore, there will be no problem. The word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; is a much clearer and easier word to deal with.  I would like to be assured that it is not intended in any way to change what was intended originally.</P>

      <P>It is not intended to change what was intended originally.  It would be a foolish creditor who would <Col N="536" /> not notify in writing first of all.  The normal every day practice would be notification in writing but it does not exclude notification by any other means.  If it specifically insisted on notification in writing it would say &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;.  Therefore, the broadest meaning of the word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; is what we have in mind here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 143:</P>
      <P>In page 91, between lines 15 and 16, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  All rights arising from pension funds contributed to by employees shall be protected in the winding up of a company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked me to propose this amendment in his absence.  I am doing so formally because I have not done the background research on it.  It seems it is intended quite clearly to protect pension funds.  Before I go into a long explanation perhaps the Minister could tell me what provisions are already in the legislation to protect pension funds.  In other words, if the Minister can assure me that this amendment is not necessary, I will not press it.</P>
      <P>The workers' future is dependent on their pension fund.  I have no doubt that the Minister is as concerned about this as the trade union movement or any reasonable employer.  The amendment is put down to try to protect pension funds. Perhaps the Minister could tell me that pension funds are protected in previous legislation.  I would like to hear the Minister's response before pushing this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is substantial <Col N="537" /> protection at present.  The actual wording of that amendment &ldquo;shall be protected in the winding up&rdquo; is quite meaningless legally.  The proposed wording would not help.  In my own area of responsibility, company law already provides protection for pension contributions where the company concerned goes into liquidation.  In particular, under section 10 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, unpaid company superannuation contributions due after 15 June 1982 and members' contributions deducted after that date but not remitted by the company to the trustees of the company pension schemes, were added to the list of preferential creditors in the event of a company going into liquidation.  They were turned into preferential creditors in the 1982 Act.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am aware that there have been cases where, despite the protection of preferential status, companies have gone into liquidation leaving the pension fund high and dry.  The increased penalties and remedies which we are building into the Bill generally should greatly reduce such abuse.  I am thinking here of the provisions in later sections of this Part about fraudulent and reckless trading and indeed about the provisions in Part VII of the Bill in relation to disqualification and restriction of company directors.  The major step forward in this area was making these contributions a preferential creditor, which is about as much protection as one can give.  Combined with the reckless and fraudulent trading provisions coming up later, it is probably as far as one can go. I certainly cannot think of a device which would protect them any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we will have a lot of discussion on reckless, fraudulent and wrongful trading and so on.  It was my impression that pension funds were preferential creditors.  I recall that it was said in the discussion on the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982 that legislation had been introduced in Britain which made it compulsory that pension funds would be self-supporting, in other words, they would stand alone from the accounts <Col N="538" /> of the company.  Not only could there be no fradulent interference, but they had to be in a position to meet the liabilities that could arise at any time.  Payments made since 1982 are protected but does that mean that payments made before 1982 are not protected?  I just want clarification on this point.  For example, if a 25-year old company are wound up &mdash; many of their employees will have been there for 20 years &mdash; will their pensions be fully protected under the present legislation, in that if the company dies, the pension fund is there?</P>
      <P>One of the reasons there is such bad practice in this area is that the Government give a very bad example by not having a pension fund of their own and paying pensions out of a current account, but that is a separate issue.  I would like the pension fund of a company to be in a position to meet their commitments at any time, should the company be wound up.  In other words, the former employees, now unemployed, would have a pension dependent on their years' service and their contributions.  I recognise that this may be moving away from the amendment, and may be complicating it needlessly.  The Labour Party put down this amendment because they felt this was another opportunity for companies to eat into the pension fund.  Does the present legislation allow moneys paid before 1982 to be put at risk when the company is being wound up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that 1982 was a watershed in that it made the contributions preferential.  Before that date they were not preferential but they were a debt nevertheless.  They were an ordinary debt and ranked as an ordinary creditor not as a preferential creditor. Therefore, they only had that measure of protection of an ordinary creditor and, depending on the extent of the deficit of the insolvent company, they either got their contributions or they did not.  Turning them into a preferential makes it much much likely that the contributions will be protected.  That is the first point. Before 1982 there was far less protection than there is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> On the question of pensions overall, the brief of the Minister for Social Welfare, as Senators know, includes matters relating to the area of pension schemes. The National Pension Board who were set up to advise him on all aspects of occupational pension schemes reported to him in January 1987.  Senators may be aware of the board's report which concluded basically that there was a lack of comprehensive supervisory framework for pension schemes and that there was a need for much greater accountability with regard to the management and operation of these schemes.  The board recommended to him that most of the shortcomings they identified should be addressed by the introduction of a Pensions Bill.  I understand that consultations are at present going on between the Minister for Social Welfare and interested parties about suggested Pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>My view now would be that it would be better to let the Minister for Social Welfare in a proposed Pensions Bill perhaps deal with the further question of how better to protect the pension funds because that precisely is what this board recommended to him and it is very very much in that area right now.  In company legislation all we can seek to do is to ensure the preferential status and that the reckless and insolvency stipulations and fines, and so on, are sufficiently strong to ensure that, from a company point of view, matters are dealt with properly.  The best way to handle what the Senator has in mind is the Pensions Bill if the Minister decides to go ahead with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy but I cannot respond to the impeccable logic of the Minister.  Of course it would be better dealt with in a Pensions Bill.  I was hoping that some protection might be brought in, in the meantime.  I saw the report on pensions, not the January 1987 but a later one at the very end of 1987 or perhaps January 1988.  It struck me on reading that report that we have a major job to do to bring into the national psyche <Col N="540" /> the importance of pensions.  They really are being very badly managed, not deliberately by people but in terms of the controls over them.  For that reason I would agree with the Minister in saying that we badly need a Pensions Bill. People feel that paying into the pension fund is sufficient but the constraints on it are not quite well enough spelt out.  In fact, much of the advice being offered at the moment is incorrect advice.  In that report, for instance, they made particular play of the fact that many workers like to get a large lump sum and a small pension, as opposed to a small lump sum and a larger proportion of pension.  They would maintain that the second option should be the requirement and that the choice should not be there at all.  I agree with that, particularly with people tending to live longer nowadays.  I accept the Minister's explanation and reluctantly withdraw the amendment because I feel I am leaving people without cover in some sense.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 103 as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is appropriate to talk on the section about preferential creditors or payments on this section or the next one.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not looked more deeply at the whole question of preferential creditors.  We have, on the one hand, the lending institutions and, on the other hand, the Revenue Commissioners. Looking at firms who had liquidity problems over the past 20 years in the midlands my view is that, in the main, it was either the Revenue Commissioners or the lending institutions who were pulling the plug at a time advantageous to them.  Especially from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners there seems to be absolutely no thought about the national interest or the national good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an anomaly here.  I accept fully that the Revenue Commissioners are guided and bound by the Finance Acts <Col N="541" /> and that they have an obligation to collect finance.  It is daft that, for the sake of outstanding amounts of taxes or VAT, a company can be put into liquidation or receivership while the amount owing to and recoverable by the Revenue Commissioners is greatly exceeded in many cases by the amounts paid either in redundancy payments by the State or by the dole in the following period.  Surely this is an area that the Minister should have confronted head on in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am definitely quite confident that the banks would not be so quick in putting liquidators in companies if they did not get the first slice and the largest slice of the cake.  Have the Minister's Department given any thought to this huge problem and does he hope to improve the situation not only for the people working in these concerns but also for people who in the normal course of trade and commerce are caught with sales to those firms?&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to dissociate myself totally from the words of Senator McDonald on this issue.  I certainly would not in any sense agree with the argument that he was putting forward there.  This idea that the State should in some sense downgrade itself in the collection of its due debt is something to which I do not subscribe having spoken time and time again here about the recklessness &mdash; to use that word not in the context of the Companies Bill &mdash; of people operating and not paying the State what they duly owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the contrary view also.  I think that when taxes are paid by individual people, let us say workers in an enterprise or VAT paid by people who purchase goods, there is a public duty on the Revenue Commissioners not alone to collect that but to collect it promptly.  A further reason I would say is that unpaid taxes, be they PAYE, or PRSI, or VAT, may well be a very important signal that <Col N="542" /> companies are in trouble.  If, in fact, the Revenue Commissioners do not move early enough, it may be too late to pick up the pieces at a later point and the employees, of course, in particular, can be the most vulnerable at the end of the day.  The point I want to make is that I would favour the prompt collection of taxes by the Revenue Commissioners. That could lead &mdash; and I have this from liquidators &mdash; to better chances for survival at the end of the day if the problems are faced early enough.</P>
      <P>There is the temptation obviously when companies get into trouble for employers &mdash; and psychologically it is understandable enough &mdash; to disguise or conceal their problems for as long as possible. That disguise process takes place in respect of employees as well.  That is not fair to the various parties including suppliers. Could I make a further point since we are on the preferential treatment for the Revenue Commissioners?  I am not convinced really that they should have preferential status.  I think uncollected taxes form a very small part of the total Revenue take in a country.  Take the collapse of a supermarket, and we had an example recently.  What about the small suppliers who did not have preferential status, some of whom are now gone out of business?</P>
      <P>I will make two points in summary. One is that the Revenue should act promptly to collect debts.  They have a public duty to do so and it is provocative for employees, in particular, who pay their PAYE if, in fact, the employer does not pay over what they have already paid promptly.  The second point is that I am not convinced about the preferential status for the Revenue Commissioners because I think there are other more vulnerable creditors in situations like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that many interested parties feel this opportunity should be taken to encourage all creditors to be more vigilant in the collection of debts due to them.  Negligence in debt collection tends to encourage and results in bad debts, <Col N="543" /> trading under the appearance of solvency and ultimately fraudulent trading.  In this regard the Government have in the past year shown a willingness to grasp the nettle and have put pressure on the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities to collect unpaid taxes and other charges.  Many people believe that the Revenue Commissioners should carry out this duty without reliance on preferential status in the event of a company winding up.  The fact that income tax, capital tax, capital gains tax, acquisition tax, rates and other taxation remains unpaid should not justify giving preferential status to the Revenue Commissioners. As Senator Hillery has pointed out, a bad debt owed to the State is likely to be insignificant in terms of total Government receipts while the loss of a similar sum to a supplier could result in serious hardship and further insolvencies.</P>
      <P>I recognise that certain debts owed to the State are in respect of moneys collected by a debtor on behalf of the State, for which the debtor could be said to have trustee status.  I do not think anyone would disagree that in that instance preferential status is indeed justified. However, I ask the Minister to consider reducing the preferential period for VAT and excise duty to the last complete period of say, six months, for which returns ought to have been collected and to consider reducing the preferential period for PAYE and PRSI payments to the last three months for which returns ought to have been collected.  Would the Minister consider some movement in that area?</P>

As I understand it, because of moneys outstanding to the State in taxation the State is given preferential status and it is intended to retain this provision in this legislation, unless we propose otherwise.  I am well aware of the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry on this issue.  I do not agree with that particular point of view but I want <Col N="544" /> to make it clear that if we let this section go through as it stands, and indeed the next section as it stands, we will preserve the present position and the State in respect of moneys due to it in VAT, income tax, corporation tax and everything else will be given preferential status.  I would certainly support that point of view.  We can make all sorts of arguments in favour of letting the State get the last whack of whatever is left but, as has been said previously, this is an intimation of what is going to happen later on.  It is a precipitation of the inevitable and I do not believe it is a protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 144:</P>
      <P>In page 91, before section 104, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 285 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of subsection (2) (a) (ii)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have put down this amendment for the reasons outlined by my colleagues, Senators Hillery and Mulroy.  They rightly point out that there are a number of reasons why it might not be appropriate to give preferential status to the Revenue Commissioners.  First of all, a number of small suppliers of goods to various businesses who found themselves in financial difficulties have been thrown to the wind, as it were, and have collapsed as a result of the failure of the larger company or concern.  There are many examples we could give to show how the balance is tilted in favour of the State rather than in favour of the business involved which would enable them to bring about an appropriate reconstruction of the ailing company.  I agree with Senator O'Toole and other Senators when they say it would be a lot better if a company, large or small, were tackled by the Revenue Commissioners at an earlier stage in order to establish what their difficulties are and an earlier decision made on the payment of their taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts recently revealed that the Revenue Commissioners have been less than speedy in their actions in bringing people to heel in relation to unpaid taxes.  I know of companies who have been written to by the Revenue Commissioners who outlined to them the amount of taxation owed and the consequences of failing to pay that money but who did not receive any further communication from the Revenue Commissioners for two and a half years.  This kind of inaction has brought about many company collapses and we have to face up to that fact.  The Revenue Commissioners because of their preferential status know they are going to get their money at the end of the day if a company collapses and this has led to <Col N="546" /> complacency on the part of the State in so far as that it gobbles up any moneys owed to it at the expense of the smaller unsecured creditors who get no recompense on the collapse of the company. We could give many examples to show this.  H. Williams is one example.  The receiver or the liquidator concerned is supposed to get the best price they can for goods to be sold but they do not.  In many cases they are happy once they have secured sufficient finance to keep their secured and preferential creditors happy and very little effort is made to bring about a pool of resources which would give unsecured creditors as little as 20p or 25p in the pound.</P>
    <P>Section 285 (2) (a) (ii) of the Principal Act states:</P>
    <P>All assessed taxes, including income tax and corporation profits tax, assessed on the company up to the 5th day of April next before the relevant date and not exceeding in the whole one year's assessment;</P>
    <P>This is regarded as giving preferential status to the State on the winding-up of a company.  The Revenue Commissioners now have the power of attachment and they are becoming complacent in relation to the collection of taxes, a duty which they are required to carry out under legislation. I would not suggest for one moment that they should not carry out their duties or let people away without paying their taxes, far from it.  The balance in company law has gone against the smaller unsecured creditor who needs some protection. We can all give examples of small unsecured creditors who inevitably collapsed following the collapse of a larger firm.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the arguments I have made and while not tilting the balance against the State, as the State is obliged to get in taxes owed to it in the first place and it should be seen to be doing so, he should consider providing some relief for the unsecured creditor who unlike the preferential or secured creditors has nothing to fall back on.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to amendment No. <Col N="547" /> 145.  Section 285 (2) (a) (iii) of the Principal Act states:</P>
    <P>Any amount due at the relevant date in respect of sums which an employer is liable for under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, and any regulations thereunder to deduct from emoluments to which Part II of that Act applies paid by him during the period of 12 months next before the relevant date reduced by any amount which he was under that Act and any regulation thereunder liable to repay during the said period, with the addition of intererst payable under section 8 of that Act....</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the amount of interest required to be paid along with the outstanding principal to the Revenue Commissioners and to secured creditors places an enormous burden on a company in receivership or liquidation and it extracts money which should remain to enable a payout to be given to the smaller unsecured creditors.  The Revenue Commissioners and the banks already have some security in that they have the deeds of the property concerned.  They could sell that property to cover the repayment of the outstanding debt.  It is grossly unfair that, when unsecured creditors and preferential and secured creditors try to get their money in the event of a liquidation or receivership, we are prepared to support legislation which will give precedence solely to the Revenue Commissioners and the secured creditors with no thought being given to the other unsecured creditors, who are equally important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Hogan, and what he has stated, giving an advantage to certain people in the event of a liquidation can have a terrible effect on some small businesses and some individual might find himself ruined as a result of a liquidation.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me, but I do not <Col N="548" /> know what the origin of giving preferential treatment to the Revenue Commissioners in the event of liquidation is. The Revenue Commissioners already have certain advantages over other people who trade or who deal with companies. The Revenue Commissioners deal with, or should be dealing with, a company on an annual basis or perhaps on a monthly basis and the symptoms of trouble in a company should become apparent to the Revenue Commissioners at an early date.</P>
      <P>An early symptom is, and it is part of Irish company culture nowadays, that you do not make your corporation tax, income tax or PAYE payments to the Revenue Commissioners if you find yourself getting into difficulty.  The last thing some companies think about when in difficulty is making their returns to the Revenue Commissioners; but that should be a warning to the Revenue Commissioners that trouble is looming in that company. They should ensure that they investigate the company in good time to see if they are generating enough profits &mdash; that would be one of the results of a proper investigation &mdash; to pay the Revenue Commissioners what is due to them and, by a clear extension of that argument, what is due to small creditors.  That is what this amendment seeks to achieve &mdash; to protect the small man, who may be a supplier to a company, who may find himself ruined because he has supplied goods or services to a company which were not paid for or who had paid for goods which had not been delivered at the time of the liquidation.  He may not find himself getting 25p in the pound but perhaps only a penny in the pound.  We want the Minister to seriously consider these amendments and I will not repeat the very eloquent and very comprehensive case which has been made by my colleague.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate to remind the House that the small man in this case is not the person who owns a supply company but the guy who will be out of a job at the end of the day and who will be dependent on the State <Col N="549" /> to look after him or her.  The only way the State can look after him or her is by the due and proper collection of taxes.</P>
      <P>Before we continue this discussion I think it is appropriate that we, I do not have the Principal Act before me, get a list of those to be given priority or preferential treatment so that we know exactly what we are talking about.  I dislike a discussion where it becomes the State against the rest.  I want to see all the players involved in this game before we decide which ones we will take out of the game.  Perhaps, the Minister will accommodate us by letting us know who are to be given preferential treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support my colleagues who have put their names to these amendments, which are extremely important.  Earlier I asked for the Revenue Commissioners to lose the status they have been given of preferential creditors; and I am not advocating that people should be slow in paying their taxes or not pay their taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners are well established. They have every facility and, I presume, an adequate number of staff.  I am aware that the very small trader receives a visit from the Revenue Commissioners or the VAT man on a monthly basis.  These small traders are the unpaid tax collectors. When a company is in difficulties I do not see why the State should be given preference over the small suppliers. During the last number of years we have seen quite definite examples of this.  The majority of small companies who went into liquidation did so because they had not been paid for goods supplied.  It is most unfair.  I cannot understand why trading stock, whether it is livestock or grain or bread, which a small manufacturer or producer sells to a firm, which may not be added to or improved by the buyer and which is not even paid for, is considered to be an asset of the company who goes into liquidation, by virtue of the fact that the stock is inside the entrance gate of the company.  The Minister should consider introducing a system whereby trading companies would keep a special register of trading stock.  I am <Col N="550" /> aware that most of the big supermarket chains at present obtain several months credit from their suppliers, big and small, and it is most unfortunate that a small or large company can be put out of business through the failure of the larger combine to pay up, which has a knock-on effect.</P>
      <P>I was a Member of this House when the Principal Act was enacted in 1963, that is a long time ago.  I do not anticipate that we will have similar legislation before the Oireachtas again for another 20 years.  The Minister must take this opportunity to provide some protection for those people who in good faith dispose of their produce or stock.  The system in operation of late seems to be that as soon as traders in difficulty seem to be stocked up at the expense of bona fide businesses, the preferential creditors are promoted to pull the plug.  This is most unfair.  The purpose of these amendments is to bring about a change whereby people who sell commodities to trading companies will have some protection and will get some proportion of the cost of the unpaid stock.  That should prevent people from being at a total loss and I ask the Minister to endeavour to improve the position because it is absolutely iniquitous at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Revenue Commissioners being given preferential treatment in respect of moneys that have been collected by a company.  The legislation, as drafted does help small companies in the area of cashflow. The fact that the Revenue Commissioners have preferential status for a 12 month period in respect of unpaid taxes makes them a little less concerned as to when they collect those taxes.  I am aware that in some cases they wait 12 months before collecting it.  This amounted to a double-edged sword in that many companies who are experiencing trading difficulties often use this money as a cashflow to give extended credit, in the hope that they will be paid for the goods and that they in turn will be able to pay the Revenue Commissioners eventually.  If the Revenue Commissioners were entitled to six months <Col N="551" /> preferential status in respect of outstanding taxes only they would obviously be more vigilant and more energetic in the collection of those taxes and this cashflow, if you like would be lost to the small supplier.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the small businessman.  When a small company supply goods they should have some protection, such as being allowed to retain title to those goods.  Let us take as an example a company who supply goods to a sub-contractor carrying out a Government contract.  If that sub-contractor goes out of business, not having paid for the goods, that small businessman loses the value of those goods even though they were supplied to a sub-contractor carrying out a Government contract.  A design group, architect and engineers will have been appointed by the Department who in turn would have appointed sub-contractors. Yet, the nominated supplier is caught for the value of the goods.  I am not sure whether I should deal with this matter under this section but I think supplies, particularly on Government contracts, should be given more protection. If they are nominated suppliers they should be allowed to retain title to those goods.  It should be written into the Bill that nominated suppliers would be guaranteed payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that I was not convinced of the merit of having preferential status accorded to the Revenue Commissioners.  I would give a greater priority to the prompt collection of taxes by the Revenue Commissioners themselves.  Here we are talking about liquidations after the event as it were.  I am of the belief that some liquidations at least could be avoided if taxes due to the Government were collected promptly by the Revenue Commissioners.  I can understand why people make a plea to the Revenue Commissioners for the postponement of the collection of taxes in the hope that a company would survive and jobs would be preserved but they may well be doing a bad day's turn for all <Col N="552" /> concerned by not having prompt collection. The point I am making is that the Minister, in his ministerial capacity within the Government, might use his influence to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners act promptly in the collection of taxes.  After all, PAYE is a hot potato at present and here we are talking about workers who have paid over their taxes to their employers.  We now find in many cases that the employers in turn have not actually paid over that money to the State or have not paid it promptly, so it is highly provocative in that sense. My plea would be not so much for preferential status but rather for the Minister to take the more preventive measure, if you like, whereby the Revenue Commissioners would be urged by whatever means to collect the taxes promptly that have already been paid over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the debate on this taxation question. Let me start by saying that this is a very fundamental issue.  One of the most fundamental issues in this new Companies (No. 2) Bill is whether we should give the taxman preferential treatment. That is a very central issue.  There are very good reasons why we should and I listened very carefully to the reasons why we should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the collection of taxes.  I doubt that there is anybody in the country today who is <Col N="553" /> under any illusion as to the resoluteness of the Revenue Commissioners which is quite the opposite to what some Senators indicated to be the case.  I have been told in my own clinics and by the business community that the Revenue Commissioners have never been as tough or as difficult.  If there are Senators who, from their experience, can tell me that that is not the case I would certainly welcome hearing from them.  With the power of attachment, threat of prison, publication of people's names and with sheriffs having extraordinarily tough attitudes at present, I understand that the Revenue are collecting taxes as toughly and as accurately as they possibly can. Senators should consider whether they are arguing for an even tougher approach.  What kind of a State that might lead us into is an issue that we could debate here for many a long day.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that the method of collection is improving and the Revenue are now by and large getting in taxation due in a manner which they never did before because of the very strong powers they have and which they are most certainly using.  That is borne out by what I have been told by the business community.  I do not want to leave any impression in the Seanad today that the Revenue are soft on the collection of taxes and that if they went out, like everybody else, and got their money there would be no problem.  Not only are they going out, like everybody else, but they are ahead of everybody else right now and getting their money.  I want to make that clear in the strongest possible way.</P>
    <P>The reality is that income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax are preferential for any 12 month period for which those taxes are due.  They are company taxes.  With regard to PAYE, PRSI and VAT, the position is that PAYE and VAT are due to the Revenue Commissioners and PRSI to the Department of Social Welfare and they are preferential for the most recent 12 months.  That is not perhaps the most technical way of expressing it, but that <Col N="554" /> is the idea.  The rates due to the local authority are preferential for the previous 12 months.  Wages and salaries due to employees for the previous four months are preferential and, as we discussed earlier under the 1982 Act, pensions contributions are preferential.  That has been an open-ended preferential contribution since the introduction of the 1982 Act.</P>
    <P>All of these rank together as preferential creditors and Senators are no doubt aware of the order of preferential creditors.  The first thing paid in a liquidation is the expenses of liquidation, which one could have a very exciting debate on; then the fixed charges and fixed assets are looked after properly; then the preferential creditors are paid; then the floating charges are paid, and what is left is for the unsecured creditors. Obviously, what we are talking about today is a change in that order.  That is the proposal from the Senators who have put down this amendment.  Section 285 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides that certain debts shall rank in priority to all other debts in a winding up, and I have listed those here today.  Section 98 of the 1963 Act applies the provisions of section 285 to receiverships.  These preferential debts are, therefore, paid after the holders of fixed charges and before floating charges and unsecured creditors.  I have given the Senators their order of ranking.</P>
    <P>The principal reasons that sums due in respect of unpaid tax ought to have priority are, first, because such sums are owed to the community and, secondly, because the Revenue Commissioners are an involuntary creditor.  Unlike other creditors they cannot choose whom they do business with.  They are obliged to accept their taxpayers as they find them and cannot generally avoid giving them credit.  Indeed, it could be said that taxing authorities necessarily operate after the event.  Even if there are no delays on the part of the taxpayer, there will inevitably be a significant lapse of time after the transactions giving rise to the tax liability before any attempt to collect the tax can be made.  There is no means such as may be available to private creditors to restrict <Col N="555" /> the amount of credit which they extend or to require existing tax liabilities to be discharged before further transactions giving rise to fresh tax liabilities are entered into.  By definition it rolls automatically. Furthermore, it is a common experience to find that a taxpayer, in his efforts to avoid impending insolvency, has ignored the demands for payment of tax while continuing to pay suppliers and other creditors whose goodwill is essential to his commercial survival.  Because it is preferential, one could argue that very often this device enables the small man to get paid.  One could turn the argument one is making on its head, but that is not the intention.  Because the Revenue Commissioners are preferential creditors perhaps one could argue that the small man does get paid.  That is not the intention of either of us in what we are trying to do.  Obviously, we are trying to make sure that everybody gets paid, but one should think twice or three times before one automatically removes the preferential treatment in order to help the small man because very often it may have the opposite effect for him.</P>
    <P>In the case of PAYE in particular the State's claim is for moneys actually collected by the debtor and for which the debtor is accountable to the State.  The debtor is, therefore, really a tax collector rather than a taxpayer.  Unless some measure of priority was accorded to the State for moneys collected on its behalf, those moneys would go to swell the insolvent's estate to the advantage of the general body of creditors.  It is not acceptable that the statutory provisions enacted for the more convenient collection of the Revenue Commissioners should accrue to the benefit of private creditors.</P>
    <P>Criticism is sometimes levelled at the Revenue Commissioners over their alleged heavy-handedness in pursuing tax debts with the result that businesses have collapsed when they could have survived. The argument goes &ldquo;If they had been allowed some more time ...&rdquo;  To be realistic, and many Senators have said this, if financial help is needed it should be sought from sources other than the <Col N="556" /> public purse.  In practice I understand that some limited measure of flexibility is generally shown by the Revenue Commissioners if there appears to be a bona fide case of short term difficulty in finding cash to pay a particular bill.  It is worth noting that although the Cork Committee in the United Kingdom recommended a number of changes in this area, they recommended also that the Revenue Commissioner's preference in relation to PAYE should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Senators that I have listened very carefully to the arguments they have made and I can find sympathy with some of the points made.  I would like to give some further thought to those points between now and Report Stage.  I could not accept this amendment as it is presently worded and, if it is pushed, I would have to totally reject it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very complex issues involved in, for example, company taxation.  This is an example taken at random.  There are interesting arguments as to whether or not the preferential status should be maintained in that area because that is money which is due by the company.  In other areas &mdash; for example, PAYE and so on &mdash; that money is held in trust by the company to be passed on to the State.  Perhaps that is an entirely different argument and one which brings us into the area of community money. I would like to think further about the broader issues involved and to feel free to raise them again in the Seanad at a later date if I decide that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has not exactly thrown out the baby with the bathwater in rejecting completely out of hand the arguments we have made.  I welcome his intention to consider the situation between now and Report Stage.  I hope that his consideration will be long and hard and that he will come up with an appropriate Government amendment in order to rank the position of unsecured creditors much higher and much more meaningful than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the arguments and points made by the Minister that the Revenue <Col N="557" /> Commissioners must have some hold on a company so that they can get the right amount of taxes due to them.  The experience over the last number of years has been that the Revenue Commissioners delayed for a long time before they moved in order to get what they were rightfully owed by a company.  They delayed to such an extent that the company went into an even worse financial situation because, as the Minister rightly pointed out, creditors, smaller suppliers and even larger suppliers, used the VAT and unpaid taxes due to the Revenue Commissioners in order to keep their companies solvent.  I condemn that activity and it is one which should not be part of the commercial scene.  Nevertheless, the collection of taxes is, as laid down by the Oireachtas, the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and there is no excuse whatsoever for the Revenue Commissioners in allowing a situation to develop over a period of time whereby a substantial amount of money is owed to the State by a company.  Unfortunately, as the situation gets worse, smaller suppliers and creditors to that company are left in an even more vulnerable position.  This is why we are seeking an expeditious and accelerated process of tax collection in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad that various new measures have been brought in over a period of years in order to speed up the system of collection.  This will ensure that the delay of up to two and a half years in issuing a second reminder to a company to pay taxes which I mentioned earlier will not occur in the future and that a second reminder will issue within six months.  I assure the Minister that he will have the support of the Fine Gael Party in seeking to give a higher ranking to the smaller supplier of goods to a firm that goes into receivership or liquidation through no fault of the supplier of goods.  Because a company involved in a co-operative, a meat processing company or even a company as large as H. Williams owe large amounts of money to small suppliers of goods this means that, unfortunately the <Col N="558" /> small suppliers are in an untenable position and substantially more jobs are going to be lost as a result of that inactivity by the Revenue Commissioners.  We are seeking to have a higher recognition of the position of unsecured creditors included in this legislation.  I hope the Minister will be able to frame an appropriate amendment to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want immediately to make the point that Senator Hogan in his contribution took a somewhat different line to the one he opened up with.  He opened up saying that the preferential status should be taken away from the State whereas he finished up by saying that a better preference should be given to the smaller supplier.  Indeed, if there was an amendment before us which would in some way protect the smaller supplier there would be some way in which I could look at it, but there is not the slightest possibility that I would support any attempt to take away the preferential status of the State in the collection of tax due to it.</P>
      <P>The general attitude towards this was well summed up by Senator Connor, who said that not paying the Revenue Commissioners has become part of our culture. It has been, and they are the first people to suffer.  In my speech on Second Stage I made the point that the person who takes the decision in the first place not to pay due taxation at the proper time is the person who should be held liable for it.  I believe very strongly in this and I agree with the Minister that it is a key aspect of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Revenue Commissioners can do no wrong.  I have heard all the arguments.  The Minister referred to the question of the sheriffs and we all agree with the point he put forward.  The Revenue Commissioners are prepared to be reasonable and to go along to the companies and say: &ldquo;If you cannot pay it now, we will do a deal with you and maybe we will defer it.&rdquo;  If they do that they are liable not get paid if the company is wound up, but on, the other hand, somebody could say that the Revenue Commissioners should have been easier <Col N="559" /> in dealing with these people a year ago. They are in a no-win situation.  They more than any other group need the support of elected representatives.  They are attempting to do an impossible and absolutely unpopular job and they deserve our support.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on resisting the advances of the CII and other groups in their proposals for changes in this area. I am sorry if they seem to have made some impact on my two colleagues in the Government benches, but I am here to defend the Minister and I will continue to defend him against his colleagues as well as the other side of the House.  I am not finished yet, Senator Hogan, so you can relax.</P>

      <P>I also looked at the recommendations of the Cork report on this and I noted the Minister's somewhat selective quote from that issue.  I noted, somewhat poignantly, that the first recommendation of the Cork report was that the funeral, etc., expenses of a bankrupt person should also get number one preferential treatment.  I thought that showed a little bit of humanity.  Putting the existing legislation in the context of the proposed changes and also in the context of the Cork report, the Minister is doing an excellent job in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are hearing here is the old story of hit the State and protect everybody else.  As I said at the beginning, if a company got out of business the person who is going to suffer as much as anybody else is the worker at the end of the line who is going to be out of a job.  The one place that worker can turn for support in the immediate future is to the State.  The State can support such workers only if tax duly owed has been collected.  I am not impressed by the arguments that sometimes the State should not collect, that other times they should collect, that other times they should send out the sheriff but that at other times they should not.  They cannot win in that situation. They have to do the best they can.  They <Col N="560" /> are understaffed and that is one of the reasons they have problems.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that the case for taking the preferential status from the duly owed taxation in this case does not in any sense meet the case put forward very eloquently by my colleagues in the Fine Gael benches.  Of course, the first thing that will happen with the change in this legislation is that companies will be able to go out and borrow.  At present if a company in trouble looks for money from a bank or lending institution all parties know that if the company is wound up the State will get first preference. Therefore, the lending institutions will be quite slow in putting money forward.</P>
    <P>The other immediate effect it will have on the workings of the company is that, of course, it would impact on the credit period.  The main reason small suppliers lose out in this area is because the large companies, quite unfairly, insist on long periods of credit.  I have spoken on this before.  From our discussions on the Cecchini report we are aware that one of the big problems is not market share but is the share of the distribution outlets which control a large amount of the market.  If one company control 80 per cent of the market and a supplier is trying to get into it, the company will make demands and look for three months credit, or whatever would be inappropriate, and free supply for a period of time or that the supplier has to take back unused goods.  I am aware of the pressures that are put on small supplier's but that problem should be dealt with at that level; this is not the way to deal with it.  The idea of the State having to pick up the pieces one more time because of the unacceptable practices of those people who put unfair pressure on small suppliers is not the right way to deal with the problem.  We should look at who is causing the problem and deal with it there.  A strong case has been made to protect the small supplier.  No one can doubt that fact, but this is not the way to go about doing it.  That is my basic objection.  I agree with the comments that in this case the balance is with the State.  I welcome the fact that the <Col N="561" /> balance is with the State in this case.  In order to deal with the problems created by giving this balance to the State, there should be another structure, but this is not the one.  I am opposed to the amendment and I support the existing section as it is written into the companies legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can take issue with any of the comments Senator O'Toole has made because we all know that in any legislation, particularly if we are talking about preferential creditors, that the State must have a primacy.  We realise the primacy of the State, the Revenue Commissioners, Fóir Teoranta and all the other agencies that are involved with companies and employers. However, a balance must be struck because if we were to operate the system as outlined a possible 20,000 jobs could be lost.  That is the reality.  People employ other people at tremendous cost to themselves and incentives must be given to employers to continue holding people in employment.  If everybody met their immediate obligations to the State there could be widespread unemployment.</P>
      <P>Recently a Minister of State advocated that employers should give young people an opportunity or start in order to stop emigration.  However, the reality is that there is relatively little incentive for companies to do that because it can cost an employer something like £50 per week to employ one person.  I should like more people to be employed directly by companies which have an incentive to do so and that they would not be penalised. There are penalties involved in the creation of employment and that is one of the problems we will have to address in our efforts to ensure that more people are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the rights of employees and that is why I had an amendment down to the previous section, which my colleague, Senator O'Toole, moved in my absence.  In previous legislation preferential treatment was given to the entitlements of employees in an insolvency but unfortunately pension funds were not <Col N="562" /> included.  Anomalies arose with two or three companies where the pension funds and pension rights of people were not protected when the company went into insolvency.  All the other rights of employees such as wages, holiday pay, pay in lieu of notice, etc. were protected and gladly became the responsibility of the State.  This legislation followed a European Directive and was back-dated to 1985.  Unfortunately, pension funds were excluded from that legislation.  That is why we in the Labour Party considered that the Companies (No. 2) Act should contain a relevant section.  Perhaps the Minister would look at the possibility of updating the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act which gives preferential treatment to employees, when a company goes out of business.</P>
    <P>The concept of the small supplier is one that cannot be overstated.  Small employers also employ people.  They are usually family companies and they employ people in good faith.  They may supply materials and services to a larger company which may go out of business and, therefore, we must worry about the implications of that for smaller businesses. That is the balance these amendments are trying to achieve.  Nobody wants to remove the predominance of the State and its entitlements, whether it is through Fóir Teoranta, the IDA or the Revenue Commissioners, but we must have a balance so that small companies are not put out of business through no fault of their own.  In a recent well-known case the contributing companies were the sufferers and suffered job losses.  The Minister has a major responsibility in this area.  He is attuned to the problem and is forthcoming in our efforts to strike a happy balance.</P>
    <P>I would not be too optimistic about how generously the Revenue Commissioners deal with people who are in difficulty because I have seen proposals made to the Revenue Commissioners by companies.  Those proposals on the repayment of tax were brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners by the companies and not <i>vice versa.</i> They brought certain anomalies and <Col N="563" /> errors to their attention and companies who employed up to 30 people set down a programme for the repayment of the debts they owed.  The Revenue Commissioners were not prepared to give companies an opportunity to do that and they put a company into liquidation, which realised 50 per cent less than what the company had offered as a first instalment. You can operate everything according to the book but you may not necessarily achieve the desired results. Therefore, a balance is required.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that the State must have a preference but, after that, we must have regard for the small suppliers who employ people.  They should not be forgotten in the overall context of the service industry.  The service industry is often the only employer in small towns which have a small manufacturing base.  The service industry is one of our most important industries and it gives considerable employment.  I think that is recognised by the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not understand his argument.  This State has the most advanced &mdash; I do not want to use the word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo;&mdash; and strongest legislation for the recoupment or repayment of taxes of any State in the Community, with the possible exception of Denmark.  That being said, I do not think that if it fails to use the machinery that is at its disposal, which is almost draconian, it should get its pound of flesh off the backs of the small private individual, whether he has a firm, is a farmer, or whatever, because taking money earned by the small supplier will put additional people out of work and out of business.  With respect, that is the argument we make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All companies such as meat factories or grain merchants should legally have to <Col N="564" /> maintain a separate trading stock account.  This trading stock account should be kept separate from other assets and if a company goes into receivership all money collected for stock on hands should go into this account.  If my memory serves me correctly, there was a similar section in the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Bill which was enacted some eight to ten years ago.  That would not be a novel idea but it would give some security to the small suppliers.  I do not accept that the Revenue Commissioners and the secured creditors should be guaranteed payment at the expense of the small producer or small supplier.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Minister to examine the retention of title clause which would, perhaps, maintain the ownership of produce or goods supplied until such time as they were paid for and exclude a situation whereby receivers would come in.  This is a difficult problem and I very much appreciate the Minister's undertaking to look at it again.  Perhaps on Report Stage he might be able to meet this vexatious problem which causes much hardship and backache for people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitive but there are a number of points I should like to put straight.  I do not wish to be at any cross-purposes with my good friend Senator O'Toole.  He quoted me as saying that it is part of Irish culture that we do not pay our taxes.  I said it is a part of company culture and because there are cultures and subcultures about everything nowadays I am sure there is a company culture also.  I want to elaborate on my essential point and set down clearly my view on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can accept the argument for preferential treatment for the protection of pensions and wages but I find great difficulty in giving this open-ended preferential treatment to the Revenue Commissioners.  In my earlier submission I pointed out the advantage the Revenue Commisioners have in knowing the progress of a particular company because of their fairly constant contact with the company.  That kind of contact need not necessarily exist for a supplier, a small <Col N="565" /> company, or an individual.  When I refer to suppliers and small companies I am referring also to the people they employ because they can be directly affected by the liquidation of a company.  They too can lose their jobs if the dominoes start to fall right down along the line and naturally we have to think of them sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has an open mind on the argument in relation to giving preferential treatment to the Revenue Commissioners and that he intends at least to think about it and come back to it on Report Stage.  I leave him with the suggestion that that aspect needs to be looked at because the Revenue Commissioners have extraordinary powers.  They have protection under the law in the collection of taxation and, as somebody said, they are bound by Acts of this Oireachtas to collect their taxation. Part of their duty is to know exactly the solvency, health and ability of a company to pay the taxation it duly owes to the State.</P>
    <P>In the very nature of things, a pension fund, of course, does not have that kind of information open to it.  A supplier who has a normal trading relationship with a company takes it at face value and always acts in good faith.  A supplier does not have that kind of information open to him.  Of course, the unfortunate workers, whether they be in the company which is in difficulty or in the companies that will be put into difficulty by the insolvency or the liquidation of the first company, do not have that open to them.  I am making the plea that we should create a level field, if you like, for the people &mdash; all the players, if you like &mdash; and we give preferential treatment to the workers for their immediate wages and their pensions, etc., but that the Revenue Commissioners would take their place in the level field with all the other unsecured creditors of any company in the unfortunate event of a liquidation or a winding up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners for moneys such as <Col N="566" /> PAYE and PRSI which were collected and held in trust by a company.  I am pleased that the Minister will consider removing this on corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The big problem in this country is the taxes that are not being collected.  I believe this legislation will give the Revenue Commissioners the necessary ways and means to collect this outstanding tax because the problem behind this for the small supplier and the small businessman is extended credit.  One of the reasons he has to give extended credit is competition. One of the reasons he has this unfair competition is the number of fly-by-night operators who are out there and whom the Revenue Commissioners cannot touch.  Until this legislation is enacted the problem will still be with us.</P>
      <P>There are companies that are actually using the 25 per cent VAT just to keep the company going and that is their profits and overheads.  It is the VAT they are using.  When the Revenue Commissioners finally catch up with them, what do they do?  They change the company name and set up again the next day. Until this legislation is enacted, we will have that problem and the sooner the legislation is enacted the better for everybody.</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1986: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts Bill, 1986, which has been passed by the Dáil, contains important procedural reforms in relation to the hearing of personal and fatal injury cases in the High Court.  These cases comprise the vast majority of civil jury actions in the High Court &mdash; perhaps as much as 95 per cent of such actions.  They are cases that involve many ordinary people as plaintiffs in actions for damages for personal injury or fatal injury caused through the negligence of others and most of these cases arise from traffic accidents.</P>
      <P>As a matter of policy, we should be concerned that the administration of justice in these cases can provide compensation that is fair to plaintiffs having regard to the injuries and the other relevant circumstances that are involved; that the injured plaintiffs receive compensation with the minimum of delay, and that the legal costs involved in disposing of these cases &mdash; many of which are simple and straightforward &mdash; are reduced as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that the courts should be as consistent and predictable as is possible in the award of damages. It is desirable that litigants who receive similar injuries, and whose personal circumstances are also similar, should be compensated in a consistent manner. Also the prospects of settling cases at an early stage, before heavy costs are <Col N="568" /> incurred, is greatly enhanced if the manner in which the courts deal with cases that come to trial, and the compensation that is awarded, is as consistent and predictable as possible.</P>
    <P>These are the principal policy objectives that provide the background to the proposals in the Bill which are designed to improve the position for litigants who are involved in personal and fatal injury actions.  If these objectives can be achieved other benefits will follow.  One aspect that has been highlighted is the area of liability insurance.  I am confident that the new procedures proposed in this Bill will reduce the legal costs incurred by insurers in the area of motor, employer and public liability insurance. This should be reflected in reduced premium costs for such insurance.  The Government are committed, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to taking certain measures to reduce the cost of liability insurance to industry.  That includes the Government's commitment to proceed with this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been substantially amended and strengthened during its passage through the Dáil and I will return to this matter later on in my speech.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two main provisions. It provides that actions in the High Court for damages for personal injuries and in fatal accident cases will in future be tried by a judge sitting alone rather than by a judge and a jury as at present.  The other main provision proposes to give the Minister for Justice power to make regulations to limit costs of legal counsel that may be recovered by a successful party in these actions against the unsuccessful party.  I will refer to this matter later.  A further provision will enable personal or fatal injury cases which are awaiting trial in the High Court to be remitted for trial to the Circuit Court if the proceedings could have been commenced in that court.</P>
    <P>The first thing that I want to emphasise is that this Bill does not propose to abolish jury trials for all civil actions in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with only one category of High Court action &mdash; claims <Col N="569" /> for damages for personal and fatal injuries. Although these cases comprise the vast majority of civil jury trials in the High Court at present, juries will continue to be available in High Court actions involving claims for damages for defamation, for false imprisonment, for intentional trespass to the person &mdash; these are assault cases &mdash; and in some other actions for which juries are sometimes sought.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the Bill will not affect juries in criminal cases.  There is a constitutional right to trial by jury on a serious criminal charge which is subject only to the exceptions set out in Article 38 of the Constitution.  The Constitution does not contain any reference to trial by jury in civil cases.</P>
    <P>Another preliminary point I would like to make is that the main proposal in the Bill is part of a long-term trend, under way for over 100 years, to dispense with the use of juries to try civil actions.  In the early days of the State the right to jury trial in actions for liquidated sums, for damages for breach of contract, or for the recovery of land was withdrawn by the Courts Act, 1924.  The right to civil jury trial in cases in the Circuit Court, including personal injuries actions, was abolished by the Courts Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>The Courts Bill, 1986, was initiated by the previous Administration.  The original Bill contained one proposal only.  It provided for the abolition of juries in personal and fatal injury cases.  When my party were in Opposition we were not enthusiastic about the original Bill.  Generally, we felt that the Bill, as initiated, was inadequate.  In particular, it did nothing about the problem of over-representation by lawyers in personal injury cases &mdash; which had become a matter of acute public concern &mdash; or the related problem of excessive legal costs associated with these cases.  These were factors that were contributing to the escalating cost of liability insurance for the public generally and for industry and through this to job losses in industry, the closure of businesses and the viability of many sporting and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in Government we <Col N="570" /> decided that the Bill would need to be strengthened considerably before we could proceed with it.  The Bill which was passed in the Dáil contains additional provisions to deal with the particular problems that I have mentioned and contains a new commencement provision which will have the effect of bringing the new arrangements for trying these cases into force as from 1 August of this year. The original Bill would not have taken effect for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the growth in personal injury cases coming before the High Court in recent years has focused greater attention on the awards being made by juries in those cases.  The high level of some awards attracted much publicity and a growing belief in some quarters that the incidence of excessive awards had become unacceptable.  In 1982 the &ldquo;McLiam Committee&rdquo;, which examined the problem of motor insurance costs, found evidence that awards given by juries were sometimes remarkably unpredictable, varying widely between cases where the circumstances appeared to be similar.  It emphasised the unfairness of such a situation to litigants and the difficulties which this unpredictability created for the insurance industry.  It concluded that it would be in the interest of justice if a greater degree of consistency could be achieved in the assessment of damages, bearing in mind the overriding requirement of doing justice between the parties.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court was also concerned about excessive jury awards and, in three important judgments delivered between 1983 and 1984, brought about substantial changes in the basis for assessing the quantum of damages in personal injury cases.  In the last of these cases it indicated that a limit of £150,000 should apply generally to awards of general damages for pain and suffering and loss of the amenities of life in the most extreme cases of personal injuries, unless particular circumstances suggest otherwise. The then Chief Justice had remarked in that case that in attempting to compensate for very serious injury &ldquo;All sense <Col N="571" /> of reality may be lost&rdquo; and he considered that &ldquo;A yardstick of a reasonable nature must be applied if reality is to be retained in the assessment of such compensation&rdquo;. These cases show a concern on the part of the Supreme Court at what it regarded as clearly excessive awards by juries.</P>
    <P>The excessive level of damages awarded in the courts in such cases have had a major bearing on the amounts for which insurers will settle personal injuries claims outside the courts.  Insurance companies point out that such claims are settled under the shadow of a court hearing and that the unpredictability of jury awards has had a destabilising effect on the settlement process, reflected ultimately in the high cost of liability insurance.</P>
    <P>I understand that, although upwards of 85 per cent of personal injury cases set down for trial in the High Court are settled without going all the way to judgment, this proportion is much smaller than the comparable statistics for neighbouring jurisdictions where these cases are heard by a judge alone.  In Britain, for example, up to 95 per cent of personal injury cases are settled without going to trial.  We still have a relatively high volume of personal injury cases going to trial, and I am sure that this is due mainly to the availability of jury trial. The elimination of juries is likely to produce a corresponding reduction in cases going to trial and will enhance the prospect of settling many more personal injury cases at an earlier stage.  Injured plaintiffs will benefit by receiving compensation for their injuries more quickly. As a result there should be a reduction generally in the tension of worry that long drawn-out proceedings create for many injured parties.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to make it very clear that the object of the proposal to abolish the right to a jury trial for personal and fatal injury cases is not to reduce the level of damages generally that the High Court will award in this type of case.  The object is to avoid excessive awards as far as possible and to bring consistency and predictability into the awards given.  I think <Col N="572" /> it is necessary to be very cautious in speculating what effect the measure might have on the general level of damages awarded, apart from the expected effect that it will obviate excessive awards.  For one thing, the recent Supreme Court decisions will have had an effect on the general level of damages. Moreover, although the incidence of personal injuries cases heard to date in the High Court by a judge sitting alone, with the consent of the parties, has not been great, what indications there are show that a judge can be no less generous than a jury when it comes to assessing damages in serious cases.  Furthermore, judges sitting alone have been deciding personal injuries cases in the Circuit Court since 1972 and there has been no public reaction, as far as I am aware, against the level of damages awarded in the Circuit Court.  Since the jurisdiction of that court to hear tort actions was increased to £150,000 in 1982, more serious cases are now being decided in the Circuit Court and I am not aware of any claim that Circuit Court judges are making inadequate awards, even in cases where minor injuries are involved.</P>
    <P>Civil trials by judge alone are a normal feature in the High Court already.  At present civil juries are used only in cases arising out of personal injury claims in motor accident, employer's and public liability cases in the High Court and in a very limited number of other cases.  All other cases have been decided by judges sitting without juries for a very long time. As I have already mentioned, juries have not been used in personal injury cases in the Circuit Court since 1972.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that awards of damages by judges alone will be lower because awards of damages by judges in Britain have been lower than here. Comparisons with the neighbouring jurisdictions on this score are not valid, because there are crucial differences in the way in which damages for future losses and costs are assessed here and in neighbouring jurisdictions.  One important difference is the reluctance of English courts to use actuarial evidence. Also, I understand that damages <Col N="573" /> awarded in serious injury cases in Britain have increased substantially in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The crucial point is that greater consistency may be expected to prevail under the proposed new system here and excessive awards will be largely avoided. Any variations that may arise from the norm on the part of individual judges will, I am sure, be corrected by the Supreme Court.  I would expect that the Supreme Court will be more ready to interfere with the reasoned decision of a judge in these cases and that in time an acceptable and more predictable pattern of awards will emerge.</P>
    <P>This will come about when all personal and fatal injury cases are being decided continually by a body of experienced judges, compared with the present &ldquo;once-off shot&rdquo; system involving a jury that will have no experience of the task. That task has become even more complicated and sophisticated in recent times, involving greater reliance on technical and expert evidence.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for trial by judges sitting alone will also lead to wider reporting of decisions in personal and fatal injury cases.  It will make possible the publication eventually of a compendium of decisions of the Superior Courts in important cases &mdash; amounting to an authoritive book of quantum of damages &mdash; for the benefit of the legal profession and bodies such as insurance companies who wish to value the claims they receive.  This development would further enhance the prospect of early settlement in more cases.  There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to the effect that I will examine the scope of the publication of such a book of quantum.  I have already asked The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting to look at the matter.  I regard the removal of juries from personal and fatal injury cases as a first, essential, step towards the systematic reporting of awards.</P>
    <P>An effect of the proposals in the Courts Bill, 1986, will be to simplify the procedure for the trial of personal and fatal injury cases and to shorten the length of <Col N="574" /> these trials.  This should mean that less input will be required from the barristers who appear in these cases and I also expect that there should be less need for expensive expert witnesses to appear to give oral evidence.  There is a link there fore between the proposal to abolish the use of juries in these cases and the proposals in the Bill to limit the costs that can be recovered by successful parties in respect of the appearance of counsel. Already the Bar Council have agreed to discontinue, when juries go, the former practice of requiring that three counsel &mdash; two seniors and one junior &mdash; be briefed in personal injury cases.  Spokesmen for the insurance industry have assured me that they will not brief more than two counsel in connection with any personal injury case when the new arrangements are in place.  There is a provision in the Bill to empower me to limit the costs that can be recovered for counsel in these cases by way of regulations.  But I intend to wait until the new arrangments are in place before moving on the question of regulations.  I intend to assess the actual situation in the light of the disappearance of juries, and the various commitments that have been given to me, before invoking statutory powers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 1 of the Bill contains the substantive provision to abolish the use of juries in personal and fatal injury cases in the High Court.  Subsections (2) and (4) are necessary to take account of the fact that many personal and fatal injury cases include claims for damages under other headings and may involve counterclaims.  Subsection (3) contains an exemption from the main provision in the Bill for cases involving claims for false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person &mdash; jury trials will continue to be available for such cases.  Subsection (5) will enable a jury trial that has started before the commencement of the Bill to continue until the trial is disposed of.  Subsection (6) is a technical provision.</P>
    <P>Section 2 will enable cases set down and awaiting trial in the High Court to be transferred for trial to the Circuit Court on the application of any party to <Col N="575" /> the action if the proceedings could have been commenced in that court.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 contain minor technical provisions consequential on the substantive provision in section 1.  Section 5 contains the proposal about counsels' costs that I have mentioned.  Section 6 contains the commencement provision and the usual provisions for a Short Title, collective citation and construction with other statutes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>It was Justice Douglas of the United States Supreme Court who said of the vital and essential role of juries:</P>
      <P>A jury reflects the attitudes and mores of the community from which it is drawn.  It lives only for the day and melts away thereafter.  It is not present the next day to be criticised.  It is the one governmental agency that has no ambition.</P>
      <P>Judge Douglas continued:</P>
      <P>A jury is as human as the people who make it up.  It takes the sharp edges off the law and uses conscience to ameliorate a hardship.  Since it is of and from the community it gives the law an acceptance which verdicts of judges could not do.</P>
      <P>That quotation, I believe, encapsulates and sums up the vital and fundamental role of the jury system, where one is judged by 12 wise and sensible people not only in the United States of America &mdash; one of the great republics &mdash; but also in this country.  However, this Bill provides that actions in the High Court for damages, for personal injuries, will be tried in future by a judge sitting alone rather than by a judge and jury as at present. As the Minister has indicated, juries will remain available in cases involving false imprisonment, assault and battery, defamation, malicious prosecution and for certain probate and matrimonial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972 the O'Connor Committee which was established by the then Government to inquire into the insurance <Col N="576" /> industry concluded that juries should be retained to decide liability in negligence cases but that the responsibility for deciding the quantum of damages should rest with the judge assisted by assessors.  The MacLiam Committee, the Prices Advisory Committee which reported in 1982 on the cost and method of providing motor insurance, concluded that the jury system should be retained but that certain changes were needed to deal with the problem of inconsistency and unfairness, as mentioned by the Minister, that arose from the operation of the system in deciding motor insurance cases.  The MacLiam Committee stated on page 45 of their report &mdash; and I quote from paragraph 77:</P>
    <P>At the present time neither counsel nor the trial judge may suggest any figures to the jury for general damages whether past or future.  It is in the area of the assessment of general damages that the wide diversions sometimes arise in cases which can be regarded as truly comparable.  By and large, special damages &mdash; mainly medical and hospital fees on the one hand and loss of earnings on the other hand &mdash; are a matter of proof and mathematics. Figures can be and are suggested to the jury by counsel and the judge in respect of these items and the mathematics is done for them, where, for example, a loss of earnings projected into the future is to be calculated with the help of actuarial evidence.  When one comes to the general damages, however, both past and future, neither counsel nor the judge may give any help to the jury beyond the use of certain well known cliches.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the MacLiam Committee strongly recommended:</P>
    <P>That the rule that neither the judge nor counsel may suggest figures for general damages to the jury should be altered so as to allow the judge (but not counsel) at his discretion to inform the jury as to what he estimates to be the going range of general damages for the sort of injuries proved in the circumstances of the particular case <Col N="577" /> before him, bearing in mind other jury awards and especially awards as assessed by the Supreme Court, of both of which he will have informed himself, whilst at the same time making it clear to the jury that they are at liberty to depart from such range in the particular case if they think fit.</P>
    <P>Strong arguments arise on both sides of this issue and there are strongly divided views on the matter.  This is true even of the judges, even of our Supreme Court judges, and even of our senior politicians in the various parties.</P>
    <P>That was demonstrated very forcefully last night.  It was demonstrated over the past number of years by leading spokesmen in the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, for example, senior Minister in the present Government, Deputy Michael Woods who made a very impassioned plea for the retention of the jury system.  I decided to resist the temptation to quote those extracts on this occasion especially with a Limerickman here as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Professor Bryan McMahon, however, in his article entitled <i>Jury Trial for Personal Injury Cases In Ireland, (1985)</i> found the High Court judges who responded to his questionnaire were evenly split on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bryan McMahon's article, <i>Jury Trial for Personal Injury Cases in Ireland, (1985).</i>  Various possible options were open to the Government, as indeed to the previous Government, for the reform of the jury system.  These options include: (1), retaining the present jury system for the determination of liability and damages in personal injury cases but empowering the trial judge to indicate the going rate for general damages in comparable cases to the jury; (2), retaining juries to determine liability but not damages; (3), replacing juries by a judge sitting with assessors to advise or make recommendations on damages; (4), <Col N="578" /> introducing a statutory tariff for general damages for personal injury cases; (5), introducing a statutory maximum for general damages on the lines adopted by the Supreme Court in fixing a limitation of £150,000 in the case of general damages; (6), replacing juries by a judge sitting alone to decide on liability and damages in all cases; (7), allowing juries to decide on liability and damages in exceptional cases with all other cases being decided by a judge sitting alone.</P>
      <P>My own preference is for the first option retaining the present jury system for the determination of liability and damages in personal injury cases but empowering the trial judge to indicate the going rate for general damages in comparable cases to the jury.  Why should not 12 ordinary citizens, with the rising standards of education in this country, with appropriate guidance from the judges be the arbiters of standards for their fellow citizens who are the unfortunate victims of accidents and in many cases are maimed or paralysed for life? The alternative adopted by the Government is for members of the legal profession to control totally both the procedure and level of compensation and consequently the standards to be observed by drivers and employers.  I believe that the decision taken by one man or one woman sitting alone is potentially inferior to the collective decision and wisdom of 12 ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view, of course, has been endorsed by the Third Interim Report to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which was set up by Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Justice at the time, a committee which was chaired by one of the most distinguished lawyers this country has ever produced, Justice Brian Walsh of the Supreme Court.  In this report the committee examined the historical background of the jury system, the existing position of civil jury trial, the social and civic value of jury trial and, indeed, the advantages and disadvantages of civil jury trial.  In page 8 of this report this committee, a very distinguished committee, examined the historical background first.  Civil jury trial, <Col N="579" /> as they emphasise, is not the creature of statute but it has evolved gradually over a very long period of time and I quote as follows from page 8:</P>
    <P>From about the time of Henry II the fundamental principle on which the institution was based on the concept of the determination of facts in the administration of civil justice by twelve lay persons sworn to decide facts truly according to evidence produced before them.</P>
    <P>They go on then to examine the existing position of civil jury trial in this country and they note in paragraph 9:</P>
    <P>At present the right to jury trial and civil actions is governed by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, section 94, (as amended by the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, section 20), the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962, and the Rules of the Circuit Court, 1950.</P>
    <P>They go on to state as follows in paragraph 10:</P>
    <P>In practice civil jury trial is largely confined to High Court actions for damages for personal injury or death caused by negligence.  Of these actions the greatest number arise from road traffic accidents while next in order of number are those brought by employees against their employers on the ground either of negligence of common law or of breach of statutory duty or both.</P>
    <P>Then the committee go on to examine the social and civic value of jury trial. This is most important when we consider the ethos and the mores of the Irish people.  They then said:</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the Constitution describes the powers of government as being the legislative, the executive and the judicial powers of government. The trial and decision of civil actions is one of the spheres in which the judicial <Col N="580" /> powers of government are exercised. In the legislative field of government the citizen participates, either by voting in the elections, or, even more directly, by becoming a member of the legislature.  The only opportunity the ordinary citizen has of participating in the working of the judicial government of the State is in jury service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just trying to outline the social and civic value of jury trial which is the key point I am trying to make.  The committee have very pertinent points on this.  They continue:</P>
      <P>Jury service gives a sense of community responsibility, is an educating force in the community and acquaints the citizen with justice as it is in practice administered.</P>
      <P>This is the fundamental weakness of this system.  They go on to say:</P>
      <P>Jury service helps to teach the members of the jury that they have a share in the rule of the society in which they live.  The system also tends to make the law intelligible by keeping it close to the common course of individual and social life.  The judge in a jury trial is obliged to explain precisely the law to the jury and in particular its application to the facts of the case.  This in turn helps towards a clear outside judgment on those facts and thus to the inside world of the law the jury brings an outside sense and an outside animation.</P>
      <P>It is most important to have independent juries who are able to communicate with the lawyers and with the judges who often seem to be remote from the sense of reality the Minister has been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> This committee were composed predominantly of lawyers.  It is to the credit of this committee that they endorsed so strongly the whole concept of the jury system in civil actions.  They go on to say in page 11:</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that jury trial, whether in criminal or civil proceedings, is in reality a combination of trial by judge and jury the essential underlying fact is that if and where there may be a conflict between the judge and the jury on some question of fact it is the lay mind which predominates.</P>
    <P>In questions of law it is the judge's mind which predominates for the trial of all criminal offences in the ordinary courts save in the case of minor offences,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This has been mentioned by the Minister:</P>
    <P>The Constitution prescribes trial by jury.  To this extent the participation of the ordinary citizen in the exercise of the judicial powers of government is indeed mandatory.  While the right of personal liberty is so fundamental that it must be strictly safeguarded, it is difficult to see why, so far as the participation of the ordinary citizen is concerned, he should not have the right and the duty, to participate in the administration of justice in civil cases as in criminal cases and, so far as the litigant is concerned, why the participation of his fellow citizens should not at least be as available to him in the defence or prosecution of his civil rights as it would be if he were on trial for a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that, for the liberty of the citizen and for the safeguarding of the fundamental rights of the citizen, as enshrined in the Constitution, the existence of a civil jury in practical terms is almost as important as a criminal jury.</P>
    <P>This committee go on to make the strongest point of all in paragraph 15 when they examine how relevant lawyers <Col N="582" /> and judges are to make decisions affecting the ordinary citizen.  They make the following comment:</P>
    <P>The availability of jury trial also serves the useful social function of discouraging and even preventing litigation from becoming the exercise of an exclusive professional ritual engaged in by professional lawyers, judges and advocates, by ensuring that within the framework of the law, in respect of which the expert professional guidance is necessary, the kind of justice administered is one which the ordinary man can understand and desires rather than the kind which the professional lawyer thinks he ought to have or is good for him.</P>
    <P>We know that in this country there are certain lawyers and certain judges who feel that certain things are good for us and that we should have these things, irrespective of what the public may think. That is a fine admission by this committee. It is a strong endorsement of the case I am making for the retention of the jury system.  I am dealing at length with this report because I think it is absolutely fundamental in the case I am asking the Minister to consider.</P>

      <P>With the Chair's indulgence, I would like to quote one final paragraph.  The Minister and other speakers in the other House referred to what has been called the hardship on jurors.  This was examined in great detail here.  I have never really come across a good citizen who has objected to the inconvenience and to the hardship imposed on him.  It may cause him much inconvenience and much hardship.  The committee state, in examining this matter:</P>
      <P>One of the objections which has been made to the jury trial system is that it imposes an unnecessary hardship on jurors in that a relatively small part of the adult population is liable for jury service.  Almost all the jurors who attended before the Committee appeared to appreciate the civic and social value of the duty they performed and were quite willing to bear the measure of personal inconvenience necessarily flowing from the jury service.</P>
      <P>That was a very wise statement.  We know that the major insurance companies in this country have taken a different view over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quoted enough from the report. I hoped to avail further of the Cathaoirleach's indulgence, so that other people in the other House might have been able to read some of the excellent extracts from that report.  However, I believe that in the jury system we are dealing with a fundamental institution which is embedded in our administration of justice.  As insurance premium payers, we would, as indicated by Deputy John Kelly in the other House, all rejoice over anything that would reduce the level of premiums; but there is no guarantee that insurance premiums will come down.  The Minister expressed confidence that something of this nature would happen, but the insurance companies have persistently stated that they do not see premiums <Col N="584" /> coming down.  They see a stabilisation of premiums and perhaps in the future they may come down.  I believe we should not legislate on something so fundamental as the right to jury trial merely because the insurance companies have a sort of hunch that the level of awards will be lower.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy John Kelly in the other House when he stated in the Dáil, on 31 May 1988:</P>
    <P>We are now seeing the last stages of a very persistent, well kept up lobbying operation laid on by the insurance companies which has been going on for at least 20 years.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, in this Bill the new section 4 which purports to give the Minister for Justice the power to make regulations concerning the fees of counsel which may be recovered on taxation.  I know that the Bar Council are most anxious to streamline their affairs and I know also that the Minister for Justice has a special concern to work out the details of any future regulations that will be made in this regard.  However, I must on this occasion urge the Minister to give the barristers and the Bar Council the appropriate opportunity in time &mdash; I am not arguing for exhorbitant time but a reasonable amount of time and opportunity &mdash; for the self-regulation of their own affairs and of their own profession.</P>
    <P>The problems facing the legal professions in regard to these changes as envisaged in the new section 4 have been well pinpointed, I believe, by Deputy Patrick Cooney, a former Minister for Justice and, indeed, a distinguished legal practitioner and also a man who knows the value of a good jury and when to take cases.  When speaking in the Dáil on 31 May 1988, column 864, he had the following to say which I think sums up my attitude to the new section 4:</P>
    <P>The county solicitor can put together the maximum legal team suited to his particular needs and the needs of that client in the knowledge that if the case fails everybody is on nothing and if the case wins everybody gets paid.  That is <Col N="585" /> the position at the moment.  The second senior counsel may be brought in for a particular purpose in that case. He may be brought in to address the jury winding up the case; he may be brought in for a specialist cross-examination, or he may be brought in for his own personal muscle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I just want to say that the present system allows the humblest county solicitor, whether in Limerick, Clare, Longford or Westmeath, to act for the poorest man in the district to build a good legal team.  I believe that, unfortunately, we are now proposing to end that, again at the behest of the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the arguments I have heard in the other House, or indeed read in extensive publications which I have studied, for abolishing the jury system stand comparison with the arguments for the retention of the jury system.  I am not satisfied that the changes proposed in this Bill &mdash; quite clearly I am not talking in political terms, and I am sure, the Minister for Justice will accept that I am talking from conviction &mdash; are for the better. I believe the Minister for Justice has not discharged the onus of proof, which is a civil onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities.  I hope, therefore, &mdash; it was <Col N="586" /> suggested in the other House last night &mdash; that the Minister might be open to the acceptance of reasonable amendments at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I conclude my remarks by referring to the great Sir William Blackstone, who in his <i>Commentaries</i> in 1809 said of the jury system that it was the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, that he, or she cannot be affected either in his property in his liberty or in his person without the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals.  He said that the impartial administration of justice which secures both our persons and our properties is the great end of civilised society.</P>
    <P>Blackstone went on to say that every new tribunal erected for the decision of facts without the intervention of a jury, whether composed of justices of the peace, revenue commissioners, judges of courts of conscious or, indeed, any other standing magistrates, was a step towards establishing what he called aristocracy &mdash; the most suppressive and absolute governments.</P>
    <P>I believe that these comments are as relevant today as when they were made by Blackstone in 1809.  I ask the Minister to consider if further refinements could be made having regard to experience in other countries regarding the retention in some shape or form at least of the jury system in High Court actions in personal injury cases.  I feel that the Minister has come a long way in regard to meeting the problems of the legal profession.  I understand, for instance, that one of the biggest problems that barristers have at the moment, and especially the senior barristers, is this.  For instance, I understand that next week in Cork there are three judges for 25 important cases in this area.  If a barrister has one case for one day he is all right, but if he has to handle several cases over a period of a week or so, or if he has several cases on the one day, it is a very difficult thing.  I can see the Minister is doing his mathematics and is asking how it all adds up.  That is a fair comment.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that actions in the High Court for damages for personal injury in future will be tried by a judge sitting alone rather than a sitting by a judge and jury as at present. Juries will remain available, however, in cases involving false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person, that is, assault or battery, even if the damages claimed include damages for personal injuries.  Juries will also continue in actions for defamation, malicious persecution and for certain probate and matrimonial matters.  The cases affected by the Bill are a small fraction of the jury cases.  They are primarily negligence actions for personal injuries as a result of road accidents or accidents at work.  They account for the vast bulk of jury actions <Col N="588" /> coming before the High Court.  The Bill will not affect juries in criminal cases.</P>
      <P>The number of personal injury cases coming before the High Court in recent years has focused a lot of attention on the awards being made by jurors.  The high level of some awards gave rise to people saying that the awards were excessive and led to very high premiums for car insurance and, indeed, for public liability as well.  This has created a great problem for insurance companies and for people who are paying insurance premiums. We have heard a lot of this in the past number of years when we had many people making a case to the Government about the premiums they had to pay for car insurance and for public liability. They said they were excessive and very unreasonable.  After careful consideration the Government decided that the best arrangement was to replace civil juries with a single judge sitting alone to decide the issue of liability and damages in personal injury cases.  Civil juries are used only in cases arising out of motor accidents and accidents at work.  All other civil cases, with a few exceptions, are decided by a judge sitting alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of people do not want to act as jurors and regard jury service as a burden.  They go to great lengths to evade it.  Actually, it is claimed that only 30 per cent of the people called for jury service in High Court actions attend.  There is an assumption in some quarters that the object of the Government's proposals to replace civil juries is to reduce the awards in personal injury cases.  This is not correct. The purpose is to avoid excessive awards as far as possible and bring consistency into the awards given and obliterate excessive awards.  Judges have been dealing with personal injury cases in the Circuit Court since 1972 and there has been no public reaction against the level of damages being awarded in the Circuit Court.  A greater degree of consistency will prevail in relation to awards under the new system and excessive awards will be largely avoided.  This is likely to come about when all personal injury cases have been decided by a body of experienced <Col N="589" /> judges rather than being decided by a body of jurors who have no experience.</P>
    <P>I differ from Senator Kennedy's statement here because he said a jury would be a much fairer system and that they would have a lot of experience.  My contention is that many people who are selected as jurors do not want the job.  They are not interested in the job, and, indeed, they would much prefer if they had not to do the job at all.  As a result, we will do much better in not having juries and having cases decided by judges in future. The Supreme Court will be available to correct any awards made by judges whether they be too high or too low.  It is thought that, under the new system, personal injuries claims will be settled more quickly by insurers.  It is also thought that insurance premiums will become more stabilised as the compensations paid out will be more uniform. I feel this is a good Bill and that the country will benefit eventually from it.</P>

      <P>I will not be very long.  I simply want to put on record my opposition to the Bill and, in my view, the unsound premise on which it is based. There is evidence that this is the final stage of a process of lobbying by very powerful forces.  If there are problems in the whole area of compensation, it is not proved that the problems are due to the jury system.  If there are undue delays, uncertainty, unpredictability and so on, I do not think it has been sufficiently investigated whether in fact these are not due to a wide variety of causes.  Nor is it proved that the insurance industry are losing money in non-life cases.  Their profits are lower than they wish, but that is something else.  Even there, it seems to me it has not been sufficiently checked out whether we can believe the insurance industry when they tell us that they are losing a lot of money in the non-life sector.</P>

    <P>The Bill also ignores the fact that, if there have been excesses in the past, there is in recent times a new sense of realism in the awards made by juries since the influence of the Supreme Court <Col N="590" /> judgments in 1984.  It is ironic at a time when this sense of realism has crept into the jury awards system, when there is a very real Supreme Court check manifesting itself, that we have a cry for the abolition of juries expressed in this Bill. Are we taking sufficient steps to enforce the criminal side of safety regulations and so on?  Are we keeping accidents down with sufficient penalties?  Is our policing sufficiently realistic, because fewer accidents will mean fewer insurance claims? I am simply suggesting through the Chair to the Minister that there are a number of areas which will prove fruitful to investigate, and which might well lead to the conclusion that we are getting the wrong end of the stick in thinking that the system of juries is responsible for our problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>Again it seems to me to be not proved that you are going to remove unpredictability and inconsistency if you remove the jury system.  What proof have we that judges sitting on their own are necessarily any more predictable or consistent than 12 good men?  Indeed, we have examples, very frequently, of the erratic nature of decisions taken by learned gentlemen sitting on their own.  I do not believe we can expect any greater degree of consistency from a judge than we can from juries.  In fact, the absence of juries will mean that the litigants will pay more attention to the identity of the judge.  It cannot be assumed that all judges will behave automatically and predictably and, therefore, a new factor of uncertainty and delay will come into action in these cases, as people wonder what particular judge they are going to get, what kind of personality he has and how is he likely to pronounce.  It does not seem to me that we are going to get necessarily predictability and consistency by removing juries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the abolition of juries in certain civil cases as being part of a trend which is with us for a long time.  If that is so, it is a trend that should now be arrested.  The whole idea that you take these decisions out of the hands of 12 ordinary citizens and give them to an expert is in keeping with a <Col N="591" /> very undesirable and very sinister trend of our times, namely, that the experts know best, and that ordinary people are not competent to pronounce in these matters &mdash; leave it to the experts whether they are diplomats, Government Ministers or professionals in other areas.  This elitist and anti-democratic trend is again expressing itself in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We should accept the diminution of the jury system in our jurisprudence only in the gravest cases.  Every erosion of trial by jury is an erosion of civil liberties.  In criminal cases we have necessarily and rightly restricted trial by jury &mdash; they were abolished in political criminal cases in 1971 &mdash; but it remains a matter of concern.  It is still a deprivation of civil liberties.  I see every proposal to reduce the role of juries, irrespective of whether it is in the civil or criminal area, as a further erosion of our civil liberties.  Let us remember, and it has been well said, that the jury is the lamp that shows that liberty lives.  In principle I am opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong views about the abolition of juries in this instance.  At present, persons injured in motor accidents or in accidents at work are entitled to a jury trial when seeking compensation for serious injuries.  It has been suggested that large jury awards have contributed to the recent crisis in the insurance industry and that, if juries were abolished, premiums would be reduced dramatically.  This matter has been under consideration for a number of years and, as far as I know, great consultation has taken place between the Department of Justice and the Bar Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is claimed by the insurance industry that juries are inconsistent and unpredictable. There is an element of truth in this assertion, of course.  Legal lore is full of anecdotal instances of jury differences. These considerations can only be partly explained by stating that no two cases are factually the same.  Money values change and the juries selected from ordinary people in the street are probably more <Col N="592" /> sensitive to social change and values than many legal institutions.  The point that juries are inconsistent and unpredictable, however, cannot be considered in isolation. If you advocate the abolition of the jury system you have to consider the alternatives to the jury trial.  The main alternative is a judge sitting alone.  We must ask whether trial by a judge sitting alone guarantees greater predictability and more consistency than a jury trial. There is no absolute and sure affirmative answer to this.  One could assume that each judge would act in a way consistent with his own style or his own track record. There is no consistency there.</P>
    <P>It is well-known that we have a difficulty in Ireland with regard to some judges who are eccentric, difficult or temperamental. I have to stress this is the case with the minority of judges and district justices.  The manner in which those who cause concern arrive at the decisions and the judgments they make is seen as a problem by legal practitioners in the courts who, of course, can do nothing about it.  It raises very serious questions when a measure such as is proposed in this Bill is contemplated.</P>
    <P>Consistency would not be guaranteed if actions were to be heard by a judge sitting alone.  Once it was known which judge was selected to hear the case, it would be predictable whether the award would be, as it were, generous or mean. This information would only be known immediately prior to the trial, which could force settlements or agreements that would be unfair.  Because that information comes too late, it is too late to change parties from firmly held stances.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence, as the insurance industry seem to suggest, that awards given by a judge alone would be smaller than those given by a jury.  So many cases involve calculations in which an actuary is invariably employed that it is difficult to see where there could be scope for any great difference between the view a judge would take and a jury would take in such cases.  I do not really feel there is good reason for abolishing juries.  We should defend the principle in any event.  We should examine the system as it is at <Col N="593" /> present.  There are savings that could be made at the moment on legal representation. One cannot sustain the number and cost of, as it is at present, eight legal representatives in these cases. This is unsustainable.  It is said that costs can be up to 40 per cent of the award.  In the event of abolishing juries, what will the requirement be for the hearing of cases before a judge alone?</P>
    <P>This Bill has come about because of insurance company assertions that jury trial settlements lead to high premiums. Yet, as other speakers have said, we are not told with any degree of certainty that, subsequent on the abolition of juries, premiums will come down.  This concerns me.  Could we end up with the worst of all worlds by getting rid of juries and not seeing lower premiums?  I suggest that a commitment to lower motor insurance charges should have been secured prior to the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would regret the abolition of juries, in any event, because I believe all of us should have a right to have justice delivered to us through our peers.  I am afraid this Bill is not a move in the right direction.  Surely it could be possible to leave room to have jury trials in exceptional cases.  It looks as if this Bill will become law, and it will then rule out the possibility of a jury trial in any event and in any case.  I believe that in future exceptional cases will call for jury trials even if we do not have them for all the other cases.</P>
    <P>On the whole area of cost awards in civil cases, I have to say that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  At present there is a basic dishonesty with regard to claims made and settled by insurance companies. We are paying higher premiums. To a large extent we are paying them because 90 per cent of claims do not go to court.  People with a whiplash injury walk around and do their job with a collar on.  As far as I can see, professionals colluded to say it was a very serious injury worth £7,000 to £10,000, knowing that the case will be settled.  There is a great toleration of what I can only call dishonesty. This is morally very questionable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> Perhaps we could probe into this and see if there could not be a degree of honesty &mdash; let us call it what it is &mdash; in calling a spade a spade.  If people have very minor injuries, why should they go ahead and claim and be paid a substantial amount of money which, at the end of the day, levels out and costs all of us higher premiums in all areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Murphy in recording my opposition to this Bill basically on a matter of principle.  The basic constitutional right in criminal cases to trial by jury has been extended to civil cases for very good reason.  It is quite simply that it is regarded and has always been regarded as a fairer form of trial.  It seems that this Bill is being introduced to some extent because it is a matter of convenience, that it will speed things up and that administratively the courts will be able to dispose of these cases more quickly if they are conducted by a judge. It also seems that fewer cases will actually come to court as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am loth to interrupt you Senator but the Chair would like to recognise the presence in the Distinguished Strangers Gallery of distinguished guests in the persons of His Excellency the Turkish Ambassador Halil Dag, his wife Lady Dorothy Halil Dag, and their party.  You are very welcome. Senator Ross to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The premise upon which this Bill is based, that there will be greater consistency in judgments because such cases as these will come before a judge only and not before a jury, is fallacious. It is much easier to get a bad judge than it is to get a bad jury.  We have had, as Senator Fennell so rightly said, some very dubious judgments in recent cases, not only in civil cases but in criminal cases. Nobody maintains &mdash; and I am sure the Minister does not maintain &mdash; that judges are perfect.  In some criminal cases there has been a marked inconsistency between certain judgments and certain sentences for certain crimes.  It seems quite logical as a result that, when it comes to the same <Col N="595" /> judges dealing with civil cases, there will be equal inconsistency.  I am afraid that is natural.  Whereas juries certainly have been inconsistent, I see no reason to believe that judges would be any more consistent because they have no record of great consistency.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that this Bill has been introduced because awards have been regarded by public opinion as being too high.  I do not regard any such awards as have been given by juries in recent times as too high.  I do not believe there is any compensation that can be made for the loss of a limb, the loss of an eye, the loss of any part of one's body, or any physical injuries.  You cannot compensate people in money terms for this.  It is wrong for the Government to try to reduce compensation in this way.  There is obviously a feeling that juries sympathise with the plaintiff, with the injured party.  That feeling is right. That feeling is correct but why should not the jury sympathise with the injured party?  Quite simply after years and years of seeing cases like this going backwards and forwards judges will become hardened to such cases and will not be as sympathetic as 12 men and women actually appointed at random who see this sort of dreadful case only once or twice in a lifetime.</P>
      <P>A final point I would like to make &mdash; which I am not sure is totally relevant to the Bill but the Leas-Chathaoirleach will tell me no doubt &mdash; is that we must remember that judges are political appointments while juries are picked at random, or almost at random.  It is very difficult to pick 12 people who are likely to come up with a certain result and have certain sympathies.  Judges are political appointments and this is a matter of great regret.  That extends not just from political to criminal cases but it also exists in civil cases of this sort.  I would like to record my dissent from the Bill because the principle of reducing juries in any case is a dangerous one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply, I too, with your indulgence <Col N="596" /> a Leas-Chathaoirligh would like to say how glad I am to be in this Chamber today on the occasion of the visit of the Turkish Ambassador and his good wife and to say how welcome they are.  I note in particular, of course, the very good company they are keeping.  There has always been a very good healthy relationship between our two countries and I have no doubt that it will continue.  I know they have very good friends in both Houses of the Oireachtas and indeed throughout the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators very much for their contributions.  Indeed, I want to say to the last speaker, Senator Ross, with whom more often than not we disagree, that we can always disagree in the most cordial of terms, and that is as it should be.  I understand perfectly the concern which he has.  Indeed, it is only on balance that I am on the other side of the line.  The same would apply to the comments made by his colleague from Cork university, Senator Murphy, who I know had to leave.</P>
      <P>I want to thank my own party for their support for this Bill, which was to be expected.  I thank the Fine Gael Party and, in particular, their spokesperson, my countyman, Senator Kennedy, for his political support for the Bill.  As I explained to him, I can readily understand the reasons that professionally he may not support what is involved in the Bill, or personally he may not want to support what is in the Bill, but I think on the whole he and his party have been very helpful in ensuring that legislation which was initiated during the term of office of the Government of which they were the major party is a much much better Bill.  I think there is general agreement all around on that.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say &mdash; and I see Senator Cregan looking at me &mdash; a word of thanks for the help I received from all parties in the other House and for the amendments which were put forward and which I accepted in good faith because I recognised the value of and the need for them. On another occasion in this House, in my <Col N="597" /> absence, I was criticised unfairly by one person who is not here as being the type of person who does not take amendments. As far as I am concerned on matters which are totally non-political, why should we not all pool our knowledge and our experiences from our different walks of life and try to have the best legislation possible on our Statute Book?</P>
    <P>I also thank Senator Fennell for her contribution.  She has changed somewhat in her thinking since she was junior Minister at the Department of Justice but I suppose ladies are allowed to change their minds more often than we are.  I will not hold that against her.  In her heart I know she will support the Bill.  At least I am sure she will.</P>
    <P>I must give credit to Senator Kennedy. He made a most interesting case and he certainly had a lot of research done.  It was just as well from my point of view that I too had to do a lot of homework and a lot of research because we did come across the same sources.  I wonder would that great American, Justice Douglas, of the Supreme Court mentioned by our Senator Kennedy &mdash; not the American Senator Kennedy &mdash; repeat these sentiments today in support of the role of juries.  I doubt it very much because, by all accounts, a national crisis exists in the United States at present in relation to liability insurance, so much so, that President Reagan has placed the subject of civil liability reform on his legislative agenda.  Six liability reform Bills are reported to be sitting before the US Congress at present.  Every State Legislature is considering some measure of liability reform.  Excessive jury awards are among the reasons advanced for the present crisis.  This is the problem we have here. Many instances are quoted, none more dramatic than the reported award of $3.5 million, punitive damages, to a couple who sued an insurance company for wrongfully refusing to pay a hospital bill of $1,650.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes my case.  A number of points were made but I think <Col N="598" /> I covered the situation more than adequately earlier.  The principal policy objectives that provide the background to the Bill are designed to improve the position of litigants involved in personal or fatal injury actions.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  If these objectives can be achieved other benefits will follow.</P>
      <P>I want to tell Senator Kennedy through the Chair that I have nothing but the best regard and respect for the Bar Council. On several occasions I have met the Bar Council when a request came through at the shortest notice.  I have had nothing but co-operation from the Bar Council. I am sure I will have nothing but co-operation from the Bar Council.  I am sure Senator Kennedy will agree with me that co-operation will be most willingly forthcoming.  I do not think I will have to exercise the power which this Bill gives me, that is, the authority by way of regulation to bring about situations which I believe will be there voluntarily.  It is amazing how we can have agreement between ourselves in the most practical and realistic of terms to ensure that the system works as it must and should work. We can have agreement with regard to representation.  The only reason that bit of extra muscle is in the Bill is for my successor who may not have the same good relationship with the Bar Council as I have or, indeed, with the insurance companies for that matter.  I would not say, in particular, that I have a great relationship, but I am sure I will have a good working relationship with them to ensure that the principles of this Bill are followed right through.</P>
      <P>It is excellent legislation.  We had a thorough and deep study of the Bill.  We accepted quite a lot of amendments to it. We have improved the Bill considerably. I will not talk about the principle of juries and so.  This has been discussed by quite a number of Members.  There are mixed views but, on balance, we are doing the right thing.  I thank the House for their contributions on this Stage and hope that we can move on from there.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the dire situation of local authorities throughout the country in terms of the services that are provided, calls on the Minister for the Environment in the preparation of the estimates to provide funding to remedy the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Like the Minister, Senator Ferris and I arrived here at very short notice.  We were prepared to take this motion at 6 p.m. but events overtook that.  I am a member of three local authorities; a city council, a county council and a town commission. I should like to deal with the three different bodies to illustrate what we are getting at in this motion.  When rates were abolished in 1977 the rates support grant was put in place, in order to reimburse local authorities in full for what they would have got by way of domestic rates. Up to two years ago the increase was by way of an increase on the base figure of 1978.  There was a built in injustice in that for local authorities because if you take, for example, Waterford Corporation, of which I am a member, about 1,000 new houses have been built in the city since 1978.  There was a built in injustice in that those extra houses because the rates support grant was based on the number of houses in the city in 1978.  Last year, there was a catastrophic cut of 9 per cent in the rates support grant, followed by a 14 per cent cut this year.  This was particularly injurious for Waterford Corporation, whose staff had been somewhat in decline since the late seventies.  The area of the city was increased fourfold when the borough boundary was extended.  At that time, Waterford Corporation had 200 <Col N="605" /> outdoor men but that figure is now below 150.  Huge problems have arisen because of that.  The corporation have responsibility for more roads but there is absolutely no possibility, with present funding, of dealing adequately with these roads.</P>
    <P>A further blow to local authorities was the Supreme Court decision in 1983 that the PLV system was unconstitutional in terms of assessing the liability of farmers to pay rates.  The Supreme Court decision did not in any way deal with whether or not farmers were liable to pay rates; it only found that the PLV system was an unconstitutional way of assessing their liability.  The rates support grant was then put in place for agricultural rates and that has cost something in the order of £120 million since then.  The previous Government sought to redress the situation by bringing in a land tax.  The land tax was to apply to farms under 80 adjusted acres and farmers would pay £10 per acre with no further taxation.  Farmers who had over 80 adjusted acres would be liable for tax but the land tax would be deducted from their total tax liability.  The rates support grant for agricultural rates was cut by 9 per cent in 1987 and by 14 per cent in 1988.</P>
    <P>With regard to Waterford County Council &mdash; and one can only speak about what one sees on the ground &mdash; 62 outdoor employers have availed of the voluntary redundancy scheme offered by the Department.  I live in the town of Tramore which has a population of 6,000 people.  There are only two outdoor cleaning staff for the whole town.  Tramore is a very busy seaside resort; indeed, it is the primary resort in the country, and the cleaning of the town is proving to be a huge problem because of the reduced level of staff.</P>
    <P>The next area I should like to deal with is the area of housing.  In late 1987, Waterford Corporation had well in excess of 418 housing applicants.  Yet no houses were started in Waterford in 1987, nor will any houses be started there in 1988. Not alone is this tragic for those who are on the housing list but it is tragic also in terms of the rejuvenation of the city.  A great deal of work had been done on <Col N="606" /> urban renewal in Waterford city and very exciting plans were in the process of coming to fruition but it is now impossible to go ahead with these because no money is being provided for local authority housing. At the end of 1987 Waterford County Council had 106 applications for houses. Throughout the eighties, 50 houses a year had been built in the county but there will be six houses only started in the county by the end of the year.  There is enough money there to get them started.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to those who have an income of less than £10,000 who, in the normal course of events, would not get a local authority house.  Last October the Government removed the subsidy so that now instead of the loans being provided by local authorities at fixed interest, the interest on these loans will fluctuate with the market.  If we take a maximum loan of £21,000 and the highest rate of interest and the lowest rate of interest which obtained in the eighties, there is a swing of £90 per month in the repayments on such a loan.  This change has made it very difficult for people who earn less than £10,000 a year to avail of loans and I believe this is further worsening the crisis.</P>
    <P>A general point that needs to be made here is the erosion of local democracy. The local health committees have been disbanded but, more important, in the context of local authorities and the changes that will come about in the structural funds of the EC in 1992, the regional development organisations have been disbanded.  The South Eastern Regional Development Organisation were disbanded yesterday and my colleague, Senator Ferris, was at that meeting.  The changes that are coming about in Europe mean that we are now moving towards programmes rather than projects and the regional dimension is becoming much more important.  The Government have seen fit to disband the only organisations who provided a forum for local authorities to discuss problems of joint interest and to come up with programmes for dealing with them.</P>
    <P>The number of VECs are to be reduced.  We are told that they will be <Col N="607" /> reduced from 38 to 20.  The county committees of agriculture &mdash; and there was a strong debate on this matter last week &mdash; are also gone.  Last weekend I attended the annual general meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Athlone.  The Minister was at that meeting and he addressed it the first morning. The one thing which struck me when I was talking to councillors is how demoralised councillors are at present.</P>

      <P>With regard to the various services that are provided by local authorities, be they roads, houses or whatever, local authority members feel impotent nowadays to act on behalf of their clients.  There is a demoralisation, not alone among elected members, but also among the staff.  The much wanted developmental role of local authorities, which the Government spoke so much about in their manifesto for the 1985 local elections, is now virtually diminished. This is terribly important in terms of tourism because, for instance, our fine archaeological remains, scenic picnic parks, roads and so on, are part of what tourists look for.  Urban renewal housing has virtually come to a stop and local authorities cannot deal as effectively with beautifying our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is verbally solving all the problems around the country, be they fish kills or river pollution.  They are grandiose aspirations <Col N="608" /> but the actual resources to back them up are very scarce.  Our beaches are being polluted because of sewage disposal but there is no money for new sewerage schemes because the capital programmes of local authorities have been very drastically curtailed and diminished by the Government.  For the past two years no small sewerage schemes have been undertaken in rural areas in my county council area.</P>
    <P>The major local authorities, county councils, urban councils and county borough councils are being diminished in terms of resources and staffing.  We have been told that local government reform is on the way.  We have heard much about that but one wonders, for instance, about the future of small urban councils, whose staffs have been diminished by the cutbacks, and the future of town commissioners. If these bodies are abolished &mdash; and some commentators would have us believe that is the intention of the Minister &mdash; this will be further erosion of local democracy.</P>
    <P>The fundamental point is that, if local authorities are to prosper and play a meaningful role, the wherewithal must be provided.  The wherewithal is not being provided at present and the Government have actually brought in a cut in the rates support grant for the first time since 1978. As I outlined earlier, a cut of 9 per cent was followed by a dramatic cut of 14 per cent.  If the Government seriously tackled the problem of a land tax &mdash; in other words if farmers who previously paid rates now had to pay a land tax &mdash; this would be a very important source of revenue for local authorities.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out some months ago on behalf of the ICMSA by a very reputable organisation, it transpired that two-thirds of farmers would prefer to get an alternative to accounts and to be on a land tax.  Figures suggest that last year the total take from the farming community was £35 million whereas they paid £30 million to accountants to process their forms and a further £10 million was spent by the State in administering and dealing with their applications.  We are <Col N="609" /> talking about £40 million going on administration and £35 million coming back in revenue.  This is ludicrous and is a terrible waste of resources.</P>
    <P>A very notable feature of the rates book of my county council is that small farmers were not alone good payers but were very prompt payers of agricultural rates.  I believe that if a land tax was introduced and paid to local authorities, in addition to present forms of funding, there would not be any great resistance by the farming community, and certainly not the smaller farmers.  It would have the merit that the farmers who pay this tax would be able to see at close hand what that money was achieving.  They would also be in a much stronger position to lobby and make representations to those on the local authorities who make the decisions on how that money should be spent.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal because this extra revenue could be very important to local authorities in terms of giving back hope, not alone to public representatives but to officials also.</P>
    <P>The situation is in so much chaos and decline at present that one worries about the future of local government.  The style of the Government is to remove bodies which tend to be platforms for criticism of central Government.  I referred to this earlier.  The whole thrust seems to be to reduce the democratic element in local government, in the health services and in the educational services.  It is absolutely incumbent on the Government in terms of tourism &mdash; which the pundits tell us by the year 2000 will provide the major number of jobs in this country &mdash; to give the local authorities the wherewithal to assume a dynamic role in the promotion of tourism.  Waterford Corporation at present avail of the scheme of incentives for commercial urban renewal which were announced by the previous Government and have succeeded in bringing to Waterford city a developer who is about to provide a very exciting shopping development in the city centre.</P>

      <P>Waterford City Council have been undertaking an archaeological dig and some very important artefacts and evidence have come to light.  For instance, it has been discovered from the material that had been dumped in that area that during Viking times Waterford was a thriving city and much more prosperous than was realised.  The archaeological remains which have been found in Waterford are not alone of national importance but of European importance and will be incorporated into the commercial redevelopment in the city. Unfortunately, funding to carry out the archaeological dig to the best effect has not been available.  Many of the very exciting plans Waterford Corporation had in terms of developing Waterford as a tourist centre have been frustrated because year after year the amount of money available to the city council has been diminishing and, in particular, the number of staff in the city council have been greatly diminished this year.</P>
      <P>In proposing this motion I call on the Minister to realise that local authorities provide a framework for local democracy and for the feeding through of the views of constituents and other people.  More important, they provide a forum for development, in particular in the tourism area.  Because of the number of potholes and the many miles of road which will not be looked at in the foreseeable future, our road system is virtually falling apart in many parts of the county.  I will conclude by earnestly requesting the Minister to tackle seriously the provision of adequate funds to local authorities to fulfil their roles.</P>

      <P>In seconding this motion on behalf of the The Labour Party I want first to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We regard the preparation of the Estimates as very important.  I want to put on the record my appreciation of the assistance given by the Minister's Department following representations which were made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, today we are criticising the Government in the area of local authority funding.  As local authority <Col N="611" /> members many of the Members on both sides of the House are acutely aware of the major problems facing local authorities. This view is shared by members of the General Council of County Councils, the municipal authorities of Ireland and any other statutory body who have an all-Ireland dimension.  Members of local authorities who were duly elected feel frustrated because they are unable to tackle many of the areas they were able to tackle in the past when they had a certain degree of independence in relation to funding.</P>
    <P>Since the abolition of the rating system, and in particular since the abolition of domestic rates and agricultural rates, local authorities had to depend totally on the generosity of the Government of the day for their funding.  They had to rely on charges which were brought in by legislation, on rates which now remain with the business sector or small shopkeepers and on increased local authority rents which have gone up considerably in the past year and a half. Local authorities have a responsibility at local level, not alone because they provide the services for which they have a statutory role, but also because they are major employers.  Many have been put on short time and, but for the ingenuity of local authorities in availing of the social employment scheme, it is likely that local authorities would be unable to carry out much of the work which is now being done by employees under this scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme was never designed to replace permanent workers in local authorities but was intended to add a social dimension to their work.  However, county councils have used this scheme and some of their permanent employees act as advisers and supervisors on these schemes.  From that point of view we welcome that scheme.  However, when proposals come up before the national monitoring committee on the social employment scheme, local authorities are faced with the dilemma of trying to convince the trade union movement that this scheme is not being used or abused by local authorities who are in a desperate <Col N="612" /> state as regards funding.  That is why we reject out of hand the amendment to our motion which starts off with the normal Government accolade about restoring order to the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment said publicly that he is anxious to give a certain amount of autonomy to local authorities in their funding which, of course, would not interfere with the public finances, as we understand them.  However, the Government's stated policy when they were in Opposition was &mdash; and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 May 1985 on the run up to local elections:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's manifesto stresses that local authorities should:</P>
    <P>Assume the role of local enterprise agencies as a means of tackling unemployment; receive greater powers; have their finances reformed, with local water and service charges abolished as soon as Fianna Fáil returns to Government or through decisions on local authorities where Fianna Fáil have a majority.</P>
    <P>That is a newspaper interpretation of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  However, the manifesto states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will restore financial stability to Local Authorities by repealing the Coalition Government's Local Government Financial Provisions No. 2 Act, 1983.  This has had a devastating effect on the ability of Local Authorities to maintain existing services and gave County Managers the power to levy services charges to reduce Exchequer funding of Local Authorities...</P>
    <P>That is what the Government said when they were in Opposition.  Unfortunately a signatory to that document has since left the Government party.  I hope that the Minister, having stayed with that party in Government, will live up to those promises made in the manifesto, considering the success that he had in those 1985 elections.  The Minister received support on the understanding that the public accepted that he would <Col N="613" /> change everything with regard to local authority funding.  The reality is that, not alone did the Minister retain these awful charges that he condemned in Opposition, but he actually forced members, including his members, of local authorities to vote for them at estimates time and to increase them out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>At estimates time county managers have to tell people like myself and Senator Brian O'Shea, who are members of several local authorities, that we are faced with the dilemma of increasing these charges or reducing services beyond recognition.  Local authorities have a major statutory obligation at local level. Even though they have limited powers local authorities are elected to do a job and this includes the provision of sanitary services, housing, roads and all the other structures which are now suffering as a result of a lack of funding.  For instance, public housing in most authorities areas is now at a standstill.  The allocation of funding this year will only complete the start that took place last year.  There is relatively little additional funding for any new starts.</P>
    <P>Some limited new starts have been approved in County Tipperary for 26 council houses.  In Tipperary Urban Council, apart from finishing the existing scheme, we have no new funds available for building new houses.  I want to put on record our appreciation of the allocation of funds to restore some of these low-cost houses to some semblance of being fit for human habitation because they were generally falling to pieces and people living in them were being rehoused anyway.  It is good economics either to demolish them or to rebuild them and I am pleased the Government have decided to rebuild them.</P>
    <P>In the area of roads, where there is a Government allocation for primary routes, in particular, the national primary route has got a certain element of EC-assisted funding.  We have by-passes, which are a necessary part of the road structure, but the county roads and the non-route roads which are now totally dependent on the striking of the rate are <Col N="614" /> in a desperate condition.  I do not know if the Minister for the Environment is aware of these potholes in county roads and non-route roads.  Obviously he is travelling the national primary routes which may give the impression that there are no potholes in parts of rural Ireland. The opposite is, in fact, true.  We are disappointed that not alone have the Government not lived up to their promises to reorganise and restructure local authorities and their finances and make them into local development agencies which would be in accordance with all our hopes and understanding as members, but they are also removing local bodies like county committees of agriculture, local health committees, SERDO and all these other fora where local inputs were available at very little cost to either the council or the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Government have forced the abolition of those bodies by various Acts, taken out Acts, taken out local democracy, as we understand it, and put the survival of small local authorities like urban councils and town commissioners in jeopardy.  Members of those local authorities, including the Fianna Fáil members, are extremely concerned that, apart from a stated commitment by the Government to do something there is relatively little evidence of this happening on the ground.  In the preparation of the Estimates, we understand there is a projected cut of some £500 million in additional funding from the Exchequer. If this is true obviously local authorities will suffer further unless the Minister lives up to his commitment to allow them some degree of autonomy in regard to their own financing.</P>
    <P>We are extremely concerned that members' ability to meet has been reduced, by direction from the Department, by about 27 per cent.  Why should local representatives be unable to meet when they want to meet to develop and improve their counties in consultation and in conjunction with the Government? The Minister knows from being a member of a local authority of the commitment of local elected people to <Col N="615" /> their county area.  It is a tremendous local structure and it is one for which EC funding should be available.  The Minister's party said it should be available and we hope he will ensure that local authorities, in relation to this new programme for financing from the EC running up into 1992, this integrated programme and the policies in the new Community, as we understand it, will have an input in looking for funding and that the Exchequer will not take that money into the national purse for distribution for political or any other reasons.  Usually the application is made for the best of reasons.</P>
    <P>We are dissatisfied with the past two years' history of allocations to local authorities and we are now asking the Minister, in preparing the 1988 budget running into next year, to have regard to the views of Seanad Éireann in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;conscious of the need to restore order to the public finances, notes the steps that have been taken to maintain a satisfactory level of essential local services through the provision of adequate central funding for local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a very important motion and it is a pity, in a sense, that the time is so restricted and that we cannot elaborate on any aspect of it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rates support grant, I do not think we can blame any Government in particular and while we might criticise and, indeed, go into details, it does not serve any useful purpose.  Perhaps we can use it as an experience on which to build in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Shea spoke with considerable enthusiasm about the land tax. I was one of those who saw some very positive aspects in the land tax.  At the time I was quite enthusiastic about it, as I come from a rural community and I am involved to a large extent with small <Col N="616" /> farmers.  Nevertheless, at that time representations were made to us by all the farming communities and by farmers in general.</P>
    <P>I attended a monster meeting in Beechmount Hotel in Navan where farmers were protesting against the land tax.  I saw the positive aspects of it at that time but, apparently, the farmers did not.  It seemed to me to be in favour of the land tax that it placed a fixed responsibility on farmers.  They knew exactly what they had to pay and they did not have to go to accountants.  Not everybody who owns land is necessarily a farmer and there are some people who own land more or less in the sense of a business.  People of that kind are well able to engineer their profits so that they have a minimum amount of tax to pay and the Government suffer as a result of this.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interest of the Government to encourage every farmer to use his land as profitably as possible. Through the years I, personally, have had experience of wealthy farmers who were not all that concerned about profit with the result that land and grass went to waste and consequently the Government suffered.  From that point of view, it appeared to me that a very good case could be made for the land tax.  However, at the end of the day, everybody must admit that people should pay according to their incomes.  It is very difficult to make a case against that.</P>
    <P>The finances of local authorities, everybody will agree, must be put in order as in the case of any private concern or, indeed, private company.  It is most important that the finances are in order. The Government have done great work. They have been commended from all sides and the polls that have been taken recently and, indeed, since the Government came into office, have proved the point that the country and the people are very pleased with the way the Government have performed.  Interest rates have come down and consequently mortgage rates have come down; exports are booming; the balance of payments is in surplus; there is confidence in the economy and this is at an all-time high level in every <Col N="617" /> area.  Growth last year was 5 per cent of GNP and this has been achieved to a large extent by the Government cutting back on their expenditure.  It was necessary to do it; it was difficult to do it; but the Government did it and they have been commended, and rightly so, on all sides for their achievements.  There was no other way.  Local authorities must do the same thing.  They have to cut back also, even if it is painful and, of course, it will be painful.  It must be done.</P>
    <P>A motion of this kind should not be taken in isolation.  We should debate whether the structures that exist at present should be changed.  I think they should be changed.  The last two speakers more or less hinted at that with regard to local authorities.  I have always been fair to the Labour Party in the House and given credit where credit was due.  When former Deputy Jimmy Tully was Minister for Local Government he made an effort at decentralisation.  At one stage, the housing grants were organised from County Meath.  That scheme was a great success.  Great credit was due to the Minister at that time.  Unfortunately, it was not followed through.  I could never understand why.  It eliminated travelling expenses for officials: it reduced bureaucracy; it reduced book-keeping; it accelerated the process of dealing with applications and it is unfortunate that it was not followed up.  Decentralisation is very important in every area.</P>
    <P>As one who worked with the local authority in many areas, on roads, for example, I saw at first hand that local authorities in many ways had their hands tied.  Plans were drawn up by local authorities but they had to be vetted and passed by the inspector from the Department of Local Government, as it was then &mdash; the Department of the Environment now.  It ties the hands of the local authorities behind their backs when local enthusiasm is not harnessed in the way it might be.  It puts a weight around the necks of local authorities.  With decentralisation this is something that could be eliminated.  Local authorities have at present the possibility of entering into <Col N="618" /> money-making situations under the Planning Act and particularly in relation to tourism which was mentioned by the previous two speakers.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to go into but, unfortunately, time does not allow me to do so.  Archaeology is another area where there is a potential for local authorities to have a great input. I refer to the display centre at Kilfenora which could be a model for many other areas.  I do not agree that elected representatives are frustrated.  They may be inhibited to an extent but they are a very resilient group of people.  The present situation places problems before them which they will overcome.  Structural changes are inevitable.  Senator Ferris referred to Fianna Fáil promises that they would change everything.  When the last Coalition Government of which the Labour Party were part came into office the debt was £12 billion and when they left office it had increased to £24 billion. That was the situation this Government inherited.</P>
    <P>My time has expired, unfortunately, and I cannot develop that theme any further.  I would like to say again that the Government have been praised on all sides for their achievements since they took office.  In conclusion, I hope we will be successful in the fiscal and financial areas and that there will be a great improvement in employment as well.  I believe this is coming about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the amendment to the motion I would like to pass a few comments.  I do not intend to spend very long on this amendment.  Much play has been made about the downturn in local authority spending and the fact that jobs have been lost.  Nobody has said that interest rates, since we came into Government, have dropped by over 5 per cent and the rate is now about 6.2 per cent.  Every 1 per cent of a drop in interest rates means that every local authority have a drop in their repayments to the banks.  The banks were milked by the local authorities and I sincerely hope that the Labour Party will acknowledge the fact that, because this Government have <Col N="619" /> managed to get interest rates down, repayments to banks from local authorities have dropped significantly.</P>
      <P>I would think that the drop in interest rates means that there is at least £1 million available to local authorities which was not available when interest rates were at 12 per cent or so.  The repayment of overdraft interest by local authorities has dropped by significant millions of pounds.  The repayment on capital schemes has correspondingly dropped. Therefore, there is a saving for local authorities even if they never embarked on a scheme to ensure that they were managing their affairs effectively.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure whether we should say, as Senator O'Shea did, that he is a member of three local authorities.  I just happen to be an alderman of one, a member of another and a Member of this House.  I can see the problems for local authorities in terms of funds.  The local authority feedback I get is no different from the feedback Senator O'Shea gets but, of course, he interprets it differently. In no way has he said that, because this Government went about their job in the right way because repayments have decreased &mdash; not only repayments decreased but the cost of the services to local authorities has also decreased &mdash; his motion is ineffectual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made about potholes. Certainly there are potholes.  I travel to various countries and there are no bigger potholes in Ireland than there are in any other country.  We have to face the fact that the taxpayer pays for the repair of the potholes and the potholes will not be repaired in this country, any more than in any other country, unless the taxpayer is willing to pay.  The taxpayer has not decided that the repair of potholes is a priority.  Having said that, I travel every day throughout this country and I have never seen a better scheme of repairs on roads than I have seen in the past two years.  If Senator O'Shea who comes from Waterford travels through County Kilkenny he should know that he will not hit one pothole until he travels into another county.  He may hit a pothole <Col N="620" /> going into Kilcullen &mdash; and I would like the authorities in Kilcullen to repair the couple of potholes that are there.  It is not for us, as the Government, to ask the people of Kilcullen to repair the couple of potholes that are there.</P>
    <P>Low-cost houses were mentioned by Senator O'Shea.  A scheme of low-cost houses was brought in by a former Fianna Fáil Government.  At the time there was a crying need to get people out of flats which were over-priced, which were in dire need of refurbishing and the Government of the day decided to provide a certain number of low-cost houses.  I do not know about Waterford but I know that in South Tipperary, Kilkenny, Wicklow and various areas around the country, these houses were provided by the National Building Agency.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary there was a scheme.  In Kilkenny, there were schemes and there were schemes in Wicklow.  Not this Government but another Fianna Fáil Government decided that these houses should be brought up to what were considered to be good standards.  In Kilkenny, the housing schemes built by the NBA are now being brought up to a standard which would be acceptable in any community.  They will far surpass the type of housing available on the private housing market.  This Government have been providing the money and a Government prior to this made certain that these houses would be brought up to standards which are above private housing standards.</P>
    <P>This Government again have made decisions which will ensure that people who live in corporation, or county council, or open housing estates will want to stay in these housing estates.  The Labour Party in Government decided that these people who are tenants of local authority houses wanted to get out; they wanted to get rid of their local authority status and wanted to go into private housing.  What we are saying to them is: &ldquo;We will give you the opportunity to stay in the locality in which you were born.  We will give you the status you deserve.  We are not like the Labour Party in Government, trying to get rid of you out of the <Col N="621" /> housing estates provided by the State.&rdquo; We suggest that the State should provide a certain number of houses for those who need them but, once people go into these housing estates, we do not want them to stay in a ghetto.  We want to ensure that these people can live in these houses and can provide for themselves and their children in the best housing conditions in the world in terms of Government provision for houses.</P>
    <P>On the question of statutory bodies, frustration, I am a member of a local authority, I think, for longer than Senator O'Shea the proposer of the motion.  In the 20 years or more that I have been involved in local authority membership, I have never gone to a corporation meeting or a county council meeting at which there has not been criticism of the lack of funding for local authorities.  I can see there is frustration among local authority members because they feel that all the authority is up here.  I can tell them as a member of the Oireachtas that I feel tremendous frustration that I cannot do any more here than I can do at corporation or county council level.  We depend on the decisions made at Government level.  On a social basis the Labour Party should consider that this Government are providing moneys in a way that the Labour Party should be praising rather than criticising.</P>
    <P>Short time and social employment schemes were mentioned.  In County Kilkenny and in other counties there is no scheme that took from the potential employment of county council or corporation workers.  The social employment schemes were used on the most imaginative projects and they continue to be used on the most imaginative projects. I hope the social employment scheme will never be used to replace workers in the normal scheme.  I compliment the Minister on what he is doing in trying to broaden the social employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I go into various counties and I do not think Senator O'Shea is being true to himself when he criticises what is happening in the centre of Waterford city. The centre of Waterford city is being developed under a scheme which was <Col N="622" /> brought in by our Government.  The fact that in the centre ot Waterford city artefacts over 1,000 years old have been found is a credit to the Government who brought in the scheme, the Government who gave the money for the development of the centre city area.  The artefacts found in Waterford city can perhaps equal those which have been found in Waterford county, Clonmel and wherever.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by suggesting that the motion, tabled, is not relevant and I would like to second the amendment which is in my name but, in actual fact, it is Senator Fitzsimons' motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise in support of the motion in the name of the Labour group.  I do so because last October, I think, I put down a motion somewhat similar to the motion before us tonight in relation to local authority funding.  I did so at that time because I was very conscious of the effect that last year's Environment Vote would have on local authorities.  Looking at the motion in front of us here tonight I think what the Labour Party group are saying is that that vote had a serious effect on the funding of local authorities during the <Col N="623" /> year and they are trying to issue a warning to the Government to take cognisance of that fact in the preparation of the Estimates for the coming year.  That is a very reasonable approach to take and one that we would all have to concur with because we have to learn from the situation on the ground.  The cut in funding &mdash; I think it was 14 per cent overall in last year's Estimates has had a serious effect on local authorities and the work carried out by local authorities &mdash; road schemes and sewage schemes, environmental works, the maintenance of our environmental works and other such works throughout the counties &mdash; has almost come to a standstill due to a lack of funding.  We experienced in my own local authority a cutback in this maintenance work due mainly to a cutback in staff.  Dublin Corporation had voluntary redundancy for several hundred of their staff during the past year.</P>
    <P>Continually, local authorities are being starved of funding.  It is only right that the proposer of this motion should fire a shot across the bows tonight, so to speak, warning the Minister for the Environment to take into consideration the funding of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is a very unique Department because it is a Department that touches almost everyone in the country at some stage or another.  It is a very personal kind of Department as far as the public are concerned. The public are very conscious, too, of the Department of the Environment and the work they carry out. They are also very conscious of the work that local authorities carry out, because while they might not be very clear at national level what is done they certainly take a personal interest at local level.  It is essential that at local level sufficient funding be given to allow local authorities and local representatives who are elected by the local people to carry out the work we have responsibility for.</P>
    <P>It has been my sad experience in the past year in Dublin Corporation, the major local authority in the country, that <Col N="624" /> when I move motions to benefit the environment in my area and in the city generally the answer received from officials is that they would like to carry out the work but, unfortunately, due to lack of funds it is not possible in the current year. I hope that next year there will be a better allocation of funding and that the rates relief grant will not be cut back as severely &mdash; I hope it will be increased &mdash; so that local authorities can carry out this work.  The Minister in his speech last year on the motion on local authority funding said, at column 682 on Wednesday 21 October 1987:</P>
    <P>There is one further very important aspect relating to local authority funding on which I would like to comment. I am not satisfied with the present system of local authority funding.  I have already initiated a review of local finances within the Department with a view to developing proposals for long term reform of the system.  The review is at an advanced stage now in the Department, I will be putting proposals to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>&mdash; We must remember when the Minister said &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; he was making the statement last October &mdash;</P>
    <P>to put local authority funding on a sound and stable footing for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister was only quoting exactly what was in his manifesto in the last local elections when it was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to put local authority funding on a sound and stable footing. Unfortunately, that has not happened. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I think a cheer will go up in every local authority in Ireland once that is in place and running.</P>
    <P>I hope this evening that a cheer goes up in every local authority in the country for a different reason.  I am still waiting for the cheer to go up for the funding.  I think we will be waiting for a long time for the cheer that the Minister was speaking about in relation to local authority funding. It is essential, if we are to have the kind of local authority services that are <Col N="625" /> necessary for the country, that we and the local authorities we represent throughout the country get the funding that is necessary. I fully support the motion before us tonight because it is sounding a warning note to the Minister that the situation is not well on the ground.  It is in a very serious situation on the ground and he should take cognisance of this in the preparation of his Estimates in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be first to concede that the Minister should be facilitated. Due to the importance of the subject of our motion which earnestly cries for attention I would have hoped for a wider interest in it, particularly since there are so many local authority representatives in the House.  I also thought that perhaps at the end of that debate we should conclude by offering remedies that people will actually see to be expedient.  It is another matter whether they are practical. It was meant to be a broader debate and it was meant to have more people participating.  It was meant to deal with the whole question of representation, structure, functions and finance, not just the question of funding alone.  It was hoped in the context of the amendment that it would broaden out in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a general point, because local government, as far as I am concerned, cannot be considered just on its own.  It is a very important part of our democratic system.  The remedies for the ills in local government must be considered in that broader context and hence I speak of suggested remedies.  When we think of the health of our local democracy <Col N="627" /> we must never forget to raise the question of the health of our democracy as a whole. We are running into many problems trying to fund many things, never mind local government.  Consequently, while the wording of the motion deals with the question of getting the Estimates right for the funding for local government for next year, that is a type of limitation on what was actually intended in the overall meaning of the motion.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not the best worded motion but the overall intention was that we would deal with the situation a little more seriously, that we would talk about the question of the opportunities for spontaniety, for local and regional initiatives for enterprises, enterprises which were progressively choked off down the years by the whole question of centralisation. In the past everything had to be referred to central Government, which increasingly was unable to respond positively and assertively.  Hence we get ourselves to the point where we are actually talking about the question of funding rather than talking about the broader democracy in the interest of the health of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have become a nation of centralisers.  It was centralised failure with regard to the question of local government.  I heard it described once as progressive constipation.  It was a fragmented effort.  You had to press on and do your best.  In the past we have been talking about programmes of devolution etc.  Not only this Government but many other Governments and many other people advocated this devolution of power.  It there was a consuming desire to accept this whole question of devolution of power I doubt very much that we would be talking about funding because we would have reached the point of finding out how best local government could generate, in the main, their own finance.</P>
    <P>It is not unheard of for local authorities in some countries to have control over municipal banking systems where they raise their own finance.  It is not unknown for local government to be much further <Col N="628" /> into the whole question of tourism in terms of a spin-off for the local people, activating the whole question of tourism. It is not unknown for local government and local authorities in many countries to sell their trading enterprises and to sell services elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why it has not been possible to think along lines such as that down through the years, instead of bringing it to the point where everybody gets into the dug-out.  We are fighting from a dug-out on the question of funds.  If we had been sincere about broadening democracy and making sure that everybody, from the local parish up to the community as a whole, had an input into how local authorities raised their own money, we would have been much better off.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  We have not been able to raise the level of public responsibility and realism in our society with regard to local government.</P>
    <P>The whole question of civic culture and civic honesty is also causing problems. Because we have not been involved in this question of democracy in the past five or six general elections, the Government have not lost; they have been sacked. The people said: &ldquo;A plague on both of your houses.&rdquo;  That is a reflection of the fact that we have not democratised our local government or given enough power to local government.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we were talking about the advantages we could give to the Electricity Supply Board by extending their enterprise activities, selling services, etc. I do not believe there is anything in the managerial order that would debar local government from actually running municipal banks and becoming more deeply involved in generating tourism for themselves.  Naturally, some spin-off would have to go to central Government. Local government, on a regional and local basis, could do much more on the question of raising finance.  It does not have to be just somebody talking about water rates.  I know the subject of water rates raises the question of employment. I would not knock anything that keeps people at work.  I am not arguing about water rates.  I am not stating the Labour <Col N="629" /> Party point of view.  I am speaking in a general context.</P>
    <P>I suppose we could say that a monster has grown up in the sense that everything was <i>ultra vires</i> as far as local authorities were concerned and the severe trimming was necessary.  Nobody will argue about the fact that there were some difficulties regarding the huge costs of administration. Nevertheless, the question of control was too much.  I agree that when there is a minority Government they have to keep a certain amount of control but they should not necessarily tie their hands so that they cannot generate funds for themselves.  I see the Minister is getting a little anxious.  I must be in breach of the motion or the time.  I imagine it is the time.</P>

With the piecemeal effort and our tendency, down through the years, towards centralisation, we have choked off the progress of local government.  I hope the local representatives I have to call on from time to time will not take me up wrongly when I say they could have been a little more forceful on the question of local democracy.  I am talking about all parties.  One wonders why the force did not generate itself.</P>

      <P>I am extremely pleased to be here with Senators this evening to speak on this motion.  I want to thank all of them for their contributions.  I appreciate them very much.  I thank Senator Ferris for his kind remarks, it is always my aim to help and assist.  I hope that will always be my aim.  I see no reason why it should not be, because that is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised.  I will deal with them as they come to hand in the short amount of time available to me.  Senator O'Shea talked about urban <Col N="630" /> renewal.  As far as his city is concerned I am very hopeful that work will commence in the autumn.  There are very positive proposals, not only in Waterford but in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I was asked why I did not bring in a White Paper on this.  I did not bring in a White Paper on urban renewal.  I set out to do it.  With the approval of the Government I went about that and I designated nine areas.  I am glad to say that many positive proposals are coming from them now.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about Senator O'Shea's county.  I look forward to complete and utter co-operation from everybody.  I know I have that co-operation from the corporation and their members.  I hope to go down there very shortly to see everybody and to see what is taking place. I hope that there will be major development there and I look forward to that.</P>
    <P>Land tax was referred to.  If the land tax was implemented it would bring in £46 million a year.  The income tax yield would be a little less than £46 million. However, it would cost £13 million to introduce the scheme alone.  I never agreed to charge anyone tax on an income that they have not got.  I believe that, if you earn the money, you pay the tax; if you do not earn the money, you do not pay the tax.  It is my view and the view of many legal people as well that it would not stand up in law because it does not take into account ability to pay.  There could be an illness in a house, or wherever the case may be.  That must be taken into account.  That is my view.  I want to make it quite clear that, as far as the Government are concerned now, the tax situation in regard to the farming community is settled.  It will be on earned income.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words also on the social employment schemes.  Those are very good schemes and working well in many counties throughout the country. In some of the counties where they are not in operation &mdash; I am asking this in the most diplomatic way I possibly can &mdash; would the local authorities, the unions, the members, the employees, get together, and solve the problem now and <Col N="631" /> get on with the job.  I do not see how this will interfere with any permanent employees of the local authorities.  If there is a little bit of a difference there they should get around the table, come to an agreement, and get on with the job because otherwise our people will not respect us.  They will blame us and say: &ldquo;Why did you not get your act together?&rdquo; I say to those areas where it is not in operation to set about it now.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about local government financing.  There is a lot of talk about it. The previous Government talked about it for four years and did not come up with any proposals.  I will come back to that later.  Housing interest rates have come down substantially and Senators will agree that those on high mortgages are receiving very substantial decreases in their mortgage repayments.  A person who has a loan of £25,000 will be paying £63 a month less in repayments since the Government took office.  That is into their pockets.  That could only be done by keeping a tight rein on the finances. There was no other way we could do this and, as far as the Department of the Environment are concerned, there cannot and will not be any overspending. We must live within the allocation in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for the Minister and certainly not easy for myself to prepare the Estimates last year for this year.  We set about that and as Senators know, in October last the Estimates were published. Everybody saw all the amounts and before Christmas the local authorities were able to make the necessary arrangements in regard to their finances for this year.  Waste had to go, overlapping had to go.</P>

We cannot borrow money, as <Col N="632" /> was mentioned earlier.  The debt rose from £12 billion to £24 billion and that could not be allowed to go on.  Corrective action had to be taken in that respect, which we are now taking, painful as it may be.  There is no other option open that I can see.  We could have carried on by increasing taxation but we are not prepared to do that because the people are paying too much tax.  We have to get down the taxation base and make ourselves more competitive.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing, Senators know the amount of money that was made available.  In regard to medical schemes, the amount of money last year was £7 million.  Ten million pounds is being provided this year for remedial schemes in housing throughout the country, which all politicians say is money well spent.  I am glad to say that we are getting very good value here for the money.  I must pay a tribute now to the local authorities and the management teams who look after that.  It is very good work.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about other local authorities and housing in general.  We have a position now in the country and up here as well that applicants are now picking and choosing.  They want the end house with the big garden.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a new type of person also, unmarried mothers, smaller families, and other domestic circumstances also.  I would like to see in relation to vacant local authority houses that allocations of these houses would be speeded up because I do not think it is right to see some local authority houses boarded up in some cases for two or three months before allocations are made.  I am appealing to local authorities to take the necessary action to correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk about the roads as well. The total amount of the grant for roads this year is £154 million.  It is to be used for carrying out work on major roads to ports and airports.  The Government are at present carrying out a major review of the roads programme and intend to publish a blueprint for road development <Col N="633" /> over the next decade.  The Government will shortly announce details of the national roads authority which they propose to set up to oversee the development of our national roads system.</P>
    <P>These measures represent a detailed and planned approach to the development of our national roads network, one of the factors which underpin economic development.  As part of the review which the Government have been conducting into the roads system detailed information has been gathered on the condition of the county roads.  There is no doubt that the condition of the county roads has worsened in recent years.  That is why this Government decided to make a special grant of £15 million available this year and last year for the strengthening of county roads.  This is three times the amount paid by the previous Government in their last year of office.  Local authorities have also been given more flexibility in regard to the allocation of the money for the county road network also.  It is up to them now to manage it in the best way they possibly can.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on the subject of local government reform.  We would all accept that an administrative structure set up 90 years ago and that has not changed much since, is in need of a review.  There has been a lot of hot air in regard to this.  The time for talking about it is over.  We want action now.  The Minister and I have now finalised a plan for the future of local government.  We have consulted with the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities, the County and City Managers Association and other interested parties and we have a fairly accurate picture of what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>We do not want short term solutions. The reforms we wish to put in place will have to stand up to the test.  Reform of local government structures on their own is not enough.  Financial reform must go hand in hand with that reform.  Over the years a number of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions have been made about local authority finance. We now have the benefit of two in-depth reports on the matter carried out by the <Col N="634" /> National Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Taxation.  These reports have given a very clear indication of the problems involved and we are intent on meeting these problems.</P>
    <P>The reforms that the Minister and I will put before the Government must be seen to be fair.  We must be able to administer them easily and, above all, they must work.  We are going to set about that now. At a meeting of the General Council of County Councils the other day I put it up to representatives of local authorities across the board whether they have the belly for reform and are prepared to meet the change.  I asked them: &ldquo;Do you want a soft option?  Do you want to run away? Do you want to come and meet me, but I have not got the money?&rdquo;  I would like to give them money but I have explained why I cannot.  I asked them: &ldquo;Do you want that soft option?  It is not around.&rdquo; I warned them that it is not around.  I think that people are expecting more from all the local authority members and elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight now that whatever new arrangements are brought in the financing must be workable and, above all, be fair to the weaker section of our community also.  We will try to endeavour to do that.  That is our aim.  As I said earlier, I do not want anyone running away from reform when it comes, looking for it on the one hand and moving the goalpost, as some would say, when it suits them.</P>
    <P>With your kind permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I will conclude on the new house purchase and tenant scheme.  It gives all local authority tenants a wonderful opportunity to own their own homes.  I am asking you as Members of this House, and members of local authorities as well, to use your influence to bring about the sale of these houses to local authority tenants, because I think nobody can deny it is a very attractive scheme.  I am looking forward to your full co-operation in that.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Shea, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to set the record straight.  For some extraordinary reason Senator Lanigan felt I was criticising what was going on in the centre of Waterford city.  That is far from the case. At all times I have been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of that inner city development and I would like to thank the Minister for his enthusiasm and confidence in what is likely to take place in Waterford later this year.  We are all very hopeful that the project will be well and truly under way by then.  I would like to compliment the Minister for extending the time limit for the completion of the urban renewal package.  There were delays because archaeological remains were discovered in Waterford.  This was very important for us.  That extension ensures that the development can be completed well inside the target time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to compliment the Minister on extending the same programme to nine other centres, because a national problem is that the cores of our cities and towns have in many cases decayed over the past couple of decades. This gives an opportunity for the renewal and redevelopment of these areas.  It does, of course, reduce in the short term the income to local authorities because <Col N="636" /> there are concessions regarding commercial rates involved.  Certainly, overall the thrust and the extension of this policy by the Minister is something we are all very pleased about.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he looks forward to going to Waterford in the very near future.  Let me assure him that he will be most welcome in Waterford.  I think he will be very impressed when he inspects the archaeological remains and, indeed, goes to visit the exhibition of the more important finds that are presently on display in Reginald's Tower.</P>
    <P>We presented this motion in a constructive spirit.  I would like to refer again to the land tax.  The Minister said that the land tax would bring in about £46 million and that it would cost £13 million to implement.  I presented figures earlier, showing that farmers are paying on average about £460 to accountants.  One in four of these farmers then discovers he has no taxable income.  In late 1986 the ICMSA told the Government of the day that they were prepared to pay the land tax on an arbitrary basis until such time as the land survey had been carried out. I still hold that at the end of the day, the State take would be larger.  There is another problem regarding the small farmers, in particular.  We have to take into consideration the family farm unit where the wife and some of the children are obviously involved in the farm enterprise and ensure that the efficient person who is producing is not penalised for being efficient.  I believe that the land tax would serve to improve the appearance of the countryside because the land would be better worked.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons alluded also to this aspect earlier on and said that he feels that taxation should be assessed on accounts.  The proposal by the previous Government was that the land tax should be paid on farms smaller than 80 adjusted acres and that, above 80 adjusted acres, tax on accounts should be implemented. I disagree with the Minister's assessment of the role that land tax could play.  I believe it would put some spirit into the countryside because the young farmer with the young family will know what he <Col N="637" /> has to pay on 1 January every year, taking a good year and in a bad year it may not go so well with them.  It does not penalise enterprise.  There is still quite a lot of land throughout the country that is under-utilised at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister also alluded to the fact that the style of application for local authority housing is changing to some extent and, obviously, the unmarried mothers category has become a larger part of our housing list.  A trend I have noticed too is that single people, be they men or women, in their forties and onwards, are coming onto the housing list.  Consequently we need to provide more smaller houses.  That is a direction in which we have to go.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tenant purchase scheme, all public representatives I know, irrespective of party, are promoting that scheme.  I hope the Minister will be pleased to hear that.  The origins of this scheme relate to the fact that local authorities no longer had the men or the materials to carry out housing repairs and this was the real reason this scheme was introduced.  For instance, in the County Waterford County Council area there is a craftsman and one labourer for east Waterford and a craftsman and one labourer for west Waterford so the level of housing repairs we can carry out in County Waterford is pretty minimal.  I believe this is the reason the Government brought in this scheme.</P>
    <P>A basic problem with this scheme is that it will reduce the housing stock at a time when the housing stock should be increased.  I have some figures.  For instance, if we assume that a local authority house would cost £40,000 in the Dublin County Council area, three houses could be built in Dublin County Council area in 1988, but there are 722 people on the list.  Dublin Corporation have a waiting list of 3,696 people, and no money has been provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about &mdash; and, <Col N="638" /> indeed, the Fianna Fáil amendment talks about &mdash; the problem with the national finances.  There is a severe problem and there is no point in ignoring it.  I accept that it has to be tackled.  I am very concerned about the decline in the services being provided by local authorities.  The Minister may say local authorities must be more efficient and must use their money in a more productive way.  I have seen no fat or waste in the local authorities in the past number of years.  I am horrified at the results of some of the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The Minister is opposing our motion but I still ask him, when the Estimates are being considered, to try to provide the wherewithal to give a dynamic, developmental role to local authorities, one that is geared towards job creation in particular in the tourism area.  The package extended this year for commercial redevelopment is a very important element in that.  More funds need to be provided for archaeological development because all the advice we get in Waterford is that the continental and American tourist is looking for modern shopping development allied to the development of archaeological and historical remains, retaining old street-scapes, retaining our narrow streets and the character of the medieval or Viking cities and towns we have around the country.</P>
    <P>I earnestly put it to the Minister that this is an area for job creation.  The local authorities have an immense role which they cannot play without the funds and the wherewithal.  As the father of six children I hope I will never see them emigrating &mdash; as a teacher I have seen too many of my past pupils emigrate &mdash; I believe the local authorities have a vital role to play here.  I ask the Minister to take full cognisance of this when the Estimates are being drawn up.</P>

      <P>I received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter: the proposal to withdraw school transport contracts from Bus Éireann.  I call on Senator Brian O'Shea; he has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad and thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for giving me this opportunity to raise this issue which we in the Labour Party feel very strongly about.  The whole question of the privatisation of school transport needs to be put in its broadest context.  Bus Éireann, because of the provisions of the 1986 Transport Act, must be in profit by the end of 1989.  All the present indications are that Bus Éireann are well on target to attaining this objective.  Some special offers which were run by Bus Éireann in the latter part of last year and the early part of this year have brought in an extra £250,000 in revenue.  The organisation are showing a degree of entrepreneurial endeavour and this is both very commendable and very important in terms of achieving the objective of being in profit by the end of 1989.  However, much depends on Bus Éireann's involvement with the school transport scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forty-eight per cent of Bus Éireann's <Col N="641" /> revenue comes from their school transport activities.  The knock-on effect for Bus Éireann generally if privatisation was implemented countrywide would obviously be huge.  To illustrate what I mean by this I will outline the position in my own area, Waterford.  Bus Éireann operate a garage in Waterford which employ 33 people.  There are 76 school buses and 39 ordinary buses operating out of Waterford.  If the 76 school buses were to be withdrawn there is no way that the garage overheads could be absorbed by the 39 ordinary buses on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann employs 120 people full time and 67 part time bus drivers in Waterford.  Obviously, the Bus Éireann schools' office in Waterford would close. The garage would also close with further jobs being lost.  The Waterford offices, the regional capital, would be further downgraded as the management would obviously be withdrawn to other centres.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the present position. Ninety-six part-time drivers in Counties Clare, Laois, Cavan and Sligo have been issued with redundancy notices, some of which are to expire at the end of this month with the remainder to expire in mid-July because of the terms of the contracts of service and the particular operations the part-time drivers are involved in.  These drivers, some of whom have been working for CIE since the inception of the school transport scheme in 1967, are being offered statutory redundancy terms &mdash; a half week's pay for each year of service before the age of 40 and a week's pay for each year of service after the age of 40.  There is however a voluntary service scheme operating in Bus Éireann which provides for two and a half week's pay for each year of service. This amounts to blatant discrimination against the part-time drivers and another unsavoury element of these proposed pilot schemes.  Including the part-time drivers, there are 130 jobs at risk.</P>
    <P>Another interesting point is that the yellow buses used in the school transport scheme cannot be used outside school hours and are the property of the Minister <Col N="642" /> for Education.  I would like the Minister to tell us what she is going to do with these 130 buses which will revert back to her as soon as these private schemes are implemented.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to the newly-constructed Bus Éireann garage in Cavan recently completed at a cost of £200,000. I understand that the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy John Wilson, was to perform the official opening in May or June of this year.  Will the Minister now be called on to perform the official closure of the garage?  Interestingly enough, when Deputy Wilson met with shop stewards of the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland in Cavan on 18 May he informed them that he was not aware of any Cabinet decision, or of any pilot project, on the privatisation of school buses in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The confusion goes still further with the Minister for Education claiming that it would cost £80 million to replace the school transport fleet, the Minister for Finance claiming that it would cost £50 million and finally Bus Éireann claiming that it would cost £20 million.  If we take the middle figure, £50 million, the cost averages out at £100,000 per bus, which is the price of a superbus, which, as the Minister will agree, are a lot more expensive than school buses.  My information is that there are 850 buses in the Bus Éireann fleet and that all but 141 of these are over age.  Trade union sources contend that the fleet could be replaced over six years at a cost of £1 million per year.  I understand that the Ministry for Defence in Britain have offered Bus Éireann 35 buses, compatible with existing Bus Éireann stock, at an all in cost of £248,500 sterling.  The estimated cost of each bus is £7,100.  Trade union sources contend that such buses could be obtained from the English service over a period to replace the Irish school transport fleet.  These buses would have a high standard of maintenance and repair and a good working lifespan ahead of them.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement strongly contend that a national bus building industry is essential but that in the present economic climate the finance is just not <Col N="643" /> going to be provided to buy new buses and that the short term remedy, as I have outlined, is the only real solution at the moment.  It is estimated that the exercise in the Counties of Laois, Cavan, Clare and Sligo will bring about a saving of £348,000 per annum.  We must balance this against the estimated £421,000 per annum which would be paid in unemployment benefit together with the loss of £27,000 in PRSI contributions and £21,000 in PAYE payments.  The total cost to the State would be £469,000.  Let me repeat that the Minister would also find herself with 130 redundant yellow buses which would have limited use.  I do not envy the Minister that one.</P>

      <P>I cannot speak about something I was not involved with but we are talking about the present and what the Minister intends to do.  The transport liaison officers in each of the four counties mentioned are, according to my information, to recruit three people to assist them in operating this scheme.  It has been alleged that retired employees of CIE who availed of the voluntary redundancy package in the public service have already been approached to become involved in the scheme.  It is not clear to trade union sources whether these people are to be remunerated by way of expenses which would be tax free or by way of a salary which would be subject to PAYE <Col N="644" /> and PRSI deductions.  I ask the Minister to clarify that point for me.</P>

      <P>This whole exercise is in breach of the agreement contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1986.  These compulsory redundancies were announced without consultation. The future of Bus Éireann is being put at risk.  The computer system, which cost £200,000 and which Bus Éireann use in the operation of the school transport scheme, could very well become redundant.  This exercise makes no sense in terms of efficient administration and cost effectiveness.  It grossly offends the spirit and the letter of the agreement contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It resembles the decisions which have already been made and which have given rise to such chaos in the health services. The exercise appears to be based on misinformation and confusion.  I earnestly request the Minister to withdraw the redundancy notices before irreparable harm is done not alone to the school transport scheme but to Bus Éireann. Following this, immediate discussions should take place between the company and the unions on the replacing of the fleet.</P>

      <P>Let me first of all say, lest my non-reply be taken to indicate that I am in agreement with the charges the Senator has made, that I do not intend in public, in this House or in any other forum to reply to allegations made about certain persons and certain areas.  That is not my function.  What the Senator may say is his business; what I may say is another matter.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Shea for bringing this matter to the attention of this House. In respect of the school transport pilot projects and the consequences as the Senator sees them, for Bus Éireann and their staff, the Senator asked me to withdraw the redundancy notices issued.  I have never issued a redundancy notice to a person in CIE.  Let me make it quite clear that it is not my function to issue redundancy notices to the employees of Bus Éireann.  That is their function, not mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked if I would now withdraw redundancy notices issued to Bus Éireann staff.  It is not my function to issue redundancy notices to Bus Éireann staff.  That is their own business. I have no hand, act or part to play in the issuing of redundancy notices.  I have to make it quite clear that it is not my function to do so.  The second point which I want to make is that when I went to investigate this matter I was amazed to find that the Department of Education are paying 48 per cent of school transport costs.  The Senator also referred to that fact.  That places an enormous burden on any Minister for Education who receives no subsidy from any other Department towards the running of this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should put the issues into perspective by outlining the background to the school transport service. <Col N="646" /> Quite obviously, Senator O'Shea's information is not up-to-date and I cannot blame him for that.  Perhaps his union sources did not have it.  But, as he is aware, I have had some meetings with them recently on the role of Bus Éireann in providing such a service.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education have the responsibility to ensure the satisfactory delivery of transport services to approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary students throughout the length and breadth of this land.  They also have the responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service. This is particularly so in the current economic circumstances, for all services have to be rigorously examined in regard to cost effectiveness.  This scheme will cost approximately £36 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed over many years and from many quarters at this level of expenditure, and indeed the last Government made very advanced plans for these pilot projects.  They did not put them into operation but I know from a perusal of the records that very advanced plans, far more advanced than the ones I have now made, were made by the previous Government of which the Senator's party was a part.  Concern has been expressed over many years from many quarters at this level of expenditure and I consider it our responsibility to explore all possible means of reducing the drain on our financial resources while continuing to give a satisfactory level of service to our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator is aware, the day to day operations of the school transport scheme are carried out by Bus Éireann as the agent for the Minister for Education; and again I repeat I do not issue redundancy notices to the employees of Bus Éireann. This function has been discharged efficiently by Córas Iompar Éireann, as it then was, and by Bus Éireann since the inception of the scheme in 1967-68.  In the intervening 20 years generations of children have benefitted from the <Col N="647" /> scheme, many of whom would otherwise have had extreme difficulty in ever getting to a school or getting to it on a regular basis.  Great care is exercised in all aspects of the operation and the expertise and the good work of the company is worthy of appreciation.  I have constantly said in public that our first concern is the safety of the children.  All other factors come after that.  In this respect Bus Éireann have a record unparalleled in Europe for the safe transport of children. Nonetheless, it is essential to explore all possible means of reducing expenditure and, as part of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, the Government have had under consideration the possibility of introducing a system based on local arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are many issues which are relevant to the question of the devolution of the school transport operations as, for example, the matter of replacement of the school bus fleet, possible savings in administration and whether more flexibility in operations could be brought about in the system based on localised organisation.  The examination of any schemes to be considered will include the determination of pupils' entitlement and the allocation of bus routes.  All routes will be put out to tender and it will be open to Bus Éireann to tender in the normal way.  I do not think that fact is being fully appreciated but the unions did appreciate it when we put it to them across the table.  The projects will be monitored and the question of a general application of these or any similar arrangements will be considered when we see how these schemes are operating.</P>
    <P>In regard to the consequence of these projects for Bus Éireann and their staff, these were put very forcibly to the Minister for Labour and myself at a very long and comprehensive meeting about two weeks ago which we had in this building with the unions at their request.  Our primary concern, as I have said, is to provide a satisfactory school transport <Col N="648" /> service at the lowest possible cost to the State.  As matters stand, the Department are a major customer of Bus Éireann and will continue to be during the coming school year.  In establishing the pilot projects we are, in effect, testing another model for the transport service and I consider that we are perfectly justified in so doing for the reasons already given.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that any pilot project would have an open tendering arrangement and the company would have the opportunity to secure substantial business as a contractor in the project areas. In general it will be a matter for the company to adjust to changed circumstances, which is an intrinsic part of everyday commercial activity and indeed which is a matter the Senator spoke about.  The Senator referred to how Bus Éireann were getting their act together, justifiably so, in the economic circumstances under which we live.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity that Senator O'Shea has given me to correct the impression that we are engaged on a sweeping scheme of privatisation. Indeed, I might mention that over 60 per cent of the school transport services already being provided are being provided by private contractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the problem is the administration of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the service in the four counties involved, which we have under consideration, is along the lines I have outlined.  On the operational side, an open tendering arrangement would give Bus Éireann an opportunity to maximise their share of the contracting business for the benefit of employees, whose future is of course of concern to us in this House and indeed to Deputies in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind the pilot projects is that there should be a genuine devolution of the school transport service to local parties but I can assure the Senator, <Col N="649" /> however, that the essential provisions to cover real hardship cases, such as the lack of adequate means on the part of parents or guardians, and to cater for handicapped children, will be maintained.  The Senator and his party, and indeed all Members, may have had some worries in that respect.  The Senator did not mention this in his remarks but I know that he shares my wish that in genuine hardship cases, such as the lack of adequate means, and in catering for the handicapped, the wide discretionary travel arrangements, which they presently enjoy, would continue to be made.</P>
    <P>I should mention that with the Minister for Labour I met a delegation from ICTU in connection with the pilot projects and we agreed that the issue should be fully examined in the light of the information, costs and other matters which had been outlined to me in a letter from the chairman, Mr. Conlon, some days before that and also in the light of information supplied by the ICTU delegation.  I shall be reporting to Government on the outcome of this examination and I shall, of course, be writing to the ICTU in connection with this matter also.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that we are talking about pilot projects and I cannot predict what the outcome of this examination will be. I ought to say, however, that the concept of the transfer of the organisation of the school transport service to local parties has been put forward by many interests, and I referred to this earlier, over a great many years.  My view and the Government's view is that we shall never know how a devolution of the service to local organisations would work unless we get around to actually trying it out on a pilot basis and I am sure all concerned would agree with me.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to the school transport fleet and its replacement.  The figures which I have quoted were given to us over the years by Córas Iompair Éireann or Bus Éireann as it is now known.  Quite simply, no matter how many millions are required, be it £20 million or £80 million, this Government or any other Government <Col N="650" /> would not have that much money to spend on new buses or replacement buses.  The present buses are steadily going beyond the age at which they should be replaced.  They are not all going to fall down on the same day.  Replacement will take place on a gradual process and we have been very mindful of the fact that it is not within our scope to provide the capital required to do so.  I do not know whether it will ever be within our scope to do so but it is certainly not within the scope of the Government at present.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the offer from the Ministry of Defence in Britain &mdash; which was sent to me a couple of days before that meeting &mdash; to sell buses to Bus Éireann. You cannot just accept offers like that straight away.  The offer would have to be examined in a thorough and comprehensive way, in the light of the facts given to me in a letter I received from the ICTU.  It is not a case of just waving your hand and saying we will take all of the buses being offered by the Ministry of Defence.  There are all sorts of matters to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The buses are not used for any purpose other than the carrying of children to and from school.  They could be used in a number of other ways.  The unions at that meeting put forward the idea that the buses could be used in other ways when not being used to take children to and from school.  Many issues came up and I only wish they had come up last October. In my Estimates speech I announced the four pilot projects.  However, there was a long silence after that.  Many very important and interesting issues were raised at that meeting which will be of help in the formulation of the pilot projects. Talks are going on at present between the officials of Bus Éireann and the officials of my Department and when various factors and facts have been teased out, I will report back to the Government.</P>
    <P>Let me make two facts quite clear. First, neither I nor my office issue redundancy notices to those employed in Bus <Col N="651" /> Éireann.  It is not our job to do so and, secondly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>The record will show what the Senator has said in the House <Col N="652" /> and I wish to correct it.  Secondly, I do not want to comment on allegations made about particular people to be employed by the CEOs.</P>
