      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent decisions by the Minister for Finance not to re-appoint a director to the board of Irish Life Assurance Company Ltd. and the appointment of two new directors.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill and the remaining part of the motion.  It is proposed that the order of the House which fixed the date for the taking of Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill for tomorrow be discharged to allow the Bill to be taken today.  On completion of the Second Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill last Thursday the House fixed the date for Committee Stage as Thursday, 9 June.  That is why the Bill does not appear on the Order Paper as a numbered item of business but rather it appears at the end of the Order Paper under the heading &ldquo;Bills in Progress&rdquo;. It is intended to take the Intoxicating Liquor Bill until 3.30 p.m., the <Col N="3" /> Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill from 3.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., the motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock and to resume the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill at 8 o'clock.  The House will adjourn not later than 12 o'clock tonight.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may we take it that we will not have the Report and Final Stages of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill today, merely the Committee Stage?  If this is agreed, the Order of Business is agreed also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I in no way wish to be obstructive but this is the first I have heard of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill being taken today.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could give us some reason why this is so.  It is not on the Order Paper.  I do not understand it and it is unfair to the House without explanation of any sort for this to be sprung on us in this way.  I would like the Leader of the House to give us some reason why this has happened.  The second thing I would like to ask about is the Companies (No. 2) Bill and what the plans for that Bill are, whether there was agreement amongst the Whips about this or whether there was an agreement amongst the Whips about the Intoxicating Liquor Bill?</P>
      <P>The third thing I would like to ask the leader of the House about is Item No. 17, the abolition of hanging Bill, in my name and in the names of other Independent Senators.  I wonder if the Leader of the House would tell us what the Government's attitude is to this Bill.  We and Turkey are the only countries left in Europe that have hanging on the Statute Book.  I wonder if the Government have any plans to abolish it, especially in the light of the fact that the British House of Commons for the umpteenth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was a mistake to bring the House of Commons into it.  I did not mean to say that they rejected hanging again yesterday.  I would like the Leader of the House to tell us whether the Government intend to leave this on the Statute Book.  It is high time that they faced this issue once and for all.  It is very easy for them to take it off.  It is very, very easy for them to duck it.  I would like a reply from the Leader of the House on that.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Ross, this is the first intimation I have had that we are taking the Intoxicating Liquor Bill today. I discussed this with the Whip and I understand that he was trying to contact me over the weekend and was unable to do so, so I accept what he has said as being true.  I am also anxious to know if the Report Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill will be taken tomorrow.  I share Senator Ross's concern about hanging. He is probably the only conservative who is soft on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised over a number of weeks the question of the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the need to have it taken fairly urgently in the House. Last week I was assured that it could not be taken this week so that we could deal with the Insurance Bill which now is not being dealt with either this week.  The two most urgent matters of business before the House are now being ignored, as it were.  I will certainly be proposing an amendment to the Order of Business today that we take the Companies (No. 2) Bill today.</P>

      <P>The point was put to the House at 10.50 p.m.  The record of the House will show that it was done in accordance with the rules of the House. At any stage the Order of Business can be changed by order of the House.  I order the business in the morning and after that it can be changed.</P>
      <P>As far as the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill are concerned, we were ordering today's business and we are sitting tomorrow.  In order to facilitate Senator O'Toole, the Insurance Bill will be taken tomorrow and the Companies (No. 2) Bill will be taken next week.  I gave an indication last week &mdash; Senator O'Toole must not have been listening &mdash; that it would not be taken this week, that it would be taken next week.  He looked for an agreement that he would have time to study the amendments that were put down by the Government. Because of that it was suggested that we would take the Companies (No. 2) Bill next week.</P>

I intend to have the record of the House put right.  I demand that the Cathaoirleach defend me on this point.  I have spoken week after week on this issue and I will not be browbeaten <Col N="7" /> by an unruly Leader of the House who refuses to listen or to give any commitment as to what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <P>I would like to assure the House that that is utterly untrue.  I have asked for these amendments week after week after week, five times in the past two weeks and at least a dozen times in the past couple of months.  This kind of behaviour is what brings this House into disrepute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Insurance Bill will be taken tomorrow.  The matter raised by Senator McCormack has nothing to do with the Order of Business.  The Report Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill will not be taken today: it will be taken tomorrow. As far as item No. 17 is concerned, I will pass on the remarks that were made to the Government.  I do not think this issue will be brought forward in the near future.  Senator Ross asked again about the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  It will be taken next week.  As regards the remarks passed about changing the Order of Business, my Whip can deal with that.  Every effort was made to contact both Senator Ferris's office and Senator O'Toole's office and neither office could be contacted. I will leave that to Senator Ryan to explain.  The Order of Business is as I have stated.</P>

      <P>I want to say this. Immediately I discovered that there was a question about the Business yesterday morning, I asked my secretary to ring Senator O'Toole's office and Senator Ferris's office to inform the Fine Gael people.  Senator Manning's office was aware of it.  My secretary said that she got no reply from their offices.  That is all I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of the Bill gives the Minister for Tourism and Transport power to make standard regulations for restaurants. These cannot come into operation until the Bill is enacted into law. As soon as the regulations have been <Col N="10" /> made, the Minister for Justice will bring Part II into operation by commencement order.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport expects to be in a position to bring the regulations into operation soon after the Bill is enacted.  I understand that the regulations are practically 99 per cent ready for the Minister to bring to the House as soon as the Bill is enacted.  As a result of requests in the other House &mdash; to which I readily agreed because I can see the commonsense of them &mdash; I accepted the proposition that we would approve the regulations when the Bill is enacted.  Heretofore, when regulations came in there were 21 days in which to annul them.  That is the only hold-up and that is part and parcel of the need to get things moving as quickly as we can, bearing in mind remarks made by certain Senators on the last occasion that the law is being broken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>If all Stages of the Bill are approved here tomorrow and if there are one or two amendments to go back to the Dáil, I would hope to get the agreement of all parties in the Dáil as quickly as possible.  Then it is a matter for the President, which normally takes a few days. I hope the Minister for Tourism and Transport will come to the Dáil certainly before the summer recess and he will have to come here also to approve the regulations for the special licences for the restaurants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the remainder of the Bill will come into operation as and when we have the full approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The only delay will involve getting the regulations to deal with the requirements for the restaurant <Col N="11" /> licences.  That will take a little longer but, in the meantime, the remainder of the Bill will come into operation immediately.</P>
      <P>I gave an assurance in the other House which I would like to repeat in this House.  If in October or November it is seen that there is a need of further amendments I will be prepared at that stage to bring a special short Bill into the Dáil to try to improve the situation and to try to bring some common sense and reality into our licensing laws.  I am not prepared to sit back for another 20, 30 or 40 years before we look again at the licensing laws.  I volunteered that assurance in the Dáil and I would like to put it on the record of this House also.</P>

      <P>Can we take it that copies of the regulations the Minister will make will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the Library so that we can look at them and go over them?  I presume they are not ready yet?</P>

      <P>In reply to senator Ferris, it is my intention to ensure that every Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; Seanad and Dáil &mdash; will have a full copy of the regulations before they can be implemented.  They can only be implemented after approval by the Seanad and the Dáil.  Senators will have to have them and there will be a debate on them.  Then, and only then can they be implemented.</P>

      <P>In the other House there was a considerable amount of debate on the definition of &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; the floor area of which does not exceed 20 per cent of the dining area of the restaurant.  There is a provision in the Bill for the sale of liquor in the dispensing area.  Is the Minister satisfied that a waiting area could not, in fact, become a second pub?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave every assurance to the other House, which I also want to give to this House &mdash; and I am thankful to Senator Manning for giving me an opportunity to do so &mdash; that it is my very firm intention to ensure that these waiting areas shall never develop into what we would call pubs.  We have been as strict and as tight as we have been to ensure that this does not happen.  We went to a lot of trouble, as was our responsibility, to study other areas to see what went wrong with legislation of this type when introduced.  We learned from their mistakes and that is why I then decided to recommend to Government &mdash; and the Government agreed &mdash; that we should restrict the waiting area to 20 per cent of the size of the dining room area and that it should be defined as a waiting area and not a bar area.  That is why we changed the definition of the bar area in the earlier part of the legislation.  Drink may be ordered there when a meal has been ordered and drink may be served there, but there will not be a bar there.  Drink will be there by waiter service.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether this <Col N="13" /> is relevant to this section but the Minister has outlined a point of particular concern to publicans about the definition of a bar within a restaurant which is very questionable. May I ask the Minister &mdash; this has been asked by the Licensed Vintners' Association but I do not know whether or not the Minister has been informed of it &mdash; if a special licence is to be given to people with a defined area, we are not allowing a publican who is prepared to build or improve his premises to become a special restaurant area to get the same licence?  In other words, if a publican decides to improve his premises &mdash; and many are now improving their premises enormously &mdash; is he allowed to apply for the same licence and get the same benefits as those who are getting a special licence now from Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the instance outlined by Senator Cregan it may not be necessary for the vintner to give up his ordinary licence to do exactly what the Senator says but, in the event of his so doing &mdash; and I see no valid reason why he should &mdash; he could make an application for a special restaurant licence.  I can see no advantage for him in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister if that is so, but the special restaurant licence gives the licensee more benefits than a publican has.  I have no objection to that if the Minister would agree that the publican is entitled to open for the same hours as a restaurant but the Minister is not saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misunderstood the Senator but I think I see more clearly now what he means, that is, that it is the desire of the vintner to get a restaurant licence.  The special restaurant licence may be obtained under very specific regulation and, if a vintner wants to avail of the additional benefits by way of serving drink for an extra hour until 12.30 a.m., he must comply fully with the regulations that will be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas to qualify for that special restaurant licence and only then can he qualify for that special restaurant licence. <Col N="14" /> Otherwise every vintner in the country could apply for this licence.  Representatives of their association in recent times said they see no reason &mdash; we all see every reason &mdash; why every pub cannot be allowed to serve food until 1.30 a.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will enable restaurants to get special licences at a cost of £3,000 but in fairness &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; there are excellent pubs, particularly in the Dublin area and also throughout the country, which have great restaurant facilities and have a pub licence also.  These are pubs that have been changed to become specialitists in restaurant food.  Is the Minister saying that, because he does not have the special restaurant licence, the owner of such a pub is not entitled to have a person on his premises after 11.30 p.m., even at an extra cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator not aware that the facility which he is talking about is already there and availed of by vintners because, if they wish to serve drink with food up to 12.30 a.m., they can make an application to the court for a restaurant certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by <Col N="15" /> Senator Cregan may be relevant to the other section but he is talking about an extension that can be given to certain publicians who have facilities for dinner dances and late night drinking.  A special licence can be obtained for this but this does not apply to the ordinary publican who has a restaurant on his premises in which, say, six people can have a meal. Senator Cregan wants to ensure that, in the defined area of their premises, they can give the kind of service under the special restaurant licence that is included under this section.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's definition of the waiting area and how that will be operated.  First of all he specifies a percentage of the dining space, that only 20 per cent of the dining space can be used for a waiting space.  The reality is different from that.  There are high class restaurants where the waiting area is greater than 20 per cent.  What will happen to those when this legislation is passed?  Will they have to carry out alterations to curtail the waiting area?  If people go into a restaurant and look at the menu and, while doing so, order a drink they will not be asked by the restaurateur &mdash; certainly no tourist would be asked because they would leave immediately &mdash; if they are definitely going to have a meal because if not they cannot be served a drink.  You can have a drink while looking at the menu but it might happen that when you look at the menu you might not like anything on it and leave.  Technically a restaurateur would be breaking the law in that case as the Minister has outlined it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice at the moment is that you go into a restaurant, and are fortunate enough to be able to afford to go into one, you get the menu and order a drink but you might not have a meal there because you might not like what is on the menu, or the price might not be right. Because you had a drink there they could be in trouble.  Let us reassure the restaurateurs about the insertion we are talking about here in relation to the waiting area.  In a good restaurant a person might often have to wait an hour for <Col N="16" /> a table.  Therefore, this area will be a drinking area for people in the process of waiting for a meal and you might enjoy the meal a lot better at the end of it.  Let us not be tied down to the parliamentary draftsman's words.  I want to ensure that this is operable and from my experience at the moment, limited and all as it is, this would be inoperable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris has raised a very real point.  I have a slightly different situation in mind where a restaurant is established.  There might not be a great trade in the restaurant.  There is a waiting area and the owner decides that there is a good passing trade &mdash; people like to come in after work &mdash; and so he provides hamburgers, sausages, and so on, and also serves pints and all other types of drinks in the normal way.  In the waiting areas, so defined, is the law being broken in that case?  People may well even have their meal at the bar in the waiting area.  One of the very common features of summertime in the country is when an outside area, a patio, is open out and people sit outside.  This could be very much more than 20 per cent of the actual waiting area.  Is the outside area counted as part of the 20 per cent?  Again I could see the possibility, especially in populated areas, of a restaurateur availing of what is a very good market among people who would like to have a drink, a small piece of food, maybe outside the hours or whatever.  The offer of food could make it more attractive.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification from the Minister on what happens when the bar closes at 11.30 p.m. and the customers then move in, as Senator Ferris has said, to a restaurant. Is there a definition of the type of meal they can have and are customers in breach of the law if they have a drink before the meal, irrespective of whether they wish to continue and consume their order?  Especially in tourist areas like Galway, this would discriminate very much against a publican.  Everybody would leave at 11.30 p.m. and order a meal in a place which could still sell liquor <Col N="17" /> up to 12.30 a.m.  What is the situation at 12.30 a.m. if the meal is not finished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to section 6.  I came down from my office to have my say on that.  What is the situation on that?  If people look at the menu and order steaks and do not wait for the steaks, are they in breach of the law if they drink two rounds of pints in the meantime?  If that is the case, it would be a very severe discrimination against a genuine bar licensee who has to close his premises at 11.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senators who have just raised these important points will now readily understand the difficulties I have had in trying to put this legislation together.  It is a very complicated, complex, delicate, and unbelievably difficult piece of legislation. What we were trying to cater for from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; was to provide a situation whereby in bona fide restaurants &mdash; not hamburger joints, not fish and chippers, not takeaways, nobody wants that, or at least those who want it are not getting it &mdash; where bona fide meals are being consumed, people will be entitled to have a drink with their meal.  There was a general desire right across the board that that need should be catered for and, in doing that, I availed of the opportunity to try to be as liberal as I could in other ways to help the trade generally.  That was the basis from which I started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to ensure that restaurants which will now probably be eligible for these special licences will never develop into bars, or into pubs as such.  That was something I had to protect against and I did that in the only way I could, that is, by defining &ldquo;waiting area&rdquo; and more so by regulation as Senators will see when the regulations come before them for their approval.  A waiting area is within the building.  It is not on the street, as Senator Manning mentioned.  It is a custom and a tradition I enjoy myself.  It <Col N="18" /> is nice to sit outside drinking Ballygowan, watching the strollers pass by.</P>
    <P>We have had to be very careful to define the waiting area.  It is not a bar.  It can never be a bar.  It is an area where drink may be consumed by people who are there for the legitimate purpose of having a meal.  It would be an offence to go there for a drinking session and not have a meal.  If it is an offence, it is against the law and that is something that will have to be taken into account when that licence comes up for renewal in the 12 monthly period.  The waiting area has been very clearly defined.</P>
    <P>In the other House, as Members will probably be aware, there was genuine worry that already the sharkers were moving in greater numbers into Leeson Street, that the waiting area would probably be two floors of the house and the little dining room would be downstairs and overnight we would be given people licences to print their own money because of what would happen then.  That is why we decided with full approval and without any vote in the other House, after many days of discussion in great detail on a 20 per cent limit of the dining area where drinks can be consumed, where it will not be a bar, where drink will be brought.  I have tried to define clearly what the waiting area is as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with Senator Ferris's points.  There is a full restaurant certificate available for public houses, for vintners who serve full means.  They can have their special exemption in the normal way.  That is not interfered with in any way in this Bill.  There is the limited restaurant certificate.  That is provided for again in existing legislation.  There can be no fear.  This was raised by Senator McEllistrim very forcefully on the morning the Bill was introduced here.  I gave him a very clear assurance which I will repeat here.  It is nobody's intention that fish and chippers, take-aways or caravans for that matter will be able to serve liquor and call it a substantial meal.</P>
    <P>There has always been a problem about and an abuse of what was meant to be a substantial meal in the 1979 legislation. Everybody here knows that, and perhaps <Col N="19" /> most people would have been aware of that abuse over the years at different functions we may have attended.  Senator Ross has gone.  He was the only one who admitted publicly that he broke the law on every occasion he went into a restaurant. I was wondering whether that meant he did not pay his bill.  I do not mean that, of course.  I apologise to him. We have to be very careful that the regulations to be made will clearly spell out what a substantial meal is, the type of premises which will qualify for this special licence, a whole lot of very strict requirements, more strict than many will expect and they will come before Senators for their approval.</P>
    <P>If I were asked &mdash; and it is only an opinion at this stage &mdash; how many licences I could see getting under way in the first full year &mdash; not even this year, unfortunately, because of the heavy legislative programme of both Houses we may not have the restaurants up and running this year &mdash; I would say if there are 100 in the country I will be very surprised.  We have to be careful that we do not allow them to become pubs overnight because I do not think that is anybody's intention.  We all want to do what we can to encourage the tourist trade.  We want to see people enjoying a drink of Guinness or a drink of whatever it is with their meal and doing it without breaking the law.</P>
    <P>There should never be a law on our Statute Book making it an offence to drink a bottle of Guinness or a bottle of Heineken with your meal if that is what you desire.  That is the way it should be. You can go into any pub in any part of the country, and most pubs are in the food business right now, without any great criticism from the restaurants.  Most pubs are doing tremendous food business at present and I think most publicans would agree that, but for the food trade they are doing now, many of them would be feeling the pinch.  I am speaking with a little bit of experience because over the past 12 months I have had many meetings <Col N="20" /> with different interests in the liquor business and I hope I have a reasonable knowledge of the difficulties at present.  I think I have covered most of the comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is very much involved and very much up to date on the drink trade.  To a person who is involved in the trade the Minister is a breath of fresh air.  It is good to hear a person who knows what he is talking about.  If I can get a point clarified now we will get through the Bill more quickly. Because of the way consumption of drink is going and the way the drink trade is going generally, over the past two to three years, many publicans have put a lot of money into diversifying their business into the food trade.  That has been welcomed generally.  It has done no harm to the pub trade.  Should we not be considering the idea of giving the same facilities to these people that the special licensed people are now getting?  I do not think it is asking too much and I do not think we will be giving away too much. They have spent a lot of money in upgrading their businesses not alone for drink but to provide better facilities for our tourists and that is all the more reason why we should be considering them.  I do not think any person should get it openhandedly. Bord Fáilte should recommend that they should get it.  If Bord Fáilte recommend that the pub owner is serving substantial meals should he than not be entitled to have the same facility?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for his contribution.  I do not think there is any difference between us on this because, as I understand it &mdash; and I am so advised &mdash; publicans can get a limited restaurant certificate if they want to which empowers them to serve drink up to 12.30 a.m.  They may do that by applying to the courts for it.  Under existing legislation &mdash; not this Bill &mdash; they can do that if they want to.  They can make application for that.  There are special requirements laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>Perhaps I might clear up the problem.  In my county, which is a tourist county, we have pub owners who have restaurant licences.  They had to go to court and those pubs can stay open until 12.30 a.m.  It is difficult to get those licences in the courts but there are a good few of them in my county.  I presume a licence is available to any publican who thinks he is serving a sufficiently good meal.  He can apply to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this Bill would not interfere with the existing rights of publicans who serve excellent bar food.  I welcome that.  Senator McEllistrim is assisting in the process of trying to explain.  Under another Act publicans with facilities for dancing and dinner dances in clubs, and so on, have the facility to apply for a late night bar. They do it on special occasions, perhaps <Col N="22" /> two or three nights a week.  That is for a different purpose.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the legitimate publican who serves a legitimate meal. Can he serve it in the bar up to closing time and after under the special licence which is granted to restaurateurs?  Are we into the question of the waiting area? Has it to be in another part of the premises or can the food be consumed in the bar?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Ferris is saying will not apply.  There will be no question of a waiting area in the circumstances the Senator is talking about because that is covered by different legislation. The only time a waiting area is specifically required is when we are talking about special restaurant licences because they are limited.  I do not want the limited restaurant licences to develop into full pub licences any more than any body else does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want publicans who are legitimately involved in providing food to be in difficulty after hours particularly if they are serving proper food in the premises in the way Senator McEllistrim has said it can happen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a publican can stay open if he is serving food.  It has to be more precise than that. <Col N="23" /> If he is serving food to me and to each and every customer, that is so.  In fact, if a publican is serving food he might only serve food to 20 people and he may have 32 people in the bar.  That is a policing problem, and a very serious one.  The first response by the Minister to Senator Manning is a useful one and one we should welcome and recognise which is that the Minister is prepared to look at this law to see how it functions.  That is welcome.  Everyone in the industry welcomes the introduction of a new measure but it will not be Utopia.  It will not be perfection in itself, by any means.  The kind of friendly discussion the Minister is inviting now will tease out the problems. The Minister's attitude is the right one.  I would like the Minister to keep to the specifics.  How does he see it as a simple policing operation for anybody in the trade who wants to be openly in breach of the time limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being advised to keep to the specifics and I will.  I want to be very open and straightforward with Members of Seanad Éireann because this is an area about which we all think we are knowledgeable.  I do not think any of us could claim to have full knowledge in this area.  For 12 months I have had more meetings than I will ever want to have again with any group on any other piece of legislation, but I felt that was necessary. It is totally non-political.  It affects each and every one of us.  I approached this with a very simple attitude but full of common sense, and that was: &ldquo;Look, please help me to make a good law right across the board.&rdquo;  I did not want any one vested interest &mdash; I ran into difficulty with this &mdash; to use their powers of persuasion or put pressure on me to take something from the other interests.  Some Senators will know that I took flak for that and I did not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went straight down the middle with each of the sectional interests.  They are all entitled to make their living.  They are all entitled to protect their investments. In the Dáil I accepted amendments which were good amendments.  In fact, I have <Col N="24" /> an amendment down here today which I got on the very last night we finished which I think is an excellent amendment. It means going back to the Dáil and I will do that because it is a worthwhile amendment.  I have been very open, as I think we should and must be in areas like this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specifics and how we are going to enforce the special restaurant licences, the regulations, first, will have to be complied with.  We will be dealing with those regulations when we come to the sections in the Bill.  Those regulations will be very, very strict indeed.  They will have to be complied with and they will have to be inspected by Bord Fáilte.  I know this cuts across an amendment by Deputy Manning but I can see the value of what he is trying to do.  I can see the sense in what he is trying to do and I have problems with it.</P>
    <P>I want to see these regulations approved by the Oireachtas and only then going to Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte will then see that such a restaurant belonging to Senator Ferris is of such quality and that the types of meal served will fulfil the requirements of a substantial meal. Only then will he be given the certificate and the licence by the court to operate. That will be up for renewal on a yearly basis.  He pays £3,000 for the privilege. Many criticised that and said it was far too high.  I tried to keep a fair balance.  I ran into trouble with the country vintners' associations who wanted me to give them all the money we collected from the license to buy up the old licenses that they have hanging around the country. My instinct is that any moneys I can get must be for the Exchequer and not for the vintners.  I do not think any serious-minded person would object to that.</P>
    <P>With regard to how these premises will be run, they will be subject to scrutiny by the law.  There has to be a cut off time. If the law says drink may not be consumed with food after 12.30 a.m., there will have to be a cut off time.  I suggest to people that, instead of starting their meal at 12.20 a.m. they might move it forward and start it at 11.20 p.m. or thereabouts.  Otherwise it will be 1.30 <Col N="25" /> a.m. or 2.30 a.m. when they finish.  Perhaps in ten or 12 years time when most of us might still be around, there may not be any restriction on the sale of liquor at all.  Perhaps we will be able to drink round the clock if we want to.  As it stands at the moment, this is not on.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties.  The inspection will not be confined to any senior officer.  There was a privilege in older legislation but thankfully we have gone beyond those days.  If a law officer wants to enforce the law and that law officer is properly and duly trained, he may inspect the premises.  At the end of the year when that licence is up for renewal if things have not been run as they should be run, that licence can be objected to.  That is about the only way.  Nobody would want us to station a member of the Garda Síochána outside the door of the restaurant to monitor it.  Nobody wants that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something about the public houses.  We do not want it in public houses either.  That is why I have swung the balance and put the onus on persons found on the premises to be about their business somewhere else, rather than having the entire responsibility put on the publican to put them out.  That was unfair and it was wrong for me as Minister for Justice to see, as we all saw, many members of the Garda Síochána on duty emptying public houses. at night instead of being on the streets finding criminals.  Everybody would agree with me on that also.  That comes at a later stage in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand fully what Senator McGowan is saying.  If these special licences are given, they are given under very strict conditions.  They will be monitored. They will be observed and, if at the end of the one year period, they are found not to be operated as they should be, that can be objected to in court and the whole thing will come up for very close examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's reply.  He has covered most <Col N="26" /> of the points raised in so far as they can be covered.  He raised an important question of principle which, perhaps, should have been discussed on Second Stage, that is, the whole question of the policing of this legislation.  He said something which would strike a very responsive cord in many people, that is, that basically the job of monitoring this legislation should not be the function of the police at all.  It trivialises the role of the police.  It marginalises them.  It takes up energy which could well be used elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I wonder if at some stage down the line, as a question of national policy, we might think of some form of tourist police &mdash; I do not even like to use the word &ldquo;police&rdquo;.  In Turkey, where I spent some time recently, I was enormously impressed by the very high standards observed by those engaged in tourism where there were real sanctions which could be imposed on these people by the Department of Tourism, not by the civil police.  Again, it is no business of the police and there are sanctions which could be used, obviously not in this part of this Bill, but in some future thinking about the rationalisation of our police force.  Perhaps he would consider creating a category of officials who could be specialist, who could be paid out of the tourist industry, out of revenue generated in the tourist industry.  This is an idea which we might start thinking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with Senator Manning.  We are talking about 1988.  We are talking about a time when crime is rampant, not alone here but throughout the entire world, when there is organised crime to a great degree.  I have just come from a meeting of Ministers for Justice in Munich.  Drug trafficking is on an upward boom in Europe at present because of the fact that cocaine is fetching twice the number of dollars per ounce as in the United States, so we will be flooded with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we content to sit back and have our police force emptying public houses at night, calling two or three times to put them out?  Are we satisfied to have our <Col N="27" /> police force taking up their time checking tax and insurance on cars?  Are we satisfied to have our police force tied down filling out dole forms on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in many parts of the country and issuing dog licences?  Is it not about time we had a radical change in what they are meant to do?  Is it not about time we took the 400 or 500 of them who are sitting behind desks plodding at typewriters and put in young clerical assistants? If we are serious about protecting our people from the effects of serious internationally organised crime, it is about time to do what we are doing.</P>
    <P>It is with this in mind that recently I established a Garda Advisory Committee to advise me on how the Garda can best be organised and what their roles and functions should be in an effort to move fast into the nineties, never mind into the year 2000.  If we do not, we will be left so far behind and so many of our people will suffer that by the time we catch up it will be too late.</P>

Young people may abuse the law in relation to intoxicating liquor and find themselves behind the wheel of a car <Col N="28" /> which turns into a lethal weapon.  If there is no police presence on the ground they will feel they have full freedom to indulge in these excesses.  As the Minister is well aware, irrespective of the difficulties there may have been down through the years in implementing the intoxicating liquor laws, there has built up over the years a very strong bond, a deep respect and friendship between publicans and the gardaí.  I would not like to see that being in any way interfered with.</P>

      <P>I will probably upset Senator Ferris by saying that I support my amendment and I cannot support his. Mine is purely a technical amendment to improve the drafting of subsection (2) of section 8 of the Bill.  Under this amendment the requirement that Bord Fáilte must inspect at least once a year will be continued, that is, to ensure that that yearly inspection will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment does not upset me at all, technical and all as it might be, because I can see the <Col N="29" /> reason for it.  I hope the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; will not upset the Minister too much either.  Inserting the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; before &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; is, perhaps, a country definition.  I have no doubt that the Minister's inspectorate will be reasonable.  I am anxious to have a certain degree of reasonableness and that it will not be just black and white.  It is a question of defining the words &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;.  It is in that context that I put it down for the Minister's consideration. I would like to hear his response to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ferris.  It is a point that has been made, as the Senator knows well, on different legislation at different times in different places.  I am more than satisfied that the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the opening line of subsection (2) of section 8 would not add anything to the sense of the provision as it stands.  The board must act reasonably in arriving at their decisions.  They have to act reasonably in arriving at their decisions.  I am advised very strongly by our law officers, by the Attorney General's office, that the amendment as suggested by Senator Ferris would introduce an element of uncertainty because it might suggest that if the board were not fully satisfied that the requisite standards were maintained, they might still issue a certificate.  It is purely on legal advice that I am told it is not necessary.  It would not add anything because the board must act reasonably under ordinary law as it is at present.</P>

      <P>In page 6, lines 37 to 41, to delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 37 down to and including &ldquo;force,&rdquo; in line 41.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to remove paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 8, lines 37 to 41.  It excludes everything down as far as &ldquo;force&rdquo; but allows the word &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; to remain. The subsection would read differently.  It is removing subsection (a).  I would like the Minister's response to that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that the decision as to whether the restaurant concerned was of an acceptable standard would be left totally to Bord Fáilte without any reference to regulations made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport under <Col N="31" /> section 12.  Obviously this is not acceptable. It is clearly necessary not merely that minimum standards should be prescribed but that every interested party should be in a position to know what these standards are.  This objective would best be met by regulations.  Under this amendment it would be a matter for the board to decide the standards to be met in every case.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that Bord Fáilte would establish their own minimum standards. It would obviously be in everybody's interests, including in particular the interests of the restaurant owners, that the standards to be complied with should be available in statutory regulations approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied especially in relation to the previous discussion we had and the procedure the Minister will adopt regarding the regulations which will be laid down that this would be the wrong way to go about it.  It is better to do it the other way, to lay down the regulations and then let Bord Fáilte fall into line. I was worried about the bureaucracy. Obviously, I can see the need for a certain element of control by way of legislation and regulations to set a guideline for Bord Fáilte.  That would mean a more uniform distribution of the regulations throughout the country and you would not have particular counties, which are considered to be tourist counties, being treated more favourably than inland counties which are dependent on a different kind of tourist. It is better to have it done properly.</P>

Is it necessary to set up a particular body the Minister thinks would be better equipped because, as Senator Ferris said, there are areas where we have tourism but there are other areas where we need to get something moving?  Are we right in saying that over the past ten <Col N="32" /> years Bord Fáilte have done the job and they are the right people to do it, that a board set up by a Government, irrespective of who the Government are, are the right people to be managing this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (5), lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;and of the reasons therefor&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, of the reasons therefor and his right of appeal to the Ombudsman against such refusal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some of the points have been made by Senator Cregan already.  Basically, the problem is that, as we look at the regulations there, we can see the criteria which would enable a restaurant to get a licence.  They are fairly broad but they are open to interpretation.  There is the possibility of a difference of opinion and people who may very well be seen by some people as competent managers of staff may seem like &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo; to other people and there may be variations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the basic point.  The basic point is a sense of fairness and the suitability of Bord Fáilte to carry out this operation.  Bord Fáilte's principal and only role is to promote and develop tourism. The board have been saddled with other jobs over the years which basically <Col N="33" /> should have been done by somebody else. For example, why should Bord Fáilte be saddled with the job of grading hotels?  In France, for example, one of the countries with the best developed sense of tourism, the State or a State agency does not have the job of grading hotels.  These are graded by the Michelin Guide, Egon Ronay, by various other people and, to a certain extent, the grading is often carried out by the willingness of customers to pay the prices in particular hotels.</P>
    <P>We have entrusted that task to Bord Fáilte.  I know that, in the question of grading of hotels, there is frequently a major difference of opinion as to whether or not a particular hotel is entitled to the grading it has got.  People can go to a Grade A hotel on a bad day and feel that there is no justification for another hotel, for reasons which can be a bit mechanical almost, has been rated downwards and yet the service can often be better than a Grade A hotel.  The point I am making is that Bord Fáilte should not be saddled with this job.  I am not certain that Bord Fáilte, who have gone through a great period of demoralisation &mdash; they are getting their act back together again in the last while &mdash; should be asked to do something for which they do not have any particular competence and which is not part of their main brief.  The end result may very well be that there will be dissatisfaction about the granting of licences, that the standard may not be seen to be uniform across the country. There will be people who will have a genuine sense of grievance and it is the absence of any openness or court of appeal I am worried about.</P>
    <P>I know this was discussed at great length in the other House and I know there is no easy answer to it.  Some people would favour the District Court.  In our amendment I put down the possibility of these cases being referred to the Ombudsman.  I have to say at the outset that I am not happy that that is the answer either.  After the recent controversy about the Ombudsman I see it as one possibility where somebody who feels he or she has a genuine grievance could take the case to have an impartial adjudication <Col N="34" /> on it.  This may very well mean that the Ombudsman might need extra staff.  He might need extra teeth that he has not got already although I suppose the Ombudsman would be able to get outside independent advice on these matters.</P>
    <P>I will not push this amendment very far because I am not sure that the Ombudsman is the answer.  The legislation is weakened by the absence of any sort of appeal mechanism against the decisions of Bord Fáilte.  I am heartened to a certain extent that the Minister has said that he will review this legislation at an early stage to see if there is satisfaction, to see if there is a sense of grievance around the country, that people feel they have been hard done by or that certain areas are more favoured than others.  We are used to dealing with officials and bureaucrats and they may well develop a sense where the officials concerned may, in an effort to protect themselves, adopt standards which are unnecessarily high or, indeed, they could even go the other way and lower the standards so that they will not incur the ire of those who are turned down.</P>
    <P>This is really the problem.  It was raised in the other House and it was not resolved there.  The amendment in my name goes part of the way to addressing the problem. It is not, I believe, the ideal answer but I would like a little further thought on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are a fairly competent body to make a decision on whether a restaurant should qualify for a liquor licence.  I am sure that certain criteria will be laid down by Bord Fáilte, possibly in conjunction with the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  Bord Fáilte have vast experience of grading hotels and restaurants and they are a very competent body.  I heard Senator Manning say that a district justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene very briefly at this stage to clarify something? It is not Bord Fáilte.  It is all those people here who tell Bord Fáilte what we want by way of standards in restaurants.  It is not being left to Bord Fáilte.  They are an excellent, competent body.  There is no doubt about that in anybody's mind.  Like any State organisation they have had their good times and their bad times.  I believe they are going through a good time now.  I believe there is motivation there that we have not seen in Bord Fáilte for a long time and I hope it zooms in all our interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each and every one of us will lay down the standards when they are brought in here by the Minister for Tourism and Transport in a very short time.  They are the standards Bord Fáilte will be told to implement and they have got the professional expertise to see to it that they are implemented.  I fully appreciate the points made by Senator Manning in his amendments Nos, 5, 6 and 11 when he asks: if there is a refusal what happens? I do not think Senator Manning would want me to go into all the reasons why Bord Fáilte have the certain degree of professionalism they have, bearing in mind their duties in the grading of restaurants, in grant-aiding restaurants and hotels to upgrade their cooking facilities, their kitchens, their diningrooms and so on.  They are very much involved in that <Col N="36" /> on a daily basis.  That is part and parcel of their function as and from day one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  I would be concerned in view of the slimming down of the Bord Fáilte operation and the loss of staff in recent times that they should have the manpower available to process the large numbers of requests coming in.  That is probably a matter that can be addressed when it happens, but I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that somebody somewhere along the line said the other day there were a few civil servants available here and there who had not been slotted into jobs.  Maybe we might find someone there.  I would take a few myself if I could get them.  I did not realise that my own personal office staff complement was down compared to that of my predecessors.  I must do something about that one of these days.</P>
      <P>We lay down the regulations, Bord Fáilte give a certificate and then the court gives the licence.  The thrust of Senator Manning's amendment is that there should be a court of appeal in the event of that licence not being granted.  We had a long discussion on this matter and there were a number of amendments in the other House from all parties.  In the end we came to a solution which is as near perfect as one can get.  Section 8 (5), which was added to the original Bill states:</P>
      <P>If, in any case, the Board refuses to grant a Bord Fáilte Certificate it shall as soon as may be, by notice in writing, inform the person who applied for the Certificate of the refusal and of the reasons therefor.</P>
      <P>He has an opportunity to put his house in order.  If he is told, for instance, that his kitchen lacks (a), (b) or (c), his toilet facilities are not up to standard, his waiting area is too big, his dining area is not as it should be, his cloakrooms are not as they might be, he can put his house in order and he will stand a chance.</P>

I, too, resent deeply officialdom and bureaucrats coming to any part of the country and wham, bam, slam you are in, you are out, good luck to you, you can pack your bag and go away just because he is in a hurry to go off and catch up on a golf game in some other part of the country.  I detest that as much as anybody.  He now has to explain to the intending applicant who is prepared to pay a fee of £3,000 why he may not qualify and what he has to do to qualify.</P>
      <P>We went a little further than that to meet genuine cases made.  I refer to section 13 (1) which states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the Board that a restaurant in respect of which a Bord Fáilte Certificate is in force no longer complies with the standards specified in section 8 or, as the case may be, under section 12, the Board shall give or send by post to the holder thereof a notice&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  stating that it appears to the Board as aforesaid,</P>
      <P>(b)  requiring the holder to take specified steps within a specified period in order to bring the restaurant into compliance with the standards aforesaid, and</P>
      <P>(c)  informing the holder that, if the requirements in the notice are not complied with, the Board will cancel the Certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that if somebody holding a licence gets a little slipshod, a little lazy, he will be told to put his house in order if he wants to keep his licence.  That gives him every chance to meet what is required.  After all, this is his way of life.  I deliberately mentioned these two amendments which I accepted from the other side of the House &mdash; I think it was from Deputy Barrett &mdash; because they are <Col N="38" /> good and necessary.  Above all, I feel that the ordinary citizen is entitled to know and must be told when he does not meet what is required and must not be left guessing by some little fellow with a rolled umbrella and a briefcase who is in too much of a hurry to bid him anything other than the time of day because he has to get back to Baggot Street Bridge to do whatever is required of him next.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the Minister has answered all the questions. I was just a little concerned about any suggestion that perhaps Bord Fáilte were not the competent body.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Manning said.  A lot of the hotel and restaurant guides that are used throughout Europe, with the honourable exception of the Michelin Guide, are commercially operated and in many cases the establishments listed in those guides pay for the privilege or in some way make a monetary reward to the publications concerned. I say the Michelin Guide is an honourable exception.  In this country Bord Fáilte could never be accused of being involved in any sort of monetary association with the establishments concerned. Perhaps it is outside the Minister's brief but, as the whole thrust of this section of the Bill is related to tourism and restaurant certificates, are there any plans at all within his Department to bring under the umbrella of legislation or regulation the several hundred unlicensed bed and breakfast establishments? Senator Cregan talked about the difficulties publicans may have in coming up against unfair trading competition from licensed restaurants.  It is a valid point that every area is now under regulation but this one area is not, which means that anybody can put a sign outside his door, set up in bed and breakfast and there is a considerable loss to the Exchequer as a result.</P>

I do not wish to knock the Senator who conscientiously put down the amendment, but it would be better to rub out an application which had failed and have another run at it.  The same would apply as in the case of a planning application.  I see that as the best procedure.</P>

If the system is seen to break down because there are not enough personnel, no matter what assurances we get from the Minister today the person who is waiting in Donegal or Kerry for the go ahead may well find himself getting letters back and TDs and Senators will start getting involved, trying to put pressure on to see that this person gets a fair hearing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the application for a special certificate, a case has been put to me very strongly by the licensed vintners regarding a person running a highly recommended Bord Fáilte-approved guesthouse.  He might have, for instance, ten, 12, 18 or 20 rooms and would have to have excellent restaurant and kitchen facilities to be recommended by Bord Fáilte for bed and breakfast. What is the position if that person wishes to apply for a special licence to serve evening meals?  In order to do so it would be necessary to comply with the standards laid down by Bord Fáilte.  I know the Minister will say I am taking a different line and that the Bill deals with particular restaurants which cannot serve a drink at this time.  When the law is implemented such a person who puts in the facilities needed for a proper restaurant in his guesthouse will have the legal right to ask for the same licence as <Col N="41" /> is relevant to a restaurant on the outskirts of the city or in any town?  I see no reason why an argument cannot be made by such people.  In Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Bray or Dún Laoghaire, a person living up the road from any public house or any certified licensed restaurant could claim that by paying £3,000 he is legally entitled to the same facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to Part II of the Bill, section 6, line 25:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Restaurant&rdquo; means any premises which are structurally adapted and used for the purpose of supplying substantial meals to the public for consumption on the premises at midday or in the evening, and in which any other business carried on is ancillary and subsidiary to the provision of such meals.</P>
      <P>Basically that means these special licences are applicable to bona fide restaurants only, where the main business is supplying meals to the public.  Anything else is ancillary or subsidary to that.  Ordinary bed and breakfast establishments will certainly not qualify, but if it can be shown, bearing in mind the regulations which this House will be asked to approve reasonably shortly, that their main business is supplying food to the public and that they meet the other requirements, they may, in the ordinary sense, make an application to Bord Fáilte for a certificate. They would be entitled to do that, but there is no question whatsoever of anybody with a B and B sign getting a licence to sell booze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory the Minister is right and I am not denying that, I have been in bed and breakfasts in the Killarney area which resemble a mini-hotel, places where there are excellent restaurant facilities and excellent kitchen facilities.  I am involved in kitchen equipment and food and I know what I am talking about.  Legally, people have the right facilities.  If the Minister is saying it must be a bona fide restaurant which only provides food, how can we make that argument to a person who is already providing drink and is now providing food <Col N="42" /> facilities?  In the vast majority of cases in Kinsale the pubs have changed over to restaurants, but they still serve drink.  We cannot object to them.  We cannot tell them they are not supposed to be serving drink because they are serving food.  That contradicts the whole argument.</P>
      <P>A person may have a facility of 200 or 300 square feet which is excellent for morning breakfasts.  There is no reason at all why he cannot say to his guests that he is now providing an evening meal, an open restaurant for anybody to come in and sit down, even though he is giving room facilities as well.  Is it not the case that a person can pay £3,000 for this licence and have a pub in between two genuine public houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way Senator Cregan is going to convert a bed and breakfast establishment into a public house.  We will not allow him to do that. Breakfast is of no relevance whatsoever in terms of the requirement to provide substantial meals.  It does not come into it at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It has to be a public restaurant.  I appreciate Senator Cregan's point that there are some very fine bed and breakfast guesthouses around Killarney. They are almost as expensive as hotels.  I presume they are all paying their taxes.  These guesthouses do not give a public service in providing substantial meals.  The point the Senator is making will give food for thought when the regulations to be approved come here in a couple of weeks.  These regulations will have to be approved before they go to Bord Fáilte, outlining the conditions which will have to be met.  In my opinion the answer is that they will not qualify because they do not provide a public service in providing substantial meals generally. They provide a bed and breakfast service.  In some instances evening meals are provided but in a very limited form. Bearing in mind the regulations which <Col N="43" /> are there, if through their own enterprise they can expand their business and then build up from there, they can take the opportunity to see if they qualify for a special restaurant licence for the purpose of selling drink with meals to the public at large, other than those who come and stay for the purpose of sleeping overnight.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte-recommended bed and breakfast houses would have an advantage.  People who are already approved by Bord Fáilte could have an advantage over others who would wish to take that line.  If they have the required facilities and apply for a licence, they cannot be disallowed.  We must ensure that every second guesthouse that is Bord Fáilte-approved for bed and breakfast will not take advantage of this. The Minister for Tourism and Transport should be informed before the regulations are brought before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no argument between Senator Cregan and me in this matter.  The Bord Fáilte inspectorate responsible for inspecting bed and breakfasts guesthouses should not be the same people who will be inspecting restaurants. Dealing with high quality restaurants which apply for special licences to sell drink with high quality meals is a different matter.  We must be on our guard against the kind of practice Senator Cregan describes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) In the event of a refusal by the Board, of any application for a Bord Fáilte Certificate to grant the said Certificate, an appeal against that decision by the Board shall lie at the suit of the applicant to the District Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I in our discussion on the previous section both agreed on a person's civil rights in the event of his application being rejected.  This amendment is to provide for the right of an applicant, in the event of a refusal by the board of an application for a Bord Fáilte certificate to appeal to the District Court.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, a precedent for this in existing legislation.  I mentioned the Abbatoirs Act, which was the most recent legislation in which the Government insisted on having a court procedure for an appeal.  I believe there should have been some other means of appeal.  If a butcher was refused a licence to have part of his premises as an abbatoir and had to go to court to appeal, it could ruin his business.  The same could apply here. Therefore, I am anxous to ensure that a person's legal rights are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a precedent set in the Betting Act, 1931, under the Minister's own jurisdiction, where one can appeal to the District Court against the decision of a superintendent of the Garda Síochána to refuse an applicant a certificate of personal fitness or a certificate of suitability of premises.  It is quite usual in legislation to have such a clause written in.  It allows applicants some rights in law to have an over-riding view if they are of the opinion that they have complied with all the regulations.  In some cases there may be an agreement between the applicant and Bord Fáilte that, if certain improvements are carried out, they will qualify.  If an applicant genuinely believes that he has complied in every way with <Col N="45" /> the regulations and still fails to get a licence, I want to ensure that there is a procedure available to which he can resort.  I mentioned the District Court so that the application would not have to go to a higher and more expensive court. For that reason, in this amendment and in the other, I mention specifically the District Court and I want to enshrine in legislation that right which is already enshrined in previous legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same area we discussed on other amendments. While it might appear useful to have the right of appeal to the courts, it would involve court proceedings, legal structures, and witnesses from Bord Fáilte giving explanations as to why they had to decline to grant or cancel a licence.  I would see it as heading for a jungle.  We are trying to co-operate with the Minister and the Department in streamlining this Bill and I would not see this as a helpful amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that these amendments do not appear to relate to an appeal on legal grounds to the court but rather seem to envisage that there should be an appeal to the court in relation to a finding by Bord Fáilte as to whether or not the restaurant in question complied with the requisite standards.  Provisions of this kind would probably have the effect that there would be an appeal in every case, as Senator McGowan said, against a refusal by the board to grant a certificate or its decision to cancel a certificate when already granted.  This would mean the court would have to become an inspecting body in such cases so as to decide whether the restaurant in question was well equipped, providing a high standard of catering, etc. and, in effect, would mean that the court would supersede the functions of Bord Fáilte.  This would not be an appropriate function for the court and would clearly be a matter that should be left for a decision by Bord Fáilte on the basis of the professional expertise available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 8, where Bord Fáilte refuse to grant a certificate, they must <Col N="46" /> inform the applicant of the reasons for such refusal.  We had a discussion earlier on this with Senator Ferris and I think the point was taken.  I should point out also that under section 13 the holder of a certificate for a restaurant which no longer complies with the standards required in the regulations gets a second change to bring his premises into compliance with the regulations.  Thus, where it appears to Bord Fáilte that a restaurant's standards have fallen to a point where it no longer complies with the regulations, the inspector must notify the holder of the certificate as to what steps must be taken within a specified period to bring his premises into compliance with the regulations.  It is only when those steps have not been taken in the specified time that the certificate is cancelled.</P>
    <P>I should add that the applicant for as well as a holder of a special restaurant licence can continue to avail of any recourse to the court which is available under the existing law in relation to the activities or decisions of the board. Senator Ferris has already acknowledged this and I thank him for it.  It is important that there is recourse to the courts where a decision is not arrived at properly, or an improper decision is arrived at through negligence or whatever.  There is then the right of appeal to the court and that is as it should be.  That is something we all cherish.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the safeguards in the provisions which were suggested to me from the other side of the Dáil, I have more than adequately catered for the genuine concern which Senator Ferris had in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Manning was suggesting another procedure &mdash; he was suggesting the Ombudsman and then realised that that might not be the correct method to follow &mdash; I suggested that this common law right was available, which the Minister immediately acceded to. Therefore, I presumed that the Minister would immediately accept my amendments because, if he reads the arguments made by one of his Cabinet colleagues on other legislation he will see that the very <Col N="47" /> same procedure was used in the granting of abattoir licences.  The Minister insisted on writing in a section which gave the right of appeal to a court when the licence was refused.  I argue that a man's reputation is at stake if he has to go to court to get his rights.  I was looking for something between the official, the bureaucrat the Minister dislikes so much, the man in a hurry, the man that comes down on us for all sorts of reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister was very vocal today in his analysis of some of their functions and roles.

Is the Minister confirming that they have?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is concerned that we should write it in so that everybody can use it.  They would want to be out of their cotton picking minds to use it if they failed to reach the standards because they would be subjecting themselves to critical public analysis in court. A Bord Fáilte official or any other witness may come in and say: &ldquo;I could not give them a licence because the kitchen was filthy, the food preparation area was unclean, or whatever.&rdquo;  There is no question of my asking an applicant to appeal to a court in areas like that but I want to ensure that there is a right to do it.  A Minister previously insisted that that right should be given in another Act.  I wanted the granting authority, who in that case were the local authority to have an interim procedure.  Eventually the Minister and I reached a compromise period of 21 days within which the applicant had the right of appeal to the licensing authority.  In this instance, I am anxious to write in &mdash; as have been previously written into other legislation &mdash; ordinary rights to appeal against the <Col N="48" /> decision of officials, or bureaucrats, or inspectors from Bord Fáilte or whoever.</P>
      <P>We hope all applications will be dealt with impartially and fairly and that all applicants achieving the standards will get their rights and will get their special licence.  I hope that is how it will operate on the ground.  If the Minister confirms that this right is written into ordinary common law, that is all right.  I am sounding a warning.  I hope all applicants who achieve the standards set down by regulation will get the special licence.  I hope that is the only criterion and that numbers and all the other things will not come into it, for example: &ldquo;we cannot give you a special licence because Mary So-and-So has one down the road&rdquo; and all the other reasons Senator Cregan referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the thrust of what Senator Ferris is trying to say.  We are all trying to protect innocent people from becoming victims of a bureaucratic system.  It is our intention to ensure that that does not happen. The principle of the Bill is that we leave the facts to Bord Fáilte as the professionals. We define through Bord Fáilte what these facts must be, what the conditions and requirements are, and we leave them to deal with the facts.  In the event of negligence on the part of Bord Fáilte, or undue delay, or anything in any way which denies the applicant the licence, he has the full right of recourse to the law to protect himself.</P>

    <P>I wonder what the Minister's response is to that.  I will not press this amendment very much, but I am anxious to have a clear statement on the Minister's view on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ferris for the way he proposed his amendment.  The effect of the amendment would be that it would require a new Act of Parliament to amend the fee for a special restaurant licence.  Clearly there are many considerations influencing the size of this fee, including, for example, the depreciation in money values with the passage of time. Because of this, it would be inappropriate that a procedure like an Act of the Oireachtas should be necessary to amend the fee.  Any such change would be best made by ministerial regulation.  I would point out that under section 24 of the Bill, any such regulations will require a resolution by each House of the Oireachtas approving them in draft before they come into effect.  Senator Ferris will probably agree that I am fairly safeguarding the fee here because we would not want anybody at any stage to come in and shift it from £3,000 to £6,000 or £9,000 or £12,000 overnight.  That would not be good at all.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 has been grouped with amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 9, I should say that any regulation made under section 9 varying the amount of the fee for a special restaurant licence will be made by the Minister for Justice as the Minister with primary responsibility for intoxicating liquor legislation.  However, the Minister for Tourism and Transport also has a particular interest in special restaurant licences since one of the main objectives of these licences is to help meet the demand from tourists for the supply of a full range of drinks with substantial meals in good quality restaurants. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Minister for Tourism and Transport <Col N="50" /> should be consulted in relation to any variation in the amount of the fee, and amendment No. 9 is proposed accordingly. May I go further and say that in matters like this.  Senators can rest assured that the Government have a big say in what the fee is?</P>

I felt it was appropriate to put it down for discussion.  This Government have been using every method to ensure that they can get funding from various sources.  I have been trying to index link charges, licences, everything, to try to ensure that the Exchequer would not use every method of funding as another tax procedure.  That is why I want to have it excluded here.  If the Minister excludes it, he will have to come back to the Oireachtas.  I was waiting for the Minister to tell me that, if there was an increase in the fees outlined in this section, after consultation with the Minister for Tourism and Transport, maybe at the request of the Minister for Finance, he would have to bring it back to the House of the Oireachtas anyway without new legislation. This section gives the Minister the power to do that without new legislation.</P>

      <P>It is by regulation and even then it says that the Minister of the day, in consultation with some other Minister for some other different reason &mdash; these things are decided informally by the Government, particularly when regulations have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It depends on the voting strength at any time in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It depends on the amount of influence the Oireachtas might have on <Col N="51" /> the decision of the Government.  Any sector who, for the first time, have to pay something are worried out of their lives in case this will be raised every year for other purposes outside the reason for it here.  That is my only worry.</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks I should just sit down but I am genuinely concerned and all the legislation I have spoken on over the past six months in this area indicates that continuing concern.  I must respect the Minister's right to be able to make changes so long as he brings that right back down to democracy, back here for discussion.  I will be happy enough with that.  I will argue with it.  If the Minister raises this to £4,000 next year, I will tell him next year what he said today, that is, if both of us are still here and the Cathaoirleach hopes that we will be.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris has raised a point about the charges.  Would the Minister not be prepared to consider the idea that charges should be indexed? Senator Ferris gives the impression that prices are jumping above the price that should be charged and that sometimes prices are being increased substantially when they should not be.  I do not disagree with that.  For instance commercial rates are being charged above the consumer indexed rate.  The amendment recognises that a consumer indexed rate should be allowed.  I would have no objection if there was a consumer indexed rate across the board on everything. Perhaps the Minister would consider broadening that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an observation and two questions for the Minister.  I think we are back to the point the Minister made very forcefully and eloquently earlier about the role of the Garda Síochána in this legislation and where there was an objection by them to the renewal of the special licence.  I am concerned about this because I believe we could have a variation acrosss the country in the use of this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In some areas the Garda may feel they are too busy to scrutinise the operation of this legislation in the way in which it may need to be scrutinised if it is to be effective.  In other parts of the country, members of the Garda may feel very strongly about it.  In the past it was common knowledge that in certain parts of the country there was a great variation in the severity and the degree with which the drunken driving laws were applied. The Minister may not have been aware of that and the Department may not agree it happened, but it was common knowledge that in certain parts of the country the zeal of particular officers ensured that there was a much more stringent application than in other areas.  There may have been operational reasons also.  The superintendent in a particular area may feel more strongly than one somewhere else and objections may be more numerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from this section are two questions. Is it open to other groups to object to the renewal of a licence?  Is it open to those, for example, who may be in competition or those who may be discommoded in some way and may have <Col N="53" /> reason to feel that the spirit or the letter of the law is not being observed?  Has a person the right to go to court at that stage to object to the licence, or is it solely the Garda who have this right?  Is there any procedure available to people who feel, for whatever reason, that the bona fide provisions are not being fully carried out?  Is there any mechanism open to these people to make their point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say to Senator Manning that in relation to the enforcement of any law, it is the statutory function of the Garda Commissioner to see that it is done fairly and squarely across the board.  Nevertheless I will bring the Senator's views to his attention because we would have equal views on this.  I remember when I was Minister for Justice in 1977 and 1978 I saw some statistics from Garda divisions on people about to be charged for drunken driving. In some divisions they were very high and in others they were very low and obviously there was something wrong. Another time I asked for information on the operation of illegal slot machines &mdash; not all of them in licensed premises, but in other areas &mdash; and the statistics from some divisions were ridiculously low and other were very high.  There is the human element.  I will bring the Senator's views to the attention of the Garda Commissioner because a guiding principle which I had in trying to bring this package of licensing liquor changes together was to try to have uniformity as far as possible. If you have uniformity in legislation, you make it a little easier for those who are trying to enforce it.  If we have certain provisions to allow for special occasions at seaside resorts it is practically impossible to enforce them and, after a while, the law is held in total disrepute.  The liquor law, as it stands now, is not held in the high repute we would like it to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to those who may object, I understand that any inhabitant of any parish or health authority within whose functional area the restaurant is situated may object.  That is there as a result of an amendment by Deputy Seán Barrett <Col N="54" /> being accepted in the other House.  That covers that one.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 11 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;The Minister for Tourism may make regulations prescribing the inspection and certification of restaurants for the purpose of the granting or the renewal by the Board of a Bord Fáilte Certificate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this would be to remove the existing section 12 of the Bill.  One of the reasons we are concerned about the section as it is written is that it is very specific in the areas in which the Minister for Tourism and Transport can lay down regulations for Bord Fáilte.  We want it to be within the jurisdiction of the Minister to make the regulations prescribing the inspection and certification of restaurants for the purposes of the granting or the renewal by the board of the certificate. If any other area which concerned the Minister or Bord Fáilte after the enactment of this Bill was not included in the list of requirements in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), the Minister would have to bring in new legislation whereas accepting the wording we have suggested would allow for the inclusion of other such areas that may not necessarily be specified here.  That is why we were anxious for a debate on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we recommend that paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) be accepted and that we do not accept &ldquo;any other area&rdquo;.  Can this be implemented? Could we say the maximum waiting area in such restaurants is 20 per cent; standards to be complied with in such restaurants in relation to the maximum <Col N="55" /> accommodation in such restaurants are such an amount; and 20 per cent is a waiting area?  Is it possible that we could insert something like that to cover the point Senator Ferris has made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment by Senator Ferris would necessitate the deletion of the existing section 12 and, as it stands, section 12 is clearly a necessary provision because it enables standards to be prescribed for restaurants which will qualify for the new special licence.  That has to be there.  The wording of the amendment is very general and it is not clear whether it would entail the making of any such regulations.</P>
      <P>Section 12, as it stands, provides that the consent of the Minister for Justice will be required for regulations fixing standards for the premises in question. This is clearly necessary since all these provisions relating to special restaurant licences are made within the scope of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill for which the Minister for Justice of the day has responsibility to the Oireachtas.  I do not see the need for the amendment.  We need regulations and they are there.  We expressed the opinion earlier on in the course of the debate that the Minister for Justice would have to be consulted and give his approval to these regulations and that these regulations would come before the Seanad for approval before they would be implemented.</P>

      <P>There is great concern in the trade about people being found on licensed premises even though they are not being served any drink.  Would the Minister have another look at this area and operate on the basis of pubs in the UK where, when it comes to closing time, they put a towel over the taps.  They serve no more drink but people are allowed to sit in comfort and peace and the staff are not out rapping on tables and one thing and another.  Of course I would have no sympathy for anybody found serving drink after the time, and I do not think anybody else would.  It seems that half an hour is an improvement on ten minutes but it is still very hard to clear out a large house in 30 minutes.</P>

I ask the Minister to pursue that if it all possible and he would certainly have the full support of the licensed trade.  Certainly, we in the licensed trade do not want to supply drink to under-age people and it would be a easier if they were educated at a younger age in the schools.  I welcome the Bill.

I know that because I serve them.  He thinks he cannot get enough because closing time is coming.  What is the answer to this?  Further on in the Bill we deal with it from a pub's point of view.  We want to try to create a contended atmospheres in our restaurants.  We are now saying that, come 12.30 a.m. nothing should be on the table.  I agree with that.  I am not saying that it should be, but this is a fact of life.  We are saying that a person is entitled to stay on the premises and is entitled to have a meal an hour after any pub closes but, come 12.30 a.m. he is supposed to get out.  We will have big trouble.

      <P>In reply to Senator Cregan there has to be a cut-off point.  If the time comes in two, five or ten years time where there is a cut-off point, I will not be offended personally.  I would like to see a stage when a person can go in for a drink at any time of the night and he can drink in moderation.  It seems to me he should have his drink if he wants it.  As it is now, drink is being served up to 12.30 a.m. with at meal.  I am not a great frequenter of restaurants, even here in Dublin, but most people have their meals finished by 12.30 a.m.  Perhaps at weekends it might be somewhat different.  As it is, there must be a cut-off point because, if not, there would be the usual stock-piling and the whole thing would mushroom along the way.  I could make the same argument the Senator is making as to why on a Sunday, say, there is no drinking after 11 o'clock.  I could say: &ldquo;Why have we no drinking after 11 p.m. <Col N="61" /> on a Sunday night?&rdquo;  You could make the same argument anytime.  That cut-off point is there too.  When he spoke on Second Stage Senator Ross felt that we should look forward to the time when we would not have a cut-off point.  The restaurateurs are not anxious for Jatenight drinking.  They did not make representations to me that they should be allowed to sell drink to be consumed on their premises after 12.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>I am going from that point.  I understand the people in this area eat out on Christmas Day in restaurants. Down the country we stay at home.  I will be bringing up the club issues and I will be looking at it from a pub point of view. I shall always remember a time when I had a business, a hot food take-away or fish and chip business and there was a club opposite me.  On Good Friday and on Christmas Day outside that club the number of people who were looking for a drink was unbelieveable.  I am talking about pubs now.  I do not want as a publican to be open on Christmas Day or Good Friday.  Giving these benefits to restaurants on Christmas Day and on Good Friday could create a situation where people who normally would not go to these places on any other day would go on those days to get drink which they could not get in pubs.  Even the clubs are open.  I do not understand why everybody is not getting the same facility.  Why are we now allowing a restaurant to open on Christmas Day &mdash; I do not say it should not &mdash; and on Good Friday?  Where is the logic in saying that restaurants in, say, Kinsale, and probably Cork are open on Good Friday and every pub is closed. The regulations are there for clubs to open on Good Friday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to clarify this matter.  Under the laws we were speaking about earlier as regards particular licences you can apply for, clubs can have facilities to apply for a certain number of licences per year, for opening hours or for extra hours as a club.  In actual fact one of these is that they can apply to serve drink on Good Friday.  They do so. This happens throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>They apply for a licence and then they charge a fee to go into the club.  Drink is served and everybody who wants to can sign his name in the club.  If he does not sign, it is up to the law to ensure that he signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that the area of exemptions and extensions requires immediate and indepth examination with a view to putting it back on the rails.  I will devote my time and effort to do so.  We will be talking later on about the curse and scourge of under-age drinking.  If we are serious about doing something worthwhile here, we better turn our minds to that area.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if disco restaurants, the night clubs in Leeson Street, will have to close at 12.30 a.m. or have they a special licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly to go back <Col N="63" /> to the point raised before Senator Ferris's or Senator Cregan's points on the question of the dead stop at 12.30 a.m. &mdash; like the Minister I do not have all that much concern for people who find themselves in restaurants but I am worried because, right throughout the Minister's speech and right throughout this debate, there has been one big concern on all sides, that the law should not be brought into disrepute.  It was accepted that certain sections of the existing laws were more honoured in the breach than in the observance and that it was necessary to have credible laws that did apply.</P>
      <P>I have a great worry that, if we insist on the 12.30 a.m. close down, the law simply will not be observed.  You will find people going into restaurants at, say, 12.20 a.m. ordering a meal and knowing that they can order, say, a half-bottle of whiskey or three or four pints, they may do that.  The drink is on the table and the law is being broken.  I do not know what the answer is.  I would not like to see raids on restaurants at 12.30 a.m. to see if the tables were clear of drink.  It may well be that there is some way around this, some accommodation that would get us out of that bind.  Perhaps, after consultation on Report Stage, we may have some amendment to propose to the Minister on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has just expressed the problems I have with this section.  We want to make sure that this new legislation which is fairly controversial and has been finely-balanced between the different sectors can be operated.  Senator Manning and I have agreed that there are many subsections in this section that will be inoperable. There is no doubt that they will bring the law into disrepute.  One of them is &ldquo;permitting the consumption on the premises of&rdquo; drink which could have been ordered, bought or even paid for before closing time but would be part of the meal.  It says here, &ldquo;any intoxicating liquor,&rdquo; so I take it that could be a half-bottle of wine which was bought an hour before that.  It might not be sufficiently chilled and could be left and at 12.35 a.m. <Col N="64" /> you could be pouring the last glasses and you are technically in breach of the law.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says that the Garda Síochána will not be standing on duty outside the restaurants, he is putting a tremendous emphasis on the responsibility of restaurateurs to say to people: &ldquo;You must finish your drink before 12.30.&rdquo;  We have to presume these are continental tourists.  Some Irish people might also be involved in Dublin in particular. They all talk about these &ldquo;nice places&rdquo;, even on Christmas Day or Good Friday.  I am concerned that subsection (3) of section 14 will be inoperable.  I have a feeling that it will be inoperable. It is unreasonable to expect people who are serving to insist that something that is part of the meal must be finished, whereas you can finish the rest of the meal at 1 o'clock or 1.15 a.m. when, in fact, wine might be considered to be a necessary part of the meal all the time.</P>
      <P>The other thing is &ldquo;to sell or expose for sale&rdquo;.  This could be bottles on the shelves and may not necessarily be sold but, given the fact that they are up there, how can you say: &ldquo;They are up there but they are not for sale&rdquo;.  Is that exposing them for sale?  There are two paragraphs that I am extremely worried about.  Certainly, on Report Stage, apart from all the other subsections written in here about various days and various times, including Christmas Day and Good Friday, I have worries about paragraphs (a) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 14 (1) (a), &ldquo;sell or expose for sale&rdquo;, we are talking about licensed restaurants and this is the law as it applies at the present time.  You are not allowed to expose alcohol for sale.  You are supposed to serve it at the table.  You are not supposed to have a great display.  You are supposed to bring drink and serve it.  When you bring your menu, you let people select what they want and bring it from the wine cellar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister has not frequented some of these restaurants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Most restaurants display wines in the restaurant.  They are visible. They have them on a rack in the restaurant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is &ldquo;expose for sale&rdquo; during the prohibited hours that matters. If the Senator wants to consider an amendment for Report Stage, we will give him every opportunity.  In fairness, I want to say that restaurateurs do not want it.  They have not asked for it.  They feel there is no need for it.  This is after a whole series of consultations.  Secondly, the amount of business that the bona fide restaurant does after midnight by way of serving meals is not significant.  They have no interest in that sort of thing.  I am talking about the restaurant that qualifies for this special licence.  They are not interested in keeping a full staff on at 12 o'clock at night on the chance that somebody will come in, probably having had more than enough to drink at that hour of the night, to order a substantial meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this point but there is a genuine problem here which could perhaps, be overcome reasonably easily.  I believe that the words &ldquo;expose for sale&rdquo; are redundant.  I believe that the rule will not be observed. Why have it there if it is not going to be observed, especially in restaurants where they have the wine on a shelf?  It is visible. It is exposed for sale.  Almost all restaurants that serve spirits will have the bottle exposed with the measure beneath it.  Again, if people are ordering &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; they want to see that they are getting &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; and not some inferior brand.  So, I think that that clause could be excised on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister might think again about some nominal drinking up period here.  We will be putting forward an amendment to this effect.  It could be ten minutes or 15 minutes but something which would allow people to order drinks <Col N="66" /> up to 12.30 a.m. and then to have to gulp them down.  Clearly, if people are allowed order up to 12.30 a.m. they will order up to 12.30 a.m. and it is unreasonable to expect them to have everything gulped down within one minute of getting it.  Some sort of drinking up time, maybe 15 minutes or so, is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You stop them selling drink at 12 o'clock and give them half an hour drinking up time?  That is one way of doing it.  I think that 12.30 in the morning is more than time enough and we have to draw the shutters down sometime, somewhere.  I have spoken to restaurateurs who are running very high quality restaurants in this city and they have no interest in anybody coming in at 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m.  It is no good if they come at that hour and it is only costing the owners money.  They do legitimate business and if there is to be no drink on the table at 12.30 a.m. it causes them no problems.  The arguments that are being made by Senators Manning and Ferris are equally applicable to whatever time of the night you stop serving drink because you will have the person coming in on the night of a bull show, the night of a horse show, the night of a spring show.  He will come in from somewhere to a restaurant and be &ldquo;elephants,&rdquo; in his cups, and he will want a substantial meal because he will want more booze.  You will have to draw the line somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a fair point and I can see that the restaurateurs would agree with what he is saying about 12.30 a.m. but to give half an hour drinking up time the same as in the pubs could be another way of handling it.  It would be unfair because we have people coming in for three months of the year whom we need in the country very urgently, certainly from a business point of view.  The restaurateurs have made the point that after 11.30 p.m. they do not want to see anybody coming in. The reason is that we see too many people with too much drink looking for a substantial meal.  If you are able to say to <Col N="67" /> them that you are not giving them any more drink after 12.30 a.m., after a short period of time these people would not be visiting these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Talking from my own experience &mdash; and I have visited restaurants in many parts of the country over the years &mdash; the tourists, the people we are catering for, will not be in any restaurant after 10.30 p.m.  They are first in; they are waiting for the restaurants to open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not tourists. Everybody here knows this to be true in regard to the legitimate tourists, whether they are Europeans or Americans and more particularly the Americans.  I visited the Great Southern in Killarney last Saturday week to attend a business function.  There were several Americans there and when the 10 o'clock meal was over these people were interested in going to bed because they were golfing in Ballybunion the following morning at 7.30 a.m.  Let us be realistic about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to join in the Minister's comments on all of this.  The only experience we have at the moment in regard to the drinking up time is in relation to public houses.  The only experience we have where you have no drinking up time is where there is an extension and that law is working but it is being abused and flouted.  I welcome the Minister's train of thought.  Perhaps he might be considering having a drinking up period by reducing the hours of the restaurant back from 12.30 a.m.  I would not necessarily agree with what Senator Cregan was saying.  I agree that most of the tourists we are aiming this provision at would be out of restaurants by 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m.  Even as things stand in this country at the moment, you cannot get a meal in most restaurants after 9.30 p.m. or 10 o'clock.  Therefore, I assume that, when these new restaurants are up and <Col N="68" /> running, the tourist will be out of them early enough.  I would ask, perhaps, in the context of not having the law abused, that we make sure that there is no outlet for the law to be abused.  The Minister might consider having a drinking up period in restaurants, if necessary, putting it back to 12 o'clock or 12.15 a.m.  I support the Minister's thinking on those lines.</P>

We will be doing this from what we consider is the experience on the ground.  I am not a bit worried about Americans who come in buses and are shepherded around the country and must be here, there and everywhere.  These package people are not the kind of people these special restaurateurs will be catering for.  We are talking about continental tourists in particular who are used to this kind of facility.  We are not providing any right for people from Europe that they do not already enjoy.  We want to emphasise that, if there is a law that prohibits the sale of drink with a meal in a special restaurant at 12.30 a.m. and it is part of the meal, it would be unacceptable and physically impossible to have the drink consumed within minutes of being seved as part of the meal.  That is all we are saying.  We feel there should be some little leeway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he could confidently say that <Col N="69" /> the regulations will be so drafted that they will prevent those who want to drink, whether they are in a hotel, a bar or a restaurant and the drinking time is finished, from easily going into a club or being guided into a club.  A club has a very wide connotation and this will be pretty difficult.  Life will be very difficult for all of us if regulations are not specific and clear in this area and clubs are brought in under some provision of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan has put his finger on the key to the whole thing.  If we had uniformity in our drinking laws right across the board there would be no problems.  Where we have one section penalised for not closing at one time, another for some reason being given a half an hour extra, and another being given an extra half hour, whether it is drinking up or drinking down time, and somebody getting an exemption on Good Friday, are we not eventually getting ourselves into a chaotic situation?</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people involved in the trade at different levels.  They, too, are mainly family people who would like to be able to say that after 10 o'clock, 12 o'clock, or whatever time it is, there will be no drink for anybody, across the board.  They can close the door at 12 o'clock.  The customers cannot get drink anywhere else and therefore they do not lose trade.  The competition for trade is so keen now that, if one breaks the law, the other breaks it, and so on.  I have heard Deputies and Senators say that the gardaí were very severe.  We should try to keep a clear time for closing right across the board.  That is why we have taken some decisions to tighten up in the clubs.  Perhaps there is room for more tightening up.  It would not be in order to go into the details of it right now, but we should try to keep uniformity in mind as best we can.  If we keep that in mind we will be doing a great day's work.</P>

Before the Senator arrived I said that I would be having a very serious look at exemptions, extensions, clubs etc.  Members are aware that we have had something like 46,000 special exemptions for late night disco-ing in 12 months alone for week-ending. It is primarily youngsters who are going there.  From my own limited personal knowledge of what goes on, I think 99 per cent of them should be closed down.</P>

I am glad to hear that he is not including live bands in it.  I represent those people who earn their living by the sweat of their brow entertaining people on the stage. As a former musician I represent them here and I strongly oppose any inclusion of a dance licence with these very special restaurant licences.  They are a very good idea.

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (f), line 3, after &ldquo;products&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, farm forestry, agri-tourism&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What Senator Ferris has in mind here is the broadening of section 1(a).  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> In this Act &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; includes horticulture, dairying, the breeding and keeping of horses, cattle, pigs and other livestock, the rearing and keeping of poultry and bee-keeping.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to include the words &ldquo;farm forestry, agri-tourism&rdquo;. One can see the reason for this amendment. Basically it is a broadening of the scope or the meaning of this section.  It is an amendment very much with an eye to the future.  We all know there are major changes taking place in agriculture.  We know that major changes will have to take place henceforth.  We will have to move away from lines of traditional enterprise in agriculture, i.e., beef, milk, production, etc. because of the surplus situation on the market.  The approach here is that we should broaden the meaning &mdash; it is important that we get the meaning correct from the beginning &mdash; to take account of farm forestry which will be a new area of enterprise in agriculture. We have so much land which is inappropriately used.  It is used for stock raising, for dairying, and there are cases where it is used for cereal, when its only appropriate use is forestry.</P>
    <P>There is also the area of agri-tourism which holds great potential.  It has no place at all within the scope of agricultural policy, as enunciated or as carried forward presently by our Minister or by our Department of Agriculture and Food.  We ask the Minister, while waiting for Senator Ferris and his colleagues, Senators Brian O'Shea and John Harte, if he would like to comment.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely that we are in a period of constant change.  I described it the last time as revolutionary change.  It is for that reason that the broad definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in the Bill is very extensive.  I do not mind having to answer for what is not in the Bill but I find it difficult on occasion to answer for what is in the Bill, on the suggestion that it is not in the Bill.  All of the things that are being suggested that I should include <Col N="74" /> are already in the Bill.  So, if we are to have a debate on the basis of what is not there, let us recognise it.</P>
      <P>Let me point out where it is.  We are talking about all aspects of rural development from the definition stage.  At some point you have to say that is the end of the definition.  It includes, as Senators see, in section 1 a whole range of definitions, but particularly section 1 (f): &ldquo;farm management, agricultural economics, rural development...&rdquo;.  That is a major element in the whole role of this new Teagasc authority.</P>
      <P>Coming to the point about farm forestry, it is in the Bill already.  Am I to go back to the draftsman every second day and tell him to put it in again and again? It is there in section 4 (8) and it is there in the terminology which is appropriate to this type of development:</P>
      <P>The reference in subsection 1 (a) to advisory services in agriculture shall be construed as including a reference to advisory services in relation to the growing of trees as part of a farming enterprise and the establishment of shelter belts of trees.</P>
      <P>That is part of a farming enterprise.  That is my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not here at my behest but I see the need for it.  We are talking about the introductory stages of the Bill.  We are making the point that we should get it off on the right foot from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and that the broadest possible scope should be included in its descriptions at the beginning. For that reason we appeal to the Minister to make this simple technical adjustment which is just to add an extra line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were not already there I would certainly be amenable to accepting it.  I do not have to be persuaded on the substance of the amendment. The substance is already there.  I was convinced of that when I introduced this legislation and, because it is there and is covered in the actual terminology and definition of the Bill.  I could only agree with the spirit and the purpose of <Col N="75" /> what Senator Ferris proposes.  I am simply saying that it is covered already specifically in section 4 (8).  I will repeat it for the benefit of Senator Ferris who has just come in:</P>
      <P>The reference in subsection 1 (a) to advisory services in agriculture shall be construed as including a reference to advisory services in relation to the growing of trees as part of a farming enterprise and the establishment of shelter belts of trees.</P>
      <P>Farm forestry, as a term, as far as I have been able to ascertain, does not have any precise legal definition.  Agri-tourism does not have any precise legal definition either.  We know what we mean these things to be, but they do not have any precise meaning in legal terms.  That is why what Senator Ferris proposes is already inscribed in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise to the House.  I had to leave the House and go down for a brief break.  I was here for four hours on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and I did not have any lunch.  I do not want to be discourteous to the Minister but that is the way the timing of the House went today.  All the changes were without prior warning to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wanted to include this because section 1 specifies a whole lot of areas which the Minister says are legally included in recognised agricultural enterprises such as horticulture, the breeding of horses and other livestock.  We were anxious to ensure that the area of farm forestry and agri-tourism is included also. While in the past they may not have been defined as agriculturally orientated, the Minister, his Department, the Minister of State and his colleagues from his own constituency have an interest naturally in the development of these two sub-areas. Whereas the Minister says that another section includes these areas, I believe <Col N="76" /> they should be specifically included in a subsection of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In future &mdash; if there is to be a future in agriculture &mdash; people will have to be able to diversify into other areas and should be encouraged by the Minister's Department and the European Community to do so.  Farm forestry is certainly one area and agri-tourism is another.  The people in the industry who will be involved in advice and research in these areas are of the same opinion.  If the Minister is absolutely sure that another subsection includes these that is fair enough, but the parliamentary draftsman should have taken that into account and recognised the changing trend in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which Senator Ferris has presented the case.  His case is well made. It is an important element and will be an important element of rural development. We are not just talking in terms of agriculture in the conventional sense of the word, in the literal sense of the word agriculture.  For that reason we are in a period of rapid change.  Land usage is what we are really involved with here and it is for that reason that I accept the strength of the case made by Senator Ferris.  I want to assure him that it is already covered in section 4 (a) which specifically says that the reference in subsection (1) to advisory services in agriculture shall be construed as including a reference to advisory services in relation to the growing of trees.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 13, to delete &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ACOTT&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the title of the new body. Practically every speaker who spoke in <Col N="77" /> both Houses on Second Stage of this Bill expressed unhappiness about the title of the Bill and that is the feeling of people outside of this House who will be operating the new organisation and the people it will affect, the farmers.  Everybody believes that the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; is awkward. It has been described to me as incongruous, as being totally inappropriate and as being unattractive.  The word &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; is the best one because somehow it does not lend itself to being marketable.  This new organisation, like all new organisations, has to find its own feet.  ACOT are well established and have been in place for almost ten years.  They have been well established in farmers' minds for the past ten years as an organisation, more so perhaps than AFT, the ordinary farmer was in contact with.</P>
    <P>Our party are proposing that instead of calling the body Teagasc, we go back to the old name of ACOT and, instead of spelling it &ldquo;ACOT&rdquo;, that we now spell it &ldquo;ACOTT&rdquo;.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, the one which we are replacing, were the council for advice on agriculture.  We are merely seeking to add &ldquo;Taighde&rdquo; at the end, which means research.  It would then be called An Chomhairle Oiliúna agus Taighde Talmhaíochta.  We think that the argument for this is eminently reasonable. The Minister will remember that ten years ago the first title for ACOT was ANCOT which was changed later to ACOT.  Presumably it was changed to make it more attractive and to make it a word that was more easily identified by the people who would be directly affected by the new organisation.  As I have said, people find something totally foreign and totally inappropriate about Teagasc.  We are asking the Minister not to get this organisation off on the wrong foot.  All organisations starting up have their problems so we plead with the Minister not to let the first problem of this organisation be the name.</P>
    <P>There are perhaps 120,000 farmers in the country at present and about 25,000 of those are being directly dealt with for advice by ACOT.  That means that there <Col N="78" /> are approximately 85,000 farmers who are not affected at all or who have no contact with ACOT or with the research services.  We are making the argument that this new body must reach out to that vast body of farmers, many of them below the commercial line, but who have the possibility of becoming viable if they were in receipt of proper advice and if they had at their disposal the findings of new research and so on.</P>
    <P>The new body must be aggressive in selling themselves and in getting across to a broader body of farmers because, as we said on Second Stage, of the huge importance of agriculture to this country and because such a large sector of agriculture is not making its contribution towards the national income or the national wealth.  One of the instruments we must use to ensure that agriculture plays a more meaningful economic role in the total economy of this country is the advice of the advisory service which must reach out to these people.  There should not be bars by name or by fees precluding the organisation from reaching out and the people who receive the advice and apply the research should not have any antipathy towards that organisation, particularly if that antipathy sprang from their name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The success or failure of the new body will not be very dependent on the name but, as Senator Connor stated, it would be best to start on a footing on which everybody could agree.  He mentioned that most of the speakers last week, in their Second Stage contributions, expressed their disquiet over this new title of the body, certainly at county committee of agriculture level and I would also imagine at the level of the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture.  Most rural representatives are unhappy with the name of this body.  It is a very cumbersome title and, as I remarked last week, if a competition had been set up among school children to find the best name for the new body, they would have come up with something far better than Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> Senator Connor stated quite rightly that this new institution must be prepared to reach out to the farming community. The farming community's success depends on that and there should be no barriers between the farming community and the body.  I am sure that, as such, the title will not turn people away from the organisation but I would still feel that a return to a title more akin to something like the former ACOT and this new ACOT with the extra &ldquo;T&rdquo; which we are proposing would be the best option.</P>
    <P>This was discussed in the other House and the Minister was not very forthcoming there in relation to a name change.  That means we have a battle be fore us here to try to get him to change his mind.  The Minister should seriously consider our amendment because 95 per cent of the people at least who are involved in the institutes, the farming community and the public representatives who deal with agriculture would agree with us.  The Minister should take that into account.  I am sure he has received many representations and, while as I state the title will not make or break it, this would be a far better title.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to our amendment even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>Much has been made about the name given to this new body both in the Second Stage debate here and also in the Dáil when it was being debated there.  I do not think the name is at all important.  What is important is the type of service this new body will give when it is set up.  When this debate started, Teagasc seemed very strange to a lot of us.  The more often you repeat Teagasc, the more common that name becomes and the easier it is to get your tongue around it and to memorise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all taught Teagasc Críostaí going to school and I think that is the one thing that always sticks in our mind.  If we can remember back to those days when we started school and learned our <Col N="80" /> Teagasc Críostaí to the best of our ability, there is no reason why the farmers of Ireland could not memorise the name being given to this new body.  The important thing is that the new body should provide the type of service the farmers of this country need to help them to improve our most important industry, that is, the agricultural industry.  If this body being set up under the name Teagasc can help them to produce more food and more agricultural goods and make farming more profitable, the name will definitely stick in the minds of the farmers and they will be able to get their tongues around it without any problem.</P>

Ach sa chomhthéacs seo measaim go bhfuil sé amaideach ar fad, toisc nach é teagascóir atá i gceist sa Bhille &mdash; tá cúrsaí eile seachas teagasc i gceist.  Níl an t-ainm atá molta sa Bhille cruinn.  Táimse mar sin i bhfábhar an leasaithe atá molta ag na Seanadóirí Connor agus Bradford.</P>
      <P>I would be the first to champion an Irish language term in any legislation.  I only wish this cosmetic habit reflected a living reality, but let us have the cosmetic anyway.  It is a long-established practice now in the State to devise a nomenclature which is in Irish and which has become acceptable to the public and, indeed, over a wide range of semi-State bodies.  To that extent I accept the point being made by Senator Hussey and by other speakers on that side.  Nonetheless Senators Hussey's attempt to defend Teagasc is totally unconvincing.  I have no idea what the Senator's reference was to Teagasc Críostaí. I should imagine the tendency of every sane citizen into whom catechism was battered through the medium of Irish is never to hear a reference to Teagasc Críostaí again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hussey also said the name is not important; it is the success to the <Col N="81" /> project which is important.  Well, of course, that is true then why are we debating it at all?  If the name is not important, why not accept the suggestion to put in ACOT instead of Teagasc.  The implications of Teagasc are simply that this is a Bill about instruction, about conveying information, and that is not a proper or accurate description of what the Bill is about.  Surely section 5 of the Bill defines the functions of the new institution. Those functions have to do with other things than actually conveying information including, of course, the vital function of research.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I do not like Teagasc is not alone that it is inaccurate and an incomplete description of the functions of the new institution but that, by implication, it downgrades the research dimension which, as I said in my Second Stage speech, is a danger that runs throughout the whole Bill.  My objection to it is simply that it is inaccurate and an incomplete attempt to describe what the Bill is about.  For that reason it is a nonsense.  It is fatuous and any talk about farmers getting their tongues around it is really irrelevant in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would accept Teagasc if it were an accurate attempt to describe the Bill.  I would have no sympathy with people who could not get their tongues around it. I would be quite happy that foreigners should come to learn it because there is no reason why we should not use Irish language terms in our international dealings as well.  In this connection it seems to me to be entirely unsatisfactory.  The name is of secondary importance and I hope that the new institution will smell as sweet under whatever name it goes by. What is important is the sweet smell of success.  This is important enough to make some fuss about.  It is a sloppy piece of nomenclature and totally inaccurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy has put the whole argument in favour of changing this in a nutshell because it does not refer to the functions the new board will be <Col N="82" /> involved in.  That was the legitimate complaint of the people involved in the industry, the professional people who are doing the job already in two divided boards, the board of ACOT and the board of An Foras.  The scientists involved in the research industry who have given a lifetime to the development of agriculture at the scientific research end are of the opinion that this name does not reflect the work they will be putting into it in future.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage speech I referred to the name as reminding me of an anthelmintic. Those who might have done research on that in the meantime will know that that is the name of a worm drench, it is a chemical description of a worm drench. That is as close as I could get to the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo;.  For that reason farmers might remember it better than any other name.  There is an over-riding consideration as well which the Minister has not alluded to, that is, the cost factor. The amount of property the Minister has taken to himself to give to this new board with the word &ldquo;ACOT&rdquo; already written on it is pretty considerable throughout the country and adding one &ldquo;T&rdquo; onto that would be a lot cheaper than excluding it altogether and writing Teagasc all over the place.</P>
      <P>This Government subject themselves every day to a critical analysis of all the spending they carry out which is unnecessary.  Let us look at it from that point of view.  I am not sure how much printing has already been done on the presumption that this House would accept this name.  If that is the case, the Minister has a counter-argument immediately. Perhaps he has a whole lot of things set up with this new name on them but certainly Senator Murphy has made the case.  This name does not reflect the work which this new board and the staff involved will be doing in future in the area of agricultural advice, training and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My grasp of the Irish language is not as good as it should be.  It was excellent at one stage but, using English so frequently, I did not keep the blas as flúirseach as I should.  I bow to the Senator's <Col N="83" /> expert opinion on this that it does not reflect the future role of the staff involved.  That is a prime consideration when we try to explain to other people who do not understand the language what the word stands for.  They know what the word &ldquo;ACOT&rdquo; stands for.  It is an internationally accepted word now in the area of agricultural advice and training.</P>
    <P>I did not put my name to this amendment because I reckoned that everybody had objected to the name initially and that amendments were likely to be forthcoming to change the name.  I admire the ingenuity of Senators Connor, Bradford and Hogan in coming up with the addition of an extra &ldquo;T&rdquo;.  Luckily the original word to be used did not start with the letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; and finish with &ldquo;T&rdquo; because then we would have had to change it.  Irrespective of what it might have stood for at the end of the day it would have been relevant to change it.</P>

      <P>That is probably the first &ldquo;hear hear&rdquo; I will hear in this House today.  After all, it has been described as, to use Senator Connor's terms, incongruous, inappropriate, unacceptable.  I might ask: incongruous to whom, inappropriate to what, unacceptable to whom?  I understand the meaning of those words very well.  I suggest to the Senators on the other hand that ACOT is acceptable, appropriate and, I presume to that extent, congruous as well.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that, to those who would suggest that this name or any name that is proposed is not acceptable, I should make a few points.  There were reservations about the term when it was first introduced.  One of the most important things about any name is that it should be known, identified and identifiable with a particular product if it happens to be a product in terms of a physical product or an activity such as we are concerned with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that, because of the amount of public discussion, analysis and objection, &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; has been launched in a way that I could never have expected it would be.  It has commended the requisite amount of public attention and, as the weeks and months went on &mdash; because it is six months since this was first introduced &mdash; even a degree of public respect. I am satisfied that the change now to something else that is not acceptable &mdash; I do not want to make any point by trying to trump everyone's king with my ace &mdash; would overlook the fact that there are elements within the new authority in the research area and they would not find it acceptable to have a name like ACOT which is the same as a separate function of one element of the new authority, namely, the advisory service.  The researchers would not be favourable to that.  I do not want to attribute any wrong <Col N="85" /> motive or disposition to them in that.  I can just tell Senators that in fact it is not acceptable to them.  I find it unacceptable, to use Senator Connor's own phrase, when he tells me that ACOT is a name that is widely recognised abroad.  I was not aware of that.  I do not want to denigrate what they have done up to this.</P>

      <P>That is one of the realities that I am faced with.  It is not just a matter of adding one &ldquo;T&rdquo;, as Senator Ferris said. He suggested that some mischievous person might add an &ldquo;S&rdquo; at the beginning and then we would all have some trouble. One way or the other the important thing is that we are dealing with a term that implies instruction.  Far be it from me to take issue with someone from the academic life like Senator Murphy but he would acknowledge that an instruction implies basically the accumulation of knowledge in the first instance.  If you have not accumulated knowledge you have not very much to instruct.  I would assume that there is a certain precondition of accumulating knowledge involved before you convey what it is you have accumulated.</P>
      <P>That is accumulated in this instance through research.  It will then be imported through education and advice.  I am not saying everyone would agree with this, but is that a feature of anything one proposes in this land of ours particularly when it comes to putting a name on something? I am encouraged by the disposition I find all round that the important thing is what they do and the name by which they do it will become even more acceptable if less important as the years go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back on a few points.  I may not have understood the Minister at the beginning when he stated that by not using the word <Col N="86" />&ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; in some way we did not want to use an Irish word.  He made comparisons with Germany, France and Belgium and said that we would not be critical of them for using their words in their language.  The word &ldquo;ACOTT&rdquo; is an acronym of the Irish words An Chomh airle Oiliúna Taighde agus Talmhaí ochta, the Council for Advice and Research in Agriculture.  The Minister also makes the point that the people in the research sector, presumably the people in the Agricultural Institute, might not be too happy.  The word &ldquo;research&rdquo; is included in the Irish form. We had An Foras Talúntais or the Agricultural Institute formerly but we have accommodated the sensitivities that might be found among the people in the research sector, in the sense that the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; in Irish is included in the title which we want to give it.</P>
      <P>We would not have any disagreement with having the body called AFTA.  That was proposed in the Dáil by another party.  We object to the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; not because it is an acronym in the Irish language anymore than our own word is an acronym in the Irish language.  We object to the fact that this it not a marketable word; it is not an easy word that people can identify with.</P>
      <P>All the arguments Senator Murphy made are absolutely correct.  We want this to be simple, to be something that is already identified in the consciousness and in the minds of the people who will have to operate it.  Fair enough, the operators, the research and advice people may not have a great problem, but the farmers have.  Farmers have a traditions resistance to lots of things.  I honestly think that to make it acceptable, more marketable and more commercial, if you want to use a word, we should use a word they can readily identify with and which they find has a meaning.  The very word ACOTT has something of an agricultural sound about it.  Certainly the word &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo; has not.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold the House up on this matter, but must say that I was totally in agreement <Col N="87" /> with the first half of the Minister's comments in which he argued for the need for a richness of linguistic and cultural expression in the EC.  I could not agree with him more in that regard.  As I said in my first comments in the Irish language, normally I would be gunning very enthusiastically for Teagasc.</P>
      <P>In the second half of his comments he failed utterly to convince me that anything I said in my contribution was wrong. For example, he said that Teagasc implies research, that you cannot have teaching unless you have research.  The point is that you can have somebody else's research. This is what a lot of people are afraid of about the new regime which may come into operation in this Bill, that research will be down-graded and that Teagasc will mean handing on second-hand information.  That is another reason for not wanting Teagasc, that Teagasc means teaching exclusively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, section 4, which defines the principal functions of the new body, specifies providing advisory services in paragraph (a) and obtaining and making available practical information in paragraph <Col N="88" /> (b).  Even if we stopped there I would still maintain that Tagasc is not an accurate description of each and both of those functions.  Certainly paragraph (c) is nowhere mentioned in Teagasc, to undertake, promote, encourage, assist etc. in research and development.  That is totally lacking in the proposed new title.  I must stand opposed to it.</P>
    <P>It may well be that ACOTT is not terribly satisfactory.  It may well be that those who drafted this Bill did not think hard enough to come up with a proper term which is probably the likely explanation. I am convinced that the argument to retain Teagasc in the Bill is at this stage pure inertia &mdash; not be bothered making us change, there is too much trouble, can you not take it as it is, will it not do us fine?  That is the mentality behind it.  For that reason I am even more opposed to it than when I spoke the first time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 22, after &ldquo;industry)&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and to publish as it sees fit the results of such research and development&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gabh mo leithscéal, a Chathaoirligh, is mise atá i gceist anseo.  I think I am right in saying that amendment No. 7 stands in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan.  I want to make it clear that I am not Senator Brendan Ryan.  In fact, I would dearly love to call a division to delete Senator Brendan Ryan but, since that is not possible, I want to make it clear that this is Senator John A. Murphy speaking. What is in question here is simply to underline the importance of research. Research is of vital importance to the whole agricultural industry.  It is an importance not recognised in the Bill but <Col N="90" /> actually downgraded in the Bill.  I need hardly remind the Minister how important research is and has been to agriculture over the past several decades.  To mention one place familiar to me &mdash; it is by no means meant to reflect on any other institution &mdash; the excellence of the research carried out in Moore Park was essential for the phenomenal expansion of Irish farming in the sixties and seventies.</P>
    <P>One cannot, even at the risk of being repetitive, over-estimate the importance of research and one cannot sufficiently disabuse ordinary people perhaps who may feel that research is something in the ivory tower, of the notion that it is an optional extra in a matter so bread and butterish as farming.  One cannot disabuse such a notion frequently enough. Research is, of the essence, to further progress.  From now on it is going to be a different kind of research.  It will be research which will be adjusted to the intensely competitive situation in which we will be.  Senators may recall that last week Senator Ryan and I quoted from an article by Professor Cunningham in which he emphasised that the level of research in Ireland, the expenditure on research, compares very poorly with those countries which will be our competitors in the near future.  It is in that whole context, not wishing to make anything like a Second Stage speech, that I move this amendment which is to make explicit the importance of research.  If this amendment is accepted, section 4 (1) (c) will read as follows:</P>
    <P>to undertake, promote, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, facilitate and review, agricultural research and development (including research and development in relation to food processing and the food processing industry) and to publish as it sees fit the results of such research and development.</P>
    <P>You cannot have research without independent publication.</P>
    <P>It is important also to reassure those <Col N="91" /> people involved in the change in this institution, researchers involved in our greatest industry who are concerned about the implications for themselves in this Bill, that this amendment will, among other things, ensure that their independence will not be curtailed, that research will not be down-graded, that their research will continue to be recognised at an international scientific level.  Only thus can the quality of their research be guaranteed.  It is an extremely important amendment and I suggest that we should recognise that an explicit function of Teagasc should be to publish as it sees fit, without any let or hindrance from vested interests, the results of such research and development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vitally important that research be carried on independently and that the results of that independent research be made known to the public. That is the proper concept of research and that is the kind of work the people in Foras have been involved in.  It is the kind of work they have been internationally recognised in the past as doing and much of their work was referred to by other scientists in the agricultural industry in other countries.  If this new board are to have the commitment to research that was envisaged in the amalgamation of the two bodies and are to work in close liaision with those who are advising farmers, it is important that they should have the ability to publish without any restriction by the Government, the Minister of the day, or any other Minister who might consider that the publication of research would be detrimental in some way to some interests or other.  I am totally in favour of the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan in his amendment.</P>

    <Col N="92" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to express my support of the sentiments expressed by Senator Murphy acting in proxy for Senator Ryan.  The Agricultural Institute published annually one excellent document which was quite unique in that it revealed everything that was important about agriculture.  I refer to the <i>Farm Management Survey.</i>  The Minister's Department have their own survey of agricultural income and other related matters which is published annually, but the document to which I refer was researched independently by people within the Agricultural Institute who did not have to have any politico looking over their shoulder.  There was no political flavour in their findings, unlike, I would have to suggest, the Department's report.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to reflect on the civil servants, but the report on farm incomes and the state of of agriculture by the Department of Agriculture was published annually by the Minister for Agriculture. All Ministers for Agriculture naturally would take from it what they would see as being politically to their own advantage.  That was not the case with the <i>Farm Management Survey</i> as carried out by An Foras Talúntais.  This was a totally independent piece of work which went on all during the year to scientific standards, including farmers in every category, by size, by enterprise, by age and so on.  They produced this excellent type of integrated document every year and I am particularly worried about the independence of that publication after the setting up of this new body.</P>
      <P>I would also like to compliment An Foras for that excellent quarterly bulletin which they used to publish.  I do not know what its future will be.  That was <i>Farm and Food Research.</i>  In a very compelling, readable fashion they published the findings of their research on a quarterly basis in relation to agriculture, both nationally and internationally.  Senator Ferris has referred to the fact that the value of their work was recognised internationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I voice my concern that the publication of research and development <Col N="93" /> results might be down-graded upon the enactment of this legislation.  It must be realised that information is power.  Each enterprise requires more research and development and more information flow than heretofore because of the tightening margins in agriculture in each sector and the increased competition, not only from our European partners but from outside Europe, particularly America and New Zealand.  If agricultural devlopment in this country is to keep pace with international developments it has to be the forefront in agricultural research and development.  If this merger is to bear any fruit, the greatest communication possible between the new organisation and the farming community is of utmost importance.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case being made in substance by those who have spoken.  Not only do I agree with what they have said, I promoted the implementation in this Bill of the idea that has been suggested.  It is there in the Bill already.  I am all for dissemination, publication and communication.  I feel as strongly about that as anybody who has expressed himself.  That is why it is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little difficult to have to answer a case that I oppose something because of a misunderstanding of what this Bill does or, as someone suggested, does not do.  I know that Senators are genuine in their conviction that this material should be available for publication and disseminated. I am not saying Senator Hogan has not read the details but let me remind him of section 4 (1) (b) which provides that one of the principal functions of Teagasc shall be to obtain and make available to the agricultural industry the scientific and practical information in relation to agriculture required by it.  That involves dissemination of information.  Its fundamental function is to obtain and make information available to the industry.  You do not make it available unless you disseminate it.  I have to refute the charge that there is a major change here, that I am down-grading the <Col N="94" /> service, although I cannot stop people from saying it if they choose.  Section 4 (2) says:</P>
    <P>Teagasc shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, also have and enjoy all those functions (other than those conferred by sections 34, 36 and 59 of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1937) that immediately before the establishment day, were vested in the Institute, the Council, An Chomhairle and the Board and are not specified in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Let me reassure the House that the range of functions in relation to research is very clear and all of those enjoyed by the institute will now be incorporated here. They are contained in section 4 (2) of the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958.  Primary among them is the obligation to procure and disseminate the results of agricultural research to interested persons including in particular, persons engaged in providing advisory services in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <P>If anyone thought that any Minister of any colour at any time would introduce legislation to ensure that reports such as have been referred would no longer be published and would try to censor information obtained from research for no reason, Senators would have good cause not just for worry but for a full frontal attack on whatever Minister would do it. The bad news is that this Minister is not doing that.  The good news is that he is doing something different.</P>
    <P>As far as the report to which Senator Connor referred is concerned, there was no attempt ever on my part to tamper with any information &mdash; I hope the same is true of my predecessors &mdash; in terms of departmental reports.  The income review the Senator referred to from the Agricultural Institute which is, as he said, independent, would give perhaps an even better picture of just how well farmers are doing right now.  If the Senator waits for another few weeks he will find that the independent Agricultural Institute will bring forward the latest review of agricultural income, with which I have <Col N="95" /> nothing to do.  The bad news or good news, depending on which way you look at it, is that 1987 was much better than was thought.  It was a much more enhanced and improved experience over 1986.  I do not tamper with these things.</P>

      <P>I was going to refer to what the Minister presented as a virtue but which totally defeats his argument. He referred to the earlier paragraph in the same section, where he said that Teagasc would &ldquo;make available to the agricultural industry&rdquo;.  That is the weakness of his whole argument.  The agricultural industry is not the be-all and the end-all of the development of agriculture. I hope that when I sit down the Minister will explain to me exactly what is meant by the agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister did not.  He then went back to the Act which governed the setting up of one of the other bodies.  He asked if he should read all the various things it might do and because nobody asked him not to he went ahead and read some of them.  On the particular part of relevance he said; &ldquo;and shall publish and circulate to interested parties&rdquo;.  That is the very weakness of the argument and that is the reason why he must accept this amendment here today because it relates not just to the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very bright student in a third level college might see a development, a movement or research on which he or she might be able to develop some portion of the industry, some industry dependent on agriculture, or some aspect of agriculture. That is one part of it.  The other question is: who decides on the interested parties?  This is the weakness of the Minister's argument.  We are saying in the amendment that it should publish as it sees fit.  &ldquo;As it sees fit&rdquo; does not commit the new body to presenting a glossy <Col N="96" /> report and sending it around to a million people every time they come up with a piece of research.  It should be available in published form, even if only for research purposes, so that other people might develop it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by what the esteemed Senator has said and the point he makes.  He says I am confining the publication to interested parties.  I would tell the Senator that I am not.  If he wants to add, having got this next assurance, he may do so for the purpose of the dialectic but not for the purpose of enlightenment.  The next subparagraph in section 4 (2) of the 1958 Bill states: &ldquo;publish, or procure the publication of, the results of agricultural research&rdquo;.  It does not limit the publication to interested parties.  I do not expect to satisfy Senator O'Toole because I know that Senator O'Toole does not wish to be satisfied.  If he wants to play games he can play them at someone else's expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In case one or other of us is suffering from a degree of abuseness which I am afraid will reflect on the intelligence of one or other of us, when Senator O'Toole says it is not covered in the Act could I refer him to section 4 (2). If we want to have a serious discussion let us have it.  If we want to play games <Col N="97" /> let us play them, so long as the world out there knows what we are doing.  It says:</P>
      <P>Teagasc shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, also have and enjoy all those functions (other than those conferred by sections 34, 36 and 59 of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977) that immediately before the establishment day, were vested in the Institute, the Council, An Chomhairle and the Board and are not specified in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Among all those functions that Teagasc shall have, there are in addition the two I have referred to in section 4 (2) of the 1958 Act which clearly confer on them the following functions:</P>
      <P>(j) disseminate, or procure the dissemination of, the results of agricultural research to interested persons, including, in particular, persons engaged in providing advisory services in relation to agriculture,</P>
      <P>(k) publish, or procure the publication of, the results of agricultural research.</P>

      <P>I am asking a simple question: are Teagasc required to publish <Col N="98" /> the results of all their research and development?  That is the simple question. If that is the case, then it is done. The Minister has put forward to us what Teagasc might decide to do.  There is no argument about this.  The argument is that, under the new legislation, Teagasc may or may not decide to publish.  This amendment says that Teagasc are required to publish.  There is a clear distinction there and, if the Minister cannot see that distinction, perhaps it should be spelled out very simply.  This is a requirement to do something.  The answer he has given gives us the potential of what Teagasc may decide to do.  This should be acceptance that the point I make is a correct one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context &mdash; and I was looking at the earlier part of the Bill again, the section on interpretations and definitions &mdash; I am sorry now that I did not spot in time the definition of &ldquo;research&rdquo; on page five of the Bill, lines 23 and 24 in which it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;research&rdquo; includes investigation, test, experiment, analysis and study;</P>
      <P>I am sorry I did not spot that before &mdash; it is my fault &mdash; as I would have certainly added &ldquo;publication&rdquo; to that because the essential distinction which I did not really bring out in my first contribution to this amendment is that publication is of the essence.  It is possible to conceive of research being made available in a limited context.  It is possible to conceive of research proceeded with but somehow repressed or discouraged for particular reasons.  There is a distinction here between research and publication.  Publication means publication in both scientific and popular forms, available not only to this or that section of the industry or to vested interests, but to the international scientific community at home and abroad which is the only way in which research can be conducted and published in internationally referred journals.  This process should be given recognition and explicit encouragement in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not playing games.  To the extent that I play games, I play them elsewhere.  I <Col N="99" /> am quite serious in putting forward these amendments and I am expressing the genuine unease of the researchers who have given the food industry such service over the past three decades.  They fear that what they see as their vocation would be curtailed or made subordinate to other purposes.  Therefore, what they are looking for and when I am asking for on their behalf is an explicit guarantee of commitment to publication.  I accept the Minister's personal assurance.  Earlier the Minister assured us that he was as passionately committed to research as any other Members of the House but, of course, he does not exist in the context of what we are arguing about, or rather he exists in a very different and nonbenign Michael O'Kennedy fashion.  It is whoever is the embodiment of the Minister who presents the threat we are taking about.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his advisers have no objection, and indeed encourage all aspects of research, why then does he not accept this amendment to which he could have no possible objection, to which he has said he could have no possible objection?  It will make re-assurance doubly sure.  It will allay the suspicions that prevail among the researchers themselves and it will help to arrest the lowering of morale at a time when there is a general decline in morale in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not achieve what Senator Murphy says it would achieve.  Senator Murphy suggests that the amendment will require publication, etc.  The amendment if he reads it &mdash; although it is not in his name, but he has adopted it by proxy as has been said &mdash; states: &ldquo;and to publish as it sees fit the results of such research and development&rdquo;.  That is not mandatory in any sense.  That gives exactly the provision as it was in the original legislation. Researchers would like to have the discretion to publish as they do, in the institute as they had, the results of their research but I would have thought that <Col N="100" /> researchers, be they academic in a university or in an institute, would resist &mdash; and if I were tempted to do that here I could hear Senator Murphy arguing to the contrary &mdash; being forced to publish. What was never done before should not be initiated now in that they should not be forced to publish A, B or C.  They are given exactly the same discretion as they had previously.  May I suggest &mdash; although Senator Ryan is not here &mdash; that if he were aware of the details contained in the original discretion which is incorporated exactly in this legislation, he would not have seen it necessary to put down this amendment?</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to listen to the implication &mdash; and I hope it is being made in good faith &mdash; that, because there is a certain interpretation put on this which is not in my view a reasonable and fair interpretation, I want to censor the publication of research, or I want to introduce a new limitation on research and want to bring a heavy hand on academic researchers.  That is not the case.  If people want arguments to sustain that, they will have to go further than this legislation because it will not be sustained by this legislation.  It is contained in the Bill which incorporates all that was already there.  It not only embraces and involves all that was done in the original agriculture institute legislation, but also strengthens it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has ever suggested that the original legislation in some way prevented An Foras Talúntais from issuing and publishing reports, from disseminating information, from conducting research, or from making available the results of their research.  If I were to start doing that now, I do not know what would happen.  In so far as Senator O'Toole's main professional preoccupation is communicating on a basis of perceived knowledge to those who are in a position to understand it, I hope there is not the same blockage of understanding between Senator O'Toole and his pupils as seems to exist between Senator O'Toole and me because to me it is straightforward.  It does not give me any great sense of reassurance to know that <Col N="101" /> what is so clear and straightforward cannot be understood by someone whose basic professonal obligation is to communicate simple things in a straightforward way.</P>

      <P>Could we go back to where we were half an hour ago when we were discussing this.  The Minister said he was committed to research, development, publication, communicating knowledge and so on.  Every time he speaks on this amendment he concedes the amendment and then says it is unnecessary because it is included in other areas.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan in his wisdom put in a preclusion on an obligation to publish everything in that he said here &ldquo;as it sees fit&rdquo;.  Obviously that is removing a statutory obligation by law to publish everything because some of it might be irrelevant.  The researchers might consider it unfit or unwise for any reason.  If they publish everything except what they consider to be unfit, obviously they are agreeing with what the Minister has said in all the other sections of the Bill.  I can see nothing wrong with accepting Senator Ryan's amendment.  Because the parliamentary draftsman did not insert it does not mean that it is not right for us to insert it now.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going back to the other House with an amendment at some stage and possibly it might be as well to include an obligation to publish if the research done is relevant.  The Minister agreed that all communications should be published among researchers and people who are communicating.  I do not see an argument between us.  It is an argument about the reasons.  The reasons advanced by this side of the House are legitimate enough, particularly when we have discussed this with people who are engaged in research and who would hate to feel that they were precluded in some way from publishing. The Minister reassures us that they will not be precluded, that they have the same powers they had under the Act.</P>

      <P>It always bothers me &mdash; but I am quite used to it at this stage &mdash; that when people run out of decent arguments, they become personal instead of answering the issue and addressing the facts as they are delivered.  When people decide to take a very personalised line, it always assures me that they have run out of argument and do not know where they are going.  I in no way personalise my remarks to the Minister or, indeed, impute that he would wish in any sense to censor one thing or decide not to publish another.</P>
      <P>I am quite aware that being a Minister is a very transitory and transient occupation. Ministers come and go but legislation stays forever until somebody decides to change it.  That is the nature of the discussion we are having here. I wish the Minister would see this as something bigger than himself and his Department and his own personal commitment. It is not an issue for me and, if the Minister decides to make it an issue, please let him make it with somebody else.</P>
      <P>As to the imputation that I might be particularly dense, that may well be. People can decide that.  How effectively and efficiently I might communicate depends on two people.  One person can say the other is not communicating too well and, the other person might just as easily say that the person on the receiving end is not assimilating the information being put forward too well and not able to grasp the core of what is being put forward.  I advise the Minister to go back over some of the cases and arguments that have been made so far.  Apart from playing games, I have a meeting 100 miles away from here in a quarter of a hour and I put it off in order to deal with this, having discussed it with the named proposer.  I consider it quite important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The Minister has already changed his position on two points.  He said earlier that the present legislation and the proposed legislation encompass what was envisaged by this amendment, but now the Minister is saying that it does not. The Minister said clearly &ldquo;it may&rdquo; under the legislation and that we are seeking to make it a requirement.  That is the Minister's objection to it.  That is a very understandable objection and that is the reason the amendment is down there.  It is not due to a lack of understanding of what is possible under the proposed amendment but there is a clear understanding of what may or may not happen. The reason it is proposed is so that there will not be a choice.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to lecture the Minister and far be it from me to hark back to my own first profession as referred to by the Minister, but the words &ldquo;as it sees fit&rdquo; are an adverbial clause governing the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo;.  They determine the type of publication and do not apply to what may or may not be published.  It is the form of the publication that is referred to.</P>
    <P>Any simple interpretation of semantic analysis of the sentence will make that quite clear to the Minister.  I wish to reassure him that what is meant by the <Col N="104" /> words &ldquo;as it sees fit&rdquo; in that amendment is the form of the publication, not what may or may not be published.  What is intended by this amendment is that all the results of research and development should be published in some form and available for those people who wish to use them.  It is different; it is not covered in the legislation.  I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;and the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that last year the Department of the Public Service were taken into the Department of Finance it is reasonable to find in any Bill where remuneration, salaries and conditions of staff are concerned that the Minister for Finance would have an input.  In this Bill I very much regret that in almost half of the total of 31 sections the Minister for Finance has a superior role, with the Minister for Agriculture, who is the Minister named in the definition section.  This, to me, as somebody engaged in agriculture is entirely reprehensible. As public representatives we all know the great difficulty there is in getting permission from any semi-State organisation if ministerial approval or departmental approval has to be soug it from any Department of State.  But can you visualise the way agricultural education and research will be delayed and hampered in the years ahead under this legislation when, in every second section, the Minister for Agriculture and the Department, if they wish to act, have to get the permission of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>This will slow down development in the agricultural research and advisory services.  I believe that this kind of restriction which will be imposed by the Department of Finance is coming at a time when we need, if we want to compete with the agricultural service sectors and the agricultural processing sectors in the greater Europe, not just top-class agricultural produce but an advisory and research service that will be second to none in Europe.  I do not see the new organisation, Teagasc, being able to provide that if there are so many restrictions in every second section of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I made the point on Second Stage that this Bill clearly emanated from the pen of the draftsman of the Department of Finance rather than Agriculture.  This Bill is replacing 16 Agricultural (Amendment) Acts going back as far as the 1931 Agricultural Act which set up the agricultural committees.  That is over half-a-century of considered agricultural legislation being replaced by a relatively small Bill with 31 sections and most of the power and control being vested, not in the Minister for Agriculture, but in the Minister for Finance.  In the last 30 years, in my experience as a Member of the Oireachtas, the Minister for Agriculture of the day in every Government was one of the most senior Ministers in the administration, and the Department of Agriculture was one of the most important Ministeries to the economy of the country. It is regrettable and extraordinary if the powers that the present Minister and future Ministers will have as Ministers for Agriculture and Food are going to be subject in half the sections of this Bill to the say-so of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, as in every other Department, know exactly the constraints that <Col N="107" /> come from their colleagues in the Department of Finance.  I would like the Minister to tell me what independent role his Department is going to have in the future.  I put down three amendments here but the Minister for Finance is mentioned in 13 of the 31 sections.  I readily admit, but I do not accept as any answer, that in sections which are dealing purely with remuneration and staff it would be appropriate that the Department of Finance, or the section of the Department of Finance which was the Department of the Public Service, should have an input to look after the remuneration and conditions of service of public officials whether it is in a semi-State organisation or as civil servants.  That is acceptable.  But in the day-to-day running of this new organisation there is no place for the Department of Finance to have an overriding say on the decisions that the Minister for Agriculture must take in the interests of the agricultural industry. It is the one area of this legislation in which I am sorely disappointed.  I am sorry that the Minister is not here to take this point.  I fully accept that his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, is here and that he is fully equipped and briefed, but, nonetheless, it is a point that is very important and it means that the entire agricultural advice and research sector is completely degraded in the area of public administration in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose if it were possible we could all agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator McDonald but I do not think there is anything new in the this particular section.  In fact, the consent of the Minister for Finance is necessary in so many things dealing with this board.  I am sure the Department of Finance will have no say in the day-to-day running of this new organisation. That will be up to the board themselves and to the Minister for Agriculture of the day.  It has been the tradition, as far as I can remember and I think since the foundation of the State, that the Department of Finance are always consulted <Col N="108" /> in matters affecting other Departments, particularly where the question of finance arises.  If any new schemes are initiated in other Departments it is always necessary to get the consent of the Department of Finance because at the end of the day they are the people who will have to provide the wherewithal for those schemes.  For that reason it has always been necessary to get the consent of the Department of Finance.  I am sure that is what is asked for here under this legislation. It does not necessarily mean that the Department of Finance are going to be involved in the day-to-day running of this new board but I think that when the Department of Finance are providing the money for this new organisation it is necessary that the Minister for Finance of the day would know what is happening because he is the person who will be responsible in the end for providing the money.  That is merely all this is asking for.  I do not see anything wrong with having the consent of the Minister for Finance included in this new legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator McDonald.  In my Second Stage speech, which is relevant to these amendments, I made a passing reference to the influence of the Department of Finance in all matters and particularly in the area of agriculture.  I knew from the Minister's reaction to me at the time, which could not go on the record, that he agreed with the sentiments that I have expressed because I am quite sure that each move that is made by the Department of Agriculture, particularly when they need assistance to top up anything that might come from Europe, the dead hand of the Department of Finance is always there to ensure that we may not be able to avail totally of everything that might be on offer in Europe because it needs topping-up here.  We would like to <Col N="109" /> feel also that the day-to-day running of this new Authority would not be subjected to Department of Finance restrictions but because of the way the Bill is worded it is obvious that they will have an over-powering input into anything the new board may do.</P>
      <P>We know from our experience in dealing with ACOT in particular over recent years that they were frustrated in carrying out some of the projects they wanted to carry out simply because finance was not forthcoming through the Department of Agriculture and through county committees because of the restrictions put on them by the Department of Finance. Agriculture is an important economic industry and is probably one of the biggest generators of income into the country and into the Exchequer.  There should be a more liberal approach from the Department of Finance in all things agricultural. I think that underlines Senator McDonald's concern in this area.  I support the idea he has that it is certainly perceived &ldquo;out there&rdquo; that there is too much influence from the Department of Finance in matters concerning agriculture.</P>

      <P>Senator Mc Donald's amendment seems to reduce the powers of the Minister for Finance in relation to the activities and expenditure of Teagasc.  This is not a realistic view, given the considerable public funds which will be at the disposal of the new Authority.  For that reason these amendments cannot be accepted. In reply to Senator McCormack, I have no difficulty in giving an absolute assurance that the Minister for Finance will have no function whatever in the day-to-day decision taking of Teagasc.  That is a matter for the director under the council of Teagasc.  The Department of Finance in the present administration embodies the Department of the Public Service as well as Finance itself.  The function of the Department of Finance here is an overall controlling interest, but the day-to-day decision taking and the day-to-day <Col N="110" /> involvement is a matter for the director and the council of Teagasc.</P>

I would like the Minister to show me in any one of the Agriculture (Amendment) Acts from 1931 up to 1974 more than one reference to the Minister for Finance.

Therefore, I have to confine my remarks to section 4 of the Bill.  Nevertheless they hold for each of the other sections.  The Minister has not even attempted to answer any of the points I raised.  This is most unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was pleased with the Minister's assurance, but I would like to ask him if in view of the fact that the overall budget has been reduced from approximately £38 million to £20 million &mdash; the overall budget of what was ACOT and An Foras Talúntais &mdash; for the new body indicates that the Minister for Finance would have a very big say in the matter of the running of the new body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to be optimistic in his statement to us that there will be money readily available to the new Authority.  I am sure that nobody would be more pleased than those of us on this side of the House to learn that this money was available.  We have had <Col N="111" /> a promise from the Minister that it will and indeed the Minister for Agriculture and Food said almost the same thing in the House on the last occasion.  But we have to go on the facts.  The facts are that in this particular year the allocation in the budget for the two Authorities has been slashed.  We see no evidence whatsoever in the present Book of Estimates that there is to be any change in that attitude.  We would need more than assurances from Ministers in the House, as part of the legislation, which basically will fail unless there is funding.  When you consider that the amount of funding available to agriculture is only about 2 per cent of the total cost to the Exchequer of all other services this sector is not looking for anything over and above its fair due.  That is our reason for disagreeing, even if we are repeating ourselves. We disagree with too much restriction by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey made the point that it is nothing new.  But he was part of a resolution, which was passed by Galway County Committee, proposed by himself. I quote:</P>
      <P>We, the Galway County Committee of Agriculture, request the Department of Agriculture and Food to maintain the present level of staff, that special concessions be given to advise on disadvantaged areas....</P>
      <P>These were all things we would like to see.  That was passed unanimously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  But when you are in this House enacting legislation you must ensure, through the Chair, that the interests of the industry are protected. We are all agreed that the interest of the industry we represent here should be protected.  One way it can be protected is to ensure that the Department of Finance would have as little intervention in it as possible.  We know from experience <Col N="112" /> what they can do.  In any committee ever formed for the industry, whether national or otherwise, the Department of Finance insisted on having membership to ensure that there was no liberalisation of the State funds which were available. Senator McDonald is quite right; there is nothing unreasonable in trying to exclude the Minister for Finance from some sections.  Naturally, in the overall, we would expect that as the Cabinet works, there will have to be agreement between Ministers.  The Ministry for Finance is all-powerful and it can strangle other Departments, irrespective of the commitment of Ministers and Ministers of State, and the work you want to do and are doing within the constraints placed on you at Cabinet level.  We are trying to release the purse strings.  I am sure the Minister would welcome the fact that we can pass an amendment like this in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the debate on this amendment has highlighted how necessary it is to have the Minister for Finance included in this legislation because when we look for money for an organisation such as this it is to the Minister for Finance we have to go.  When we are not given that money, or when finance has been curtailed or services are being curtailed, the first man to get the blame is, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing new in having the Minister for Finance included in legislation such as this.  If we go back to other legislation introduced in this House or in the other House over the years we find that the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for providing the finance to service an organisation such as this.  It is only right and proper that his name be included in the legislation.  No matter who is Minister for Agriculture and Food he has to go to the Minister for Finance for the money to run the services.  The Minister for Finance has to impose the taxes in order to get the money to run this kind of service.  As long as the Minister for Finance has no responsibility for <Col N="113" /> the day-to-day working of the organisation, I am not in the least concerned about having his name included in the legislation.  If he were to have responsibility for or any say in the running of Teagasc it would be another matter, but the fact is that the responsibility for the running of this organisation is left to the directors and the members of the board. We will certainly be needing the Minister for Finance to provide the money and we will be making representations to him.  If he does not provide that money he will come in for a lot of criticism from the Members of the Opposition and from myself.  The fact that I was responsible for moving the motion that has been read out by Senator Ferris in Galway County Committee of Agriculture shows that my overall concern is for the farmers of this country.</P>

      <P>The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas...</P>
      <P>That is a section common to every Bill.  I challenge my colleague, Senator Hussey, to find me an Agricultural Bill out of the 16 Acts that are repealed in this legislation, in which, other than in the section dealing with the expenses, there is reference to the Minister for Finance.  That gives scope over 50 years of legislation.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P>In page 7, subsection (7) (a), line 33, to delete &ldquo;that is wholly owned by Teagasc&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is being proposed as a result of the Government's recent decision not to insist on subsidiaries being wholly owned.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food indicated this in his Second Stage speech on the basis that this would enhance Teagasc's prospects of forming joint ventures with commercial interests.  I have great pleasure in commending this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>We would like to welcome the Minister's announcement here. It has been announced prior to this.  Our party moved an amendment along these lines in the Dáil and it was not accepted. We are delighted now that the Minister has seen the light, albeit at a later stage, and has accepted the principle of our amendment as enuniciated by our spokesperson in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support the amendment.  I said in my speech last week that it is very important that the new body should branch out into developments which seem to have been beyond the scope of ACOT and AFT in their former days.  Anything that makes them more commercially aware and commercially active is to be welcomed.  I am sure that any ventures they think of involving themselves in will produce good results and will be helpful to the overall research and development agency.  I welcome the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (7), lines 42 to 46, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>The principle of what we have here has been well discussed on earlier amendments and in earlier contributions.  We are worried about this.  I would like the Minister to give more detailed comment as to what he has in mind here.  I am talking about section 4 (7) (c) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give a direction in writing to Teagasc on any matter relating to a subsidiary or the policies, programmes or activities of a subsidiary and Teagasc shall comply or, as may be appropriate, secure compliance with the direction.</P>
      <P>First, it smacks of an inordinate degree of ministerial interference in the work of Teagasc.  Earlier today the Minister said in a very ebullient and outgoing way, as he outstretched his arms, that he was all for openness, communication and dissemination etc., a form of glasnost or perestroika.  Here again we have very clearly implied the intention of the Minister to take within his power a good deal of the independence formerly enjoyed by ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  The principle of this has been dealt with in many of the contributions so far.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us in detail what he has to fear about subsidiaries and their policies.  With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I might deal with paragraph (d) afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The controls in subsection (7) (c) I believe are reasonable, given that there is the use of very substantial public funds at issue here.  In relation to that section it says that the Minister may give a direction in writing to Teagasc on any matter relating to a subsidiary or the policies, programmes etc.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The Director shall carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of Teagasc and perform such other functions as may be determined by Teagasc.</P>
      <P>In other words, the day-to-day control and management and business functions of Teagasc are the responsibilities of the director.  But I think it is reasonable that the Minister for Agriculture and Food should be in a position to have ultimate control, particularly in relation to subsidiaries of Teagasc.  I see nothing wrong with that subsection.  It is an important subsection of the Bill and it should be allowed to remain as part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be opposed to this provision in the Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food would have a power whereby he could direct Teagasc to a particular programme which might or might not suit the management and day-to-day operations of the new body at the time.  If the board of Teagasc decided on a programme of activities the Minister for Agriculture and Food would have supreme authority over and a veto on the direction which the board or its subsidiaries would take.  The level of ministerial power in the overall operation of the Bill indicates a significant lack of autonomy in the day-to-day activities of the board and the new body.  I would not be happy about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision to allow such ministerial authority.  In most Departments at the moment we see a situation developing where the arm of the State, or the aspect of the Department or the organisation which is operating away from the Department in a so-called autonomous body, <Col N="118" /> has been usurped in its authority because the Minister of that Department has so much control over it.  The very nature of the ministerial control would indicate to me that there may be no need for the body to be established in the first place. If the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in this instance, is to have such wide-ranging powers of control over Teagasc it could compromise the director and the board of Teagasc in drawing up a programme of activities.  They would be conscious of the fact that the Minister of the day would have to be satisfied that their activities would accord with his thinking on the matter.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this section is reasonable.  At present ACOT are obliged to submit their programme of activities to the Government of the day at least three months before the start of each year.  I would like to remind people that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has a statutory responsibility to the people, the electorate and the taxpayer. For the time being, any Minister for Agriculture would be entitled to know what any State body or subsidiary of a State body was proposing to do.  You could not have a State body or a subsidiary going off in a different direction from the overall Government and ministerial policy for a particular sector.  This section is quite reasonable.  I do not think it would be in the best interests of the Bill or the future of Teagasc to have it withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is introducing a vocabulary I did not use.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Agriculture and Food would preside over a body that would be leading off in a different direction from the overall agriculture policy.  The Minister knows quite well that I never suggested that.  Nevertheless, I think the Minister will realise that the level of autonomy the board will have and the discretion the body will have, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the supremacy the Minister for Agriculture will exercise over the board, is something that would inhibit the board from carrying out a more imaginative and <Col N="119" /> realistic programme of activities from the point of view of the direction of agriculture and its enterprises that they would perceive.  This would all depend on the various members of the board.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture will appoint competent people to the board, people who will know the agricultural industry fairly well and will have a particular view on the development of the various agricultural enterprises, in the light of the competition from Europe and the tightening margins under the budgetary policy and the financial situation in Europe.  I question the muffling of the activities on a day-to-day basis of the new body with the supremacy the Minister for Agriculture will have.  I am aware that ACOT have to submit a programme of activities to the Minister for Agriculture three months in advance of that programme commencing.  An overall programme of activities and policy direction could be given by the new body, Teagasc, to the Minister three months in advance of its commencement but I do not see why the programme of activities and events in the subsidiaries and in the local areas should be submitted to the Minister.  In other words the discretion within ACOT and AFT allows local autonomy.  They can exercise discretion within an overall financial expenditure given to them by the Minister for Agriculture.  I agree with that.  That does not alter the fact that the Minister for Agriculture should not have so much control over this new body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we want to make is that we agree with the Minister that the board will have control over the day-to-day running and of course the Minister must have overall control but there is something here which smacks of draconianism aimed at subsidiaries. Perhaps the Minister could give us a situation &mdash; I know he would have to speak hypothetically &mdash; where he would be unhappy about the policies, the programmes or the activities of a subsidiary which would be working with Teagasc.  It is a kind of Sword of Damocles held over the head of what will be an important <Col N="120" /> part of the activities of the new body, that is their relationship, co-operation and the work they will do with subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Senators &mdash; I think this is accepted all round &mdash; that the director and the council of Teagasc have responsibility for the day-to-day activities of Teagasc and their subsidiaries.  But subsidiaries are a new dimension to State bodies.  We have only just passed the amendment here allowing the establishment of subsidiaries.  In particular, subsidiaries under Teagasc have a facility for the establishment of joint ventures.  In this new area it is only prudent that the Minister would have overall responsibility and would seek a programme of activities from these subsidiaries. I do not see anything draconian about this.  Ministers are very humble people, particularly the present Minister. We are grilled regularly by the Members of the Seanad and the Dáil in relation to our activities, not to mention the media grilling us from time to time.  That is more than I can say about some of the State bodies I know of.  Some of them cannot even give you a civil answer to a query. The only thing we hear from some State bodies from time to time in the Dáil or Seanad is a request for a Supplementary Estimate when they have over-reached themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  I think an assurance has been given as well that there will be adequate finance available to ACOT and AFT and the new body Teagasc.  There is no difficulty in this and there should be no apprehension on the part of any Senator or anybody else in relation to this subsection.  I believe that it should remain a part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 goes back to what has been well discussed and voted upon, that is, the principle of the independence of the new body and the principle which the Government wish to <Col N="121" /> establish here of rather undue interference by the Minister for Finance.  For the benefit of the House paragraph (d) reads:</P>
      <P>A direction under this subsection in relation to the disposal of any assets or surpluses of a subsidiary shall not be given without the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House cannot see why a decision like that cannot be taken by the board of Teagasc in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  We find something suspicious about the fact that authority should be given to the Minister for Finance in a section which we believe is not particularly relevant to his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to annoy Senators any further but just to say again that I think this is quite reasonable. In the disposal of assets or property of the State and of the taxpayer and the electorate it is quite reasonable to have the consent of the Minister for Finance who, after all, is the custodian of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 14 and the powers that have been vested in the Minister for Finance, in view of the fact that the Minister for Finance is short of cash in most Departments at the moment, he could see an opportunity arising under this merger to sell off some ACOT centres.  That goes back to my original point that, when there is ministerial authority over this area, there is always the tendency to use it for a net cash gain to the Department involved rather than to have the board, who would be more sensitive to the operations and sensitive to the essential location of these centres, decide on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister for Finance will now have control over where the money comes from and goes to means that he could have an influence over what centres could be rationalised and what centres might remain in the overall rationalisation programme that will inevitably take place under the new body <Col N="122" /> Teagasc.  Could the Minister assure us that the director and board of Teagasc and the personnel involved in the various organisations will have an input into the implementation of whatever rationalisation will take place in the sale of assets or in the cashing in of various resources at present under the auspices of ACOT or AFT?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to see ministerial control and responsibility in the case of boards such as this because the Minister is responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas if something wrong is done.  If a mistake is made, he can be brought before the House and the matter can be debated.  He is responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, of course, to the electorate.  Those of us who are public representatives realise the difficulties involved in dealing with bureaucrats. I suppose it would be wrong to name particular boards, but there are a number of boards we have to deal with in making representations for our constituents and it is very difficult to get any reply or acknowledgment from them, whereas if it were a Minister who had responsibility you could deal directly with him and get a reply.  It might not be the one you wanted to get but at least you would get a reply and the Minister would be able to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with the Minister having responsibility for the activities and the disposal of assets or surpluses of a subsidiary of this board.  I am sure those assets or surpluses will not be disposed of except on the recommendation of the board.  They will be disposed of after very serious consideration by the board and, if the consent of the Minister for Finance is requested, I am sure it will be forthcoming on the recommendations of the board.</P>

    <P>This amendment which follows the 1977 ACOT wording is necessary so as not to preclude the new Authority from becoming involved in diploma courses.  At present ACOT are involved in joint courses with the Waterford Regional Technical College and Thomastown VEC in horse production.  The Botanic Gardens run diploma courses on amenity horticulture and green-keeping which could be affected.

This amendment was originally put down to delete the reference which had already been deleted and is not now in the Bill, that is, the Bill as passed by the Dáil.

      <P>On section 4 as amended, in relation to an amendment which we could not move could I say that that section sets down the principal function of the new body, that is, to provide education and training in the agricultural area?  It provides for such training and advice to the industry as may be specified by the Minister.  It provides that the body must obtain and make available to agriculture nationally, scientific and practical information in so far as the state of research, knowledge and practical information is available and up to date and to promote, assist, co-ordinate and review agricultural research, education and development.  With all of this we agree. We were proposing the amendment which we could not move because we felt that section 4 (3) is too restrictive, given the bewildering change in the agri-food industry in the last decade and in the even faster kaleidoscope of changes that we can expect over the next decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend the two Senators who put this motion down. I added my name only as an afterthought. The initiative came from my colleague, Senator Norris.  While this motion has been debated before in some form or other, it is indicative of the sort of constructive suggestions which can emanate from the Seanad that such a committee should be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that such a committee should be confrontational in any way, <Col N="127" /> that it should be party political in any sense, but that it should be there simply and solely to investigate, to recommend and to guide foreign policy.  In the last analysis, it is, of course, the prerogative of the Government of the day to guide foreign policy but this sort of committee with certain teeth would be a great asset to the Seanad and to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The committee would be of some use only if it had some teeth.  We have seen too many committees of the Oireachtas set up which proved to be utterly useless in their operation because their terms of reference gave them no powers to recommend, no powers to summons witnesses. If this committee is to mean anything it should have the power to call and to question witnesses and to make recommendations on an all-party basis.</P>
    <P>It would be a great disappointment to the proposers of this motion if this committee was opposed by the Government. I can see no reason why this should be done.  It would be a sensible, consensus type committee which would help the foreign policy of this country.  One of the reasons why this committee should be set up is that the strand of thinking behind foreign policy in this country is very confused. It is very difficult to see any consistent thinking from the Department of Foreign Affairs or from any Governments in the last ten years about foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us to say that our foreign policy is one of neutrality.  It is much talked about from the rooftops that this doctrine which we preach is one which we have never properly analysed. It is a doctrine which we have inherited, it is a sacred cow, something which we spout about but do not really know what it means.  We can say that we are neutral in the very strict sense in that we do not belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  We should examine whether this means that we are neutral in more important areas.  Just not belonging to a military pact is not, to my mind, any definition of neutrality.</P>
    <P>In other areas, it is important that we <Col N="128" /> decide we are not neutral.  Are we neutral, for instance, or pretend to be neutral in the area of human rights?  It would be totally wrong were we neutral in that area.  I hope we do not believe that we are.  Why, for instance, have we not signed the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, something which has already been raised in this debate and to which I am sure the Minister will have an answer?  That answer will not be adequate because it has been produced time and time again and nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>Are we neutral on other issues?  We pick, I suggest, easy targets for our neutrality, for our ideology and for our morality.  We pick targets like South Africa about which it is very easy to preach a particularly upright morality because everybody in the western and eastern world now disapproves of the apartheid system in South Africa.  It is very easy for those who sit in this House and in the other House to condemn apartheid and take a high moral attitude. South Africa, in fact, is a safe target.</P>
    <P>I regret that this House took it on itself, in the last session, to condemn the hangings of the Sharpeville Six, which, thank God, still has not happened, while it was unable to repeal the legislation here which allows capital punishment.  This is part of the double-think which attaches to our foreign affairs attitudes.  It is easy to condemn something happening in South Africa, so we condemn it; it is not so easy to condemn something happening somewhere else so we do not condemn it.  I think particularly of Iran where we have been deafeningly silent on the atrocities which have existed there.  Why are we silent about Iran and loud about South Africa?  There is an inconsistency about that.  There is complete hypocritical neutrality about that.</P>
    <P>I suggest that our neutrality on foreign affairs policy as pronounced, is one of ambiguity and ambivalence.  It is not neutrality, it is ambivalent.  It is difficult to see a consistency in condemning violence in one place but not condemning it in another.  I should like, having spoken about Iran to say something about the <Col N="129" /> Middle East and our policy towards the Middle East.  Is it suggested by the Department of Foreign Affairs, by the Minister, that we are neutral as regards the everlasting conflicts in the Middle East?</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is a suspicion growing in certain parts of the world that we are now no longer neutral but that we are leaning towards the Arab side in that conflict.  I will back this up with one or two facts which I found very worrying in the recent past.  The bias which many seem to have detected towards the Arab side in that conflict manifests itself most obviously in our attitudes to diplomatic representation in this country.  Senator Norris will be dealing with this in his summing up speech.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask, in regard to the double-think involved, whether it is acceptable that we allow an Iranian Embassy in Dublin while refusing the Israelis the right to resident diplomatic representation?  Is this what we call neutrality? Is there any real reason behind it apart from yielding to the greatest pressure which in this case I suggest is trade? While we should retain our rightful and deep sympathy for the Palestinian refugees, we should not allow ourselves to be identified with the violence of the PLO. The confusion is very easy to make and has been made in the minds of many.</P>
    <P>I have already gone on record as condemning the recent all-party visit to the Middle East by a group of TDs and Senators because it was funded by a terrorist organisation.  Not only this, but the existence of a PLO funded information office in Dublin, while refusing Israel a similar outlet, lends weight to the suspicion that we are not neutral in this conflict.  We cannot afford to be ambivalent on violence wherever it appears.  I ask as well on the issue of Israel whether we have been loud enough in our condemnation of the refusnik situation in the Soviet Union and why we are not more closely identified with the denial of the human rights of the Jews in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>It is something which we may have written letters about but Governments <Col N="130" /> have not been happy to go openly and loudly on public record about it.  If we are to be neutral, we must not be neutral to the point of being silent on this type of issue of human rights.  Having spoken on the issue of Israel being denied an embassy in Dublin, I should like the Minister to reply and to say why we tolerate an Iranian Embassy in Dublin, why we tolerate an Ambassador and two diplomats in a large Iranian Embassy in Dublin while denying it to Israel.  It is true that we have a trading relationship with Iran which is an important one but we should not sell out our principles for the sake of trade.</P>
    <P>We have done this not only in the case of Iran but also in the case of Libya: we have, admittedly, non-resident diplomatic relations with Libya.  We have refused to cut off diplomatic relations with Libya despite frequent provocations from Colonel Gadaffi, despite its being well known that he has supplied arms to the IRA and that is undeniable at this stage. We run our diplomatic relations with Libya from Rome while we run our diplomatic relations with Israel from Athens. The irony of this is quite simple.  It is quite wrong that, diplomatically, Israel and Libya are on equal footing.  Libya has deliberately tried to subvert the State here and Israel, for whom many have words of condemnation of its behaviour &mdash; I do too &mdash; is being put on the same footing diplomatically as a country which supports the terrorists amongst us.</P>
    <P>That is ambiguity; it is inconsistency on foreign policy, but it is explained by one thing only, that is, by trade.  If that is the explanation, we can throw our principles out the window.  Trade can be king and principles and morality can be completely disposed of.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we are frightened in the case of the refusniks to offend the Soviet Union.  We are also frightened while shouting about neutrality to offend the United States.  It is understandable that we have close links with the United States for historical reasons, for the reason that we have many emigrants <Col N="131" /> there, for the reason that we have sympathy with their system.  It is understandable that, because we are a western country, because we are a Christian country and because we are a capitalist country, like it or not, we have got an affinity with the United States and we are sympathetic towards the way they operate. Nevertheless, it does not mean that we should be a slave to their foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I was very privileged to go out to visit Nicaragua on an all-party committee at the end of 1984.  I can say that my eyes were opened by that visit.  I was appalled by the fact that there was so much ignorance of what was happening in that country and that we had never once raised our voice in protest against United States policy in that country.  Despite the fact that the all-party group came back from Nicaragua and made unanimous recommendations about what was happening and despite condemnations from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and myself as an Independent about what was happening in Nicaragua, there was no response from the Government.  They continued to be silent in the face of deprivation of human rights there.  They were a Coalition Government.  I do not expect the Minister to reply on their behalf but I would be interested in what he has to say about the regime out there now.</P>
    <P>We are saying that, while we lead on neutrality in a pious way, we are not giving any lead on human rights or on morality.  While we do great work for the United Nations in Lebanon, we fail to be fair in our foreign policy towards the Middle East.  I should like to see this Government and other Governments making the neutrality which they speak about mean something much more than stating that we are not a member of NATO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all convey to Senator Norris and the other Senators the thanks of the Tánaiste for the good wishes expressed to him here last week and say that he <Col N="132" /> expects to be back in action in the near future?</P>
      <P>As the Leader of the House said when he spoke in this debate last week, the Government cannot agree to the motion. We understand the motives of the Senators who presented and spoke in support of the motion.  In fact, I agree with much that has been said about the right of Members of the Oireachtas to information on foreign policy issues and to question the Government's approach to them.  Several speakers have rightly said that foreign policy is an important area of the State's affairs.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Manning and Murphy in their contributions to the debate mentioned the desirability of allowing representatives of the people to have more power and control over and to be able to direct foreign policy.  In this connection it was said that the Constitution was intended to operate in such a way that the people would be masters.  However, we need to take great care that the mechanisms we set up in order to ensure an appropriate role for the Oireachtas in the foreign policy area do in fact contribute to the best interests of the country.</P>
      <P>Foreign policy includes in its broad scope our bilateral relations with other States, issues arising because of EC membership, our involvement in European Political Co-operation, our participation in the United Nations and in the process of East-West co-operation in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, CSCE, and in other multilateral fora, the promotion of trade and other sources of foreign earnings, co-operation with developing countries and the welfare of our citizens abroad.  Many of the issues with which Ministers for Foreign Affairs have to deal involve the reconciliation of conflicting interests.  States have not only to reconcile national interests between one another but also often to strike a balance between conflicting national interests. These situations require the exercise of political judgment in a responsible, clearheaded and balanced manner on the basis of the fullest information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such information, the stock-in-trade of <Col N="133" /> diplomatic activity, is often privileged. It includes confidential communications with other Governments, especially those of our European partners.  The flow of information to the Department of Foreign Affairs and our missions abroad would soon dry up it it found its way into the public domain, as it surely would if the motion before us were adopted and a committee were empowered &ldquo;to send for persons, papers and records&rdquo; and to publish reports and minutes of evidence taken before it &ldquo;together with such related documents as it thinks fit&rdquo;.  That obviously would be a major handicap to any Government and would be contrary to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to appoint a committee to make recommendations to each House of the Oireachtas, the quorum for meetings of which could be as low as four which, in its turn, can appoint sub-committees with a quorum as low as three.  That the terms in which major issues are posed, in important negotiations for example, could be decided by such a committee would, in my view, be undesirable inasmuch as there would be no certainty that the country's best interests would be taken into account.  Unlike individual Members of the Oireachtas, Governments cannot allow themselves to be swayed by sectional interests but must take all factors into consideration in deciding on the pursuit of foreign policy objectives.  It is in the public interest that the Government of the day be directed by broad considerations in carrying out this often sensitive task.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are answerable to the Oireachtas for the way they manage foreign policy.  It is for the Oireachtas so to arrange its business that the Government are called upon regularly to give information and to explain their positions on foreign policy matters.  I agree entirely with Senators who say that they and, through them, the public, have a right to be well-informed, to express their opinions on aspects of foreign policy and, if they think it is justified, to criticise Government and Government decisions. <Col N="134" /> That is the essence of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Issues should be fully debated in Parliament and outside it before decisions are taken.  In a free and open society Governments have to take account of all significant shades of political opinion. This Government certainly do so.  But what we cannot do is to change the established mechanisms in an ill-considered manner at the risk of prejudicing the national interest by opening the way to the adoption of positions based on partial considerations and to the publication of foreign policy documents and papers at the behest of as few as three Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas have many opportunities to review policy.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have a wide remit and their reports are debated. There is justification for such a committee because of the need to examine draft Community legislation before it is given statutory effect in this State.  Then there are regular occurrences, such as the annual debate on the Estimates.  The presentation of six-monthly reports on developments in the European Communities and, two or three times a year, of reports on meetings of the European Council.  Finally, there are Dáil questions.</P>
    <P>With increasing frequency, foreign policy issues are raised in both Houses, either in the form of special motions, for example the debate on the situation in Ethiopia which we had here on 25 May, or on the Adjournment, like the debate in the Dáil on 26 May about the territories occupied by Israel.  The fact that we are debating this motion shows that Members of this House are able to raise foreign policy matters of interest to them without great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the comments made on particular issues during this debate.  Our policy of neutrality was raised by Senators Norris, Murphy, Manning and Ross.  We had a very thorough national debate on that policy in the course of the referendum campaign on ratification of the Single <Col N="135" /> European Act last year.  The vast majority of our people and, I dare say, of Members of this House, support that policy.  We are not a member of a military alliance.  Defence and military aspects of security are not part of the European Political Co-operation process and we are not &ldquo;fooling ourselves&rdquo;, in Senator Manning's words, when we ensure that this position is maintained.</P>
    <P>We have a position in international affairs which we value and our non-involvement in a military alliance is part of that position.  It enables us to take a well-defined position on the international arms race and to set firmly as objectives for the international community as a whole, general and complete disarmament and total abolition of nuclear weapons.  The strength of the Government's conviction of the rightness of this approach was manifested by the Taoiseach at the Third Special Session on Disarmament of the UN General Assembly in New York last week.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris and Senator Ross referred to Government policy on South Africa.  The long-standing strong opposition to apartheid of successive Irish Governments is a matter of public record.  This country has an established and principled policy of minimal contact with South Africa.  We have no diplomatic relations, no offficial cultural or sporting links and give no governmental assistance for trade with that country. Cultural or sporting organisations having links with or events receiving participants representing South Africa lose official grants and subventions.  We adhere fully to the UN embargo on arms exports to South Africa and to the measures being applied by all the EC members states. We continue to press our partners in the Twelve to adopt further restrictive measures, such as a ban on coal or fruit and vegetable imports from South Africa.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to Senator Norris' contribution when he spoke of the need for foreign policy to undertake, inform and to consult the other member states on foreign policy matters of general interest, not just a common interest, to ensure <Col N="136" /> that the combined influences of the State are exercised as effectively as possible through the co-ordination and convergence of their position.  We do that a lot in the European Community and that is one of the reasons why we will continue to press our Community partners to take more effective sanctions on South Africa.</P>
    <P>Certain countries have recently adopted stronger measures while Ireland remains among those few with the strongest anti-apartheid polices.  Our policy of seeking graduated selective mandatory sanctions in no way implies that we favour &ldquo;A type of creeping sanction&rdquo; as Senator Ross said.  We consider that only measures fully and universally applied can bring the desired pressure to bear on South Africa and are convinced that the best hope of achieving this is through graduated sanctions.  Whatever the motives which may have led the previous Government to introduce a ban on the import of fruit and vegetables, Fianna Fáil fully supported it and since coming into office we have urged our partners in the Twelve to adopt a similar measure.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Senator Norris and Senator Ross was our position with regard to international human rights instruments.  The Government are committed to the earliest possible ratification of the United Nations Covenants, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  In accordance with the practice of successive Governments of ensuring that our domestic legislation is in conformity with international instruments prior to ratification, a careful examination of our domestic legislation in the areas concerned, carried out by a committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney General, has now been completed. I am hopeful that it will be possible within a reasonably short period to bring forward the necessary legislation, including legislation on the advocacy of racial hatred, which will enable the ratification of the two United Nations covenants to proceed.  Legislation on the advocacy of racial hatred will also facilitate the process of ratification of the <Col N="137" /> International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which Ireland has signed but not ratified, pending completion of a detailed scrutiny of the legislative and other implications of ratifiation which is at present under way.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning suggested that pressure should be brought on the Government to do more for emigrants.  I would refer him to the very full debate on the matter which took place in this House one month ago.  He suggested that perhaps a foreign policy committee would be of considerable assistance.  I remain to be convinced that such a committee would serve any useful purpose.  Far more compelling will be the actions taken by the Taoiseach and the Government since coming to office which were fully debated here some time ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy in the course of his contribution said foreign policy is really how other people see us, the face we present to them and the way we behave in the community of nations.  That is indeed a very crucial part of our behaviour. I agree with what Senator Murphy said.  I do not honestly think that the formation of a committee would improve in any way how other people see us.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also said that decisions on the international sphere are taken without the knowledge of the people and outside their power.  He said the whole point of the motion as he put his name to it is to make foreign policy representative, responsible and a matter of popular control.  I again cannot see how a foreign policy committee, three members of which would have the right to make suggestions to Government, could possibly put foreign policy into control of the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning said that it is an appalling comment that he and his colleagues should have to ask from the Government as a favour what should be an established right in this House.  He said that what they are asking for is no more and no less than that this House and all parts of this House should have the right to scrutinise our foreign policy <Col N="138" /> on a regular basis and in detailed discussion, with full access to the information to review our foreign policy.  I agree with most of what Senator Manning said except that the problem I mentioned earlier of full access to information could have a serious and detrimental effect on the information that is received in confidence from other Governments.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning and Senator Robb spoke about the Leader of the House reflecting the Fianna Fáil role attitude to parliamentary reform, parliamentary committees and the whole question of a vigorous participation by all members of the party in both Houses.  The Dáil committee system and the Oireachtas committee system are still in operation.  There are approximately five joint committees, two Seanad Committees, three Dáil committees and one Dáil special committee. As one who served on a number of committees, I often found myuself having to wait until such time as a quorum could be got together so that the work of the committee could go on.  I would prefer to see a committee working properly rather than the way the committees were set up during the last Dáil.  Senator Manning also said the last experiment was not fully successful.  I agree wholeheartedly with him.</P>
    <P>We had a disagreement between Senator Manning and Senator Norris in relation to the motion.  Senator Manning felt that the committee which was in operation in the last Oireachtas should still be constituted rather than having it part and parcel of the foreign affairs committee as suggested by Senator Norris in his motion.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the comments made by Senators on the Irish diplomatic service.  Senator Manning stated:</P>
    <P>They are probably among the best in the world.  Our Department of Foreign Affairs for its size and resources is superb.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate that and say that I am glad that, despite the very trenchant views expressed by many Senators, throughout all of them came a recognition of the enormous and tremendous <Col N="139" /> job being done by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not see how international trade could be helped by the participation of a parlimanetary committee.  I disagree totally with Senator Manning in that regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the motion for the reasons I have stated.  I am a little surprised by Senator Ross's contribution, because, according to him, we are afraid of the United States, we are afraid of the Soviet Union and he almost has us as quiet as church mice.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government believe that the existing arrangements for the review of foreign policy by the Oireachtas are satisfactory.  I have outlined the many opportunities that are open to Members to raise matters of concern or interest to them.  We are, therefore, opposed to the motion for the reason that I have given essentially that the national interest could be served by such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this motion has been put down and I commend the Senators for their commitment in bringing it before the House. The motion is important in parliamentary terms and deserves the support of all.  I believed initially that it would have all-party support.  I regret that that now seems not to be the case.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan in his contribution was obviously not in accord with the motion and indeed has inferred many times in the recent past that Senators should be doing more with their time than discussing this motion.  I regret this, as it smacks a bit of the mé féin concept.  Do we not need to look abroad or be concerned about our foreign policy?  Can we say that as parliamentarians we are sufficiently informed and aware of important issues in the international arena?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was indeed a good day when the system of joint committees was agreed and set up in, I think, 1983.  It was part of overall Dáil and Seanad reform.  In the time the committees have been working they have exceeded the expectation of those who initiated them.  I could not <Col N="140" /> agree with the Minister in his comments about the committees.  Sometimes, of course, there is difficulty in getting everybody together at the same time to start the work of the committee.  Taking an overview, the work of almost all the committees has been commendable and very worthwhile.  Committee work for backbenchers makes it possible to influence policy-making and to examine and research rationally issues relating to specific sectors in a climate of agreement and co-operation.</P>
    <P>For my part since I became a Senator I have been a member of the All-Party Committee on Women's Rights and I have had great insights into issues of importance to women and the family through work on that committee.  It has been concentrated work and it is notable that in committee debate the concern is specifically with issues and disagreement based on party position is very rare.</P>
    <P>There are very good reasons why we should bring questions of foreign policy into such a tolerant environment.  We need a forum where we can discuss issues and influence decisions.  The motion is broad and suggests structures for a diverse range of foreign affairs issues.  It does not concentrate on what could be called the sensitive zones.  All six paragraphs of the motion are relevant.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer first to subparagraph (ii) dealing with the special relationship of Ireland with countries in the developing world.  We had a committee for development aid in the last Oireachtas, chaired by former Deputy Nora Owen.  It created a level of consciousness and informed public opinion in a way that we have not seen previously. It very largely took responsibility for monitoring our contributions to the developing countries.  Ideally, as Senator Manning said in his contribution, there should again be a separate committee for development aid.  But the matter should have a niche in our parliamentary work anyway.</P>
    <P>The developing countries were well served in the last administration, having as well as a committee a Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who did splendid <Col N="141" /> work during his time in office keeping in contact with Irish-funded projects abroad and being an important advocate for development workers here, as well as playing a very positive and energetic role in the area of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The cuts in development aid are serious and very damaging.  I would like to read an open letter which was written to the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, by four Church leaders.  They appealed to him to think again about the cut of 26 per cent proposed in the official development assistance programme.  The letter is signed by Archbishop Eames, Dr. Fleming, Mr. Hamilton, president of the Methodist Church in Ireland and Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiach.</P>
    <P>It states:</P>
    <P>Therefore, as Church leaders and as heads of our respective development agencies, we note with dismay the Government's recent decision to implement very substantial cuts in Irish Official Development Assistance. While we all recognise the need for overall cuts in Government expenditure, we nonetheless believe that these cuts should not affect the weakest in the community.  These cuts are particularly dismaying given the time at which they are occurring, when disturbing reports of impending hunger continue to reach us, and particularly because Irish discretionary aid is directed towards the poorest of the world's poor.</P>
    <P>The chairperson of APSO, David Rowe, had this to say in their annual report for 1986:</P>
    <P>The unpredictability of the resources with which we have to work continues, and has its effect on the quality of work as well as the numbers funded and trained.  In addition, the economic situation at home and the increasing constraints in the public sector made for fewer enquiries and completed offers of service.  The outlook for 1988 seems more threatening still.  One can only say that if bilateral assistance were to be very substantially cut back or even <Col N="142" /> abandoned, Ireland would forfeit a position of leadership amongst developed countries in this important area of modern foreign policy, and a hard-won range of sound projects in many developing countries would be endangered.</P>
    <P>In truth one can reflect on what David Rowe has said.  We have in recent years built up quite a reputation for being generous, caring and concerned for those striving with very extreme poverty in the Third World and it is regrettable that the cutbacks have been so severe.</P>
    <P>Some time ago in the Seanad we had a very emotional debate on the Sharpeville Six.  This is another area which would be of interest to a foreign affairs committee. At a time of great crisis the voices of condemnation and appeal which were world wide had an effect and averted the execution of the six condemned men. A foreign affairs committee would have maximised our effect in an area like this.</P>
    <P>In this context we surely need a committee to monitor Ireland's role in the UN.  I think this is another area that is overlooked.  We are involved in debates and voting on an on-going basis in different sectors in the UN, but nobody knows what we do or say or how we vote.  Our UN involvement gets no priority whatsoever. This matter is clearly documented in a survey by Brigid Laffan of our Government's policy in the eighties in the UN which calls for a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>Another area that concerns me is our obligation in developing legislation which is required under our ratification of UN conventions.  I refer specifically to the UN declaration on the ratification of a convention against all forms of discrimination against women.  This was ratified here in 1985, long after ratification by other countries.  It was only done because of the focus of attention on women's year in 1985.  There were a number of exceptions in our ratification and at that time we gave a commitment to initiate legislation in relation to a couple of important articles in that convention. One of them requires us to bring <Col N="143" /> in legislation to give equal treatment to men and women.  This has not been done and I am concerned that there seems to be no focus of attention and no interest. If the Minister has any information on this he might give it to me in his reply or at the end of the debate.</P>
    <P>These are important matters.  I cannot agree with the Minister that there is no need for a central committee to deal with issues of foreign affairs.  He referred to the various Departments which would have a role in discussing and analysing specific issues relating to trade or Third World development.  There is very clear evidence that we need a committee which can inform us as politicians and create an awareness and an understanding publicly. I appeal to him again to give consideration to this motion and enable one more committee which would be positive and effective to be set up in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to the debate tonight and compliment him on the actions he has taken since assuming office.  I have heard quite a lot of excellent reports of the quiet diplomatic way in which he has approached a very sensitive position in the area of foreign affairs.  It is always refreshing to be able to talk to him on a person to person basis in matters relating to foreign affairs, particularly the Middle East in which I have a special interest.  I am very concerned about the funding of UNRA, the agency which deals with the Palestinian problem, which is under threat following the uprising of the ordinary people in Palestine.  I have found the Minister open and frank in listening to the problems of those people and his Department have in the past been extremely generous.  Due to cutbacks in recent years this funding is under threat and I have asked the Minister particularly to look at it.  I hope he will respond in a positive way to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are taking an unusually conservative attitude to the request from the signatories of this motion for <Col N="144" /> the formation of an all-party policy committee on foreign policy.  The concern that the Government might have is not justified.  Any Oireachtas joint committee would naturally have a Government majority on it because all these committees are formed having due regard to the representation of the Government party in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any policy-forming committee would in the normal course of events, if members turn up at the meetings, have a majority of Government supporters. The Minister expressed concern about the difficulties, and I have experienced some of those difficulties myself in subcommittees of the House.  It is not always easy to get a quorum.</P>
    <P>This whole area of foreign policy is one which does influence Irish Members of the Oireachtas.  We are a very small neutral nation, but a very powerful one when it comes to expressing views that are not normally accepted by the aligned states. That is why our role at the United Nations has been such an important one.  We are speaking from a position of weakness as regards armaments, but we are speaking from a position of strength because we are non-aligned to the superpowers and have a stance of our own on neutrality. We also have tremendous influence with other countries in the developing world, the Middle East, the Third World and Central America.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are totally supportive of this concept of an all-party committee on foreign policy.  We as a party have over a numbr of years produced policy documents covering the whole area of foreign policy.  I have had an opportunity to discuss these policies with the Leader of the House on numerous occasions.  Even when he was the Leader of the Opposition when another Government were in power he expressed the positive view that he was in favour of the concept of an all-party Oireachtas committee.  On the basis of his international standing particularly with regard to the Middle East, he is aware that we are one of the few democratic nations which does not have an all-party foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Any Government which does not tap into the resources of independent views and views from other political parties within the country is losing out on an opportunity to help formulate foreign policy. This committee would not of course, dictate to the Government at any time with regard to what it should do in the area of confidential consultations with other Governments in the national interest or in international politics.  Certainly any Government could benefit from the expertise and the interest among Members on both sides of the Oireachtas who have an interest in the affairs of the world around them, whether in South Africa, the Middle East, Nicaragua, Central America or in other areas.</P>
    <P>That is why our party in particular have developed over the years policy documents which involve all these areas.  We have a document on Ireland as a neutral nation, a policy document on disarmament, a policy document on human rights, a policy document on international development and co-operation, a document on the European Community, on European political co-operation, on eastern Europe, on the Middle East, on South Africa and on Latin America.  We have debated these at administrative council level, at parliamentary party level and at annual conference level.  All these documents, which we are prepared to stand over, are published and are available as a help and an insight to any Government who might want to have a considered opinion on our stance in any of these areas.</P>
    <P>We do that from a position of strength because the Labour Party are associated with and part of the Socialist group in the European Community, which is the biggest and most influential group.  We are also associated with the Socialist International which has the only political ideology that can command membership from most of the democratic countries throughout the world.  I am talking about real socialists.  I am not talking about eastern bloc socialists who can only command support through their own dictatorships. I am talking about social democratic parties which are part of the <Col N="146" /> Socialist International.  As such, we have addressed all these issues and, in consultation with our colleagues, we have ensured that our view is expressed vehemently and vociferously at all the forums in which the Labour Party participate. Through the European Community we ensured that in the manifesto published by the socialists contesting European elections, Ireland's neutrality not alone was respected but was written down as part of a grand charter for any socialists who might take part in the European Community and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>We have set up a specific policy committee to deal with these matters through an international affairs committee which reports on a monthly basis to us.  There are everyday occurrences to which this Government is expected to respond diplomatically and at various meetings throughout Europe, at the United Nations, and, indeed, at other conventions whether in Geneva or elsewhere. We would like to have an input and to say how we feel something should be done.  Admittedly, the Government of the day could reject our views out of hand but at least there is a consensus on what all of us stand for in this area which no Government should disregard when they are looking for expertise.  That is the commitment of my party to the Government in the area of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Government should not be concerned about whether they have a majority because that will be built incidentally into it.  The process of dialogue between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government in the area of foreign policy is essential if we are to continue to command the international respect all of us have managed to achieve. This Government at the United Nations and in other arenas have followed the line of the consensus in politics in this area.  The Government should welcome this opportunity to have a basis for dialogue between us.  I see nothing wrong with it.  It is part of the democratic process that all parties who represent various constituents should have an input into helping <Col N="147" /> Government not to dictate policy but to formulate it.</P>
    <P>One can argue as to how the numbers from the Oireachtas should be made up but, in spite of what the Minister and the Leader of the House have said, they should accept this principle of an all-party committee.  We would like to participate at that level and would contribute constructively to it as a result of our long experience in the whole field of international affairs.  We have contacts throughout the world and we would be prepared to make these available to the Government at that level.  This is a gesture of goodwill in the area of foreign policy.  On the basis of previous statements made from all sides of the House, in and out of Government, there should be a welcome in principle for the motion moved by our colleagues in the Independent group.  It is fairly specific in that there are a lot of areas that need to be covered.</P>
    <P>These are all subject to argument or agreement by the Government because if this resolution is accepted a similar resolution, or a newly worded one by the Government, will have to pass through the other House of the Oireachtas.  This House would then discuss the actual motion setting up the procedure.  This is not a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who have no function in this area.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas and we as Members of one House of the Oireachtas call on the Government seriously to consider the cogent reasons for agreeing to this fundamental policy committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with our contribution to the Third World about which the previous speaker has spoken.  There has been condemnation of the level of contribution we have made to the Third World and of the percentage of GNP it represents. There is a never-ending demand and when this is related to restriction by the Department of Finance, it makes the Minister's task almost impossible.  The Minister could have already discussed these matters with an all-party <Col N="148" /> Oireachtas committee and in some way he would have had a consensus on what is required in this whole area of foreign policy in international affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to keep the House too long.  The speakers have confined themselves quite well.  I am a little disappointed to hear the Minister say that the Government would not be interested in hearing the views or recommendations of such a committee.</P>
      <P>First, we are a member of the EC. The EC has been quite rightly called the lifeblood of apartheid.  That is due to the fact that over half of the foreign investment in South Africa comes from EC countries, the EC takes nearly half of the South African exports and provides a similar proportion of imports.</P>
      <P>A committee would be in a neutral position in the sense that it would be able to examine our attitude to the South African Government in a more effective and detached way than the Government. The Government are locked into the EC position.  The comments, report and recommendations of a committee such as this would be a very effective way to deal with the question of attitudes towards South Africa.  The motion speaks about the human factor.  For example, the standards laid down by the EC for European firms operating in South Africa under the title &ldquo;Code of Conduct&rdquo; seem to us in the Labour Party to be irrelevant. Neither the EC Commission nor the European Parliament have any means of enforcing the code and there are no penalties for violating it.  Despite all the claims made to the contrary, the code never attempted to make any inroads into the apartheid system, let alone undermine it from within.  This is a problem since Ireland is a member of the EC and the Government must be circumspect in many ways.  The views of an all-party committee could be more detailed and more detached and would support the Government.  I think the Government's hands are tied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US Congress went overboard on their focus on South Africa.  They did this through the media.  In fact, they went so <Col N="149" /> far that in 1985 Senator Edward Kennedy visited South Africa and Bishop Tutu made a well-publicised visit to Washington. Generally speaking, there was a good interchange and much was done. The House of Representatives voted in support of a Bill on 15 June calling for immediate economic sanctions against South Africa.  The Republican Party, who tried to water it down, were beaten on the vote.</P>
    <P>The EC had asked that there be no investment in South Africa.  This Bill also called for a ban on bank loans to and investment in South Africa.  It forbids the sale of computers, nuclear fuel and technology to South Africa.  It bans the import of gold krugerrands to the United States.  There has been some slippage on this and the measures in that Bill have not really come into effect.  This Bill was dealt with by Congress, with no actual recommendations from any unbiased source.  There is a vested interest when one country is dealing with another.  If it has broad support, that vested interest can be looked after in a much better way. An all-party committee would carry out a much more extensive examination and would have the opportunity of consulting with more people.  Therefore, a better attitude would emerge from it.  We are talking not only of the human factor but also of trading with South Africa and the best way to effect the sanctions.</P>
    <P>We have soldiers in service with UNIFIL.  We should be in a position to make effective observations on the strategic interests in the Middle East.  We should be able to talk to our friends in America &mdash; because of their traditional links with Israel &mdash; about our attitudes towards the Palestinian people and Lebanon.  We should be more influential. I think that influence would need to come from an all-party foreign policy committee. After all, we supply troops to UNIFIL and whereas the Americans are not a member of UNIFIL they contribute substantially to it.  That is another area we can think about.  There are five or six different factions in Lebanon.  That needs more detailed consideration and takes time, time which a busy Government who <Col N="150" /> have a lot to handle cannot afford.  We must question our attitude, question what our policy should be and the type of pressures we can use on our friends, the Americans, in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>There are many external factors affecting Lebanon, not only the presence of Israelis but also of the Syrians.  Again, we are dealing with a very complex situation which could be investigated better by a committee which would make reports and recommendations.  For example, in Lebanon there are groups such as the Maronites, the Orthodox, the Moslems, the Druze and the Shíites &mdash; a whole mixum-gatherum.  The foreign policy committee, which would deal with the economic and the human factors, could study the situation in a more detailed and effective way and produce a report with recommendations.  The Government would then be in the best possible position in that they would not be bound by the recommendations of the report but they could get the valued thinking of this committee, who would have the power to call in people to provide them with information, etc.</P>
    <P>There are many local conflicts in Central America.  Our Government send out delegations from time to time.  Each delegation comes back with their perception of what went on, depending on whether they are in Opposition or in Government &mdash; it is like looking at an accident, you form your own perception of it.  This needs more than a short visit by a delegation. The committee should have the power to send for people, even, say, resident Nicaraguans representing the consul, in order to get a broader spectrum of views.  The same applies to Guatemala and El Salvador.  There is no decline in the number of murders and disappearances in El Salvador.  Human rights in that country continue to be a problem of international concern.  While the situation is kept under review by the United Nations it would be nice to know that a neutral country such as Ireland could make a much more lively contribution to a debate on foreign affairs. Somebody standing up here in general debate and using the safety of generality <Col N="151" /> would make a very broad contribution; however a committee could investigate the problem, which would be dealt with in a report, and make recommendations. As I have said the Government are not bound by the report, but I am sorry to say that they are not in a position to accept this motion.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we are a neutral nation.  I have certain views about neutrality which I have expressed in this House, but I will not go into detail on them.  I have always maintained that the more one gets from people, the more one owes then and the more obligated one is to them.  Therefore, neutrality is a dangerous line to go down, because I believe that we go a little overboard on it and I doubt if we will be able to argue our neutrality for more than another decade or so before we are roped in to some sort of position.  However, while we have influence, which was used very effectively in the United Nations at an earlier stage by Frank Aiken, our efforts could be much more effective in promoting peace and reconciliation if we set up a joint committee.  We could get to know more about Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and so on by having an investigative attitude on such a committee.</P>
    <P>We are not involved in the conflict between Iran and Iraq which has been going on since 1980, but nevertheless there are many sides to the story.  We know that the United States are on poor terms with Iran.  It may be possible that we might be a little more effective than we are at present.  We are strictly neutral in this conflict.  We have regularly stated our desire to see a ceasefire and that both countries would withdraw to recognised frontiers etc.  We want to be friends with both belligerents.  If we set up this foreign affairs committee we can get much more information about the situation and, again, make a better contribution towards being friends with both belligerants. We could, through a foreign affairs committee, play a bigger role than at present as we will be contributing to the role of Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> We go to conferences, for example, on security and co-operation bringing our own thinking to the table.  Our delegations are not very well equipped.  We would be better equipped if we had heard a report on a recommendation debated in the Seanad or the Dáil.  We would be much more effectively armed to make a contribution to the question of security and co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>The question of extradition might have been more fully understood and might have been approached in a better way if we had had a foreign policy committee. Again, we could have used the influence of our international friends to have examined the very important area of discrimination in the North, which we talk so very much about, but never have been able to do anything effective about. Although the Anglo-Irish Agreement is working in that direction, a foreign affairs committee could, I think, be an influence on Britain.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised that the Government, who have been very receptive to many suggestions, will not accept this one, which I think would serve them to good purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his courteous speech, although I did find it a little thin on content.  I would like particularly to deplore the apparent absence of any serious contribution whatever from the Government benches in the debate.  I cannot possibly take what the Leader of the House said with any seriousness because I have actually read the debate of less than 18 months ago in which he made it perfectly clear that he vigorously supported the establishment of a foreign policy committee.  This makes the whole debate a little ludicrous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, but this is the most spectacular somersault.  There are U-turns: but to do a kind of loop-the-loop, <Col N="153" /> as the impressive Senator did last week, is really quite startling.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a special role in foreign affairs because she is virtually unique among European countries in having had the experience of being a colony, a situation that lasted well into the present century.  This is a very important point because so many of the emerging nations of the world have experienced the colonial situation, particularly the neutral and non-aligned countries with which we would find our own natural allies.  I believe that Ireland can operate as a bridge between various power blocks, particularly linking in with the non-aligned countries, who recognise our very special position by virtue of our history. In addition, this country has, I am glad to say, established an honourable tradition in terms of the peacekeeping force which we have maintained throughout the world.  We have also got the proud record of never having been involved in international military conflicts, and this is something that I applaud and I hope will continue.</P>
      <P>As was made abundantly clear during this important debate on foreign policy, all shades of political opinion rightly place a special emphasis upon neutrality. These circumstances place Ireland in a position where, by virtue of moral rather than military authority, a very important influence can be exercised, particularly, among other neutral and non-aligned states.  I am convinced that this influence would be maximised by the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised, as I have said already, at the tone adopted by the Leader of the House in his speech last week.  U-turns have become something of a commonplace in Irish political life, and it is a regrettable fact that violent alterations of policy frequently occur when a political party make the transition from Opposition to Government.  But Senator Lanigan's somersault on the issue of foreign affairs was so spectacular that it deserves comment.  I sincerely hope that the Government's position on this important matter has been clarified <Col N="154" /> since last week and that they will be able to support moves towards the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs with the same enthusiasm and vigour that they displayed in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is virtually nobody here on the Government side, and this has characterised the entire debate.  Very few people were prepared to speak. However, I have spoken privately to a number of people in Fianna Fáil and I know perfectly well that they are in favour of this committee and that there is a majority on the Government benches who are in support of a foreign policy committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding having spoken privately to people.  They are good boys.  They do not have the luxury of independence and they have been nicely whipped into place.  The Government's nervousness and the extraordinary territoriality of the Department of Foreign Affairs are quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that I have never used a whip in my life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister would be above that kind of procedure but I have no doubt that whips are around the place from time to time.  I cannot understand, for example, the argument advanced by the Minister where he says that the stock-in-trade of diplomatic activity is often privilege.  Of course it is.  We all accept and understand that. The Minister said that it includes confidential communications with other Governments especially those of our European partners, that the flow of information to the Department of Foreign Affairs and our missions abroad would soon dry up if it found its way into the public domain, as it surely would if the motion before us were adopted and the committee were empowered to send for <Col N="155" /> persons, papers and records and to publish reports of minutes of evidence taken before it, and so on.</P>
      <P>With the greatest respect, that is nonsense. Every other country in Europe has such a committee and the flow of information to their foreign affairs departments has not shown any sign of drying up.  What is so special about Leinster House?  What is so special about the conduct of foreign affairs in this country by this Government that makes it unique in Europe?  Why should we be so extraordinarily nervous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some ways in which it is not always an advantage to be unique and it is not an advantage to be uniquely nervous and paranoid particularly in foreign affairs where one should have maturity and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be reassured by the Minister on that matter.  I want to make one point with regard to this notion of confidentiality.  I should say that in introducing the motion I made it perfectly clear that it was worded in such a way that, unlike most of the other European foreign affairs committees, we do not have the power to subponea.  We can send for the Minister but he does not have to turn up.  I know that the Minister would, of course, be so courteous as to make himself available but that has not always been the practice of all Ministers. I indicated last week that this was weaker than I would like but it is specifically worded in such a way as to cater for the nervousness of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up another very important point which emerged during the debate last week which I believe calls for very serious concern.  This is the statement by Senator John Robb that, under a previous Government, at least two attempts were made by senior civil servants in the Department of Foreign <Col N="156" /> Affairs to persuade him to remove from the Order Paper items which, in their wisdom, the servants of the State had decided were too controversial or too prejudicial to the interests of international relations to have debated in the Irish Parliament.  I regard this as a most dangerous, unwarranted and controversial intervention in the democratic process of the State and I look for an assurance from the Minister that such events will not be allowed to occur in the future.  It is essential that the independence and freedom of debate should be maintained in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did Senator Robb actually say that.  The Senator should check the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very happy to do that.  I have it here with me and on the record it was stated quite clearly by Senator Robb that he was in fact contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and asked to remove items from the Order Paper.  As reported at column 1795 of the Official Report of 1 June 1988 he said:</P>
      <P>I was telephoned, however, to suggest that I should take that motion off the Order Paper.  Similarly I had a motion down dealing with the need for Ireland to ratify the UN Covenants on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>He was also contacted about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>By whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to read the whole debate, but Senator Robb made it perfectly clear that he was telephoned by civil servants.  I am quite sure that, were he here, he would substantiate that.  It is something that I believe in all fairness the Minister should look into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my introduction of the motion last week I attempted to outline certain principles which I felt should govern the conduct of foreign policy and instanced certain specific examples.  In elaborating <Col N="157" /> this theme I would like to press the Minister with regard to the extraordinary fact that, despite the presence here of certain controversial diplomatic missions, such as the representatives of the Iranian regime, the State of Israel has still not been allowed to establish a permanent diplomatic presence in Dublin in clear violation of the terms of the Vienna Convention. Once more this delicate matter is a good example of an area in which the operation of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs would help the smooth functioning of the State.</P>
    <P>I say this with particular emphasis because the Middle East is an area of the world which I know very well.  I regard myself as a friend of the State of Israel which is a democratic country, but I have great reservations about what is going on there at the moment.  I would like to be placed in a position where I could make informed and trenchant criticism of certain developments in Israel but I am absolutely loath and reluctant to do so as long as the representative of the Israeli Government is fighting here with his hands tied behind his back.  Like most Irish people I believe in the principle of fair play.  I would like the Minister to consider commenting on this issue, although I regard it as a matter of some delicacy.  As I said, the Iranian Embassy is here and there is no reciprocity involved there so the argument about expense in terms of opening an embassy in Tel Aviv is quite redundant.</P>
    <P>In addition to that I know that arguments are sometimes made that we nearly opened up the situation and then the position became more difficult because of military and other developments.  I put it to the Minister that it is precisely during these kinds of periods of difficulty that a channel of communication is most valuable. I am optimistic that this debate will lead to the establishment of the committee that we recommended.  We shall be calling for a vote on the matter this evening.</P>
    <P>However, should the Government equivocate in the matter and force a defeat of the motion, it is the intention of the Independent group to establish an <Col N="158" /><i>ad hoc</i> committee on foreign affairs, the membership of which will initially be open to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and representatives of all the political groupings will be invited to participate in its proceedings.  It is hoped that the establishment of such a group, which all parties have welcomed in the past will, even if it is unofficial to begin with, lead to the proper establishment of a permanent official and authoritative committee.</P>
    <P>I understand that I may have a little bit of injury time because the Minister did helpfully intervene.  I would like to refer to a few issues that I raised last week and develop them slightly.  The first is the question of Ireland's bilateral aid.  I would like to quote the Minister because he not only speaks but writes very well and I would like to applaud the sentiments the Minister of State expressed during the course of last year when he said that the Government consider development co-operation with the countries of the Third World to be an important aspect of our foreign policy.  He went on to say that Irish people are, on average, at least ten times better off than people in the four priority countries for the Irish bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister in the context of those remarks: why is it that the cutback in overseas aid for 1988 will take us back to 1981-82, in comparative terms?  I would like to ask why it is that we are continually cutting back in this area, that aid is cut by £11 million and that the marvellous contribution of the Irish people through Bob Geldof's Live Aid is just simply wiped out with the stroke of a pen, and this all during a period when the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs has actually gone up by 3 per cent.  Our development aid and our commitment to people to whom we should have an obligation, because of our experience of the Famine in the last century, has actually been cut back.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again also to the question of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge and to ask the Government if they will not consider giving some significant aid to the suffering people of Kampuchea.  I <Col N="159" /> would remind the Minister that the Department of Foreign Affairs refused to meet a delegation from Kampuchea on the grounds that it was an illegal regime, despite the fact that the European Commission received them.  Apparently, we are whiter than even the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two final points. The kind of area that I would very much welcome the Minister allowing to be opened up through an Oireachtas Joint Committee is, for example, the growing and much welcomed perestroika and glasnost in Russia.  I believe we have a <Col N="160" /> very honourable tradition.  I would like to see this Government &mdash; I would ask the Minister to take this suggestion to the Cabinet &mdash; conferring the benefit of honourary citizenship of Ireland on the most courageous and wonderful man of the 20th century &mdash; Raoul Wallenberg who is probably still alive, probably in a Soviet jail.  I believe the only people who can to help liberate him are a neutral Government and the courageous and determined Mr. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.  I hope he may manage to persuade the Government to open up this area.</P>

      <P>Prior to reporting progress I was speaking about section 4 (3). We said that this subsection was too restricted, given all the bewildering changes in the agri-food industry over the last ten years and that one can expect a more rapid rate of change over the next ten years.  Who can say where the CAP will be within the coming decade?  Many feel that it will be gone and possibly replaced <Col N="161" /> by aids and transfers to the agricultural industry from the Structural Fund.  The integrated rural development fund is to be the new frontier, or so we are told. This will mean a completely new approach to sustaining agriculture based more on degrees of disadvantage and, on the other hand, market demands and trends.</P>
      <P>The greater part of the problem with agriculture in Europe and perhaps worldwide is the ignoring of the economic rules of comparative advantage or the economic principle of comparative advantage.  That has to change.  As far as Ireland is concerned, we will be compelled to make more appropriate use of the land we have.  What I mean by that is that we must have cereals where there should be cereals, milk production where there should be milk production and trees where the land used should be forestry. In future years, I feel sure we will have need for a land classification policy, a new classification programme for our farmers by enterprise, by size of farm and a whole new market analysis.  All of this will be necessary under the changes as we shift from the agricultural fund and the Common Agricultural Policy to the Structural Fund.  We were hoping that the Minister might broaden the scope under subsection (3) of section 4 by allowing a greater degree of consultation on policy formulation with ACOT prior to the making of any policy decisions.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3) of section 4 the actual wording is:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) and (2) Teagasc shall, in performing its functions, have particular regard to the need for and the importance of agricultural training and education for young persons and research and development in relation to food processing and the food processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is extraordinary terminology to use, because when you talk about young people it really is a type of aspiration rather than something that should be included in statutory legislation.  It is <Col N="162" /> aspirational and something that we would all agree with.  We would all agree with the aspiration that we should attach importance to the training and education of young people but it is rather extraordinary language for a parliamentary draftsman to use.  I will expect, at the end of the year, to see a kind of reporting procedure or an annual programme that might be presented by the board as being one of the objectives that they aspired to or had achieved.  Certainly this is unusual and the Minister might like to clarify it. This point was made in the other House also and I want clarification in this House as to what exactly we are talking about by using that terminology.</P>

      <P>The specific references in this section to the training of young farmers and to research in relation to food processing and the food processing industry is really to reflect the importance which the Government place on these areas.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, the Government in their strategy for national recovery have clearly identified the food industry as being an area with considerable potential for development.  Many a time in this House and indeed, in the other House, the shortcomings of the underdevelopment of the food industry have been touched on.  There is scope in section 13 for Teagasc to put forward in their annual programme of activities any such matters that they decide should be given special attention.  In present circumstances the amendment proposed here is not necessary.</P>

      <P>We are not happy that the provisions under this section are wide enough for future policies.  The point we have been trying to convey is that over the next ten years there will be bewildering changes in the whole area of agriculture and policy changes will have to be in line with the changes outside and the changes that are taking place in the marketplace, etc.  We are asking the Minister to add on &ldquo;and any further matters as may be decided, with the consent <Col N="163" /> of the Minister&rdquo;.  This relates to policy-making, etc.  We find that the section, as in the Bill now, is good for this time but we feel it is not good enough for the future, given the kind of change that we must expect, looking at the experience of the last decade.</P>
      <P>Who, for instance, is going to carry out the major surveys and major background work that will be needed if we are to move from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Agricultural Fund to aids and transfers under the Structural Fund? I said that possibly we would need a whole new land classification programme. We will possibly need a whole new programme for classifying farmers. We will probably have to classify the whole country in terms of comparative advantage.  Certain areas of the country will be in the area of the production of milk, certain areas will be in the production of cereals and there will be areas &mdash; my own area would be typical of this &mdash; where we will have to have trees because they are the only appropriate enterprise in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out in my earlier submission that a great part of the problem of agriculture in this country, in Europe and indeed worldwide, has been the inappropriate use of the natural resource, the land itself which we have &mdash; inappropriate enterprises, crops or whatever in the wrong places.  If we are to move on, the framers of policy know this now, and future policies certainly are going to take into account to a far greater degree the principle of comparative advantage. That means major adjustment policies for us.  We feel that the scope of this Bill should be wide enough to include power within it to make as-wide-as-possible new policy changes or to suggest them and that ACOT and the research sector should have that power to do so and to make these suggestions and they should not have their hands tied because the scope of this section is not wide enough. Otherwise, we may have to come back in four or five years, in a piecemeal way, to add on a new section to the Bill to give them the kind of powers necessary to <Col N="164" /> carry out new investigations, or classification or to carry out new programmes.</P>

      <P>This amendment No. 17 follows what is the acceptable form in the country for the filling of any vacancies, particularly a vacancy on a body as important as this.  It is important that it would be open competition to allow in the best <Col N="165" /> possible brains in the country that might have a leaning towards becoming a director of what will in fact be a very important joint board in the future.  In saying that, on the previous occasion I paid my respects to the existing directors of the two boards, Dr. Liam Downey and Professor Ryan and expressed my appreciation of their work.  I have the greatest admiration for both men but I am sure they would feel that neither one of them would want to be offered a voluntary redundancy while the other would get the post remaining.  It was to meet that situation that I felt the filling of this vacancy should be open competition.  I have no doubt that if either of these two men compete in an open competition their knowledge and expertise will in itself be of tremendous benefit to them. I want to ensure that there is fair competition for this very important post.  I would commend this amendment to the Minister for consideration.  I know that the next amendment, in the names of Senators Connor and Bradford, is of a similar nature.  They will deal with their own wording but I am anxious to ensure that this vacancy and any future vacancy would not just be a political appointment by the Minister but that it would be open to competition to allow the best brains to compete for an important post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I, together with Senator Bradford and Senator Hogan, have put down an amendment similar to that put down by Senator Ferris, Senator O'Shea and Senator Harte.  We have absolutely no quibble between us.  The only difference is that our amendment addresses itself to the appointment of the first director of the new body while the other amendment refers to future appointments. We on this side of the House cannot understand why it is not provided in the Bill that this post be filled by open competition.  The Minister of State was not present in the earlier part of the day but the Minister himself was here.  At suggestions that this body might not be independent, it is true to say, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, that the Minister became quite angry.  We were <Col N="166" /> making the point that the Agriculture Institute itself is very famous for its publications and that the integrity and independence of these publications is well established and well known.  We expressed our concern that, with the drawing in of this new body under the greater control of the Minister, it would interfere with their independence.  The Minister's reaction to all of that was that it just could not be and it would not be.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why we are fearful &mdash; we are not saying that the present Minister might have certain designs in mind &mdash; is that, if this particular question is not resolved, it certainly leaves it open to a future incumbent of the office to exercise a political control over the new body.  We are asking the Minister to eliminate any suggestion by anybody that there could be political intrigue in the appointment of the director and to accept our amendment which asks that it be done after open competition, which is the normal practice within the Civil Service and throughout the public service and in the private sector generally.  Acceptance of this amendment by the Minister will go a long way in reassuring those people, including myself and Senator Ferris, who have misgivings about the independence that existed in the Institute and in ACOT being lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In the appointment of the first chief officer of any new State-funded body it is normal to provide in legislation that the Minister would reserve the right to make the appointment.  I think that the Senators will agree that previous experiences in this regard have proven that the right decisions have been taken. The Minister has overall responsibility for the agricultural industry; he has, as it were, been through the legislation; he spent a considerable amount of time teasing out and discussing this legislation in the other House before it came before the Seanad.  At this time his appreciation of what is required for the position is very considerable.  It is fair to say that his judgment in the matter can be trusted.  It is essential that the power of appointment <Col N="167" /> of the chief executive should remain with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that in the final analysis the Minister would make the formal appointment, because it is a board that will be subject to Government policy and the development of Government policy and indeed of national policy in the area of agriculture advice and research, I would like to ask the Minister of State what kind of procedure will the Minister adopt in arriving at a group of names from which he will make his final decision?  I take it that he will not do it in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, that he will have to have some regard to people with existing expertise in this area or that he will have a panel from which he will make his final choice.  I know that Government in the past have always defended their right both to appoint and afterwards to defend the appointees.  This was not always accepted by this Government when they were in Opposition as being the right way to do it.  In fact, some of the best known appointees to agencies like the Youth Employment Agency and other agencies were the subject of the severest criticism from this Government when they were in Opposition on the basis that this was jobs for the boys or that political considerations were taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to ensure is that no such accusation can be made in regard to the appointment of a director for a body that will be dealing with the most important economic section in the country, agriculture, and which will be carrying out the policy set down by Government and by the Houses of the Oireachtas. That body should be above and beyond reproach, it should be beyond criticism. The farmers and all the staff who will remain in the new body should have regard and respect for the newly-appointed director.  I am now asking the Minister of State to tell to us what procedure he will follow, to whom will he turn for names.  Surely he is not going to ring up the local cumann to find out if they have anybody who would be recommended. I know he is above that, but <Col N="168" /> that is exactly the accusation that will be made.  What a tragedy it would be for a body such as Teagasc to have that kind of tag put on it.  We have two experienced people in the two existing boards.  I would be hopeful that, without prejudice, if they offered themselves, one of them would be successful.  I also believe that they would like to compete with other people because their success would be in open competition with their colleagues or peers for the particular post.  I hope Teagasc will be above and beyond reproach and that is the only reason I wanted this enshrined in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  I do not doubt at all the Minister of State's sincerity in the reply he gave.  We made the point earlier today that it was a great pity that the name of this Bill has not been changed.  One of its difficulties in getting off will be its very name.  Do not give it another major difficulty &mdash; that its director was not appointed by a system that is above reproach.  The director of this body must be seen to be like Caesar's wife, above reproach.  The director must be the very best man possible because he has a major job of work on his hands.  It is not just his responsibility to the new organisation, to staff etc; it is the responsibility this man will have to this nation.  Agriculture in this country is in serious trouble.  The national cattle herd is in serious trouble, the national pig herd is in serious trouble, the dairy industry through no fault of our own is in serious trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the question of leaving oneself open to the allegation that you go the cumann for a recruit, I do not think that will arise in this case.  The realities are that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is the political head who is answerable to the agricultural industry and, in <Col N="170" /> turn, he will be answerable to the taxpayers of this country.  I think it is fair to say that his judgment and his decision in the matter will be taken to be in the very best interests of the agricultural industry and indeed with the very best interests of the taxpayers at heart.  The role that he fills and the responsibility he carries pretty well ensure that the right decision will be taken in the matter when it comes to the question of the appointment of the chief for the new body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down which the Chair ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a charge on public funds.  It was in connection with adding a new section.  Although it was ruled out of order, may I say that our reason for looking for a waiver for charges to be initiated by Teagasc was to allow an opportunity for some categories of farmers to be excluded for charges in the future?  This was made on the basis <Col N="171" /> that there could be cases where advice might be needed and where, if the new board did not have this section or something like it written in, hardship could arise.  I felt that by allowing a waiver scheme for some categories, the additional charge that would arise from that would be borne not by the public at large which you have ruled on, a Chathaorligh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know the direction that has already gone out to ACOT staff, that in one year they have a particular allocation to be collected, the next year it will be greater and then greater still.  At the end, we will find that only those who can afford advice will get it.

I know that the budgeting has gone wrong because sufficient people have not opted for reduncancy.  I am anxious that in future the new board will have some guideline to determine qualifications of particular grades.  We had a new grade within the ACOT advisory service which was about the only means of promotion available to agricultural instructors.  This was agreed after long and protracted discussions and negotiations.  We put it into place and it was accepted by the staff concerned.  This amendment is to try to ensure that in future the new board will have a facility to determine the qualification of certain grades they will require.</P>

      <P>I am extremely worried now that the Minister is going to interfere a lot with the board of Teagasc and this is something I thought would not happen arising out of this legislation.  I thought that once the board were given their allocation of funds they would carry out the job.  We are now going to determine for them, in advance, a kind of policy decision about grades and conditions of services which would normally be applicable to people in the Civil Service within a Department.  This is not a Department. This body will be set up with a specific budget within which they will have to live, as did ACOT and AFT.  Now they do not even have the right to determine the grades they will require to have, the qualifications of people filling the grades, or even some indication of the conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no incentive for anybody to work for this type of board. It will be as easy for them to stay in <Col N="174" /> the Department of Agriculture and Food where all these constraints are operated by the Minister anyway.  I felt that it was not an unreasonable additional paragraph to put in.  Now the Minister has confirmed not only my worries but the worries of all those employed by the two boards.  It was in consultation with them that we decided it was important that the board should have some autonomy in the running of their affairs.  Naturally for pay and salaries there are national guidelines laid down.  We have the Gleeson report and other such reports which deal specifically with the payment of people in the higher Civil Service and other areas.  So there are guidelines laid down.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that anybody should have a complete and total disregard for the national norms or disregard Government guidelines in this area.  I would hate to feel that the Government were going to set guidelines. It would be beyond normal procedure and would go beyond the normal acceptable trade union and other negotiation union procedures set down for a body such as Teagasc.  We are setting up a new body and we hope that the Minister will not keep his hand on them to make sure they do not get off the ground, which is quite likely if we are to have such restraint on it.</P>

      <P>The controls envisaged are quite standard.  We had recent legislation to establish FÁS.  It is really a contunuation of the type of arrangements that exist in those circumstances.  While it is not directly in the public service, we are really talking about the whole area of the public service.  It would be quite unthinkable and contrary to the Government's overall approach at this time to have any arrangement other than what is being provided for in the legislation as such.  To even contemplate accepting the amendment would create all kinds of difficulties for this Government and for future Governments in this area.</P>

      <Col N="175" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We find this section very restrictive in relation to the recruitment and staffing powers of Teagasc or a Teagasc subsidary.  Like Senator Ferris, we think it would be helpful if all references to subsidiaries in subsections 2 (a), 2 (b) and (3) were deleted, and all these mentions of &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, which we find in subsections (1), (2) (a), 2 (b) and (3).</P>
      <P>With these shackles placed upon the board of Teagasc, the ever-present often dead hand of the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance, especially in relation to policies nowadays regarding recruitment in the public service and other ancillary activities, we feel there would be great difficulty for the new body in establishing joint ventures, for instance, in our soil testing services. They would have difficulty in setting up tax efficient vehicles whereby venture capital could be attracted.  They would have difficulty in availing of certain EC or IDA funds, open only to private companies through forming a limited company with an industrial partner.  They would have great difficulty in optimally privatising market-ready research and that has been much discussed here already today.  Finally, we feel it would stand in the way of creating a genuine business environment.  It is important that we get a business environment into this new body within which sales and technical staff could be reasonably well motivated.</P>

      <P>Far from playing games, as the Minister earlier suggested we were doing on this Bill, I certainly would not be here unless I was serious about what I wanted to say. Indeed, I have no intention of playing games with section 10 and this amendment, which is down in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan.  Any special pleading for members of staff of Teagasc to be Members of Seanad Éireann is not sustainable unless we apply it right across the board to a whole complex of State and semi-State bodies.  I cannot see Senator Brendan Ryan's attempt at distinction between Dáil and Seanad in this regard. In theory I am in favour of having the expertise of researchers in the area of An Teagasc available if they want to submit themselves to the usual electoral test in what in theory is supposed to be a vocational chamber.  I do not think that one can make a case in favour of this Bill rather than a whole host of others.  I have no particular brief to carry for section 10 or any of the amendments Nos. 20 to 23.</P>

      <P>We are talking here about fairly standard and accepted legislation. The basic thinking behind it is to avoid any conflict of interests.  I am sure others would argue that it would preclude the allegation of double jobbing being levelled against the individual who might aspire to that particular position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I are not really arguing about this.  I believe there certainly are plenty conflicts of interests in this State at all kinds of levels, certainly in this House, between people who have not disclosed their interests <Col N="177" /> about the private particular as against the public good.  The Minister and I are not in conflict about this.  All I am saying is this.  In my time in Seanad Éireann, from 1977 onwards, there have been occasions on which I have argued against the proposition that being a Member of Seanad Éireann is, <i>ipso facto,</i> a disqualification against serving on various commissions under the aegis of the State and <i>vice versa.</i>  To that extent I share the principle of Senator Brendan Ryan's amendments, but I simply say to the Minister that I do not think there is any case in particular to be made for saying staff or members of An Teagasc should be exempt from the general perceived view that membership of the Oireachtas and membership and staff employment in these bodies are incompatible.  In my view that does not arise.</P>
      <P>Since I have been described here today as a proxy of Senator Brendan Ryan, I want to reject that totally.  I am nobody's proxy.  The views I expressed earlier today I represent quite independently and, apart from Senator Ryan's name on these amendments, I represent the graduates and my constituents, who have quite a legitimate and valid interest in this Bill.  I do not have either to apologise for or reject the amendments which stand in somebody else's name.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the Senator's response to the amendments <Col N="178" /> which have been put down by another person so long as the anomaly which was in past legislation, which the previous Government started to change and which, thankfully, the parliamentary draftsman has eventually come to grips with, is removed.  It was an anomaly that somebody who was nominated to contest an election, even against his will or without his knowledge, could have been excluded or lost his position on a board. The fact that the Taoiseach would nominate somebody to be a Member of the House is not nomination as understood when we were debating similar sections in other legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree that there would be a conflict of interest, but being a member of the Oireachtas and being nominated to contest an election are different matters.  It is only on election to this House or by nomination to be a Member of this House that the question of a dual role or a conflict of interest arises.  I agree with Senator Murphy and the way he has explained his position in case he might be misrepresented as representing the views of Senator Ryan on this section.  The Minister does not even have to reply if that suits the Chair.</P>

    <Col N="179" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an amendment down, amendment No. 24, which we cannot move now because of our references to ACOT.  We were hoping that the Minister might have accepted our amendment and that we might now be talking about a new body called ACOTT.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the financing of Teagasc.  This is one of the core issues of this Bill &mdash; the financing and, more importantly, the future financing after consultation.  Last October an arbitrary decision was taken to cut the joint budgets of ACOT and AFT from £38 million to £20 million.  Since then we have had nothing in either body but a mixture of mayhem and disarray.  All of this was caused by this very highhanded and, we would submit, very stupid decision which was taken completely without reference to anyone in either body.  There was a further diktat from the Minister at the time that 1,000 of the 2,200 staff jointly in ACOT and AFT would have to go. The announcement at that time made no reference to voluntary redundancy or redeployment under the terms of the National Understanding.</P>
      <P>It was issued with a degree of threat to the staff of both bodies that they should get out.  This threat took no account of the fact that both organisations, on average, had trimmed their expenditure by 25 per cent since 1980, while the Minister's own Department in Agriculture House have enjoyed &mdash; I made this point in my Second Stage speech &mdash; an increase in real or absolute terms of 6 per cent in the amount of money it cost the taxpayer since 1980.</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted in the Dáil that the £20 million provided for it will be inadequate this year since only about 400 of the staff of the combined bodies have opted for leaving and many of the people who have opted to leave were the most industrious and talented and the most necessary people in both bodies.  The Minister may deny that but my sources in both bodies confirm to me that that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally agreed that at least £30 million or £32 million would have to be found to fund the research and advice <Col N="180" /> services in 1988.  It is a matter of principle for us that the figure for funding this year must be the bottom line for financing to build on for future years.  We want no more arbitrary diktats.  The decisions must be taken after consultations and this also holds relevance for possible increases in charges to farmers for ACOT services.</P>
    <P>We have the rather sad situation at present that the ACOT advisers in the field, literally have to be collectors of revenue for the Department because they have a set figure which they must collect in order for these areas to remain viable. This has meant that very often now the service is only being given not to farmers who most need the advice but to those who can afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister may dictate, without any consultation with the governing body or the body set up under the director of ACOT or with the director of Teagasc, that there should be a major increase in the charge to farmers for the provision of advice or making known to them new findings in research.  That is a fundamental question of principle as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be amended &mdash; we will come back to this again on Report Stage &mdash; to ensure that the interest of the people to whom the service is delivered is protected and above all that adequate funding will be provided for this body.  If it is not to be provided, then its establishment will be totally meaningless.  What we are talking about is double-edged in the sense that we want to ensure that adequate finance is provided from the Central Exchequer to keep this body up and running, to be relevant to the people that it has to be relevant to and, indeed, to the national economy, but also that its funding will not be found to a greater and greater degree out of the pockets of farmers who cannot afford it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of this section my colleagues in the other House called a division on the Bill in total on the basis that they felt that this new board could not be properly financed with the budget struck this year in anticipation of the <Col N="181" /> formation of the new board of Teagasc. I wanted to adopt a more constructive role in that I felt the need for this merger was there, I also have extreme concern, like Senator Connor, about the lack of funding this year.</P>
      <P>We have listened to representations from staff in both bodies and we are aware of the actual economics of how these fundings were broken down.  For ACOT the State input was about £10.5 million; the local authorities put in £3.9 million; the EC funding was £2.8 million; charging for services realised £1.5 million and there was another miscellaneous accounting of about £2 million, bringing the total ACOT budget to about £20.7 million.  The AFT budget was £9.5 million.</P>
      <P>We considered, in consultation with the staff, that an extra £2 million would be required to have this board properly financed to carry out the work that we and the Government recognise needs to be done.  That kind of budgeting of £30 million or £32 million, which was a minimum one, and which already had imposed on us some statutory cuts in the previous year, was not met by the Government.  All we have at the moment is a kind of promise from the Minister of State's colleague, the other Minister of State and, indeed the Minister, that sufficient funding would be made available in future.</P>
      <P>The lack of that additional funding at the moment will ensure that the scientific base of the industry as we know it will be undermined, that we will reduce the number of farmers without the advisory service; there are about 25,000 farmers, largely commercial farmers, who can afford to pay for the service but are not the category of farmers at whom this Bill should be aimed.  It will mean that the staff and resources that are required to carry out development work will be smaller and some of the schemes will not be capable of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expect that this smaller funding will diminish the contribution that agriculture can make to the national programme for recovery which has been mentioned by <Col N="182" /> the Minister and which we feel is a necessary part of any development programme for this country.  The Estimates for this year have been accepted by the other House, so let us pin the responsibility where it should be pinned.  I feel the other House did not allow sufficient funding for this area.</P>
    <P>We are looking now for a commitment from the Minister that there will be a real budget for this new body next year.  If not, we predict that it will be a failure. The Minister can call it whatever name he likes, appoint whatever director he likes and give him whatever remuneration he likes, but he will be unable to carry out the task that the State will charge him with unless proper funding is available.  Unless we ensure that that funding is available more staff will be lost.  They will see no future in the service unless we ensure that there are sufficient funds available to them to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>Those are the reservations I have and I have expressed them on various other sections.  I have tried to do something for people who will be unable to pay the charges that, of necessity will be made by the new board for services rendered.  I have no objection to the concept of commercially based farmers paying for a service but I have concern for family farmers who need advice, service and research and who will be unable to pay for this and who will be saddled with an imposition by a board that will have financial constrictions on it.  I hope that under this section we can have the assurance that the Chair was unable to allow the Minister to give me under another section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senators Connor and Ferris, the financial provision is really quite a separate matter from the Bill.  It is something that has to be considered within the context of the Department of Agriculture and Food Estimate.  We have all learned the lesson of reality.  These matters cannot be considered in splendid isolation from the economic reality of the day.  I am sure any Government would like to have double or treble the resources available in specific areas, such as <Col N="183" /> research and development, but it is simply not possible to divorce decision making with regard to financial provisions from the sort of resources that are available in the context of the overall economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor made the point that the amount of money available this year for research and advice was in the region of £20 million.  The figure is £23 million. Senator Ferris spoke about the division we had on this section in the other House. The division was on section 6 on fixing charges and was not on the question of the financial provision by the Government.</P>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary as there is ample scope in section 13, when Teagasc are submitting their proposed activities and estimates for the year, to put forward their views and requests at that time.  I am sure they will be adequately considered when they are submitted for adjudication.  I am sure the requirements of the new body will be adequately taken into account when the size of the grant given is being determined.</P>

At any rate I am glad to be able to assure Senator Murphy, since he is a former tutor of mine, that there is no difficulty in relation to this matter.  Section 14 provides that members of the board and the staff of Teagasc or a subsidiary shall not disclose any information obtained by them in the performance of their duties without the consent of Teagasc.  This is a reasonable requirement and an essential one in many ways because a lot of the research and development work that is being done by Teagasc will be by way of commercial <Col N="186" /> involvement and support.  Commercial firms want to have their R and D work carried out in a confidential way.</P>
      <P>It is in the best interests of the employees of Teagasc that no information should be disclosed without the prior consent of Teagasc.  I have no difficulty in giving an assurance that this confidentiality aspect will not inhibit in any way research publications or research findings.  That will continue as usual in the various publications which will come out from time to time from the new body. In the interests of the employees, the clients and in the interest of the future of Teagasc and their performance this section is essential.</P>

      <P>In responding positively I hope Senator Murphy's who expressed an interest in this will accept the Minister's assurance.  In addition to the areas of research, development and information which might have been achieved through that process, there is other private information which an employee of Teagasc might have available to him in dealing with clients.  When dealing with a client's farming accounts his financial situation was available and an assurance of confidentiality was given by the previous advisers in ACOT.</P>
      <P>Farmers will now need to be reassured again that any information available to advisers in their capacity as employees of Teagasc will not be available to the Revenue Commissioners or any other agency.  I hope that the board of Teagasc who will have this information will treat it with confidentiality to which it is entitled particularly if it should be made available in the course of advice that is necessary to get somebody out of financial difficulty or to put him into another area of farming which is more beneficial financially.  I want to reassure people that that confidentiality will remain as this section indicates.  It gives Teagasc as a board some discretion in disclosing information.</P>

I can give an absolute assurance that there will be no question of disclosing any confidential information, including accounts of clients.

      <P>Teagasc or a subsidiary may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, invest funds of Teagasc or the subsidiary, as the case may be, in such a manner as it thinks fit.</P>
      <P>We would like it to be a little more positive and we would be looking for a change in the wording.  We feel that any funds generated by Teagasc or any of its subsidiaries that the Government would see fit to dispose of should not go directly back into the Exchequer.  Why should they not go back into Teagasc itself for the development of further research programmes or into the agricultural industry generally?</P>

    <P>I am concerned about the acquisition of some of the assets of county committees of agriculture and ACOT which were partly financed by local authorities and partly by the Department.

      <P>This section deals with proceeds which accrue to Teagasc and which have to date accrued to An Foras Talúntais.  In practice, those moneys or finances generated by contract research go back into the research programme. The same principle will apply under Teagasc itself.  This section is to ensure that there is accountability since the assets are State assets, the assets of the Irish people.  There is accountability to a Minister in Government for the disposal of any assets or the expenditure of any moneys which accrue from contract research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  It is a pity that he would not follow up his remarks with an actual change in the wording of this section. He accepts my point and assures us that moneys generated from contracts in the research sector will go back into development of further research or provide the wherewithal for wider research.  Why not state that formally in the Bill?  He could still include in it &ldquo;under the direction of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  We are worried about the clear inference here that the Minister for Finance can take that money and put it where he will.</P>

      <P>There is an overly-suspicious attitude towards sections of this Bill.  There is no difficulty about this. What has been happening in practice for several decades in an Foras Talúntais is going to happen in Teagasc.  If we had a specific provision in the Bill it would load it in the other direction.  I want to give an assurance that any moneys accruing to Teagasc from research or commercial support for this programme will be utilised by Teagasc to further its research and development programme.  This section is included specifically to ensure that there is accountability and that State assets will <Col N="189" /> be put to the use for which they are provided and to no other use.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the section, but I am anxious about people who funded some of this property under other legislation and were promised specifically in the legislation that they would be compensated for it on the acquisition by ACOT.  This Bill gives the Minister and this new board the power to take all the property and land from county committees and from ACOT which they may have in their possession.  I am concerned that some of this was funded by local authorities.  If such is the case and the money is proven to be still legitimately due to local authorities, the Minister should refund it to the ratepayers of the counties, who included county council cottiers with an acre of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Any property of public bodies is a public or State asset and there is a procedure for resolving changes that occur in this case.  It is not a matter specifically for this Bill, which is about the establishment of Teagasc.  The disposal of assets or the transfer of assets from one State agency to another is a matter for further legislation, but it is not germane to this Bill and certainly does not arise under section 15.</P>

      <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that this Bill provides him with the legislative power to acquire the assets of ACOT and county committees. The Bill does give that power.  In my Second Stage speech I said I hoped that in the acquisition of these properties account would be taken of those who helped to fund them.  On this section, where one is talking about the Minister's accountability and the board's accountability to the Minister, I am putting in the claim for the local authorities, who were the main funders of this.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said in his Second Stage speech that it gave him the power to acquire properties.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to enable us by legislation to ensure that the new board shall establish committees.  The Bill abolishes county committees of agriculture which were set up under the ACOT Bill.  The reason given is that they were abolished automatically because ACOT was abolished. As they were associated with ACOT as statutory bodies they automatically fell or were abolished by the abolition of ACOT.  In the setting up of this new board the Minister tried to meet some of the demands made on him, particularly by members of his own party who made a major contribution over a period of some 35 to 40 years to the county committees of agriculture.  Fianna Fáil councillors and nominees of councillors elected by the people serving on county councils became responsible to farmers by serving on the county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They, in turn, were served at national level by the General Council of Agricultural Committees, another statutory body, which has not been mentioned at all in this legislation.  It is a shame, considering the service the general council has given to the agricultural industry, to the Minister and to ACOT.  They were never given due recognition by anybody for what they were doing.  Other non-statutory farming organisations were <Col N="191" /> always pandered to and brought in on deputations and had extensive media coverage.  County committees and the general council who played a major role often worked quietly behind the scenes and tried to bring the message to the Minister and to his officials.</P>
    <P>Here is a way to redress that by ensuring that Teagasc have a statutory obligation to establish a committee at county level to advise them.  I am including local authority members who have expertise in this area, farming organisations, such as Muintir na Tíre, ICMSA, IFA, ICA, Macra na Feirme and all other bodies who have in the past nominated people to serve on county committees.  Here is the wealth of talent which was freely available on a voluntary basis through county committees.  They gave a magnificent service and all the Minister could say in his opening speech was that they used up all the money allocated on travelling expenses.  I consider that one of the greatest insults that any Minister could have given to long-serving members of county committees of agriculture.  I would be reneging on my commitment to those committees and my membership of them over a period of years since 1967, if I did not mention how disgusted I was with the Minister's reference to these committees.  The allocations were miserly, to say the least, but members overlooked this and travelled throughout the country at their own expense in the best interests of agriculture, acting in an advisory capacity.  It is not unreasonable to make sure that this incoming body has a statutory obligation to continue this type of county-based advice service.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts this amendment every Fianna Fáil council in the country who have an interest in agriculture will be delighted.  They have been making representations through county councils, through the General Council of County Councils, through the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  They have been at one in demanding that there should be county committee structures set up under this new board.  This amendment, which I am quite serious about, <Col N="192" /> directs the new board to establish them. I see no reason why they should not have them.  The Minister has put in a section that would allow them the flexibility of having them, but I want to make it certain. They will be unable to perform their role or function adequately unless they have these committees.  That is why I want to strengthen the legislation by replacing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues and I have put forward a more broadly worded amendment to this section which states:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 24, after &ldquo;functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall establish, in each county, at least one local advisory forum which shall be a committee within the terms of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We believe there is a need for an input into policy making and into the direction of this new body from members of the farming and rural organisations, organised throughout the various counties.  We also believe in the value and wisdom of the contributions of locally elected members of county councils.  For the past ten years the county committees of agriculture, acting as advisory bodies to ACOT, have been constituted of members of the IFA, Macra na Feirme, the ICMSA, the ICA and other rural bodies within each county.  There is a wealth of wisdom among those people and they have contributed a wealth of very good ideas.  The &ldquo;rubbishing&rdquo; of the role of county committees took place not because of the foibles of some members of these committees &mdash; and we agree there were foibles &mdash; but because of the often arrogant disregard of their views by the Department of Agriculture and by the board of ACOT.  Not everybody is free from sin in this area.  Many of their proposals were well thought out.  They were very well informed, yet they were disregarded.  They often became the butt of a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was gratuitously insulting of the Minister to state in his Second Stage speech that they spent all of their money on travelling expenses.  No other funding <Col N="193" /> was provided for them.  The only funding was subsistence and travelling expenses for these people to go voluntarily to these meetings.  I notice a lot of smiles here and I hope they are not smiles of derision.  It was very small and very poor reward for these people for the time they lost and the services they gave.  They brought forward far more relevant ideas than ever emanated from Agriculture House.  These are the people who lived on the ground and had their feet on the ground.  The decision-makers in the headquarters of ACOT, and maybe in AFT, are less guilty of criticism than the people in Agriculture House.  The ideas and proposals of the county committees were far more germane and to the problems of Irish agriculture than the ideas of many of the people with very big salaries within Agriculture House.</P>
    <P>We are proposing very positively that the concept of county advisory committees be maintained.  Something should be written into the new law which will ensure that the good ideas and proposals brought forward by these committees will find a way into the general body of agricultural policy.  It is of no use to create a body like the previous one who came forward with good ideas, who played out their role very well, yet had no imput into policy.  That is the very antithesis of democracy.  That is all about decentralising decision-making.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, his Department, people in ACOT, in AFT or in the new body, Teagasc, do not have the monopoly of wisdom in determining the whole <i>corpus</i> policy for agriculture. There are many good ideas out there.  Let us tap into those good ideas and listen to reasonable and good proposals.</P>
    <P>We are proposing that the Minister should accept our amendment.  Many people in local authorities and in his own Department would be delighted.  Senator Hussey quoted the wording of the proposal which he championed at Galway County Council.  Every congratulation to Senator Hussey and I sincerely hope that he will stand on his feet tonight and say again what he said in Galway and impress <Col N="194" /> upon the Minister the need to retain these advisory committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the wording of section 17 (1) that, whether or not the amendments proposed are accepted, there will be committees to assist and advise in relation to the functions of Teagasc.  It does not specify whether these will be county or regional committees, but I hope they will be county committees.  It is very important that there should be county committees established to advise on the running of this board.</P>
      <P>I served on a county committee for many years and I always found that the people on those committees were very dedicated to their job.  All of them had a direct interest in agriculture.  Their recommendaitons and advice were always listened to and acted on by the CAO and by the Department of Agriculture and later by ACOT.  It would be a pity to lose that kind of contact with the local scene because the one criticism we hear of boards set up in recent times is that they have become too big, too unwieldy and too far removed from the local scene.  The establishment of a local committee would eliminate that problem because it would give a local input to the board of Teagasc and would tap that advice and help available locally.  I hope the Minister will listen to the case made tonight and that we will see established in every county after this Bill is put into operation committees that will help and advise on the day-to-day running of Teagasc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support this amendment, but at the same time I am sad that we have come to the section where the dissolution of committees has to be spoken about.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Food is to respond to the debate because, as an excellent member of the present county committee of agriculture in Cork and a most able former chairman of that body, he is very much aware of the work done by that committee down through the years and by <Col N="195" /> similar committees throughout the country. Many of his colleagues must be regretting the fact that the end appears nigh for the committees of agriculture.  I am sure his heart must be with us, though he may have to speak in a different vein when he comes to respond.</P>
      <P>When I spoke of the dissolution of the committees of agriculture last week I mentioned that I saw it as the thin edge of the wedge as regards the removal of power from local authority members. This removal may start with the scrapping of the committee of agriculture but I think it will filter down to the abandonment of many other local committees. One wonders what this will mean in ten years' time for the future of local authorities and their membership.</P>
      <P>Surely we would have to agree that local people can solve local problems best, whether it be in the field of agriculture, if you excuse the pun, or industry or any other aspect of Irish economic life. The work done by the members of the county committees of agriculture down through the years resulted in dramatic improvements in agriculture output. Undoubtedly, over the past five or six years they had only a very limited role. That, however, is very understandable because they had very little option in regard to the spending of their meagre funds.  Points have been made about the money spent on travelling expenses etc., but we have to take note of the fact that funding was so limited that once the travel expenses were taken out there was very little left over.  That certainly should not bear in any way on the members of the committees of agriculture but instead should reflect poorly on those who provided them over the past number of years under different Governments with very insufficient amounts of funds.  I am glad that the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your assistance regarding the interruptions by Senator Connor.  At least the Government are indicating that they wish that some recognition be given to local interests.  We have to seek an absolute guarantee that a local committee will be set up in each county to take note of the problems they see and deal with them in the fashion they have been used to.  Under the Bill the Minister may or may not set up the committees. That is not good enough.  We are most insistent that committees shall be set up.</P>
      <P>I believe the county structure is still the ideal one for a sub-committee.  The different problems can be best dealt with at county rather than regional level.  I would agree with all that Senator Hussey said and his comments are indicative of the views of all local authority members throughout the country.  These are the people who know the problems best and are most concerned with what they see as the disappearance of a forum that proved most effective for the farming community and agriculture in general.</P>
      <P>I again appeal to the Minister to take serious cognisance of our amendment.  It is not good enough to be half-hearted about setting up sub-committees under Teagasc.  We will have to get a full commitment that they will be set up in each county.  That structure has worked well down through the years and if it is allowed to function again with proper funding it will help in the continued expansion of agriculture throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>County committees of agriculture discharged their statutory function extremely well, particularly up to 1979.  The enactment of legislation at that time transferred many of the responsibilities of county committees to <Col N="197" /> ACOT.  That was brought about by the enactment of the legislation by the Minister of the day, Jim Gibbons.  It was probably brought about as well by the disdain and dislike by Department officials for county committees of agriculture.  I often wonder about the reason.  Perhaps it was the duplication of many of the resolutions and many of the matters that had been dealt with in each county that arrived on the desks of officials in the Department who disliked the duplication of effort and opinion in relation to each county.  Perhaps that was the reason.  It is essential to maintain a local input into the development of agricultural policy to ensure that there is a direct link between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farmer on the ground, as it were.  I can give one example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to interrupt my colleagues but could we stick to the wording of the amendment point by point?  I do not want to lose control of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sticking to the point. A county forum is needed and I am giving the background reasons for it.  The Minister understands, as Senator Bradford quite rightly said, being himself a member of a county committee.  He appreciates that a county forum is essential as put forward by Senators Connor, Bradford and Hogan in amendment No. 29, which we are discussing in conjunction with amendment No. 28.  For example, the county committees of agriculture made a considerable impact in the dissemination of information, and in communicating between the farmer and the Department during the fodder crisis caused by the bad weather in 1985 and 1986.  Programmes of activity were drawn up at county level to deal with the very difficult situation at that time when the writing off of most of the fodder farmers needed for the winter months was on the cards.  The scheme to be implemented by the Department in the form of subsidised meal costs from Europe was fine tuned by the input of local people, by the ACOT staff and by the representatives <Col N="198" /> of local democracy and the farming organisations through that county forum. That is an example of how considerable constructive work was done.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we are discussing section 17 here tonight.  It is the wilful destruction or, as we would call it in rural Ireland, the &ldquo;scarification&rdquo; of one of the last bastions of local democracy.  I regret that it is a deliberate attempt by the Government to stifle any local input into agricultural policy.  They are backed up in that role by the fact that the Minister has failed to see the considerable influence which local democracy &mdash; county councillors, farming organisations and rural organisations &mdash; can have on agricultural policy.  The action will be regretted. People will make more representations to the Oireachtas rather than less.  We will need more ombudsmen and ombudspeople throughout the country rather than less as a result of the dissolution of county committees of agriculture and the communication process on the ground.  That is why the amendment is so important.  It is important that the Minister should have a positive reaction to my contribution by saying: &ldquo;The Minister or the board of Teagasc shall, on a county basis, set up a county committee advisory structure which will supplant and replace what he is trying to dissolve under the present Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various speakers referred to the contribution and dedication of local people who were represented on these committees over the years.  It is not as a nostalgic plea that people are defending county committees of agriculture. Senators are not standing up and talking about the retention of local democracy from the view point of local elections.  It would be unwise for the Minister or his Department to form this opinion from this debate.  We are very conscious of the role of local democracy in the formulation and implementation of agricultural policy through a county forum like the county committees of agriculture.  The Minister, who has been a member of a county committee of agriculture, and the General Council of County Committees <Col N="199" /> of Agriculture knows the valuable contribution people who have long been associated with that work can make including, if I might mention one name. Michael Hassett, who was the secretary for many years.  Those dedicated people feel very strongly about the need to maintain that link between the Department and the farmer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister fails to accept an amendment of a positive nature I regret to say that it will be a classic example of the Minister for Agriculture and Food losing influence over the direction of his Department by bending to the disdain and dislike of bureaucracy for county committees of agriculture which have built up over a number of years.  I suggest that any arm of the state stretching beyond the Pale at present is either amputated by legislation or suffocated by lack of finance.  That is a direction in local democracy that I do not want to see continue. That is why I want the Minister to put positive wording into this Bill to ensure that local democracy will continue to thrive in rural Ireland if not within the Pale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support very strongly amendments Nos. 28 and 29 in the names of Senators Ferris, Connor, Hogan and Bradford.  I quite agree that the case we are making on section 17 with these very important amendments also has a very direct bearing on section 20. Over the past couple of years the Government of the day, the Department of Finance, or whoever, have actually castrated the work of the agriculture committees by removing from them whatever finance or whatever autonomy they had.  From speaking to colleagues serving on the committee I know it was just a nuisance. <Col N="200" /> Since regionalisation a few years ago there has been no input from local county committees into the policy and the work of the ACOT committees.  I can honestly say that I do not regret the passing of the ACOT county committees or the successors to the county committees of agriculture we have known for the past few years, because they had absolutely no function.  I was elected to a regional committee for some part of the Leinster region.  I attended one meeting in the Lyons estate and that was the end of that branch of the association.</P>
      <P>If we take as a case in point the county of Offaly which has one-third of its land mass comprising peat soils, can the Minister seriously stand up with a straight face and say that a new central organisation, Teagasc, or whatever, with responsibility for both research and the advisory services, will give a specialist service to a county that has a third of its land mass completely covered with peat soils and most of it with cut-over bogs.  At present there is a complete winding down of the Bord na Móna enterprises.  The board of the ESB have decided to take out of production five peat-fired generating stations. The two greatest industrial employers responsible for over 5,000 jobs are being withdrawn in a county where we have the lowest density of population in the entire Republic, taking Leitrim, Mayo or any other county into consideration. Does anyone think any national body will give specialist attention to that when we read in the newspapers just a few months ago that the cutbacks would mean the discontinuation of the An Foras Talúntais research station in Lullymore in county Kildare, which specialises completely in the cultivation of peat soils, whether for afforestation, vegetables or the production of beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that it is imperative that the Minister should give in this Bill a guarantee to the Oireachtas that local committees will be set up so that farmers who will be forced to compete with the best in Europe over the next ten or 20 years will have an opportunity to influence a service they must depend on for their <Col N="201" /> very economic survival.  I do not think the contributions of Members on this Bill are receiving serious attention or consideration from the Government.  I regret to say that.  Looking at the reception this important Bill is getting in this House as against, for instance, the Companies (No. 2) Bill &mdash; there is no rush with it; the Minister is receptive and he appears to appreciate points that are raised &mdash; there is absolutely no comparison in the way these two pieces of legislation going through this House simultaneously are being treated and dealt with.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Ferris' amendment.  It should be written into section 17 that Teagasc shall establish committees.  Unless we have committees with a local input, there are areas in this country which will have absolutely no service.  Unless pressure is kept on the Government from the grassroots, there will be no response from central Government, especially when the Department of Finance will be drawing the pen, line by line, through what they want or do not want provided.  Therefore, small specialist areas, small deprived areas needing special attention, which do not come under a grandiose plan for the whole country will fall a cropper.  Therefore, I appeal that amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30 should be taken together so that section 17 (1) will read:</P>
    <P>Teagasc shall establish committees to assist and advise it in relation to the performance of its functions and shall establish in each county at least one local advisory forum which shall be a committee within the terms of this section.</P>
    <P>With that kind of assurance written into the Bill those of us whose livelihoods and whose families depend to a great extent on the ability of this new body to come up with the answers will be able to meet the oncoming competition.  I do not have to remind the House that in 1992 not only will there be free movement of everything, according to the Single European Act, but there will be one hour access from the UK to central Europe.  We are either going to be swamped, or we are <Col N="202" /> going to avail of the opportunities that present themselves.</P>
    <P>Our farmers must have advice.  We must have the research to produce new seeds or varieties.  We must have the assistance of a top class research and advisory service.  I am not convinced that, after the passing of this Bill, the Department of Agriculture and Food will have any say in the expertise they have.  Are we going back to 12 years ago when we had the university farms were a republic or an empire on their own.  Department of Agriculture farms were doing their own thing?  The new Teagasc outfit will be at the mercy of the Department of Finance for finance for any of their research projects.  The whole thing is too uncertain; the whole thing is too serious.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that I will leave this debate in this Chamber with a diminished hope for the future &mdash; and for my future as a member of the farming community. Who can we turn to if we do not believe in the services established by the Oireachtas to provide for the agricultural industry &mdash; not just for farmers but the input services and the processing services which are becoming more and more important?  The Minister of State with responsibility for Food must surely agree with that.  We need hope and we need a clear definition of what we can expect from this section.</P>

      <P>I do not know how serious the Minister is when he says that Teagasc may establish committees to assist or advise them on the performance of their functions.  The Minister has given no indication as to what committees that may be set up throughout the country. Everybody who has gone to the trouble of reading the legislation and taking note of the Bill before us is of the opinion that it will be the exception rather than the rule if we ever see a committee.  It is generally accepted that a committee will be set up only to prove that the legislation is worth while.  There is no obligation on Teagasc to set up any committee, anywhere. If the amendments are not accepted by the Minister, I will be <Col N="203" /> interested to hear his reply to the contributions.</P>
      <P>During most of my time in public life I have served on the county committee of agriculture in County Dublin; many may think it is not the most important county committee.  That committee, as did all the other county committees throughout the country, played a significant part in bringing the farmers of Ireland up to date and into the EC.  I referred to that in my Second Stage speech last week.  I do not want to remind the House of what happened after that, It is getting to a dangerous hour.</P>

They know the value of those county committees down the years.  Indeed, I was one of those who put forward the idea that all aspects of agriculture and related operations in the county should be represented on county committees.  We saw that happen in our time.  We also saw their responsibilities and, as Senator McDonald outlined, their usefulness diminished in recent times.  When that happened under ACOT many of those serving on county committees forecast that the day would come when they would not be in existence at all.  I regret to say that we seem to be arriving at that day, but I would hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on these two amendments, I would like to make a slight reference to the opinions of former Ministers for Agriculture.  Indeed, Mr. Mark Clinton, who is now in Europe, <Col N="204" /> was anxious &mdash; and I served on a county committee with Mark Clinton before he was Minister &mdash; that all bodies who had an interest in agriculture should be represented on these county committees.  As I have said, we saw that then, but I regret to say that the Minister in his introductory speech on Second Stage referred to the expenses of members of county committees of agriculture.  He said that 70 per cent of the expenditure of county committees was on travelling expenses. That was a most unfortunate remark by the Minister because he gave the impression that county committees were doing nothing except using up finance.</P>
      <P>The facts are that the finance was taken from them.  The only thing that was not taken from them were their expenses for attending meetings.  I regret that the Minister gave this impression to the country &mdash; to those who would not otherwise know &mdash; by referring to the figures for last year, but he did not refer to a figure of five, 10, 15 or 20 years ago when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the expenditure on travelling expenses was roughly 5 per cent of the expenditure of the county committees.  However, I am sure most people throughout the country have dealt with that since the Minister made that utterance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is a slap in the face to county committees.  I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to insert these amendments into the Bill.  I am anxiously waiting to hear what he has to say tonight. I hope the Minister of State will readily accept these two amendments.  There is absolutely no means by which we can measure the value of these county committees down the years.  I think the Minister of State and, indeed, most if not all Senators and many others fully realise the value of those county committees. We are not only taking from agriculture the tremendous benefit the county committees have been to that industry but we <Col N="205" /> are denuding the country of democracy and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister had given me a wink that he was likely to accept these amendments, I might have shut up ten minutes ago, but he has not given me the nod or the wink. Perhaps he is keeping it as a little surprise for us.  I hope that, if he does not see his way to accepting these amendments in full, he will some time in the future set up committees on a county basis.  I believe that the greatest harm being done is not only the loss to agriculture but the loss to democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied and convinced that the concerns expressed by many Senators are adequately catered for in section 17 of the Bill.  Section 17 states quite clearly that Teagasc may establish committees to assist and advise in relation to the performance of their functions. Under subsection (2):</P>
      <P>A committee may include persons who are not members of Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Teagasc may appoint a person to be chairman of a committee established under this section.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>There may be paid out of the income of Teagasc to members of a committee established under this section such allowances for expenses incurred by them as Teagasc may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is written into this Bill that Teagasc may establish committees to assist them <Col N="206" /> in their work and I believe that is important. There is a change from the old committee system.  I want to avail of this occasion to pay tribute to the work done by former committee members and there are a number of them here tonight and also a number of chairmen of committees.</P>
    <P>The fact is that times and situations change and I do not believe that the county structure may be the most relevant today.  For example, in County Cork &mdash; and Senator Bradford will be familiar with this &mdash; the council is divided into three areas and more recently the Irish farmers' organisation, the IFA, decided to divide the old rebel county into two counties and more recently, again, they divided it into three counties because, of course, the area which I represent is a severely handicapped area and we look for and get a lot of assistance by way of disadvantaged areas payments and so on.  The mid-Cork area and the east-Cork area are totally different types of areas which have much more fertile land and so on.  Senator Bradford will be aware of the situation in north-Cork and the particular attributes of that county.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for the establishment of committees either at district, regional, or county level, if that is what is required by local people.  In relation to the goodwill of ACOT or the Ministers involved in the establishment of committees, in my own area of special interest which is food, I have already, in anticipation of this legislation, got the National Food Centre, which is a part of An Foras Talúntais, to establish a specialist committee to advise and assist in the development and promotion of the food industry.  That advisory committee is made up of representatives of various organisations with specialist knowledge in the food area.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that in the area Senator McDonald talked about with great concern, the area in Offaly where one-third of it is made up of peat land and cutaway bog, an advisory committee representative of that type of interest will be established to assist Teagasc in the <Col N="207" /> preparation of their programme.  Similarly, in the area of tillage, cereals or beef, there is no question but that committees will be established to assist and advise Teagasc in their work, but I am not convinced that the county committee system is the most appropriate.  In fact, the Cashman Review Group who were established to examine this matter in depth were convinced that district or regional areas, rather than county units, would give the best value as advisory committees.</P>
    <P>This is by far the most appropriate way to represent local interests, and not alone local interests but specialist areas of research and development.  For that reason I do not propose to accede to the amendments suggested and I am of the view that section 17 should be retained in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is adopting this attitude now because I think a reasonable case was made by everybody on this side of the House.  I know the Minister has interpreted some of this as being repetitious.  That comes from all the experience that all of us have had on county committees throughout the country.  The Leader of the House said, when there was an argument last week, not to worry about the Second Stage because this really is a Committee Stage Bill and we would have every opportunity to discuss the various sections.  This is a specific section to which we propose a specific set of amendments to strengthen it so as to ensure that there are and shall be local advisory committees to Teagasc.  The fact is that the section, as worded by the parliamentary draftsman and as proposed by Minister and the Government, gives an option that there may not be.  We are not satisfied on this side of the House that that is strong enough.  That is why we are emphasising, for for all the reasons given by all the Members, repetitious and otherwise that the wealth of expertise at county level, which has been given voluntarily and expertly over the years, could now be written away by a stroke of a pen because <Col N="208" /> the parliamentary draftsman did not ensure that there would be committees. He left it optional.  I am not satisfied that it should be optional: I am insisting that there should be such committes.  My colleague, Senator O'Shea, will also defend this view.  He also knows the structures that were there and how chairmen were appointed from the members, not dictated by a board in Dublin, which is what the Bill implies.  This is not democracy; this is dictatorship.  If you are going to have dictatorship from central authority down to grass roots you will get no cooperation down there if Dublin, by advertisements in the national media or otherwise, dictate how projects and programmes should be set aside.  You must have consultation.  You must have local democracy and you can only ensure that it happens by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to agree with Senator Ferris, and to express disappointment with the attitude of the Minister.  No good case has been made against these committees.  The Minister acknowledges that they have made an input and he has been appreciative of that in his expressions.  Could we make the point again that many good ideas emerged from these committees and lost their value because they went unheeded.  I would have to say to the Minister that many good ideas proceed from the decision makers and the policy makers in his own Department but indeed very many stupid and very many insane ideas have emerged from within his own Department.  We are now going to have decision making made totally and completely in Dublin.  There will be no input from the countryside, from the people who represent the rural organisations, members of the IFA, members of the ICMSA, members of Macra na Feirme, the young farmers and the elected members of the local authorities, many of them farmers themselves with a wealth of agricultural-farming experience behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to be more positive and accept our amendment. What is involved here is very small. <Col N="209" /> We would be willing to concede on the regional rather than on the county basis, but the principle of having local committees &mdash; and I mean meaningful local committees &mdash; should be upheld by having something in the Bill which would state specifically that what these bodies had to say or the advice that they had to give, as long as it was germane and relevant, would be heeded and would be taken into account in the formulation of agricultural policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express dissatisfaction with the Minister's reply.  If the Minister is convinced of what he said, why can he not accede to the small amendment proposed by Senator Ferris and establish committees?</P>
      <P>I am not enamoured of regionalisation in this country in regard to health or anything else.  It has not been a success. The end product, the services, are worse than we enjoyed before regionalisation was introduced.  I think that every time McKinsey was invited here to do a report on the public service, we wound up being worse off.  I know that if the Department of Agriculture, with their great mass of expertise and experience over a long number of years have it within themselves to improve the service if they were left alone.  What frightens me is the slowness on the part of the Minister to come out and say: &lsquo;Yes, the policy of the Government is that Teagasc shall set up local advisory committees to give the people who stand to benefit from the new service some input into the policy of the service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long discussion on section 15 and the disposal of the property of the organisations about to be abolished or transferred into this new body, Teagasc. If that policy follows the recent pattern of the Department of Finance as expressed regarding the IDA properties, where the Industrial Development Authority was told to provide £5 million towards the Exchequer in the year, where does that leave the infrastructures already built up painstakingly over the last 20 to 25 years? Therefore, with the wording of section 17 as it stands, we are left with great <Col N="210" /> doubts whether there is a genuine intention that the policy of the new policy will be to invite local participants from across the country to have an input to advise on the kind of service they want.  That is why I am dumbfounded because, taking this Bill, it is not one that I can get any hope from.</P>

      <P>With respect, a Chathaoirligh, you will certainly have repetition until we get straight answers from the Minister.  What is to stop the Minister coming forward and answering the questions that are put, not just by one speaker but by speaker after speaker? This is a deliberating forum and we are entitled to get some sort of a reassurance and answers.  I do not accept that there is repetition.  However, I bow to your ruling; there is no doubt about that.  I believe that this Bill does not give us a straight-forward assurance or any indication of what the Government's policy is going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 (1) says Teagasc &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; but they may not.  There is no guarantee that they will.  The very latest example we had this year was where another semi-State organisation was told to sell off property to contribute some £5 million towards the Exchequer.  What are we supposed to think?  We have very valuable research farms right across the country, built up and acquired painstakingly over the last quarter of a century, each one strategically placed in order to afford the farming community an opportunity of seeing the research in progress, the research in action.  I think that, with the change and amalgamation of these important infrastructures of the greatest importance to the agriculture community, there must be a local input, because a civil servant or a professional person on £25,000, £30,000 or more per year can have absolutely no understanding of the position of 35 per cent or <Col N="211" /> 40 per cent of the farming population in receipt of less than the minimum provided by the dole.  My source for that is the statistics that came out some months ago from the economic section of An Foras Talúntais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Senator McDonald asked for straight answers.  I have already said that I am satisfied that the existing provisions which I read out are adequate to meet the concern expressed by Senators &mdash; that Teagasc may establish committees to assist and advise them in relation to the performance of their functions. This is being done already and has been done in the instance which I gave.</P>
      <P>In regard to the goodwill of the organisation and their sincerity in relation to this matter, the fact is that of the ten members of the board, five would be representative of the farming organisations, which is half the number of ordinary members of the board.  It would be strange if they did not take into account the interests of the people they represent, who are the farmers.  I am convinced that the establishment of advisory committees and their format in particular should be left to the discretion of the incoming board that will be representative of the farming organisations and the industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are against the matter being left to the <Col N="212" /> incoming organisation.  The point the Minister is missing is that in the legislation as it is now proposed there is no obligation on him to set up any local committee.  It merely states that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; but if they decide not to set them up then they need not set up any.  I am sure if we were to research all the legislation that has been coming through the Oireachtas in our time, we would find that the Oireachtas ensures that the operation is carried through as we wish it to be carried through.  While the Minister would wish that these local committees be set up, he is not ensuring that they would be set up.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's earlier reply when he stated that times change &mdash; I think he said times and structures change.  Nobody here is against change and nobody will deny the Minister's view that times and structures change.  Of course they do, and will continue to do so never more so than in our time.  These are times when we have to be careful that we hold on to the democracy we have because we seem to be gobbled up by what is happening in the EC.  We have to be extra careful to ensure that that does not happen and that we hold on to those structures of democracy which are so dear to this land.</P>
      <P>The contribution of county committees down the years has been varied in many directions.  They have made an enormous contribution in advising what should be done but also they were a very important link in disseminating and imparting much of the advice coming down from the Department and from advisers in agriculture. That link is now going to be lost. It will not be as easy to get across to the farming community the benefits of whatever advice may come in the future. I found that county committees down the years were an extremely important link in this regard.  That has not been mentioned by any Senators but I would consider it an extremely important link and it is something that should not be overlooked by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made strongly to <Col N="213" /> him and, with no disrespect to or reflection on the Minister of State, it is unfortunate that we do not have the Minister for Agriculture and Food here because the Minister of State might have his riding instructions but the Minister has not heard fully the arguments being made because the Second Stage debate was somewhat restricted.  I do not want to go into that.  It was pointed out to us last week that we were merely engaged in the Second Stage debate while the real debate could take place on Committee Stage.  That is the debate that is taking place now.  It is not possible for the Minister to be here and I think he informed us last week where he would be today.  I respect that.  It is unfortunate that we could not have waited for the Minister to be here.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State but it is obvious that he has not been given the riding instructions to accept these amendments. It is regrettable, because we are sounding the death knell of a part of our democracy as we have known it for many decades.</P>

He talked about his abiding principles in this matter, consultation, dissemination and consideration.  That is what he told us this morning.  This amendment in the name of two of my colleagues and in the name of Senator Ferris and two of his colleagues is about consultation, that is consulting with people throughout the country on the formulation of agricultural policy.  I would ask the Minister to look at the long faces on his side of the House where there are members of county councils or rural communities who feel very unhappy with what is proposed in this measure and <Col N="214" /> unhappy that the Minister is refusing to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>My final appeal rests with the Minister. Would he go back to the mood in which he began this debate this afternoon when he said that his abiding principles in relation to putting through this measure were consultation, dissemination and also consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that my colleague, Deputy Walsh, has dealt with the amendments as they have been proposed and has explained the reasons why the provisions in the legislation are framed as they are.  I apologise to the House for being absent from the House but I have been engaged in numerous consultations with European farm associations in Dublin this evening.</P>
      <P>The consequence of the establishment of Teagasc is that the two existing associations that are being amalgamated under Teagasc &mdash; namely, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT &mdash; understandably and automatically are disbanded as such.  The statutory link between ACOT and the county committees automatically becomes terminated if ACOT as an organisation is terminated.  Then it follows that any association or committee linked to it directly automatically terminates as well.  Therefore, it is a natural consequence of the amalgamation that ACOT and committees statutorily associated with it are disbanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I do understand &mdash; and I said this in the Dáil and I will repeat it here &mdash; that not only is there a very strong feeling that there must be a local input, a real, not apparent, constant, not temporary, local input from the representative interests in whatever way they are best represented to the new Teagasc.  I also indicated that I cannot anticipate what Teagasc should do.  If I were to do that, I would actually be laying myself open to being accused of interfering immediately in the autonomy and direction of a new Authority.  That I do not wish to do and the Government do not wish to do either.  For that reason I can only do as the Minister of the day can <Col N="215" /> do at this point, and that is, point out to Teagasc, when it is established shortly, that it is the wish, not just of Government but of the representative parties in the Oireachtas and even beyond them, that there should be appropriate committees or consultations, formulae and procedures &mdash; not just procedures but structures for consultation &mdash; and I have little doubt that that will be done.  I cannot anticipate what they will do.</P>
    <P>I heard on the previous occasion here objective opinions expressed as to the role and relevance of the county committees as they operated.  These vary from place to place.  They have been particularly effective in some places; it is fair to say they have been rather ineffective in other places.  At a time of revolutionary change in agriculture &mdash; my own mind has been sharpened by the consultations I have had most recently with the Dutch farm associations that are in Dublin this evening &mdash; I do not think any of us here who wants to promote the interests of agriculture is going to take the view that that can best be done in the future only by adhering to each and every structure of the past irrespective of what our objective judgment of each of them might be.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I make to the House.  We have a natural statutory consequence in the first instance and, in the second, I hope that the structure for consultation that will emerge under the new Authority will be sensitive and more effective in the future than the committee system across the board has been in the past.  I hope I will not be misunderstood. I know that there have been very positive and consistent contributions here.  I think I could actually just ask each Member of the House if he or she is satisfied that it has been an even contribution, that it has been a most effective contribution and I even think I could ask them: has it been the most effective structure for bringing Irish agriculture and all that it means in this legislation into line with present conditions, and not just farm production but more rural development?  Has it been <Col N="216" /> the most effective advanced way of doing it?</P>
    <P>That is the question I would like to put to the House.  I would take the view, as the Government do, that the structures which served us well in the past are not the structures to serve us in the future. Having said that, I will be conveying very strongly to the new Authority before putting them in place the view of Government and of the representative parties of the Oireachtas which has been clearly reflected in all of these debates.  The Bill does make provision for that.  I am sure this point has been made so I do not think I need to labour it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one small observation.  I take on board what the Minister has said and I certainly do not doubt his sincerity, but he did say that the Minister cannot direct the new board of ten as to what to do.  I accept that also; but the Oireachtas can, and we can write into this piece of legislation whatever we perceive as being in the best interests of the proposed service.  If the Minister really believes in what he has just told the House, what is to stop him from accepting Senator Ferris's amendment which just asks that Teagasc shall establish committees to assist and advice in relation to the performance of its functions? That particular amendment does not ask for county committees; it does not ask for regional committees.  It asks quite simply for an input from some of the people who it is hoped are going to benefit significantly from the new realignment, from this new service.  I am at a loss to know why the Minister is not forthcoming on this point.  I am absolutely fearful that nothing will be done because the last committees, by virtue of the fact that the Department of Finance decided that they were not going to be funded, were not even listened to.  They had absolutely no function and we saw before our very eyes, as far as ACOT are concerned, highly trained and specialised advisers being desk-bound because there was not sufficient finance for them to go and visit a farm.  Therefore, instead of becoming advisers with advice, whether <Col N="217" /> on crop husbandry or whatever, they became just pushers of paper.  It is no wonder the industry is in a decline.</P>

      <P>I do not mind objective argument, and I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach contributed in no small way through objective argument on the last occasion.

      <P>I do not know how the Senator can say an industry is in decline when it has uniquely experienced what has not been experienced by any other economic sector in the country, even with renewal of investment in the last 12 months and more.  If you are going to say it is in decline, you say it in the face of the facts.  There is a 20 per cent plus increase in farm incomes.  How can one say that is in decline?  Look at the markets we are reaching across the whole range.  Our milk prices are buoyant.  I can say for the record now, a Chathaoirligh, that within weeks of tonight there will be further increases in that sector because of market buoyancy.  Is that consistent with an industry in decline?  It is not.  Is that industry in decline where we have beef prices at an all time high right throughout the whole winter period?  Is that consistent with an industry in decline?  I do not mind Senators making a case, but please let them not make it in the face of the facts.  If we are going to make arguments let us base them on facts.  There may be a case for committees but not on the basis that Senator McDonald suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be absolutely specific on the amendment I have down. The Minister talked about the autonomy he wants this board to have.  In the previous section we interfered with some of <Col N="218" /> that autonomy because we were controlling everything, including their funds and what they might be able to do with their property.  The Government will want to interfere whenever they like. Here is an area in which, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has rightly said, the Oireachtas, which is providing the legislation giving the power to establish up this board, wants this board to act in a particular way to involve people in advising at some level other than national level.  I have been absolutely specific in the way I put the amendment because I did not want a similar structure to the country committees under the ACOT Bill.  We were foolish when we allowed the ACOT Bill to go through when it meant that we allowed the then committees to be emasculated, strangled, castrated, or any other word one wishes to use to indicate removing the effectiveness of a particular body.</P>

      <P>They are accepted veterinary terminology in the agricultural world, including &ldquo;castration&rdquo;.  It is a very effective operation if you want something to be useless.  This is what happened to county committees because effectively their power was removed.  We added to the elected members selected members from experts throughout the farming organisations.  All of us were progressive enough to believe that they had a major contribution to make.  It took them a while to get used to the position of those of us who were responsible to the electorate. That is a major responsibility. Only those of us who are elected are accountable finally at election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That did not apply to other people who were given the privilege of serving on these committees.  We carried out the functions that were laid down in the Act. They were restrictive and they did not allow the use of much imagination.  I even held a seminar in Agriculture House to try to brief members of county committees on what their new role was, how it was defined and their statutory role in setting up advisory programmes and <Col N="219" /> training for young farmers and for farmers at county level because each county was separate.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I was following what the Minister and the Government and the parliamentary draftsman obviously considered was an option for the new board, that they may establish committees to assist and advise them in relation to the performance of their functions. I want to be absolutely specific.  I want the Houses of the Oireachtas to tell this board that they should appoint these committees.  I listened to the Minister speak about when he would be making the regulations in regard to the formation of the committees, who would serve on them, what their role would be, at what level they would sit, whether at county or any other level.  The county is an acceptable administrative unit in relation to agriculture and has been proven to be by the Minister and previous Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am just being absolutely specific in that the Oireachtas are requesting the new board, Teagasc, to establish committees. They shall not have any option but they shall appoint and then we will be in line with what the Minister said. The Minister has assured us that he has no doubt that this will happen.  The one way I can be really assured is if he accepts this amendment as it is.  Then we will sit down and discuss it.  I did not include an amendment that would require this subcommittee to pay expenses to people because I felt that the Minister was hung up on these miserable expenses that were paid to a few county committee of agriculture members.  I just said that they may be paid.  It is an option.  They may pay these people or they may not pay them.  It should be optional.  If there is no obligation there is no charge on the Exchequer, but there will be at least some process of consultation and advice in the compilation of their advisory programme, their research programme and their educational programme, because we are now talking about our children who would have an interest in agriculture <Col N="220" /> and the kind of input and programme that we would like them to benefit from.</P>
    <P>How can you do that?  Do you depend on some body, half of which the Minister will appoint, the director of which he will appoint and the rest of whom will be nominated?  Do we depend on that body to be able to disseminate down along the ranks to ordinary farmers?  Do we expect the ordinary farmers to have any input whatsoever in what that programme would be?  The Minister is missing an opportunity to tap into that voluntary expertise that is available and has been available over half a century.  I realise that abolishing ACOT abolishes the county committees but I am also advising the Minister that the setting up of Teagasc with this responsibility that they shall appoint committees is also legislation and it will give them no option.  He cannot be blamed for it.  I will accept the responsibility if the Minister accepts the amendment.  He can put it on my head and every Fianna Fáil councillor in the country will welcome it.  The Minister is aware of it, because he has met them and the Taoiseach has met them and there was pleading from every unit of your organisation throughout the country, on every county council, committee, general council and all the bodies that we have all served on.  They want this kind of statutory role to be built into this Bill.  I hope the Minister will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would urge the Minister to accept this amendment to have local committees set up, possibly on a county basis, to replace the county committees of agriculture which have been abolished.  I was privileged to serve for a number of years on my own Galway County Committee of Agriculture and on the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  I know those people made a solid contribution to the affairs of agriculture within their counties and on a national basis through the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture. It is a most reasoned argument that such a forum should be set up again, possibly based on the counties, when Teagasc is set up.  This is the only opportunity we <Col N="221" /> have.  It is all right for the Minister to give an assurance here.  This is the only say we, as legislators, will have in the matter to ensure that this is written into the Bill when it becomes law.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment without a division of this House.  I notice that we have two Fianna Fáil Senators and councillors present, one rural and one urban.  Do not put the Fianna Fáil Senators who are also councillors and former members of committees of agriculture to the embarrassment of having to vote against this amendment.  I know that in their hearts they do not want to vote against this amendment.  I know from my own colleagues on Galway County Council that they wish to have a body representative of the elected members.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment.  We will all agree on that.  It would be the will of all the people here if they had a free conscience and a free vote on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication might have been that they existed only for the collection of travelling expenses.  We explained that the only funding that was made available to these people was for travelling.  Certainly there was no contribution made to them for the time they lost.  I would also like to take up a point made by the Minister in relation to decline or growth in the value or the output of agriculture in the last year. It may not be totally relevant but the Minister raised it.  I would remind the Minister when he speaks about growth in agriculture that last year cattle numbers decreased by 5 per cent.  I am sure he knows that milk production, by quota restriction, decreased by 1½ per cent, that pig numbers decreased by 1 per cent and <Col N="222" /> that cow numbers decreased by almost 4 per cent.  Those are the figures supplied to me by An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this morning that he had total confidence in their research and in the advice they offer.  That is an industry in decline.  That is the only way you can measure whether an industry is growing or whether it is declining.  It is not the value.  We have the fortunate accident now of the value increasing in the market because for the first time &mdash; and we are not taking advantage of the opportunities before us &mdash; the supply market is below equilibrium on the right side for us.  We have had a fall in milk output because of the quota restriction.  The fall in pig meat output is because we have not got a policy for the pig meat industry.  Admittedly, our sheep output went up by 8 per cent last year, that is on the positive side, but on all the other enterprises we went down.  These figures were supplied by the Minister's own Department and &mdash; more importantly because I would have to take greater heed of them &mdash; by An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just take the first points that have been made by Senator Connor.  He points out that there was a decline in cattle numbers of 5 per cent last year and that the milk quota restriction meant there was a reduction in milk output last year.  That is a fact.  I think Senator Connor is close enough to rural life to know that, if there was a decline in cattle numbers of 5 per cent last year, the cause of that was not last year but previous years.  You do not suddenly press a button and produce a three year old bullock for slaughter in a factory.  It is what you do in 1985 that gives you the cattle population of 1988 and the consequences of what you did not do in 1985 is what we may be witnessing in 1987 and 1988.  I am glad to tell Senator Connor &mdash; and I think he would want to know this as well, and the figures will also indicate it &mdash; that that trend is well and truly changing.  We would want to recognise this fact.  Slaughterings of cows and heifers this year are down by 20 per cent over last year.  That in itself could be <Col N="223" /> argued either way beyond the reassuring fact, which Senators may not want to consider, that artificial inseminations are up almost 15 per cent this year over last year.  These are facts.  What does that represent?  As I have said many times, Government policy, and not just that of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, is directed to ensuring the improvement of the economic environment in which farmers operate by bringing down interest rates, by reducing cost inputs and by bringing down inflation.  All of this has meant that farmers, being prudent managers, are now retaining their cows and not sending them to slaughter.  They are now inseminating them where previously they were slaughtering them.</P>
      <P>The facts are there.  It has to be acknowledged, and the farmers know that conditions have improved considerably. I regret if there are some who would prefer to conceal those facts, but those are the realities.  There is no point in anyone here trying to give the impression that an industry is in decline which is making a remarkable recovery and is attacking the markets in a way that will ensure that we will see consistently buoyant prices.  That is the commitment of this Government in everything we do in all our range of our actions, either in dairying or in beef.  Farmers know that Irish agriculture, in the broadest sense of agriculture, is now in a buoyant situation, will continue that way and that no amount of talk is going to put it into depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is this.  If there are milk quota restrictions, of course they apply all round; and, as I said before, that is a consequence of decisions that were taken before we came into Government. I am not going to make any boast that we could have done a better job. They were European decisions and we inherited the decisions.  It is fair to say that in inheriting them we have managed the consequences much better than had been done previously.  We are ensuring that we do not lose one gallon of milk. This is being done through the whole milk restructuring programmes we have <Col N="224" /> introduced and through new leasing programmes in milk which have not been done anywhere else.  The product supply in Ireland in the dairy sector is much better than tht available anywhere else in Europe, and this is one of the advantages we have to use.  The Dutch and the Germans are coming over here to launch joint ventures with us because they know that we have the product they do not have.  In the face of those facts &mdash; the buoyant prices and the market attack we are pursuing vigorously &mdash; please do not tell us that we are looking at an agricultural industry in decline, because we are not.</P>
    <P>I come back now to the point that has been made by Senator Ferris on the committee issue, which is the one we are dealing with.  Senator Ferris's amendment says &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I am to give a direction to do something which, as Senator Ferris sees it, represents the wishes of the Oireachtas.  This is not as I see it, as it happens, nor the farming associations &mdash; that you &ldquo;shall&rdquo; establish committees.  You do not even tell them in that ministerial direction what kind of committees they shall establish.  You are just telling them: &ldquo;It does not matter; you shall establish committees&rdquo;.  I am not prepared to tell any Authority, or the Government are not, and I represent here the wishes of the Government.  I am not prepared to tell any Authority: &ldquo;You shall establish committees for whatever purpose or wherever, possibly or probably based on counties&rdquo;.  I cannot do that. Let me give you some examples why I cannot.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a new rural development in all its forms.  Everything that is included in this is very different from what has been done before.  The county committees did not deal with private forestry, but they can now.  They did not deal with agri-tourism, but they can now.  They could not deal with a whole range of things in terms of rural development &mdash; it could be rural infrastructures, small industries, craft industries &mdash; but they can now.  All of these things are open to those committees that will be <Col N="225" /> established by what will be a representative, enlightened Authority.  I am not prepared to tell them: &ldquo;You shall establish committees&rdquo; and the Government are not prepared to issue them with an edict of that kind.  That is not the way we deal with things.  We do not say: &ldquo;You shall establish committees&rdquo; and then: &ldquo;Whatever the committee's function will be is another day's work; we are telling you to establish them anyway&rdquo;.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>What I have said &mdash; and it is a matter of bona fides &mdash; is that we have given them the power here.  Let me say openly and honestly that I would expect the new Authority would require at least six months to reflect on the kind of local or county or whatever representative input they want, dealing with various types of activities, be it agriculture in a conventional sense or other matters across the range of agriculture &mdash; beef, dairy, cereals and so on, alternative land usage, things we never even contemplated when these committees were set up years ago. The Government want to display that much trust in Teagasc.  I do not think that by implication you can denigrate it on the basis that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, will nominate people.  It is not our intention to put people into a body that is of such importance for the future just for the sake of somehow suppressing development in Irish agriculture. We do not have that death wish for ourselves or for Irish agriculture.  We do not intend to do that, and the facts will prove it.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I can go.  Believe me, I am not resisting this for the sake of doing so, far from it.  I think the arguments speak for themselves.  As I have already indicated, I will convey on my own behalf and that of the Government our views to Teagasc that they should as soon as is feasible consider an appropriate form of committee both in terms of its constitution and in terms of its activities.  It may vary from place to place. The structures are different in different parts of Irish agriculture, and we all know that.  In 1988 let us start using the instruments of 1988.  I can only say that I wish <Col N="226" /> the Dutch gentlemen that I have been speaking to were in to listen to this debate.  We want to go out and beat those fellows &mdash; not compete with them, beat them &mdash; but we are not going to do it by harping back to old ways and old instruments.</P>

      <P>May I make one final point?  May I just say finally that when the Minister was giving the title to this body he did not say to them: &ldquo;You may be called that awful word Teagasc;&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;You shall be called Teagasc.&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, where it suited the Minister and suited the Government, recurs over and over again throughout the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very specific. This is a House of legislation, not just some nominating body.  This is a House that sets down laws and it requires certain things to be done.  The Minister, in a further part of his response, said that he and the Government would contact this board and tell them that they should set them up.  What is the difference in the past tense of &ldquo;should&rdquo; and the present tense of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  There is no difference whatsoever.  Either they should or they should not do it.  That they &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it is a totally different option.  They may or may not do it.  He is telling us now that <Col N="227" /> he will ring up and tell them that they should do it.</P>
      <P>I am telling him to legislate that they shall do it.  It is as simple as that.  There is no big stick about it.  It is not the same structure as before.  It is nothing like the old county committee.  It is none of these things.  It is the requirement to consult with experts at whatever level and I am quite sure that if the board had this direction they would come back to the Minister for advice, and advice from the Government, about what sort of structures the Houses of the Oireachtas required.  He can then bring regulations before us for discussion and we might make recommendations about the kind of people that should be involved in this, and we would be only happy to do so.</P>

As I said earlier, before the Minister arrived, I am sure that if we were to check the legislation that has gone through in recent times there are many precedents where Ministers enshrined in legislation for bodies being set up that they shall appoint advisers or committees or whatever.  I have been really appalled in the last few minutes.  I made a plea earlier that it was a pity we did not have this debate with the Minister present, that it was the Minister of State who was here.</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister would not regret it if he were to accede to these amendments at least in part if not in full.  He spoke earlier of allowing a time to see how it would work out. Even if he were to accede to the amendment and then give it some time to see how it worked out he could change it at a further date.  To wipe out all these committees all over the country with a <Col N="229" /> stroke of the pen is not the answer. Granted, over the last few years their powers have been diminished and they have not played as great a part as they did previously, but to eliminate them as is suggested in this legislation is too harsh a decision and it is one that I am sure the Minister will live to regret.  I was appalled at the Minister's last two contributions. I thought I was listening to a political broadcast or an Ard-Fheis speech where he was outlining the benefits accruing to agriculture since he took office.  I could take the Minister to farms not too far from where we are sitting just now where, in the last six months, the banks have a greater interest in the farm than the farmer.  I could take the Minister to a farm less than a half an hour from here where the farmer, his wife and two children drove out of that yard and emigrated, leaving the farm behind them because they owed more than the farm was worth.  That is not too far from this city.</P>

I believe that the smaller the locality the greater the volume of the advice coming from it.  Let me again make the point to the Minister that it is not only the advice that one would get from these committees of <Col N="230" /> agriculture but also their value in bringing back into agriculture the advice that he or his advisers would wish farmers to take into account.  It is a two-way process. They are an extremely important link and I would ask the Minister not to break the link with this legislation.</P>

      <P>May I make a brief comment? I will not repeat what I said earlier but I must express my disappointment with the final comments of the Minister in which he indicated clearly that he saw the future development of Irish agriculture almost ruling out entirely any of the functions or bodies which were part of the agricultural scene up to the present day.  If that is his attitude then we can see straightaway the reasons why Teagasc may, rather than, shall set up sub-committees. He stated that he does not want to bear down on them with a heavy hand and that they must have a great deal of discretion but, as Senator Connor rightly stated, the Bill is full of instructions about what Teagasc shall do.  They have very little discretion.  If the Minister is seriously committed to seeing a system of sub-committees set up throughout the country the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be inserted here, but from what we have heard here tonight he is not.  I regret that, but it is quite clear that he does not see the same role for county committees or sub-committees as we do.  I believe that we should press ahead with our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent decision by the Minister for Finance not to reappoint a director to the board of Irish Life Assurance Company Limited and the appointment of two new directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for coming in at this late hour to take this matter on the Adjournment. I do not intend to refer to these people by name but it is very difficult not to do so.  I apologise in advance if I refer to the directors involved by name and I hope I will not do so.</P>
      <P>I was very disturbed when I saw that the Minister for Finance had failed to reappoint one particular director of Irish Life the week before last.  The reason for this was that this man had been a director of Irish Life for 43 years.  He had 43 years experience of which he was managing director for 17 years.  He retired as managing director in 1983 and continued on as a non-executive director from 1984 to 1988.  This man, who had been chief executive and continued on the board, had come to Irish Life straight from university and had served a lifetime in the company up to a couple of weeks ago.  He had advanced through the ranks of Irish Life, which was unusual for a member of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This director, who was not re-elected by the votes of the Minister for Finance, was not a political appointment.  He came <Col N="235" /> up through the ranks.  It has been normal &mdash; and I regret it enormously, as do many other independent Senators &mdash; for certain members of the board of Irish Life to be appointed by Governments as a political favour.  In other words, people are appointed because of political loyalties. I regret this but it has happened.  They have also failed to be re-elected when the Government who appointed them have gone out of office and the next Government have decided to appoint somebody else as a political favour.  It is nothing else.  These people may be well qualified but the Government make a political decision to appoint them.  Many of them have been very closely identified with political parties.</P>
    <P>The chief executive who became a non-executive director was not appointed due to political favour.  His was not a political appointment originally and that is why this is such an alarming removal.  He was a man who moved up, who was a career man in Irish Life.  Had it been one or two of those who had been appointed by the Opposition when they were in Government it would have been regrettable but more understandable.  In this case it did not apply.  That director was, after 43 years, treated disgracefully.  I regret this enormously because he had given such long service to Irish Life and because his was in no way a politicial appointment.</P>
    <P>It leaves Irish Life with only one executive director.  All the other directors are non-executive.  It would seem to me that to have an ex-managing director, an exchief executive on the board would have been very sensible at a very crucial time. Now they are left with only one executived director and a board which is lacking in experience.  Five out of the nine non-executive directors of Irish Life now have fewer than two years experience between them.  The director in question had, on top of that, presided over glorious years of expansion for Irish Life. He was regarded and recognised as the architect of this great expansion.  It is an unworthy way to reward a man and to thank him for the dedication and the duty which he has given to this company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The second point which I would like the Minister to answer concerns the timing of this removal.  The director was given unprecedentedly little notice of the fact that he was not going to be re-elected. The normal practice in Irish Life is that the Department of Finance are given notice well before the annual report goes to the printers of who is and who is not going to be standing for re-election. Once that is conveyed to the Minister involved and the Department they know and usually convey whether those individuals will get support.  In this case the director was allowed to put his name forward; his name appeared as going forward for re-election.  He was not notified until it was too late that he was not going to be re-elected because he was not going to get the support of the Government. Not only was he not re-elected, he was also humiliated, which I believe is an appalling way to reward a man who has given such dedication and such a lifetime of service to this State company.</P>
    <P>There are other elements of these appointments which are alarming.  I do not question, because I do not know anything about her, the ordinary board appointment that has been made.  It would be totally unfair for me to query her ability in any way.  I am sure she is a very able person, but I was a little alarmed when the Taoiseach said in the Dáil today that she was appointed because she was a woman.  Those were his words.  It is a pity if that is why she was appointed. It is a bad reason for appointing someone. Irish Life may well lack a woman on the board as a director but to appoint someone because she is a woman and to remove somebody else because the Government want a woman on the board is ill-considered and is based on a false doctrine of tokenism.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a new chairman also gives certain cause for concern.  The new chairman undoubtedly was a very distinguished civil servant and a very distinguished Governor of the Central Bank, but it seems to me that these two people have been parachuted onto the board of Irish Life without any consultations with the board.  I would like to <Col N="237" /> hear whether these appointments were superimposed, whether the board had prior notice of them, whether the board were consulted and whether the board were happy with them.</P>
    <P>The picture that is building up is that Irish Life is being manipulated as an arm of the Government and Irish Life is not acting, or being allowed to act, in an independent way.  It is undoubtedly true that the last chairman retired voluntarily and it would have been very easy for the board of Irish Life to decide of their own accord who would be the next chairman. I do not believe they got adequate notice of the Government's intention and I do not believe they were adequately consulted on this point.  It broke with the long-standing tradition of not appointing civil servants to this board.  The suspicion is undoubtedly abroad &mdash; and I have heard it voiced in many parts of the business world recently &mdash; that the appointment was made because he is the Minister's man.  That is a very dangerous type of accusation because it threatens the independent stance of Irish Life.  He is safe, he is not in the first flush of youth, but his beliefs are very much in keeping with the thinking of the Government. That is a pity.</P>
    <P>The real issue at stake is whether Irish Life, at this very critical time when privatisation is on the line, when it is almost certainly coming, is a State-owned company solely or whether it is a State-run company as well.  It is no secret that Irish Life have been well run like a private company for the very good reason that they have to compete in a very competitive financial world with private companies. One of the obvious symptoms of that is that the Devlin salary scales have not in practice applied in Irish Life.  It would have been impossible for Irish Life to recruit the sort of talent which they undoubtedly have in the financial world and to compete without paying well over these scales, as they have done.  But these appointments, and this removal of a man who has done so much in that period, indicates to many that the Department of Finance's heavy hand is going to be guiding Irish Life in the near future.  If <Col N="238" /> that is the case, if it is going to be taking directions from the Department of Finance, then so be it, let us find out and let us know.  What is important is that we know what the thinking behind these appointments is.</P>
    <P>I believe that Irish Life now face privatisation with a highly inexperienced board but possibly a more pliable one.  I would like to hear what the thinking behind this is.  I can anticipate the Government saying it is their prerogative to appoint people to the board of Irish Life and to remove people as they come up for re-election.  I do not believe that is enough.  It is their prerogative and I accept that, but that does not mean they should not be accountable.</P>
    <P>As a final point, I should like to ask the Minister whether he would consider that there should be a total review of the system of appointing people to semi-State bodies, to State bodies and even of judges.  It is a great pity that we have this merry-go-round of political parties appointing some people, their coming up for re-election on the semi-State bodies, their not being re-appointed because their party is not in power and <i>vice versa</i>, going backwards and forwards.  As a result of this people are not necessarily appointed exclusively on merit.  There is a great deal to be said for the American system where judges, political appointments of that sort and and people in high positions in State bodies and semi-State bodies are questioned about their role and those who appoint them are also questioned about their role.</P>
    <P>I find these appointments disturbing.  I do not see any deep sinister plot here but they are disturbing simply because they indicte a change in the way this great company have been organised and they fail to recognise the man who actually steered that organisation and remove him from the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual to find in the course of a debate that one cannot agree with anything a Senator has said.  This is the case but there is absolutely no need for the Senator to be disturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> I regret that the Senator has felt it necessary to make an issue of the appointment of directors to the board.  The position in relation to Irish Life is quite clear. Like all other State-owned bodies it is up to the responsible Minister to select who he will appoint to the board on the State's behalf.  In the case of Irish Life which is an ordinary share company, and in which as Minister I hold a 91 per cent stake, the appointment of directors is the exercise of a shareholder's right.  The Senator, with his wide experience of company law, would not, I am sure, object to the exercise of shareholders' rights.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events two directorships of Irish Life fell due for filling or re-appointment.  In the case of one director the incumbent made known to me his decision not to seek re-election. The Government considered the position and settled on two names to go forward as the nominees for election as directors at the annual general meeting of the company. These names were communicated to the company in the normal way and during May 1988 I wrote to both retiring directors, thanking them for their long and valuable service to the board.  As the Senator knows, one of the retiring directors had decided on his own initiative to seek re-election but later withdrew his name.  At the annual general meeting of the company on 26 May my representative, who exercised a proxy on my behalf, conveyed the appreciation of the Government in unstinting terms to the retiring directors.  I can only re-echo those sentiments.  Both directors had a long association with the company and played no small part in developing it into the major financial institution which it now is.</P>
    <P>Changes in the board of directors of the company are by no means a rare occurrence.  For the record, the following changes have been made to the board in recent times:</P>
    <P>in 1981 two of the Minister's nominees were co-opted to fill vacancies that arose on the board in 1980; they <Col N="240" /> were subsequently elected at the annual general meeting;</P>
    <P>in 1982 two directors retired and one nominee was elected;</P>
    <P>in 1983 one of two retiring directors was re-elected, a nominee was elected to fill the second vacancy;</P>
    <P>in 1984 one nominee was co-opted to fill the vacancy existing since 1982 and another was co-opted to fill a vacancy arising from the resignation of a director; both were subsequently elected;</P>
    <P>in 1985 two retiring directors were re-elected;</P>
    <P>in 1986 one retiring director was re-elected and a nominee was elected in place of a second;</P>
    <P>in 1987 two nominees were elected in place of two retiring directors;</P>
    <P>This year as the Senator is aware, the situation was the same as that in 1987.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the principal difference this year from last is the long association between the two retiring directors and Irish Life.  While recognising the important contribution existing directors can make, I believe that it is healthy and valuable to introduce new faces to the board on occasion.  I would say that as a general principle applying to all boards, not just that of Irish Life.  The application of this principle does not imply dissatisfaction with or even ingratitude to outgoing directors.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by some to an unbalanced board following the recent AGM.  I find these comments somewhat wide of the mark.  The two new directors are very well qualified and, I know, will make a valuable contribution to the board.  The experience they have lies in related financial fields, and both of them have important expertise at director level in commercial and administrative fields. The Taoiseach made it clear earlier today that one of the appointments was made specifically because there was no woman member on the board.  Together the directors on the board bring to bear a <Col N="241" /> wide range of knowledge and skills from the business, accounting, legal and financial worlds, throughout the whole island.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this board structure is well equipped to deal with what promises to be an interesting few years for the company.  Important decisions fall to be taken concerning the company's future.  Irish Life is expanding into new markets and searching for new horizons. It has in some ways out-grown the local market.  Some of the basic facts on Irish Life portray this.  Funds under the management of the company total nearly £3 billion; these include policyholders' funds of £2.5 billion.  Its market share in Ireland is over 40 per cent.  Irish Life has major investments in every sector of Irish economic life, including holdings of gilts of about £1.3 billion.  The company has, in addition, a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies at home and abroad. In the financial services sector it has a majority shareholding in a major domestic insurer, Church and General, and a 25 per cent shareholding in Irish Intercontinental Bank.</P>
    <P>It has exercised its commitment to the development of the economic structure of the State in a responsible manner over the years.  This commitment is further shown by the company's active participation in the International Financial Services Centre.  The Government acknowledge and appreciate the important role played by Irish Life in these spheres.  I as Minister of course do not direct the normal investment management operations of the company.  It makes its decision on the same criteria as other investment institutions with whom it competes.</P>
    <P>The strength of the company is manifest in its successful expansion into the highly competitive UK market.  Irish Life established branches there in 1967 and since that time its premium income has increased from £3 million to £57 million. The company has recently expanded into the US market with its purchase of Inter State Assurance Company in Iowa.  It is a sign of the company's vitality that it is ready to compete in the US insurance <Col N="242" /> market.  I am sure that Senators will join me in wishing the company every success in this new venture.</P>
    <P>Inevitably any discussion on Irish Life nowadays get round at some time to the question of a capital restructuring of the company.  I do not wish to go into the ins and outs of this matter here tonight.  The arguments for and against a capital reorganisation were set out very fully by me on 1 March last.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the Government are examining this question fully and an early decision will be made.  Irish Life plays an important part in the commercial life of the State.  It is only right that all the issues involved should be carefully weighed.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when the Bill which allowed Irish Life to take over Church and General was being debated, Senators on both sides of the House paid warm tribute to the company and its performance. Amongst the Senators who spoke there was a visible pride in the achievements of the company.  Some remembered the very humble beginnings of the company; others were conscious of the fact that in the insurance field the company was not alone in direct competition with far bigger foreign based institutions, but was showing these institutions how to do business.</P>
    <P>I believe Senators will recognise that the Government are anxious that the success story should continue and that, in exercising their duty in the appointments to the board, this Government, like others who preceded us, have discharged their functions in a responsible way.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for what he has just said.  I would ask him to answer one or two of the questions I put to him.  I find it totally unsatisfactory. What consultation went on with the Irish Life board about these appointments or were they imposed?  Why was the director who was not re-elected not given adequate notice and treated in that way? Thirdly, why is there so little experience on the Irish Life board now, when five out of the nine directors have less than <Col N="243" /> two years' experience?  Is this satisfactory? Finally, what criteria were used to appoint the new chairman and to remove the non-executive director?</P>

      <P>The Senator was not listening.  These names were communicated to the company in the normal way during the month of May, well in advance of the annual general meeting which took place on 26 May.  As regards consultations with the board, 91 per cent of the shares are held by the Minister for Finance and it is his right.</P>

      <P>That is the Senator's view but it is not the view generally held either by the board of Irish Life or the community at large.  The Senator questioned the ability of the new board in so far as he made reference to their experience. I have no doubt whatsoever that this board will make a contribution to the future of Irish Life in the same way as any of their predecessors.</P>

      <P>I can take it from the Minister's reply that there was no consultation with the board whatsoever.</P>
