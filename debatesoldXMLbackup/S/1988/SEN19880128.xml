      <P>I have notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The closure of Barrington's Hospital, Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The possibility of siting the administrative headquarters of the proposed National Forestry Authority in Castlerea, County Roscommon, as part of the Government's decentralisation policy.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The condition of the paintings in the possession of the National Gallery of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Energy to implement in full the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kennedy, Connor, Norris and Doyle as <Col N="844" /> suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Kennedy's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Connor, Norris and Doyle may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed but I wish to raise two points. First, I wish to thank the Government for agreeing to take the all-party motion on the Constitution which I believe will be taken next week and the week after.  I am very pleased about this.  It will be a very valuable debate.  I would like to give notice that under Standing Order 29 I intend to propose the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with dismay and concern the suppression of the Stalker-Sampson report by the British Government and the failure to prosecute RUC officers involved in the shoot-to-kill policy and supports the efforts of the Irish Government and of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to have this reversed.</P>
      <P>Because of the obvious public concern and importance of this I will be invoking Standing Order 29 to have an urgent debate on this matter today.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I do not think Senator Manning needed to give notice at this point.  He could have given notice in writing and I would have ruled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>To reiterate the first point made by Senator Manning on the question of a debate on the Constitution I would like to place on record my thanks for the co-operation of all the Whips, and the Government side in particular, in allowing this discussion to take place.  I look forward to it and urge Senators to contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> I would like to establish once and for all when we will get to the next stage of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  I would just stress that there are people out there worrying and waiting for this legislation to be enacted and there are families under stress on account of it.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to put the pressure on whichever Minister it is who is delaying the matter to get it before us.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House about Item No. 13 which is the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  In the light of the matter which has just been referred to by Senator Manning and in the light of the Birmingham Six trial of today, as well as the Stalker report earlier in the week, we have a clear responsibility to our citizens to make sure that, when we extradite them, we extradite them with proper evidence against them.  This is a matter of urgency and a matter which must be addressed.  We cannot abnegate our responsibilities to our citizens.  We must have confidence in the legal system to which we are extraditing them and we must also be confident there is a case against them.  I urge that this item should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Constitution which the Government have agreed should be taken as an all-party motion.  It is appropriate that we should look at the Constitution after 50 years and I hope the two week debate will afford many of the experts on constitutional matters who are in this House an opportunity to state their case.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Manning's request under Standing Order 29, to which I hope you will agree, could the Leader of the House in responding to the Order of Business indicate what the format will be if the debate is allowed?  Will it be the normal format under Standing Order 29 or will all Members of the House be allowed to make contributions as we did on the last occasion?</P>

      <P>That generosity has been tested in recent times.  Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat down.  I did not want to test your generosity any further. I simply want to reiterate a number of things Senator O'Toole said.  The Adoption (No. 2) Bill was, and still is, a relatively non-controversial issue.  Let us remind ourselves what it is about.  It is about making it possible to adopt children who currently cannot be the subject of legal adoption processes.  I would like to know if there is a problem because, if there is a problem, perhaps this House can attempt to influence public opinion by discussing it.  If there is a delay because of a constitutional issue, then so be it.</P>
      <P>The best thing to do is to get the legislation through and have it tested in the courts.  I am absolutely certain that the Irish people would support an amendment which would make provision for this but we cannot do anything by simply sitting on it and hoping it will go away. It is an important piece of legislation and I appeal to the Leader of the House to use his influence with the Government to get progress on the Bill.  It is not long or complex.  It may well be difficult in terms of constitutional problems; it is neither complex nor long in terms of parliamentary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Senator O'Toole said about Item No. 13, the Leader of the House should give serious consideration to allowing that Bill to be discussed because it is now of vital importance.  We are fortunate that we live in a society where murder and coverups <Col N="847" /> by the police are not tolerated.  I am not very happy about having people extradited to a jurisdiction where it appears that the public interest can justify the most extraordinary activities by the security forces and therefore I cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot make a speech now on Item No. 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I did not make a speech.  I simply wanted to express my point of view on why it should be taken.  I do really think that Item No. 13 is now extremely relevant in terms of the vulnerability of Irish people under what is called justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House consider taking Item No. 54 which is a motion in the names of some of the Fine Gael Senators regarding the plight of Irish illegal emigrants in the USA?  There was a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday about a girl from Cork, Catherine Fitzgerald.  Under the new Immigration Control Act in the United States the immigration authorities have started to round up illegal Irish people and now they are taking them to police precincts in New York. We should have this discussion as a matter of urgency to see if the Government can help in some way to alleviate the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the efforts of other Senators to bring the Adoption (No. 2) Bill back into the House as soon as possible.  It is very important legislation, affecting the lives of young children.  The children who would have been affected by it six months ago when the Second Stage of the Bill was discussed in the House are now six months older.  The sooner it can be passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas the better.  I support the previous speakers on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of many Members is to bring forward the Committee Stage of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  I can assure them that concerns me as well.  The Whip and I are getting fed up of being fobbed off with excuses as to why the Bill cannot be brought forward.  We will do our utmost to ensure that it is in this House either next week or the week after.  Every effort will be made to ensure that it comes forward. Senator W. Ryan has done most of the negotiations on this and he is fed up of being fobbed off and I can assure the House it will not continue.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Constitution was not a matter of controversy.  It was a matter of getting a suitable time and a suitable format to take the discussion. We will take the item next Thursday and Thursday week.  There should be a good discussion on that very important item.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I said that Items Nos. 2 and 3 were being taken. Now that there is a suggestion that there may be a request under Standing Order 29 before us, it is doubtful that we will reach Item No. 2 today at the risk of being out of order.  If it is taken I suggest to the House that the Minister should have 15 minutes, that other speakers should take no longer than ten minutes and that the debate should conclude within an hour, if the Cathaoirleach gives permission for it to be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Reynolds that Item No. 54 is a matter of urgency.  The <Col N="849" /> Senator will have an opportunity to bring that forward as a Fine Gael motion with the agreement of his group.  Without putting words into his mouth, there are other methods he could use within Standing Orders if he gets the permission of his group to bring it forward again.  It is not intended to take Item No. 13 at this stage.</P>

    <Title>Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill further amends the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, first by broadening the power of the Housing Finance Agency to advance money to housing authorities; secondly, by increasing the amount the agency may borrow to lend to housing authorities from £500 million to £1,000 million; and thirdly, by empowering the Minister for the Environment to contribute towards the costs of the agency. Before dealing with the amendments in more detail, I think it would be useful to speak briefly about the Housing Finance Agency and its changing role.</P>
      <P>The role of the Housing Finance Agency has been evolving gradually since it was established in 1981.  It started out with the task of raising funds by way of index-linked bonds and lending these funds to individual borrowers on modest incomes who would repay them on an income-related basis.  The agency used the housing authorities as agents to process loan applications and to collect repayments.  It soon became obvious that this was not the ideal arrangement and, in 1986, the housing authorities were given full responsibility for income-related loans, with the agency simply providing the necessary funds.</P>
      <P>The income-related and convertible loan schemes &mdash; the latter introduced in 1986 &mdash; provide a source of loan finance to those on modest incomes and have enabled thousands of people to purchase their own homes who would not otherwise have been able to do so.  Taken with the traditional annuity loan scheme which the housing authorities operate, they provide a comprehensive range of mortgage facilities for people on modest incomes who cannot obtain funds elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes made in July 1986 meant that the agency no longer lent money to individual borrowers, although it will still continue to have responsibility for those to whom it lent money before that date. <Col N="851" /> It was recognised that this change would leave the agency free to devote more time to the raising of funds and, accordingly, it was decided last year that its remit would be widened to include the funding of annuity loans as well as the income-related and convertible loans.  As a result of this decision, the agency lent to housing authorities last year twice the amount provided by the Local Loans Fund and it will provide all the funds being raised for publicly funded house loans in 1988.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the various changes which have taken place is that we now have a comprehensive package of loans available for people of modest means and a single agency providing the funding for these loans.  This Bill will complete the statutory framework for this arrangement.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill spells out the purposes for which the Housing Finance Agency may lend money to housing authorities. The change which the section effects is to empower the agency to advance moneys to enable a housing authority to make loans for the purpose of carrying out improvement works to houses and to pay essential repairs and disabled persons grants.  These grants are included in the public capital programme under the provision for house purchase and improvement loans etc. and, at present, funds to provide for their payment may be advanced to housing authorities from the Local Loans Fund.  It is entirely in keeping with the wider role of the agency that it should now become the source of the funds needed by housing authorities for these grants and for improvement loans.  As far as housing authorities are concerned, the funds will be provided to them by the agency on the same terms as they would have obtained them from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The present borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency is £500 million and it is anticipated that this will be reached during 1988.  The new limit of £1,000 million provided for in section 3 of the Bill should enable the agency to fulfil its role as the principal source of <Col N="852" /> finance for publicly funded house purchase and improvement loans for the next four to five years.  Of course, the agency's borrowing requirement in 1988 would have been greater but for the arrangements announced last October whereby the building societies and banks have agreed to increase their lending to persons who would normally be seeking local authority loans.</P>
    <P>The participation of the commercial agencies in this sector of the mortgage market is very welcome and has enabled the public capital programme provision for house purchase loans to be reduced by £55 million with a consequent reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £45 million and in the Housing Finance Agency's borrowing requirement of £10 million.  Happily, the early indications are that the new arrangements are now working well. There were some teething problems at the start but I am glad to say they have now been ironed out and it is working quite well.  I am quite pleased with it.  If anybody has complaints, I would be very grateful to hear them and to take them on board and have them investigated.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the making by the Minister for the Environment of contributions towards the costs of the Housing Finance Agency. The need for these contributions arose because of the agency's inability to raise index-linked funds in the market in recent years.  The changed conditions prevailing in the markets &mdash; low inflation, high real interest rates etc. &mdash; meant that index-linked stock had become unattractive to the financial institutions and the agency had, therefore, to rely disproportionately on costly short term borrowing to fund its operations.  Naturally, this had adverse effects on its financial position since its operations were geared to index-linked borrowings.</P>
    <P>Following a review of its operations in 1986, a special capital injection of £7 million was made available to the agency in order to place it on a firm financial footing.  It was also decided to allow the agency to borrow long term funds on a conventional basis and, if appropriate, to <Col N="853" /> avail of foreign currency loans.  It was recognised, of course, that this change in the financing arrangements would have ongoing implications for the finances of the agency as it would not in the short term be able to match the cost of funds raised by it with the income derived from income-related loan payments.  Accordingly, the difference between the cost of conventional borrowing and what would be the cost of raising the same money by issuing index-linked bonds at a real interest rate of 4 per cent is paid by the Exchequer to the agency by way of an interest swop arrangement.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the interest swop arrangement is the same as if the State were to borrow money in the normal way and invest it in Housing Finance Agency index-linked bonds.  Of course, such bonds would, as well as paying the 4 per cent interest, be increasing in value so that, on maturity, the real value would be maintained.  A similar arrangement will apply to the interest swop arrangment with the result that the increase in the value will ultimately accrue to the State at the end of the loan priod.  The contribution to the agency on foot of the interest swop arrangment in 1987 was £9 million.  The provision for 1988 is £11 million but it is expected that, on the basis of current interest and exchange rate trends and the increasing capacity of the agency to fund loans from capital repayments, the size of the contribution will decrease gradually over the years. Section 4 of the Bill validates contributions already made under the interest swop arrangement and future contributions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill are designed to broaden the power of the agency to lend money to local authorities; to provide for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit of the agency and to validate and provide for future contributions to the agency. These amendments are necessary to ensure that the agency can continue its valuable contribution to the financing of local authority loans for those on modest incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated in his opening speech, the purpose of the Bill before the House is to amend the Housing Finance Agency Act of 1981. The purpose of the Bill, as outlined, is twofold, first, to increase from £500 million to £1,000 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow to fund house purchase loans and, secondly, to empower the Minister for the Environment to contribute towards the cost of the agency.  The Housing Finance agency was established in 1981.  It is only right at this stage to look at the record of the agency.  It was established to raise funds by way of index-linked bonds and to lend funds to borrowers on a modest income who could repay them on an income-related basis.</P>
      <P>Shortly after my election to a local authority, I advocated a view which was unfashionable at the time.  I saw that if people were able to rent their houses from local authorities in proportion to their incomes, it was possible to find a mechanism by which people on modest incomes could purchase their own homes and make the necessary repayments on an income-related basis.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency achieved this very purpose.  Indeed, it made a tremendous impact on Irish society. Many people, who were on the housing lists of local authorities, with little or no chance of being housed because they would never have sufficient points, were able, through the Housing Finance Agency, to purchase their own homes.  In 1982 the agency advanced £50 million; in 1983, £55 million; in 1984 £71 million; in 1985 £91 million; and in 1986 £78 million. From these figures it will be seen that it has certainly fulfilled a very valuable role and achieved its aim in making available to people in a particular income bracket the necessary finance to purchase their own houses.  Of course, the agency was not favourably received by all political parties.  The Minister's own party was opposed to the principle of the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some people, especially the occupants <Col N="855" /> of local authority houses who were living in very overcrowded accommodation, there was a very serious problem in finding the necessary deposit to purchase a new house under the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  This was solved by the previous Government when they allowed grants of £5,000 to tenants and tenant purchasers to purchase their own local authority dwellings or to build houses for their own occupation.  Indeed, so successful was that scheme that the Chairman of the Housing Finance Agency in his annual report of 1986 referred to the extent of the agency's loan activities, stating that a factor in the increased demand for the loans in the period was the success of the £5,000 grant scheme for tenants and tenant purchasers. Unfortunately, the present Government abolished the £5,000 grant scheme and the £2,250 grant for new houses which was available to people in a similar category.  At the same time they abolished the house improvement grants which were available to people of all incomes for the purpose of improving and refurbishing the housing stock of the country.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the situation further deteriorated.  We must take into account the Minister's circular, H10/87, to all local authorities in which they were told that the capital available to individual housing authorities for public funded house purchase loans in 1988 would be at a level not exceeding &ldquo;60 per cent of the amount of allocation now standing notified for the current year&rdquo;.  The circular goes on to say that this is the kernel of the arrangement announced by the Minister and that apparently the banks and building societies had been taken on to provide funding for a number of people who otherwise would qualify for SDA loans or Housing Finance Agency loans. Anyone who, in future, applies to a local authority, for example, Meath County Council, Galway County Council or Monaghan County Council, for an SDA loan will not even be allowed to fill out an application form.  They will be told that they first must go to a building society <Col N="856" /> or a bank.  Only persons refused by both a building society and a bank may apply to a local authority for a loan.  It is not even that simple.  They must also have documentation for the local authorities stating that they were refused both by a bank and a building society.</P>
    <P>The circular goes on to say that, provided the local authority are satisfied that the applicant has genuinely sought and has been refused a loan suitable to his need from a building society or a bank, the local authority may consider the applicant in the normal way.  People on a certain income, which we all regard as a very modest income, will now, before they can get a loan from the State, be humiliated by being refused both by a bank and a building society.  Unfortunately, these are the people who are making an honest effort in our society to provide for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is designed to give effect to this housing circular, as the Minister has outlined in his speech. The Government who promised the &ldquo;better way&rdquo; in so many other ways are now telling people who will be driven into the private building market that they will have to go through the building societies and banks.  Only if they are refused both by the building societies and the banks will they even be considered by a local authority.  This course of action will involve a saving of £55 million for the Exchequer in a full year.  The cream of the area which local authorities cater for and to whom they have lent in the past are now being handed over to the financial institutions because, on paper at least, they seem to be a safer risk.  If a person who has under £10,000 income fails to get a loan from a building society or a bank goes back to his local authority, he will be severely scrutinised by that local authority.  I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the way the local authorities operate the new regulations in that area.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the variable interest rate is most welcome.  I fully accept that, at a time of increasing interest rates, the variation is of benefit. Going back over the past ten years many <Col N="857" /> people who sought SDA loans were very satisfied because they knew exactly what rates of interest they would be paying for the rest of their lives.  We should not get too fixed on the idea that the ultimate would be to depart from the fixed interest rate and go on to a variable interest rate. Many people in the past took out SDA loans on the fixed interest rates and were happy to know what they would be paying for the rest of their lives.  It might be an advantage to give people a choice in this area.  I am not sure whether the Minister envisaged that in the recommendations. If the choice could be given to people of a variable interest rate or a fixed interest rate it would be up to the people to decide what was best for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the reconstruction grant from £6,500 to £8,000. Due to the removal of grants and various other incentives, a number of people are now entitled to apply for this type of reconstruction loan which can do a lot to improve their houses.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am worried about the number of houses which will be completed in 1988 by local authorities.  The figure lies somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 with a much lower figure for the following year because of the decline in housing starts.  A reduction of £50 million from £87 million to £37 million means that there will be no money for new council houses next year.  Can the Minister inform the House how many new local authority houses will be started next year?  I have a terrible fear that with the incentives which were put in place by the previous Government now removed and no new housing starts commencing our housing lists will grow and, as a result, we will find ourselves back where we were five or six years ago with a long waiting list and with little or no hope for people on these lists.  I fully accept that the purpose of the measure before the House is to make the necessary amendment to ensure that the Housing Finance Agency can continue its valuable contribution to the financing of local authorities. I welcome the amendment and I recommend the Bill, as the Minister did, <Col N="858" /> to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short but very important Bill.  I, too, welcome it very warmly.  It is appropriate that we should now be debating a Bill of this kind.  On all sides it is agreed that the construction and building industry is in a very depressed state.  From that point of view, I welcome the gesture in the budget with regard to the £6½ million provided for primary schools and also the urban renewal programme in the designated areas.  This will have a beneficial effect. The Government inherited a very unsatisfactory and chaotic situation when they came into office.  Senator Doyle referred to some of the schemes of the previous Government.  While it is not my habit to rake over coals, it is important to say that some of these schemes have contributed to the sorry plight of the building industry at the present time.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the grants which were provided by the previous Government.  At the time the £5,000 grant that Senator Doyle spoke about was introduced for local authority tenant purchasers, I, along with virtually everybody else at the time, welcomed it but it has been proved that while it did enormous good it had social and other implications which were not foreseen.  The scheme was not properly thought out.  In addition to that, the problem with regard to grants for house improvement resulted in a situation where the Government provided grants but did not provide the finance.  Unfortunately, on that account, this Government had to cease acceptance of applications for new house improvement grants and it will take a number of years to deal with the grants that are in the pipeline.  This problem was caused by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency has done enormous good.  On a previous occasion in this House I went through the history of the Housing Finance Agency.  It is not necessary to do so at the present time but in referring to the Housing Finance Agency we should not lose sight of the fact that the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act did enormous good as well.  Personally, <Col N="859" /> I always felt it was unfortunate that the Small Dwellings Acquisitions Act was not amended or extended to deal with the situation which the Housing Finance Agency was created to assist. One of the big problems in the early years of the Housing Finance Agency seems to me was with regard to capital depreciation where individuals who built houses might wish to sell them.  They found themselves &mdash; very often I think &mdash; with a problem in so far as they were unable to dispose of their houses on account of this depreciation of capital. That has been taken care of and must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is also important when dealing with this Bill to welcome the initiative of the Government in arranging that the banks and the building societies will provide finance in certain circumstances, and that where they do not provide the finance for construction of new houses and the reconstruction of old ones the local authorities will then finance these applicants. In relation to what Senator Doyle has said, the only problem which I see in this regard is, perhaps, the delay which might be caused in processing the various applications. It is inevitable that there will be teething problems but I would ask the Minister to make every effort to ensure that the delays will be as short as is possible. This is important.</P>
    <P>I feel also that in the past, to some extent, loans and loan funds have been used and abused by people in that individuals made considerable wealth through the building of houses.  They were people who were not in the construction industry and they did this as an additional source of income.  This caused problems.  In this area we are dealing with a considerable transfer of wealth.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government found themselves in a situation where some of the schemes had to be abandoned or withdrawn for the time being.  The £5,000 mortgage subsidy was important but that has been withdrawn.  Thankfully, we still have the £2,000 new house grant, which is of considerable help.  I have stated before in this House that it would <Col N="860" /> be more helpful if people were allowed to build by direct labour and qualify for the grant.  I fully realise that the Government must get the VAT payments.  There is provision under the regulations that more than one contractor can be involved with regard to this, provided that the amount on which VAT is paid is £15,000 or more.  As stated on other occasions, we have situations in this, country where we have one or two tradesmen in a family who are quite capable of doing all the work to complete their own houses.  It is a change in the wrong direction to prevent these people from building houses.  To an extent, I suppose, we can say that they are not prevented if they can build without the help of the £2,000 grant, but I am sure that there are not very many people building new houses who can do so without this grant.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the effect of this Bill will mean that the essential repairs grants and disabled persons' grants will be continued.  They both have helped enormously on a national scale. The essential repairs grants have helped to keep elderly people out of hospitals and geriatric institutions.  The amount spent per dwelling was not considerable and the value from the social point of view was enormous.  In my own county, County Meath &mdash; and I am sure it is not much different to any other county &mdash; scores of elderly people have been kept in their own homes by the essential repairs grants but, unfortunately, at the present time there is a long list.  When we are dealing with elderly people, in particular, it is unfortunate that they have to wait so long.  Many of them will be dead before their turn is reached.</P>
    <P>I know the health boards and the officers concerned draw up a priority list. They are as generous as possible, but their hands are tied with regard to the actual amounts.  Perhaps the Minister might look at this and take into consideration the backlog in the different counties.  He might try to make some provision whereby people who are in a <Col N="861" /> worse situation would be dealt with in a reasonable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the essential repair grants are to be continued. In the different counties we have small groups of permanent or semi-permanent staff who carry out those repairs. This is giving employment.  Perhaps the Minister might feel that it would be possible to advance extra funds to increase the size of these units so that more work could be done and so that the work that has to be done could be done faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the disabled person's grant, I also wish to compliment the Minister. Great work has been done in this area.  The maximum disabled person's grant at present is £5,000 or two-thirds of the estimated cost, whichever is the greater.  When we are dealing with renovations or extensions simply to cater for an individual who has been certified by the county medical officer as unfit and requiring specific alterations or extension to a building, the grant may be considered fairly generous.  However, in some cases £5,000 might not be sufficient to cover all the work, particularly in rural areas.  I mentioned this previously in the House. Where septic tanks have to be provided the cost can be considerable.  At present the planning authorities are very strict about septic tanks and the provision of percolation areas and other details. Where it is necessary to provide a septic <Col N="863" /> tank it is also necessary to obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I appealed to the Minister to consider the possibility of helping with the costs involved in obtaining planning permission.  The actual plans may not be all that costly.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the 25-inch map which it is necessary to get in order to prepare a site map costs £33.  That kind of money is outside the reach of many people who will be availing of the disabled person's grant.  The cost of obtaining planning permission where this is necessary &mdash; and we must remember it is only necessary in a rural area where a septic tank has to be provided &mdash; should be included in calculating the amount of the grant.  This would be to the benefit of the applicants and the local authorities. In many cases the local authority could help by providing the ordnance survey maps.  In Dublin the local authority provide plans.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure is to decide on what is necessary and provide the plans so that these works can be carried out.  I see no reason why this could not be done on a national basis.  It would be very helpful particularly to the kind of person who avails of those grants.  They are mostly elderly people and always people who are unwell and have some health problem.  They are not familiar with the regulations.  They are not familiar with what has to be done in order to proceed with the work.  This gesture would be appreciated very much.  Perhaps the Minister could take into consideration these problems and simply allow the cost of obtaining the permission to be included in the grants.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill but one on which I could speak for a long time.  I have covered everything I wanted to say.  I appreciate that the total amount is being doubled from £500 million to £1,000 million. This shows the Government's commitment. I have no doubt that, because of the way the Government are tackling the problems, in a short period we will have a turnabout and the building industry will come back to where it was some <Col N="864" /> years ago.  This Bill will play a big part in bringing that about.  I warmly welcome it.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister of State to the House on the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill which we are discussing.  It is ironic that we should be discussing the affairs of the Housing Finance Agency and extending its powers when one considers that perhaps the Government were a little reluctant to take on board such a proposal when it was introduced in 1981. It certainly shows the enlightened approach adopted by Fine Gael in the housing area over the years and in using a source of funds for loans other than those directly from Exchequer resources.</P>
      <P>The extension of this area is to be welcomed. Giving more borrowing capacity to the Housing Finance Agency into a wider number of areas is something which I very much welcome.  I suggest to the Minister, at a time of serious financial shortage in terms of direct Exchequer resources and considering the Exchequer borrowing limits imposed by the Minister for Finance, that the source of these funds could be extended to even more areas than he has provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>More use can be made of insurance bonds and life pension funds.  That source of revenue could be tapped to a greater extent in providing more public utilities, particularly those that come under the aegis of local authorities.  I am speaking, for example, about using a source of funds like that for the provision of water and sewerage services and roads so that the private pension contributions which have been made by policy holders over the years can be utilised at an attractive marginal rate of interest and return to the insurance companies themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year or so with the welcome reduction in mortgage rates and interest rates generally, the concept of endowment mortgages has certainly caught the imagination of many policy <Col N="865" /> holders particularly those on the higher tax rates.  The concept of endowment mortgages or using the tax system in a tax efficient way, the relief that can be made available to mortgage holders in order to give them extra benefits in terms of mortgage interest free relief but, as well as that in terms of tax relief on life assurance premiums, is an area the Minister should take on board and promote probably to a greater extent than his Department have promoted in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Anywhere we can get funds other than from the taxpayer directly is certainly something that I would consider very important at present.  The powers of the Housing Finance Agency and the moneys borrowed under that agency can be used to help many voluntary groups throughout this country who are doing excellent work in the provision of voluntary housing projects particularly for the elderly.  I hope that funds can be made available directly, even though they may have to be administered through local authorities, so that that source of funds would be available to voluntary groups in order to accelerate much needed voluntary activity in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach has a very great interest in this voluntary housing area and I am sure he would support any proposal where funds of the Housing Finance Agency would go towards that area.  Borrowers were not happy with the announcement on 28 October 1987 of the change in the amount of funds through the borrowing medium of the Exchequer that would be made available to local authorities.  The initial announcement could have been made earlier in order to give local authorities a time to adjust to the new system, where banks and building societies were now assuming a greater role in the provision of funds to borrowers and to people who would normally go to local authorities for their loans.</P>
    <P>The danger at the time &mdash; it is certainly only beginning to sort itself out at the moment &mdash; is that borrowers were perceived as crawling to financial institutions in order to get a letter stating that they <Col N="866" /> were not in a financial position to get a loan from that society.  I thought it was degrading to loan applicants at that time to have them put in the position that they had to go directly to the banks and the building societies and come back with a letter of refusal in order to qualify for a loan directly from the local authority.  I know, from my own experience in Kilkenny County Council, that the housing officer takes it upon himself to arrange with the bank manager or the building society to establish if the loan applicant is eligible under the various financial requirements to get a loan from that source.  The degrading act of the loan applicant going directly to the financial institution is now eliminated by the fact that the housing officer acts as the mediator in this case and the letters come, if required, without any degradation to the applicants involved.  The Minister, by having meetings with the banks standing committee and the building societies, that the system he was promoting and which was welcome in view of the savings in borrowing to the Exchequer, should have been streamlined better.  It is only now that it is beginning to sort itself out.  The hiccups we have had over the last few months could have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of housing, I am glad the Government have now decided in the budget to reverse some of the serious trends they were promoting in last year's budget in regard to the building and construction industry.  Section 23 is important to the provision of private rented accommodation.  I hope, together with the urban development areas the Minister has designated and extended to various towns and cities throughout the country, that it will provide an important incentive.  It is an extension of a scheme we brought in when we were in office and is something that was described at that stage as a cosmetic exercise but is now being perceived as something that is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The service sector and the retail sector should not be eligible for any incentives under the urban development areas extension the Minister announced some <Col N="867" /> time ago.  In the inner cities and the centre of many towns there are multiples grabbing some of the prime property in the inner cities to the detriment of the local traditional small grocers and retailers who have been there with their family business over a lifetime.  I support the concept of getting rid of the enormous amount of dereliction in many of our cities particularly in Dublin and Cork. In the rural towns we should consider extending the incentives for manufacturing and housing development.  In the commercial area we would want to be careful that we do not close down other sectors and family businesses that have served our towns well over the years.</P>
    <P>We have a very haphazard approach to housing.  I hope the Minister will consider putting his views in a White Paper or a discussion document in the near future in order to let us know where the Department of the Environment and the Government stand in relation to the development of housing.  I was sorry to see the enormous cut that was made to local authority housing programmes in the 1988 Estimates.  We have £50 million less to spend in the provision of local authority housing.  In Kilkenny no housing start is foreseeable in 1988.  The indications are that we may not have a housing start of any significance in 1989.</P>
    <P>The danger in that is that we are building up housing lists again.  We spent a number of years trying to eliminate that poverty trap, trying to provide decent accommodation and not have couples with three or four children living in squalor. I am proud of the last Government's record in taking that housing problem off the agenda of all the national media in this country because the problem was resolved with the enlightened approach of incentives, grants and direct financial Exchequer support to local authorities in eliminating that problem.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 surrender grant was an exceptional success.  I am taking into account the comments the Minister has made about it, that it could denude some areas and ghettoise a number of housing <Col N="868" /> estates in removing the people with the most money from that housing scheme, in other words, that it would reduce the mix in housing development in urban areas.  I hope the Minister will bring forward his proposals, in the near future and tell us where he sees the housing needs, what the second hand housing situation is and how we can renew our housing stock in order to build up some kind of rational approach for the future so that we will never again have the lists we had over the last few years and the appalling conditions people had to put up with in flats in urban areas and areas of dereliction.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the essential repairs grant scheme.  In rural Ireland there are a lot of people who, with a small amount of money, could improve their dwellings under this scheme.  A lot of people have benefited tremendously by way of the provision of much needed improvements such as essential repairs to windows and doors in order to ensure the most minimal thermal insulation to their dwellings.  Without the expenditure of a lot of money we could extend this scheme in order to ensure that there are sufficient resources, to ensure that a survey is carried out by each local authority to establish the need for essential repairs grant and in the context of the 1989 estimates for local authorities to ensure that the Minister will be in a position to say there is a need in this area, which I know he is aware of, and that he will be in a position to move in the right direction to ensure that the rural poor and the older generation in rural Ireland who never ask for much, but who are important people whom we should not forget will be looked after.  We always hear about the urban poor but we seldom hear about the rural poor.  There are people in isolated rural areas who seldom come to a politician or go to a local authority to look for anything. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are properly catered for.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the unsecured loan of £2,000 which is available from local authorities for essential repairs.  He should increase the amount of money one can get from a local <Col N="869" /> authority from £2,000 to £5,000 because £2,000 will not do much for a dwelling particularly when there are no house improvement grants to fall back on.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this and extend the facility to the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before the House. The Housing Finance Agency has served us well and I have no difficulty in agreeing to its powers being extended.  I hope that in the future the Minister will extend more local authority financing and give, together with the local loans fund to local authorities, another source of borrowing capacity in order to develop the much needed infrastructural facilities to ensure that the housing lists and the scandals of the past can never again materialise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The dramatic change in the role of the agency since it was started in 1981 is obvious in this Bill.  It is no harm to briefly recall what the HFA plan to be involved in in the future.  A new package of loans available designed to contribute to the future housing of this nation is available now from the HFA. This is basically a broadening of the powers of the HFA to advance money to the various local authorities.  The HFA can now give a loan for the acquisition of property, for improvement of houses, for the payment of essential grants for various repairs and for disabled persons. Some of these payments in the past were paid from the local loans fund.  Looking objectively at the situation I believe it makes sense to put all of these various loans, this nice package that I have referred to, under the umbrella of one body, the HFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various loans we speak about have been referred to by many Members.  As the Minister has pointed out, these loans have changed and the role of the agency has changed widely.  I must confess &mdash; I say this quite honestly &mdash; I was always one of the great fans of the SDA loan. When any people approached me about county council loans I stated quite emphatically that the SDA loan was the better loan.  I was not over-impressed with the HFA introduced in 1981. Senator Doyle referred to this this morning, <Col N="870" /> that there was no enthusiasm on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government towards it.  I would be in that category, for different reasons from those of Senator Doyle.  Throughout the country the view was that you were simply becoming a tenant of the HFA and you might as well be a tenant of the HFA as a tenant of the local authority.  The problem then was that if you wanted to sell, assuming you bought you house in 1981 or 1982 for £18,000 or £19,000, you would find yourself not owing the HFA the figure you borrowed but perhaps a figure of £25,000 or £26,000.  Therefore, it was not an attractive means of borrowing.</P>
    <P>It was attractive to the kind of person Senator Doyle had in mind, that was, a person in the Dublin area.  He rightly pointed out the huge waiting list.  If a person living in Dublin changes his job from Crumlin to Clontarf it does not mean he has to change his house.  If it happens in the rural areas almost certainly you would have to move house and from the point of view of getting the people on the waiting list into houses the HFA was attractive.  It certainly took many people off the waiting list particularly in the cities.</P>
    <P>We still have the HFA loan in the form of the income-related loan.  My understanding of that from my colleagues in the housing office in County Westmeath is that they are not enthusiastic still about it.  They see it not as a very serious contender for a choice of loan and it would be at the bottom of their list.  They will still be saying to people who come to them that they should go for the conventional annuity loan, the SDA of the past.  It now has the maximum loans of £21,000.  It is not available for a single person unless he can prove he is getting married in the immediate future.  In special cases the loan can go as high as £25,000.  You then have the in between loan, the convertible loan which is available for all people up to £22,500.  It must be converted within the five years to the annuity-type loan.  That is a nice spread of loans available to the local authorities as a result of this change in the HFA Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> There has been criticism of the fact that the banks and the building societies are now asked to play a greater role in providing finance for people of modest means.  I cannot honestly understand the criticism.  The previous speaker referred to the fact that we should seek other avenues other than the Exchequer for providing funds.  I agree with that in the knowledge that the banks were in the past providing money, even if they were limited amounts, for housing and, of course, in the knowledge that the building societies were set up clearly to provide money for the building of houses or the buying of houses.  They were taking deposits from the many to give to the few who wanted to avail of the money for houses.  They were very successful in that.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why we should be worried.  If the building societies and the banks enter the agreement in the proper spirit, then few people ought to be refused a loan.  Under the previous arrangement a person seeking an SDA loan had to have a letter from the building society and a bank.  This was a farce because the building societies simply give a letter saying, &ldquo;We regret we are unable to give you a loan&rdquo;.  You would then hand the letter to your local authority and that cleared you.  The banks did the same. That was not being serious about the problem and it was acknowledged that we were not being serious about the matter.</P>
    <P>We are serious about it now.  It is a logical extension to what the building societies and the banks have been doing for years.  The last speaker referred to the fact that the emphasis seemed to be on endowment mortgages.  I agree that that is what banks and building societies are looking for.  In regard to what the building societies are doing at present in relation to the new arrangement I have not detected any lack of spirit on the part of the banks or the building societies in regard to the provision of loans for people of modest means.  I believe banks and building societies are looking after the person with modest means with the same enthusiasm as they are the person with an <Col N="872" /> income of £15,000 to £20,000 per annum. They are looking for business.</P>
    <P>It is well known that endowment mortgages in particular are being chased quite vigorously by the building societies and the banks.  I know a person with £8,000 who wanted to buy a house and completed a building society application form.  That application will be approved. He will get two and one-third of his income and that person is quite happy about it.  That will prevail.  If that spirit continues, then we should have no worries and we should not in any way criticise the banks.  We should be saying it is their duty to provide us with the kind of finance we are looking for.  It is a logical extension of what they have been doing in the past. The arrangement is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of it that worries me.  I know there is some form of guarantee to building societies and banks from the local authorities.  I would even suggest that should not have been necessary.  It should have been done freely and willingly by the banks.  The banks have been looked after well by Governments over the years.  The debacle over the ICI and the Allied Irish Banks a couple of years ago cost the Exchequer £175 million. That was a scandal.  The bank in question got off far too lightly.</P>
    <P>Those guarantees should not have to be there for the banks and the building societies.  They should take their chances, the same as everyone else.  Indeed, the guarantee in question by the local authorities will cause some problems, some extra work for them because it will involve extra inspections.  If there is a guarantee for the banks and for the building societies, why not a guarantee for the local authorities if they at the end of the day have to take a person who has been refused a loan by the building societies or the banks?  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that?  It seems to me they should be treated in the same way.</P>
    <P>It is an issue that we could talk about for a long time.  One aspect of it I would like to talk about is the condition of housing estates.  I find, unfortunately, that many of them have got into a state of disrepair.  What is really happening &mdash;<Col N="873" /> and I find this in my own area &mdash; is that people are becoming far too choosy about where they want to live.  Those living in a caravan want to live in a beautiful house and have a view of a lake.  I have seen people refuse a house three, four or five times until they got the house they wanted.  In fact, what often happens is that they go to court and, as happened in my own town, the judge wanted the county manager to tell him why he would not give Mr. X a house on a particular estate in Athlone.  I do not think that is fair.  Once a person refuses a house and certainly if he refuses it a second time, he should go to the bottom of the list and stay there.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is that when people are given a house, they are given time to decide whether to accept it or not.  Make your offer and give them 24 hours to decide.  If they do not take it within 24 hours, they are out of luck. Unfortunately, that has not happened in the past but it should happen in the future.  Far too many houses, certainly in my town and in many other cities and towns, are lying idle and being vandalised beyond repair.  One estate I can talk about in Athlone with certainty and, unfortunately, with regret is Battery Heights where what I have said happens. It has become a problem area, as far as financing is concerned, for the urban district council in Athlone.  Indeed, I would like publicly to thank the Minister for the provision of £500,000 to carry out essential work on the Battery Heights estate.  Although not essential as regards the fabric of the house it is essential to lift the morale and for the general welfare of those living on the estate.  That is what we hope to do in the Battery Heights area of Athlone.  We appreciate this magnificent contribution of £500,000 very much which I hope will lead to a lifting of the morale of those living on that particular estate.  As I have said, it is an area which we could talk about for a long, long time.</P>
    <P>What is important is that a fine package of loans is available for people of modest means from the HFA and that there is just a single agency providing funding for <Col N="874" /> all of these loans.  That was the right decision to make and it is a good forward thinking decision.  The banks and building societies &mdash; I have some knowledge of this &mdash; are entering into the spirit of the arrangment and I hope plenty of money will be available for the buying, the building, and the reconstruction of houses and for grants for the disabled in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and sincerely hope it will prove to be successful in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that it is my intention to be critical but I hope to be critical in a positive sense.  I welcome very much the Minister's active and energetic interest in the area particulary of urban renewal and I believe that we may have further proposals during the term of office of this Government which will give specific direction to the renewal of inner city housing.  I certainly hope so and I will be urging and pressing the Minister to take this area on board.</P>
      <P>I would like to address not anything I see as deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill or the material it contains but something I rather regret has not been specifically addressed.  I would like the Minister to contemplate either in this legislation or very soon, in the immediate future, looking at a specific problem.  I am sure I will have the Minister's goodwill in this area.  I speak about the question of housing co-operatives.  They have been to a certain extent neglected.  We do have the National Association of Building Co-operatives which is funded partially at least through Government sources and it is a very worthy enterprise.  They have been involved in assisting groups in the country to set up housing co-operatives and this has been successful.  There is provision for some central funding for housing co-opratives but only, I understand, if this housing is specifically intended for the disabled or the disadvantaged in some way, and this then produces 80 per cent funding from local authorities.  This is, of course, welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has in certain limited circumstances <Col N="875" /> been successful but I would like to ask the Minister to turn his mind towards producing a system where housing co-operatives are recognised as legal entities for the purpose of triggering funding. This is most important and I will be prepared this afternoon to give the Minister some examples from other European countries where this is currently happening. I believe the lack of such machinery is actually hampering the very useful work of NABCo.  I know they are in a position at the moment to give advice, guidance and experience and they can produce model rules for housing co-operatives and so on.  Over 100 co-operative, home ownership schemes have been built around the country but the real potential does not lie just in the country; it also lies in the cities.  I believe the potential for urban renewal that lies dormant in an agency such as NABCo &mdash; certainly in the idea of housing co-operatives &mdash; is as yet, unfortunately, untapped simply because there is no adequate funding system for this.  That means that Ireland has not been able to benefit from the housing co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I know, be aware of the useful role played by housing co-operatives in many countries in meeting the needs of urban populations facilitating the proper management of apartments, flats and tenant participation in sharing responsibility for maintenance and so on.  I must say I think it is a pity that this country is so far deprived of a major impact of this benefit.  This is clearly because there is a lack of a suitable financing system to fund housing co-operatives as legal entities.  There is no system at all for funding co-operatives, rental or co-ownership housing.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that other countries have these provisions, so there are state housing finance agencies which specifically assist housing co-operatives with capital mortgages payable to them as legal entities, in other words, as registered societies or as companies.  In addition, grant or subsidy schemes have been devised to assist tenant members without going for occupancy charges.  Alternatively, the <Col N="876" /> state arranges to provide guarantees so that the housing co-operatives can borrow from the private commercial mortgage institutions.  What that means basically is that the local authority or central funding guarantee loans, or mortgages, or interest free payments and then the housing co-operatives can go out into the active independent financial markets and acquire the funding at that point.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is a specific organisation, the National Housing Corporation, which has been established for this purpose and I hope the Minister will consider instituting some such body here. At the moment all that can happen if the housing co-operative is established is that the individual members can go to mortgage companies or building societies, and so on.  The difficulty with that approach, as the Minister I am sure is aware, is that if one individual member defaults, that can cause difficulty to the entire scheme. It is much more satisfactory to have the entire thing centrally funded.</P>
    <P>Examples exist in Sweden, Germany and Norway as well as in Great Britain where there is direct state agency financing. In Denmark, a system of state guaranteed borrowing by co-operative housing associations combined with local authority grants has actually succeeded in producing 300,000 successfully managed rental dwellings.  A specific amendment of housing legislation in Canada in the early seventies led to the building of over 30,000 dwellings by housing co-operatives with the assistance of the Canadian Mortgage Corporation.</P>
    <P>There are several examples which we could profit from.  Dublin Corporation, for example, in this the Millennium Year are not going to build any houses and I am not suggesting that this is a dereliction of duty on the part of the corporation because I understand the pressure on the housing lists is not what it was some years ago.  The city manager Mr. Feely, and I am not talking out of school when I say this &mdash; certainly put it on record on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on RTE television a few weeks ago that these authorities vested with responsibility for looking after the housing requirements <Col N="877" /> of this great capital city all feel that one of the principal lacks in the revitalisation of Dublin is attracting private building investment.  If the big financial houses and big building speculators are not prepared to do it, would it not be much more in the traditions of our country that the co-operative movement should be encouraged to make up this gap?  I hope the Minister will take this very much on board.</P>
    <P>It is true that every country has its own traditions and aspirations with regard to housing.  It is not surprising that Senator Fallon should be able to talk about how choosy people in the Athlone area are about their housing.  They are equally choosy in Dublin.  We have a sturdy independence of mind in this country about housing and a very high proportion of people actually wish to own their own houses.  I welcome that although I suppose some of the more capricious aspects of it may be deplored.</P>
    <P>There is a need to widen the range of housing options in Dublin in order to overcome the loss of the private rental sector and to provide a means whereby those who want to live in the city can be involved in providing their own housing through co-operation.  I have no doubt that there is a need and there is a market there.  I will tell the Minister a story which I think is illustrative and I am afraid I will be very parochial.  It comes, you will not be surprised to learn, from North Great George's Street where we decided to restore some buildings that were pulled down by the corporation some years ago in order to complete the streetscape. There was a need for particularly sensitive treatment and to accomplish this we established a housing co-operative. One small article, about three paragraphs long, in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; it was not a big public relations job &mdash; triggered more than sufficient applicants to float the housing co-operative.  That is very interesting. We did not have a press conference. We did not make a big song and dance about it.  We had more than enough applicants to float this co-operative. However, difficulties of the kind that would be covered by an alteration in <Col N="878" /> legislation and an encouragement by the Minister &mdash; I know he is a person of goodwill with regard to the inner city &mdash; would not have allowed this scheme to take off.</P>
    <P>I will acknowledge my own shortcomings and the shortcomings of the people I work with.  Employing a sophisticated financial package which is necessary in order to get a housing co-operative really working, drawing down funds on a phased basis so that you can say to the members of the co-operative: &ldquo;You pay £1,000 on 2 February, you will then pay another £15,000 on 16 June and you will get the deeds on 3 September&rdquo; and arranging all these things with the builder and so on, is a sophisticated operation and needs guidance.  We will get a certain amount from the housing co-operative, NABCo, but we lack the capacity to trigger really supportive finance.  It is very important that this matter should be addressed and I believe the Government have shown themselves to be sufficiently imaginative to take this kind of suggestion on board.  At the moment all NABCo can do is to provide advice, guidance and experience.  They can provide model rules for housing co-operatives but they are effectively, although I do not believe intentionally, neutured.  They are so constrained that they cannot provide the vital assistance that is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I have been informed at the highest levels that the absence of access to suitable funding agencies for housing co-operatives as legal entities is the single principal obstacle to the development of the co-operative housing movement in Ireland.  If the Minister was able to indicate, even at some time in the future &mdash; because I know it is unfair to bounce these things straight into the Minister's lap in the middle of a debate on the Bill &mdash; that these ideas would be seriously looked at, I believe that would be an encouragement and the work of NABCo would be sustained and fostered.  I hope also that the Minister &mdash; this is my last remark; there are other people who wish to come in and I do not want to be greedy with the time &mdash; this is slightly outside <Col N="879" /> the scope of the Bill but I am appealing to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That frightful calumny on the Leas-Chathaoirleach who, if it had been outside the scope of the Bill, would have restrained me should not have been allowed.  I hope that the Minister will also investigate the possibility of encouraging the development of flying freeholds within the inner city which means that people can actually get access to mortgages not for entire buildings but floor by floor by floor which would provide access for people on modest incomes to acquire dilapidated housing stock in the inner city which could thereby be renewed.  If I have transgressed and gone outside the provisions of the Bill I cannot really say I regret it because I know the Minister is somebody who is interested in ideas. Even if I have been slightly guilty in this area I hope he will at least give some courteous consideration to what I have had to say.  I would also like to say that I welcome the Minister's legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly on this Bill because I think it is very important to recognise the amendment which is being proposed in this Bill and also to welcome the measure generally.  Coming from a county in which there is a housing problem, I recognise the tremendous help that the National Building Agency has been to those who do not qualify for a local authority loan or qualify for a local authority house.  Initially, people were slow to accept that the National Housing Finance Agency had a role to play.  I am glad to see that it has been necessary to apply <Col N="880" /> for a doubling of the capital involved from £500 million to £1,000 million.  That in itself indicates that the scheme has been successful.  Even though this increase in capital is being provided for the Housing Finance Agency I suggest that it is also important for the Minister to look at other aspects of the programme and I think now would be an opportune time.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example of the difficulties that a local authority member encounters.  Say somebody qualifies for a Housing Finance Agency loan and fills up the application form.  He is given an option on the repayments and he has to state that the repayments are based on his income.  These can be calculated provided he furnishes returns at the end of the year.  If, for any reason, there is a delay in the furnishing of those returns, which was part of the agreement, the Housing Finance Agency will then charge a penalty premium.  That is wrong. Another method and another mechanism should be found.  In some cases the applicant finds himself in some difficulties. For a well organised person who has no financial difficulties or a person who has a nice steady income and does his sums at the end of the month, it is great but not so for somebody living on a farm who has to sell a few sheep, or cattle, or a ton of potatoes to pay for it.  The potatoes might not mature on time and that very often is dependent on the weather and many other side issues.  I ask the Minister here in the Seanad today to look at that aspect of the matter and to take a look at the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency have done tremendous work.  They have filled a gap in that many people who found themselves just above the income limit to qualify for a local authority loan were rescued, assisted and helped by funds from the agency.  We have come to value the input and the contribution that they have made.  I further suggest that the Minister might consider this a good time for the directors of the Housing Finance Agency and the members of the local authority to meet and take a look at how successfully the scheme is working.  The <Col N="881" /> Minister, who has a background of active involvement in local authorities, must accept and appreciate that we learn from experience and gain some knowledge as we go along.  Members of local authorities have a contribution to make and I humbly suggest to the Minister at this stage that he arrange for the directors of the agency to meet members of the local authority, be it at general purpose committee meetings or at council meetings, or to meet delegations from local authorities. I think this could prove fruitful as it would give both sides an opportunity of looking at how the scheme is progressing. Now is the opportune time to do that and I hope my suggestion merits a response.</P>
    <P>Another question I would like to put to the Minister at this stage is what would happen where a county finds itself not receiving a share of the £100 million now being allocated to the Housing Finance Agency?  Do the city of Dublin and the major centres such as Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick have more people qualified to absorb the large part of the £100 million and to what extent do rural areas benefit from the £100 million which is being provided for the National Finance Agency?  This is a very important question which many a rural representative must ask.  In Donegal, even though our allocation for housing is quite good, we find ourselves in continuous difficulty.  Many small rural dwellers live in poor housing and we have an ongoing programme to provide housing for many of these.  While we have been fairly successful, there is still a backlog and we would look forward to receiving help from the National Building Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the National Building Agency have done the work we would have expected them to do.  They have abandoned, certainly, my county and have almost abandoned the west generally. They are looking at where it would be profitable for them to build in the future and where houses can be sold at a high price.  The National Building Agency, and I would like to put it on record, are doing nothing to house people in my county.  Therefore, the gap will <Col N="882" /> become that much wider.  It will add to the difficulties and fears I am expressing if in fact the £100 million capital provision for the Housing Finance Agency is taken up by the major centres of population. Added to that, if the National Building Agency find it very attractive to build in those same areas, the provision of houses in rural areas will become a major problem for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at this stage that the provision of housing is one of the major problems that the country has to face up to and, unforunately, too many people at the moment depend on local authority housing.  I can never understand why there never has been a review of our approach to the provision of housing.  The local authority housing programme is one that is nearly impossible to finance. I say this because the average cost of a house, one having bought and developed the site, even where the cost of the site was reasonably inexpensive, is about £30,000.</P>
    <P>The tenants who qualify quickest are those with large families and those with very low incomes.  We have found that at the end of the day the average rent of £10 per week does not cover the cost of maintenance.  In fact, there is never a return on the capital which would allow an extension of the programme to provide more houses for those who are on the waiting list.  It is time that that area was looked at and I take this opportunity to say to the Minister that one area that merits a reappraisal is the provision of funds for housing, regardless of the heading it comes under.</P>
    <P>People take things for granted, they walk into a new house and will not carry out even minor repairs.  It is not unusual to get a call to come out to see where drains are blocked at the back of a house. A person may only have been given a new house, yet he will expect the local authority to send out an engineer, two or three men with diggers, equipment and new pipes.  This is something he would not do if he knew where the capital came from in the first instance and fully appreciated how lucky he was to be given a house at a rent that would not even <Col N="883" /> pay for its maintenance.  Tenants in local authority housing have got to be made aware of this.</P>
    <P>You can preach to people that they should be getting new houses to the extent where you can convince them that they are being victimised.  One of the duties of the Government which is very important at present, through the Department of the Environment, is the provision of housing.  The time has come when people who walk into a new house worth £30,000 must understand that the provision of housing is capital intensive and that this capital does not grow on bushes.  I strongly advocate to the Minister that the local authorities should not maintain housing.  I have some years of experience in this matter and I come from a county where there are many people in need of local authority housing.  I would like to see local authorities facing up to the reality of taking a practical and honest approach because if they do not do so no funds will be available to house those on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the major responsibility in this area and, hopefully, this increase in capital for the Housing Finance Agency will set us on the road.  It is a help in one area but we have to look at the provision of houses, especially in rural areas, because the dice is loaded against rural counties where the housing agency may not have a big number of applicants.  The Minister should inform the House if possible &mdash; if the computer works &mdash; of the figures.  I would like to know how many loans of the total allocation of £500 million have gone to rural Ireland.  It is important that we get that figure because it has a bearing on the overall picture of financing of local authorities and the housing programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the extra provision for the HFA but I strongly urge the Minister to look at the overall housing programme.  It needs to be looked at and people need to be told that it takes finance to build houses.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at this.  I hope that any agreement for the letting or buying of <Col N="884" /> houses or rent-purchase schemes will exclude maintenance because finance is being wasted on small, petty maintenance work.  Engineers are being sent out to inspect such small jobs.  That is a waste of money and it does not encourage those who are appointed tenants of local authority houses to appreciate their new houses.  I should like to compliment the directors of the Housing Finance Agency and I hope the Minister will accept my recommendation that regular meetings be held in every county and that up-to-date information be given at them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I am somewhat puzzled as to why this extra finance is required today when there has been a reduction in the number of applications for loans to the Housing Finance Agency.  That has been the experience in my local authority area.  I wonder how this fits in with the Government's policy of encouraging people to borrow from banks and building societies. Indeed, the Government have been doing what they can to encourage those financial institutions to facilitate applicants. I am sure the Minister will tell us in his reply.  The Housing Finance Agency has achieved in our time something which I am sure no Senator thought possible in his wildest dreams, a massive reduction in the housing lists of local authorities.  One would not think this had happened listening to Senator McGowan, but I am not familiar with the position in his part of the country.  In the Dublin area and, indeed, most of the country, housing lists have been reduced. There is a danger in regard to that but I am sure it is one the Minister will pay attention to.  I will deal with that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many teething problems were experienced by the Housing Finance Agency in the first four or five years of operation although it did a good job during those years.  I should like to compliment a former Minister, Deputy John Boland, who paid a visit to this House.  Deputy Boland went into this problem in detail. Indeed, when I worked with him on a local authority I found him to be <Col N="885" /> extremely interested in housing.  I would say, without fear of contradiction, that it was Deputy Boland's efforts that brought about the Housing Finance Agency.  In the early years some people had difficulties with the agency and problems arose between borrowers and local authorities and local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency.  They were swiftly rectified in the legislation which came into operation on 1 July 1986 under which the borrower was given three options, the annuity option which would be an SDA type of option; the income-related option and the convertible one after five years. That improvement meant that the Housing Finance Agency was here to stay and that it would play a major part in financing house purchases.  Indeed, the agency has made finance available to thousands of people who, otherwise, would never have been in a position to buy their own houses.  As a result thousands of people were taken off housing authorities' lists. In making those loans available the Housing Finance Agency ensured that many people did not have to approach local authorities for houses.</P>
    <P>In the period from the start of the Housing Finance Agency up to 1 July 1986 when the three tier option was given to borrowers, upwards of 4,500 people in my local authority area availed of the agency's finance.  Many of those people and, indeed, some since, ran into difficulties. They were not of the local authority's making or the fault of the Housing Finance Agency but arose from marital problems and other reasons.  Those people have been unable to meet the repayments required.  The Minister should pay some attention to this anomaly.  I find more and more houses coming on the market from these people who simply walk out of the house, leave the key behind them, or go into the local authority and hand in the key with no requirement to do anything else.  In the case of my own local authority housing officials have done everything possible to encourage people to stay on in those houses but for reasons such as emigration, marital breakdown and so on many of them are now being handed <Col N="886" /> back.  I have an example of what occurred in recent weeks.  A Housing Finance Agency loan of £21,600 was granted to a couple on 13 July 1987.  That house was sold last week for £18,500 which represents a considerable fall in the amount of money that was loaned on the house, not to speak of the price the house cost. On a house in Clondalkin a loan of £23,700 was approved on 10 August 1987 but only last week that house was sold for £21,000, a drop of £2,700 on the loan not to mention the price the house cost. In the case of a house in Mulhuddart a loan of £22,500 was approved and it was sold for £17,000.  That loan was granted on 5 December 1984.  A house in Tallaght on which a loan of £22,500 was advanced was sold for £15,500, a considerable drop I am sure the Minister will admit.</P>
    <P>This is leaving this market wide open to speculators to move in and purchase these houses at cheap rates and to set them.  Speculators were encouraged further in the tax concessions in yesterday's budget to purchase houses and set them. The Minister should have a serious look at this and make money available to local authorities to purchase those houses and re-let them to those on their housing lists. Many of those houses are coming on the market.  I do not believe we should leave the market wide open for speculators to operate.  I would like to see the Minister giving serious consideration to making money available through some agency to local authorities.  Requests by local authorities to the Department for money to purchase these houses are not being granted, with the result that they go at a very cheap rate to somebody who is going to make a lot of money out of them.</P>
    <P>I have another great fear with the scaling down of local authority activity in the provision of houses.  There are people who until ten years ago had no hope of getting a house.  I am speaking of the widower, the widow or the unmarried person advanced in age.  In my early years on a local authority, when such people applied for a house they were put on a list in the hope that some day something would be done to house them.  Something was done eventually.  Such applicants <Col N="887" /> may suffer and be left behind again because the emphasis will now be put on the loans provided by the Housing Finance Agency, the banks and the building societies.  Many local authorities this year are not building houses.  No provision is being made for the person living alone who cannot find sufficient money for a deposit to get a house under the Housing Finance Agency.  Those people need a single-bedroom house and unless they are provided by private developers and qualify for a Housing Finance Agency loan they will have to go on the local authority housing list with no hope of ever being housed in their lifetime.</P>
    <P>There is the person, married with a family, who does not wish to own his own house.  Reference has been made to the fact that the great percentage of Irish people wish to own their own house and that is a good thing.  I hope that percentage will increase but we cannot ignore the percentage, however small it may be, who do not wish to own their own houses.  The Minister should ensure that local authority housing development is kept at some kind of a pace and that the categories I have referred are not being left behind because of the new method of helping people to own their own houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's initiative in relation to the banks and building societies providing home loans to a greater number of people is to be welcomed.  The suggestion that the Department of the Environment should be able to go back to the banks and building societies at intervals to discuss difficulties that may arise should be pursued. The type of people who will now be availing of loans from banks and building societies will be those in a modest income group.  They are the people we should try to protect and I would like to see the Department continually monitoring the situation.</P>

    <P>One question the Department might follow up in further discussions with the banks and building societies is the term of <Col N="888" /> 20 years for repayment.  That will probably be found unsatisfactory by many of the low income people compared to the 30-year term which would have been available to them from the county council. Perhaps the Department will consider approaching the banks and building societies and requesting a longer period such as 25 years or 30 years for repayment rather than 20 years.  This is now one of the main differences between the two loans, the loans provided by the local authority and those provided by the building societies and the banks.  There is a new approach to facilitate more people seeking home loans through the banks and building societies, many of them in the modest income group but many in that group would be better facilitated over a 30-year period rather than a 20-year period.  I would like to think that the spirit in which the new arrangements were made would be carried through also.  Many people have been critical of the bank and building society arrangements and there have been suggestions that money might not be handed out too easily by the banks and building societies. I have found that the opposite was the case and I have come across people who were readily facilitated by the banks and building societies.  In some cases, and this causes me concern, people were facilitated who might have been better off going to a local authority because of their modest income.  I hope they do not have problems in 15 or 20 years time with those loans.  The banks and building societies should look at this and, perhaps, send more people back to the local authorities, those who may have difficulties in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers dealt with the whole new approach to the provision of local authority houses.  I understand that the income from rent is half the maintenance cost on local authority houses and, perhaps, the time has come for the State to sell those houses at attractive rates to the occupiers.  At present under the tenant purchase scheme tenants are offered houses at a cost of £36,000 to £40,000 which is far beyond the reach of the occupier. Perhaps those houses could be sold <Col N="889" /> to those people at more attractive rates particularly when the maintenance costs are so high.</P>
    <P>Senators Hogan and Doyle referred to the old HFA loan and the objections to it at the time of its inception.  I was never happy with that loan and my experience in County Meath, being a rural area, was that when prospective buyers found that it would have spelt disaster for them should they have to sell the house in four or five years time, they quickly changed their mind about considering the HFA loan as a possibility for their mortgage.  I never recommended the HFA-type loan to people for this reason and I was always concerned about it.  On the other hand, the SDA loan was one which we could all quite happily recommend and I am glad to see that people will be able to continue to avail of local authority loans if the banks and building societies are unable to assist them.  The Bill before us broadens the powers of the Housing Finance Agency loan in advancing money to local authorities and that is to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to welcome this Bill to the House and compliment the Minister on the work he has spearheaded in this regard.  From a local authority point of view the new changes that were introduced certainly make a difference.  Perhaps as we get used to the new <i>modus operandi</i> it will become easier but last year when the changes were introduced they certainly presented many people in the lower middle income group with problems in their efforts to secure finance. Nevertheless, the Department in their overall approach to housing are very progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan, during the course of his contribution, referred to the problems some local authorities are experiencing as regards house repairs.  All local authorities are in the same situation.  The allocation under the housing heading has been reduced as a policy and I hope the Department, and the Minister, will look at tenancy agreements between local authorities and tenants and, perhaps, <Col N="890" /> exclude the agreement by the local authority to carry out repairs, particularly the minor repairs.  It would be very easy to exclude the disadvantaged categories of persons from this.  Pensioners, disabled persons and people on special allowances, could be excluded.</P>
    <P>It is infuriating for a local representative to have to take a certain amount of lip from very able bodied young tenants who have a lot of time on their hands but are not prepared to put a nail or a screw in a door handle.  Irrespective of what party or what flag colleagues on the council represent, he or she would not be on a local authority unless they had a certain amount of public spirit and were determined in a particular way to assist in local administration. Therefore, one tends to develop an overall look of the common good.  Members of different parties might see that from slightly different angles now and again but it is the desire of every member of a local authority to be able to assist constituents in their area to get the best possible service.  We pride ourselves in trying to build up that public service for the common good but we often see an outright disregard and abuse of the system, especially with some of the younger tenants, those who do not really want to conform.  Every local authority has a number of people who, perhaps, have not gone through the traditional ceremonies here and there.  They are very demanding and I for one have to bite my tongue when dealing with people like that because they do not appreciate that they are getting a £26,000 or £27,000 house. They are not prepared to give any time towards its maintenance.  We have in my county council difficulty funding the house repair scheme and this year at our estimates meeting we decided to privatise the service where it is costly.  I hope the Department will look at that.</P>
    <P>There was mention earlier of the role of the voluntary housing agencies that have approved status from the Department. They are a relatively new phenomenon in the public service.  I should like to pay a tribute to Bill Licken, a senior official in the Minister's Department, <Col N="891" /> who has done a tremendous lot to encourage community groups to provide for the disadvantaged in their own society.  The Department I must say have done tremendous work in motivating those organisations, such as the Sue Ryder Foundation of Ireland with which I am involved, in providing retirement villages and homes which are community based. That is the kind of spirit I am glad to see the Department encouraging and supporting in such a wholehearted and substantial way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the finance for housing and I am glad that the Department from time to time look at the facilities that are available.  In the larger towns it might be desirable if we went for apartment type accommodation as a sort of stop gap approach to serve young families for a few years.  Looking at the housing stock we have in our counties, even rented accommodation, I do not think it is utilised to the full.  We can have a single person living in a three or a four-bedroomed house.  I am not suggesting that that should be taken back but we have not got to the stage where we can give people a choice.  From my experience the most deserving people, especially the elderly and the pensioners, give councils very little bother or abuse. They are almost apologetic about seeking improvements they need for their own comfort.  I support this measure which is a new departure and I hope it will prove as successful as the Minister envisages.  If not we can always seek a debate with him later.</P>

      <P>I do not in any way wish to detract from the terrible events that have been taking place in the North of Ireland.  It is, indeed, a place of primary strife and it is a place where the inhabitants, whether Nationalist or Unionist, have been demeaned and humiliated.  Nevertheless, a solution to the problem is not as great as it is sometimes portrayed.  For instance, England itself has had to cope with bigger problems such as decolonisation in Kenya and in other African countries.  It is, indeed, important that not only should the Government but all of us clarify our policies and our attitudes, to the problem.  I hope my comments are in order as I am not presumptuous enough to advise the Government about clarifying their position but at least I hope I can clarify my own to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem to be solved in all of this country and in trying to solve any problem we should use as much common ground as is possible.  Fortunately there is plenty of this to build on.  Contrary to some opinions, a partitionist mentality is less common in the minds of more people than is sometimes thought.  For instance, there are a very large number of bodies throughout the entire country and among those one may mention the GAA, rugby and other sporting organisations, all of which work on a 32 county basis.  So do the Churches.  In addition, there are other <Col N="893" /> bodies, notably scientific and cultural, who work on an all Ireland basis with benefit and reward.  These various bodies and organisations demonstrate that on a national basis work of this sort is not by any means unusual.  These organisations and others I have not mentioned take all of this for granted but unfortunately it is my experience on some occasions that some Government Departments are less conscious of this and are more reluctant to engage in enterprises that may involve an all Ireland component.</P>
    <P>Looking beyond that issue we have to take into account that there is another partner.  This partner is a very important one as it is the sovereign power in control in the northern part of Ireland.  It is Britain.  With regard to Government involvement and the clarification of their involvement, one thing that is clear is that Dublin is often called on by the British literally to come to its aid in the administration of the North.  Governments have indeed been doing this not only at great financial risk but possibly at psychological cost.  Despite this and the presence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Dublin can only play a role.  It is largely a case of responsibility without representation. The events of recent days, such as the Stalker-Sampson report, emphasise this and demonstrate a strange attitude by England to justice and to the sensitiveness and concern of the Irish Government.  The Government must ensure that they have a primary role to play and this must not be marginalised in any way.</P>
    <P>In moving towards or even considering a permanent solution, it is important to look at the problem in the North of Ireland in a wider context.  I am saying the obvious when I say that this century has witnessed profound changes in Europe and beyond.  Part of this is the concept that it is wrong for one country to control another.  This concept has been put into practice by many European powers.  Many did it because they had no other choice.  In Europe this brought into being many new independent States at the end of World War I.  As a consequence <Col N="894" /> there were also many new interesting political developments such as the emergence of Yugoslavia with its diverse cultures, religions and languages.  This development gathered even greater strength in the aftermath of World War 2 with the wholesale abandonment of those vast and far flung overseas possessions in five continents by west European powers.  Coupled with this was the integrity of the new states and their unity. In this connection it is interesting to observe that the question of unity on a pan-national scale is being seriously considered in western Europe by the EC. We need not confine our thinking to the winding up of the west European colonial possessions or even to the emergence of a new EC state.  Already there is a sufficient and an efficient working model in place.  This is in Scandinavia.  Today we generally look upon Scandinavia as a group of tranquil lands, a paragon of parliamentary democracy where people enjoy the highest standards of living in Europe and where inter-state conflict has been eliminated.  This was not always so. It was only within this century that matters were resolved.  Just like us in Ireland Scandinavia had its partition problem.  I know it was a couple of centuries or more ago when southern Sweden was part of the kingdom of Denmark.  However, we need not go back as far as that but rather look at events in the 20th century.</P>
    <P>For instance, Finland was for long dominated by powerful neighbours on both sides.  This country only emerged less than 70 years ago as an independent state, but the process involved revolts and wars including a civil war in 1918-19. Furthermore, as Finland had been formerly a Swedish possession there was a considerable Swedish element in the country.  There is still a large Swedish speaking population in Finland but, despite that, the Finns and the Swedes arrived at a meaningful and a proper solution to the matter.  This enabled Finland to emerge as one of the important countries in Europe at the moment.</P>
    <P>Norway only achieved its independence from Sweden in 1904.  When the independence movement in that <Col N="895" /> country got seriously under way, there were rumblings of war in certain quarters in Sweden but wisdom prevailed and Norway then embarked on a very fruitful independent course.  It is also of interest to mention that this development with Norway also bore fruit in Sweden as it led to the establishment of parliamentary government.  Denmark, too, has settled its problems as is clear from its relationship today with Iceland and Greenland.</P>
    <P>What I would like to say &mdash; and I am not advising the Government how to go about it &mdash; is that it might be interesting if the Government would consider some of these parallel developments which had fruitful results.  The Scandinavian experience has shown that, without outside interference, a country can emerge which is more habitable for all its inhabitants, where cultural differences can provide strength not cleavage and where a willing commitment from all its peoples can lead to a stable society working for the common good and thereby producing a more comfortable and rewarding life for all.</P>
    <P>To achieve some of these things as the Scandinavians and other countries have done, we need optimism.  Unfortunately, sometimes when we discuss Northern Ireland we do lack optimism and we see too many snags.  I believe that, with optimism and goodwill, there is no reason why Ireland could not achieve the same advances as, say, the Scandinavian countries, not necessarily at some vague and distant time in the future but much closer to hand and thereby allow this country to embark on an equally fruitful period of peace and prosperity, which unfortunately has eluded us up to the present. In doing all this one need not just solely think in terms of financial rewards, as such, but what is even more important and more exciting is the emergence of what one might call a new personality in Ireland where both common experience and to some extent diversity can encourage us to move forward into a better age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement was predicated on the understanding that Northern Ireland is <Col N="896" /> composed of two identities of approaching equality in numerical strength and that hope for constructive dialogue moving towards peace, justice and reconciliation depended on acknowledgement that each community has rights equal to the other with regard to self-expression and equality of opportunity.  With this understanding, the two Governments chose on their terms to be guarantors of what they considered to be such rights. The achievements in this respect are listed in the letter to <i>The Times</i> of 7 October from Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the lack of achievement in this respect is listed in the replies from Mr. John Taylor, M.P. and Fr. Desmond Wilson on 15 October.</P>
      <P>There remains, therefore, a great deal to be done.  Fair employment must be tackled by adequate legislation.  The MacBride principles, of which I am a sponsor, should be rendered redundant by appropriate legislation at Westminster for fair employment with goals and timetables. Equally important should be the maximising of the support of the European Parliament on the one hand and of those claiming the moral high ground in the USA on the other for more employment in parallel with sound legislation for fair employment.  We should leave no pretext for exploitation by anyone in the United States of America motivated to use the MacBride platform for personal political aggrandisement or for the purpose of destabilising further one of Europe's most socially deprived areas.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the prisoners. It is vital that the role of prisons and prisoners in Anglo-Irish relations is understood and there are many lessons from the past.  An indication of such understanding should suggest that prisoners, whether English or Irish, should be allowed to serve their sentences in their home country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In education, while acknowledging parental rights of choice, it is important that the two Governments should encourage, wherever possible, truly integrated forms of education so that never again in Ireland will it be said that one half does not know how the other half <Col N="897" /> lives.  What hope do our children have of growth in unity if we do our damnedest to keep them apart?  Separate denominational education is certainly not the cause of our dilemma, yet integrated education is most certainly part of its solution. Let us, therefore, ask the Churches what are they up to as, on the one hand, the Church to which I belong, the Presbyterian Church, retains those Articles in the Westminster Confession of Faith so insulting to the Catholic people while our mother Church, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, dispensed with them, and not before time in 1986. Let us also ask, however, our Roman Catholic brothers and sisters in Ireland why it is that those who in the past rightly resented being designated as second class citizens are not now doing much more to eliminate the second class status which you confer on your Protestant and other brothers and sisters at the time or the inter-marriage of other Irish traditions with yours.</P>
    <P>With regard to the burning question of justice and its perception, constant monitoring of the effects of special powers and the need to reduce non-jury trials to a minimum must be pursued. There should be no place in the future of constructive Anglo-Irish evolution for insensitive attitudes bordering on arrogance such as those shown towards Ireland by the Trawsfynydd decision capped so quickly by yet another unsatisfactory chapter in the &ldquo;Stalkerisation&rdquo; of justice.  Nevertheless such unworthy developments in England should not become a pretext for anything less than the fullest possible co-operation in Ireland with Irish security forces in all legitimate action against those who seek political change by deliberate killing.</P>
    <P>In the political climate created by the agreement we in Northern Ireland have been challenged as never before to face up to our contradictions and in so doing to face some unpalatable realities.  This has had the effect of generating fresh constitutional debate in which the Task Force report and more notably the Commonsense document have played a not insignificant role.  The recent talks <Col N="898" /> between Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams must be viewed in a constructive light if we are ever to have hope of engaging constructively the marginalised political force encapsulated by Sinn Féin.  In this respect, no elected representative of the people should be denied access to the media and we should not be denied the right to interrogate such people on the media.  Dialogue means dialogue; violence means violence.  Few, if any, of our Irish traditions have not violated others and if the people, especially the Churches, call for dialogue, is it not important that there is dialogue with those whom they perceive as sinners as well as with the converted?</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act is an anachronism.  No solution in Ireland can be successful it it ignores the tradition which has sprung from the 1790s, reemerging in the 1840s and the 1860s, finding political expression in the emergence of Sinn Féin in 1905 and obtaining political justification from the landslide victory of the general election of 1918. With the residual legacy of the Irish historical conflict there will never be a ceasefire without some agreement on amnesty and without also a test of bona fides on all sides, an agreed de-escalation with both sides reading the signs in the hope of finding the trust on which a trial of truce followed by a ceasefire may be arranged.  Such things cannot be achieved by refusing to talk, however unpalatable such talks may be for many of us.  While I could put forward a sound argument to the Provisional IRA for a ceasefire, this is not the place, nor is there time to do so.</P>
    <P>If the Anglo-Irish understanding is to develop constructively it must now seek to achieve what thus far it has manifestly failed to do, to respond to the legitimate call from ordinary Unionist people for a say in the determination of their future, a say denied to them not just because the agreement was carried through over the top of their heads, but because of the failure on the part of their representatives and leaders to engage in constructive and imaginative debate concerning the increasingly untenable position into <Col N="899" /> which over 20 years they have led their followers.</P>
    <P>We have only to reflect on the outcome of the Northern Ireland Assembly 1974, the Convention 1975, the Round Table Conference.  Where were the imaginative Unionists at the time of the New Ireland Forum who could have rocked the Forum by presenting some new vision of Irish participation in archipelago confederation as distinct from Northern Irish Unionism?  What about the possibilities offered by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council, forerunner to the Anglo-Irish Conference?  What about the role of 15 Unionists to one Nationalist at Westminster?  While it is easy to point criticism at the leaders we must not, however, lose sight of the ordinary people and that is what the Governments should now address themselves to, by involving the most vulnerable and most marginalised in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, like to see, under Article 11 of the agreement, that the stage be set for far-reaching dialogue between the people of Northern Ireland and their representatives about our future and to promote such dialogue in as far as it is possible in a climate of reality.  Put bluntly, &ldquo;reality&rdquo; would suggest that the people of Britain are not all that anxious for Westminster to rule here indefinitely except in as far as they are not prepared to be seen to capitulate to the Provisional IRA.  The people of the Irish Republic are not all that keen to be lumbered with our problems at present, in part, perhaps, for fear of the IRA and the people of Northern Ireland in both traditions and communities show little enthusiasm for rule from Dublin, yet have to suffer paramilitary violence and State &ldquo;Stalkerisation&rdquo; as part of their day-to-day experience.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, believe that both Britain and Ireland &mdash; this is the belief of our group &mdash; should affirm jointly the right of all peoples to self-determination in accordance with Article 1, Clause 1 of the UN Covenants and, in accordance with the motion put down in my name so long ago under Item 32 on today's Seanad <Col N="900" /> Order Paper, the Governments should further affirm that the right to democratic self-determination is rooted in the achievement of consensus and, as Item 32 advocates, to press urgently for a suitable definition of consensus and also for a wider publication of the means of achieving it and the methods of assessing it.</P>
    <P>By making such a joint affirmation the people of Northern Ireland would be invited to conduct their debate divorced from the uncertainty previously sustained by the rival and conflicting claims of London and Dublin, yet in the knowledge of the prevailing attitudes of the people of both Britain and the Irish Republic. The two Governments should then act as joint sponsors of a process of dialogue and debate which would involve the people of Northern Ireland as well as their representatives and the Governments should agree to act as joint guarantors of the outcome of such process, provided it conforms with the principle of self-determination based on consensus.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, advocate that, using the list system to achieve the widest possible representation, an election take place to a forum in Northern Ireland to which the representatives would invite the people of Northern Ireland to make submissions both oral and verbal as regards the social, economic, political and constitutional problems that beset us, and also invite those outside Northern Ireland to make submissions, too.</P>
    <P>In the second phase, after the completion of the forum, the representatives should be encouraged to go into convention, first, to clarify the meaning of consensus and to research the methods of achieving it and means of assessing it and, secondly, to consider the constitutional options and all qualifications of them before presenting them to the people for their choice in a preferendum &mdash; the multiple choice referendum as devised by the Ecology Party.  It is at that stage that our New Ireland group would be promoting the vision of a new Ireland worthy of our people opening up, with suitable safeguards, exciting new possibilities.</P>
    <P>Finally, politics alone are in themselves <Col N="901" /> inadequate to resolve this ancient dilemma.  Unless we can evolve a much more courageous and imaginative way of exorcising guilt and resentment for attitudes and actions in the past collectively as well as individually, it is unlikely that we will ever free Ireland or Northern Ireland from the curse of division.  In short, if the religious traditions in Ireland are to redeem themselves for their contribution to the split in Irish consciousness, if we are ever to build a new society in which all our traditions will complement each other, the church leaders should be urged to indicate much more courageously and imaginatively their responsibility for what they have allowed to develop over generations in their name.  Without the promotion of a process of atonement among the Irish people, all else will be in vain.  We need ecclesiastical initiatives as well as political ones.</P>
    <P>In J. C. Beckett's <i>History of Modern Ireland</i> we read:</P>
    <P>It is a proverb of old date, that the pride of France, the treason of England, and the war of Ireland, shall never have end.  Which proverb, touching the war of Ireland, is likely always to continue, without God set in men's breasts to find some new remedy that was never found before.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak on behalf of the Government to the motion under debate.  The motion has proved far more timely than anticipated, although I would like to take strong issue with the terms of the motion in the sense that there is no lack of clarity in Government policy on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the action of the University Senators in asking for a debate on the North.  The question of the North is one of the most important and, indeed, grave issues facing Ireland today.  It has deeply affected every generation since the foundation of the State.  It has provoked terrible dilemmas and deep disillusionment. It has raised questions of a most fundamental <Col N="902" /> kind about what we are and to what we aspire.  The range of views expressed during this debate is testament to the divergence of approach on the best way forward for the country on the issue of the North.  It is also a measure of the energy and commitment of politicians of all shades to find an approach that is not only morally right but capable of achieving an advance in the cause of peace. Only that combination of effectiveness and justice can guarantee a sustainable solution.</P>
    <P>There has inevitably been criticism of the Government in this debate.  The Government have been criticised for ambivalence, for dragging their feet on the Anglo-Irish Agreement: they have been accused of pragmatism, lack of consistency. The Government's adherence to the view set out in our Constitution that the Irish nation consists of all who share this island, that, in other words, unity is our goal, has been critically examined. The aspiration to territorial unity has been damned as a Utopian will-o'-the-wisp which serves only to encourage terrorism.  The Government's espousal of the Irish people's aspiration to unity has been discussed as irrelevant to the people's real concerns, as an old stale cliche of our unattainable objectives. There was a bewildering range of recommendations. The Government were recommended to do more, to do less, to do nothing at all.</P>
    <P>While the Government have addressed themselves with tenacity and vigour to the problem of the public finances, they have diminished neither their attention nor their commitment to assisting in the resolution of the problems of the North. Our approach has been described as pragmatic by several speakers in the debate. We would not necessarily view that as a criticism.  There is nothing wrong with adopting a realistic pragmatic approach provided it is based on sound fundamental principles.  The Government's overall aim and the objective of the Fianna Fáil Party since their foundation is the reunification of the national territory. The unity we seek is the unity of all the people of this island.  The Government <Col N="903" /> reject any attempt to conceal or camouflage this aspiration by abandoning the concepts enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  In short the Government are fully committed to the achievement of our aim of Irish unity through peaceful, constitutional means.</P>
    <P>Unity for us is a legitimate and honourable aspiration which is deeply rooted in our sense of nationhood.  To surrender that aspiration would serve only to undermine our guardianship of Nationalists in the North and close off an avenue through which peace can come to this island.  In pursuit of our search for a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland the Government are continuing to actively pursue the Anglo-Irish process. I believe that whatever our divisions on specifics of policy may be, there is general consensus among Members of Seanad Éireann that this approach is the correct one and, indeed, the only one likely to achieve results.  The Anglo-Irish process was, of course, established at a historic meeting in Dublin Castle in December 1980 between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  It was a recognition that only in this context could a solution be found and that the problem of Northern Ireland was, and continues to be, an irritant and an impediment to achievement of fully satisfactory relations between our two islands.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of both countries that we have as close and friendly a relationship as is possible.  The Government are dedicated to good relations based on principled co-operation.  This process has served as the overall framework for successive Governments since 1980 in their approach to this problem.  I am sure that the Government can count on the support of all Members of Seanad Éireann in this regard.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office it made clear the areas which it saw as priority, namely the end to discrimination in employment, improved cross-Border social and economic co-operation, reforms in the administration of justice and the improvement of relations <Col N="904" /> between the security forces and the Nationalist people of the North.  The achievement of fair employment in Northern Ireland is a matter to which the Government attach the highest priority. The existing situation in which the unemployment rate for Catholics is twice that for Protestants is, by any standards, intolerable. After more than 60 years of being second-class citizens in the job market Nationalists are impatient for, and insistent on, change.  We share their sense of urgency and we have repeatedly emphasised that determined and far-reaching measures must be given legislative effect at the earliest possible time.  We have presented views and proposals in this area to the British authorities and we are anxious that the substance of those views should be reflected in the draft legislation currently under preparation.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to enhancing cross-Border economic co-operation as a means of improving the economies of both parts of this island, and because co-operation in this area would itself generate further co-operation and mutual understanding it was discussed at the conference meeting in July of last year when it was agreed that future contact between those concerned at ministerial and official level in both Governments would take place.  A number of such meetings have taken place in this context and several are intended on industrial matters, including science and technology.  The potential for cross-Border social and economic co-operation will also be explored in the north-west study which both Governments have agreed to commission.</P>
    <P>The need for satisfactory security co-operation between both Governments was most dramatically underlined by the size of the arms shipment on board the <i>Eksund.</i>  I believe that in the aftermath of events such as the Enniskillen massacre and the horrifying kidnap of Mr. John O'Grady, there is universal recognition in this State that violence by any and all sides has no place in the resolution of the problem of Northern Ireland.  If there has been any beneficial outcome from those horrible incidents it is the <Col N="905" /> commitment of the two communities in the North to see an end to this type of activity.  The futility of violence of this kind has been shown in stark reality and these events have brought it home in dramatic fashion to many people who may not have seen it clearly before this.</P>
    <P>The Government also attach great importance to the need for RUC accompaniment of the UDR.  The policy that the RUC should accompany all UDR patrols which involve direct contact with the community has been agreed by both Governments.  The Irish Government consider that the rate of progress towards full implementation of the policy has not been satisfactory and we wish to see, and are pressing for, a significant acceleration in this regard.  This is a matter of particular importance which reflects a long-standing concern of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Prisons policy is another area to which the Government attach great importance. We consider that it is essential that the British Government should ensure a prisons policy in Northern Ireland which is as liberal and humane as possible.  We were encouraged in this regard to note that our concerns have been reflected recently in the significant increase in the number of people granted Christmas parole in 1987.  Even more crucial, however, is the problem of young people being held at the Secretary of State's pleasure and of those serving life sentences. It is imperative that in the special circumstances obtaining in Northern Ireland, the most flexible and humane approach possible be adopted by the British authorities in relation to the life sentence review process and the setting at an earlier stage of dates of release for those serving intermediate sentences and, indeed, the whole question of remission for all categories of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the statement issued by the Government on Tuesday following the decision announced by the British Attorney General on Monday that there would be no prosecutions in the wake of the Stalker-Sampson inquiry <Col N="906" /> because of what he termed &ldquo;considerations of national security&rdquo;.  The Government's position on this most important issue was set out in further detail in the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil today.  All Senators will be aware of the deep dismay of the Government at the British decision and of our request, because of the serious implications of the British Attorney General's statement for public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and for cross-Border security co-operation, for an immediate special meeting of the Inter-governmental Council for the purpose of clarifying the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Preparations for this meeting are now in train, and pending its outcome I would not wish to comment further on the matter beyond reiterating the utmost seriousness with which the Government view the entire matter.  I feel sure that our concern is shared by all Members of this House.  In our day-to-day policy dealings with the British Government on Northern Ireland, the Government are fully committed to utilising all the mechanisms at our disposal to secure benefits for the entire population of Northern Ireland and in particular for the Nationalist population.  The present inequalities suffered by Nationalists not only offend against the principles of natural justice but are not, and cannot be, in the long term interest of any section of the population in the North.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the old order in the North is changing.  There is overall movement for change and with goodwill and commitment on all sides we can progress towards a more equal and just society.  I believe, however, that it is only honest to admit that progress has been more difficult and at a slower pace than we would have wished.  There are, nonetheless, areas where progress has been achieved and we welcome this.  The House can be assured that the Government will take every step necessary to ensure that this progress is built on and developed to the maximum degree possible. Policy on Northern Ireland is in sure and committed hands.</P>

      <P>It needs to be clarified which part of Northern Ireland we are talking about.  Is it Tyrone, Donegal, Cavan, Armagh, or where?  I suppose the motion does not refer to Donegal, Cavan or Monaghan, the three counties in the northern part of Ireland that have, like the other twenty-three counties in the Republic been free from British domination. I presume this motion refers to the other six counties in the province of Ulster.  The British Empire once covered one-seventh of the surface of the earth but the sun has long since set on that empire and its only possessions at this time are a few far-flung islands, one group, namely, the Malvinas, which give the British a spurious claim to a large tract of Antarctica and its last colony in this part of the world, the six occupied counties of the province of Ulster.</P>
      <P>Incidentally it is interesting how the British refer to this colony by calling it the province of Northern Ireland which, of course, it is not.  The Six Counties form an integral part of Ireland and they have, yet to be freed from British occupation, for occupation it is.  The British keep there a huge army backed up by massive reserves.  It is the place which had for many years a puppet government, a place in which there was widespread discrimination against the Nationalist population, a place where people held for questioning were subjected to most violent and severe forms of torture, a place where the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy, a place where murder by the security forces goes unpunished. In the words of a Taoiseach, it is a failed entity.  Senator Murphy, in opening up this debate, said he now totally rejects the concept of a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>That is his privilege.  I can assure Professor Murphy that I do not share his views and that his views are not shared by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe that we have not only a right but a duty to free the Six Counties and to try by all peaceful means at our <Col N="908" /> disposal to reunite this small island of ours.  As a first step there must be a British withdrawal.  Those who claim that there would be a bloodbath forget that there was a permanent bloodbath there for the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>British motives for staying in the Six Counties are not moral.  They are purely mercenary.  Holding the Six Counties and sponsoring the orange state prevents the united Ireland which might develop a real independence from British capitalism. One may argue that the British guarantee, namely that Northern Ireland shall remain a part of the United Kindgom for so long as a majority of the elected there so desire, makes Northern Ireland an international issue, where it is blatant interference by the United Kingdom Government in the affairs of a neighbouring country.  In the United States, Senator Edward Kennedy apparently sees it in this light.  In May 1979 and subsequently he suggested that as a first step to a settlement of the Six Counties problem the British Government should withdraw the guarantee, although Unionists dispute this view.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that Britain in 1921 refused to coerce the one-fifth of the population of Ireland who opposed a separate Irish State, but had no qualms about coercing the one-third of the population of Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry, Armagh, Down and Antrim who opposed partition. The final arbiter, it can hardly be denied, was force.  British guarantee means that force would be applied by Britain on Irish politics when and as required.  The present debacle over the Stalker affair illustrates precisely what I mean.  I do not speak here as a Government spokesman.  I have no mandate to state Government policy but I have a mandate from those whom I represent, and I have checked their views, and I can assure the House that the aspiration towards a reunited Ireland is widely held. I wonder if anyone suggests that we should forget what the British have done to us down the ages.</P>

      <P>We will never give up our &ldquo;silly&rdquo; claim to those counties currently occupied by her Majesty's armies.  As long as any part of Ireland is unfree we will never forget our Fenian dead.  The ideology of Irish nationalism will continue to ripple the political waters until its concept of nationhood is achieved, when the people of all Ireland can live as citizens under their own government and their own State.  If you were abroad and you met two men, one from Portavogie and one from Killybegs you would know immediately they were Irish and that is the way they would be treated in the country they were in.  One might have a British passport.  I would say to you that they would be unmistakeably from the same country.</P>
      <P>In a united Ireland, as outlined in the report of the New Ireland Forum, both great traditions in Ireland would have to be respected and given free expression.  I believe that these two traditions are not Nationalist and Unionist.  They are essentially Catholic and Protestant.  I would like to make a rather radical suggestion. Catholics who give allegiance to the Irish State also give allegiance of another kind, namely, religious allegiance to another head of State, namely, his Holiness the Pope.  I would see no difficulty in those of a Protestant tradition giving allegiance to the Irish State and like Roman Catholics giving religious allegiance to another head of State, namely the British monarch. Perhaps the suggestion might point the way towards a future solution.  Catholics and Protestants would have their religious traditions preserved while at the same time would have their secular aspirations taken care of by the State to which they give their secular allegiance.  Perhaps then we could finally live peacefully as one nation free to pursue our own destiny and free particularly from interference by our near neighbours.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not wish to be contentious, but I greatly deprecate the remarks of the speaker immediately preceding me, Senator Lydon.  It seems to me that the most dangerous and inflammatory thing we can do is to go <Col N="910" /> back to the cheap rhetoric of gloating over the demise of the British Empire. The British Empire is long gone.  We should live in the present.  We should understand what the realities of this country, North and South, are.  Speaking as a member of the Anglican Church I can assure the Senator that nobody in his right mind would take his suggestion as other than deeply insulting and if I feel that down here, I can assure you the people in the North of Ireland would feel it a hundredfold.  I hope he will have the gentlemanliness to withdraw that remark which I found deeply offensive.</P>
      <P>With regard to the North of Ireland and reunification of this island that seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate aim. The Government have expressed it quite rationally, quite reasonably.  I do not have the kind of doubts about the Government's policy on Northern Ireland that some of the other people seem to have.  It seems to be reasonably clear.  What worries me is the lack of clarity in the British Government's attitude. I understand that we will have an opportunity to discuss what has been properly described as the &ldquo;Stalkerisation&rdquo; of justice in the North of Ireland later on this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, like to address myself to some of the remarks made earlier by my distinguished and valued colleague, Professor Murphy, when he said he has put himself on record as saying that he now totally rejects the concept of a United Ireland and continued, &ldquo;I am suggesting that my position is as patriotic as those who prattle empty rhetoric about a United Ireland&rdquo;.  Indeed; but it is not an attitude that I share.  I happen to agree with the character of Sean O'Casey, Seamus Shields, and I recommend his very sane words, taken from the &ldquo;Shadow of a Gunman&rdquo; where it says &ldquo;I am a Nationalist myself right enough.  I believe in a United Ireland but I draw the line when I hear the gunmen blowin' about dying for the people, when it is the people that is dyin' for the gunmen&rdquo;.  If any of the gunmen, or if any of those who tacitly use the cloak of respectability to support them, would like to know what the effect <Col N="911" /> is of their policies in this island and particularly in the south of this island, in the Republic, I can inform them, because an attitude survey was done by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland covering the years 1983 and 1987, and the kind of inflated rhetoric we have heard has had this effect.</P>
    <P>In 1983, 39 per cent of people in the Republic thought that the expectation of a united Ireland was completely unrealistic, that it would never happen.  In 1987 it was 49 per cent.  In 1983, 9 per cent of the people thought it would take 100 years to unify the island.  Now 11 per cent of people think it will take 100 years. Sixteen per cent thought it would take 50 years.  Now it is 13 per cent who are that optimistic.  In 1983, 17 per cent thought it would take 25 years.  Now 9 per cent think it can be achieved in that timescale. In 1983 nine per cent thought ten years might do it.  Now it is 7 per cent.  About 10 per cent have not changed their opinion at all.  That is the effect of what we have seen going on in the North.  That is the test of whether the bomb and the bullet and dangerous rhetoric actually work.  If you want to know about aspirations towards a united Ireland &mdash; and Senator Lydon is perfectly entitled to speak about the aspirations of what he regards as his constitutents by which I presume he means the county councillors for he does not have the kind of constituency that Members of the other House have.</P>
    <P>The county councillors of the Fianna Fáil Party may have a particular attitude, but the plain people of Ireland have a slightly different and shifting attitude.  In 1983 76 per cent of the people in the Republic thought that a united Ireland was at least something to hope for.  By 1987 that had gone down to 67 per cent &mdash; a remarkable shift in attitude.  Even the perception of what an Irish nation is has altered.  In 1983, 63 per cent of the Irish people thought that the Irish nation constituted 32 counties.  We are now down to 56 per cent.  In 1983, 34 per cent thought it was only the 26 counties; now it is 38 per cent.  &ldquo;No opinion&rdquo; has changed <Col N="912" /> from 3 per cent to 6 per cent.  Those figures &mdash; it seems to me &mdash; indicate a very clear change in attitudes on the part of people down here.</P>
    <P>I also accept that there is serious concern and I very much welcome the Minister's statement.  I welcome the strong line being taken by the Government on the refusal to publish the Stalker report. These matters, taken together with what seems to be clear evidence of miscarriages of justice in the British legal system, cause great concern.  It is quite painful for me &mdash; because my father was English.  I was brought up to have respect for the British legal system and to think it was one of the finest in the world. When I hear people like Lord Denning appearing to imply that, in order to find Irish people innocent, it would be necessary to find British policemen guilty and, therefore, this is a serious obstacle to the implementation of justice, I am very worried indeed.  I am also very worried by this continuous presumption of guilt &mdash; the guilt of Irish people &mdash; not just in Britain but also in this country.</P>
    <P>I attended a debate recently and I was most interested and moved to listen to an ordinary, peace-loving woman who appeared to have no spite or revenge about her, Mrs. Annie Maguire, speaking. I noted that just before she spoke, one of the Irish daily newspapers described her as &ldquo;Bomber Annie&rdquo;.  I think that is most regrettable.  So we have quite a job to do.  Rather than a lot of rhetoric, we could all do with cultivating the art of listening, not just listening to ourselves but listening to each other, although sometimes it is good to listen to yourself.  I wish some of the reverend gentlemen I heard speaking in the North of Ireland last 12 July had listened to themselves because it seemed to me that they had not fully understood the implications of the language system they were using.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Lydon on one thing.  That is the use of the word &ldquo;province&rdquo;.  It is very interesting.  I heard several clergy refer to &ldquo;our province&rdquo;. What is it a &ldquo;province&rdquo; of?  It certainly is <Col N="913" /> not a province of England.  If it is a province of anything, it is a province of the island of Ireland and there is at least a geographical coherence about the notion of the completeness of Ireland as an island.  I believe that the positive way forward for this Government and for anybody who really loves this island is to concentrate not on the things that divide us, whether it is the Fenian dead or collapse of the British empire or the battle of the Boyne or any of this hogwash &mdash; I do not want to know about it at all &mdash; but to concentrate on the practical issues that unite us.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to believe that the Northern Protestants are pragmatic and practical.  I would like to see some more evidence of it.  With regard to the things like the Common Agricultural Policy, for example, there is a clear identity of interest between farmers North and South.  Why do they not realise and why are they not honest about it and why do not their politicians reflect it?  I know that in Europe some of those representing dyed-in-the-wool Unionist constituencies are quite capable of behaving reasonably with regard to some of these economic issues.  Why do they then trot back to Belfast and pretend that we are all devils with six heads down here?  It is unrealistic. We must continue to push these areas of co-operation as hard as we can. The same applies to integrating as far as possible the electricity generating grid. These are non-contentious issues by and large.  Let us hope that the IRA will not try and blow up these installations.</P>
    <P>I would like to address myself a little bit to this problem.  I believe that North and South one of the most intractable problems this island faces is unemployment. If we could co-operate and attempt to win as much as possible in the way of investment and employment in this island North and South, we would go a long way towards solving this problem, and the IRA know that perfectly well. That is why they specifically targeted employment exchanges, large industrial complexes.  They feed on unemployment so we should, North and South, be attempting to ensure the employment <Col N="914" /> levels are maintained as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I do think, however, that it is a little bit odd to hear people being so high minded and so critical about John Hume &mdash; a man I must say I admire very greatly &mdash; meeting Gerry Adams.  I have no time whatever for Mr. Adams, none in the world.  However, it seems to be all right for the British Government to meet these people when they so desire.  Why do people not worry about that?  Mr. Adams I understand &mdash; and I am prepared to be corrected on this &mdash; is an elected representative. We hear a lot about <i>a la carte</i> Catholicism and, frankly, considering the <i>table d'hôte</i> version, I would practically have to go for <i>a la carte</i> if I were a member of the Roman Catholic Church.  It seems to me that what we have here is <i>a la carte</i> democracy.  If somebody is elected, you may not like it.  You may, in fact, wish that the people did not elect these people at all, and I certainly do, but if they are elected it is outrageous to criticise another elected person for speaking to them.  I hope John Hume said to Mr. Adams the kind of thing that I would very much like to say to him and that I think the vast majority of the people in the Republic would like to say to him.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the fact that Senator Murphy mentioned that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, said in an interview that Anglo-Irish relations will never be correct as long as Northern Ireland remains unresolved and he wonders what the Taoiseach means by that. It would be impertinent for me to interpret the mind of someone as canny as the Taoiseach but I think I have an inkling of what he means.  I do not want to use phrases such as &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; or anything like that, but when you have an island in which there is a divided jurisdiction with a foreign country having the governmental powers in that area of the country, it is not a normal relationship.  One would hope that it might, at least gradually, begin to change.  I certainly hope that gradually it might begin to change.</P>
    <P>I feel that Articles 2 and 3 are an obstacle because they are slightly absurd and we simply do not have jurisdiction there.  The Government know that.  They <Col N="915" /> have themselves consolidated this view by increasing the strictness of the tariff barriers quite recently so if they actually believe we have jurisdiction, why are they themselves treating it as a foreign country?  I would like to say one final thing with regard to discrimination. Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland have been discriminated against.  I wish the Government here &mdash; if they really take seriously the claims to the whole of Ireland &mdash; would feel that they were representing also the interests of the Unionist population.  They should not simply all the time say &ldquo;we are representing the Roman Catholic population&rdquo;. If any member of the Government, including the Minister or Senator Leydon, wants to know about discrimination do not look just to how we treat the Protestants down here.  I know them very well: they are a small group, articulate, well heeled and mealymouthed, so there is no problem about looking after them &mdash; 3 per cent.  If you want to know about discrimination, join the 10 per cent of homosexual citizens in the country who can tell you all about discrimination.</P>

I want to make it clear that there must have been some misunderstanding by the otherwise extremely efficient and courteous reporting staff because I certainly would not make an intervention like that.

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right but I just want to draw attention to it here.  I am very glad that I sponsored this motion.  Perhaps the contribution was not as extensive as I would have liked but we got a fair response to our motion.  I would like to refer to what some of the contributors said.  I do not see any point in the proposal made by Senator Ross and echoed by Senator O'Callaghan, that we should have an all-Ireland poll on the question of unity.  After all, this is the same category of pointlessness as having a Border poll.  We all know where everybody stands.  Securing an arithmetical majority is as pointless as it was in 1918 and from the point of view of the problems of unity the 1918 election was indecisive though it gave a majority landslide to Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed by Senator Lanigan's contribution.  It seemed to reiterate all the most stale clichés in the Fianna Fáil vocabulary and to point up one of the unpalatable truths about this country, that public rhetoric is miles away from the developing reality.  It is not true simply on the question of the North but in everything else as well.  There is a kind of public facade, a pretence that things are so when, in fact, they are widely different. For Senator Lanigan to pretend that there is a national consensus now for unity does not hold up anymore, as Senator Norris's remarkable statistics demonstrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan's analogy with the Palestinians is an exaggeration.  I do not think that British rule in Ireland in <Col N="917" /> the 20th century, whatever its effects and its stupidities, can remotely compare with the Stalinist treatment by Israel of the Palestinians since 1948.  Senator O'Callaghan's contribution in other respects was inaccurate.  He spoke, for example, of Catholics not having a vote.  It was unfortunate &mdash; and I will say no more about it &mdash; that he used words like &ldquo;anti-Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quisling&rdquo;.  That kind of personal abuse does not get us very far.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole's contribution was necessarily curtailed and I understand that he is not able to join us at this point. Today we listened to Senator Eogan who said a lot of very interesting things.  He made the valuable point that in many ways we do have a common island and we have lots of cross-Border activity from sport, to banks, to Co-operation North and so on and all that is eminently desirable. I am saying that if we gave up the territorial claim, if there was an agreeable political framework in the North, then all of these activities would be immensely more attractive to the Unionist population because all the suspicion and all distrust would be much allayed.  As things are, everything is overshadowed by the territorial claim, everything is seen as a stalking horse for unity, even such a progressive and a commendable institution as Co-operation North.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan's reference to European background is also important because the comparative analysis is always useful, though I could not quite see what these developments in Scandinavian countries and so on have to offer to us in this situation.  I incline to the view that the Northern Ireland situation is <i>sui generis</i>, is unique, and that comparisons with other countries may be interesting but they do not get us all that far.  I was in large agreement with Senator Robb's contribution.  As I understand it, what Senator Robb is saying is essentially what I am saying: &ldquo;take off the pressure, Dublin; take off the pressure, London. We have to do it ourselves with your goodwill but not with your pressure&rdquo;.  I am in total agreement with that.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Minister's contribution. <Col N="918" /> Life is always full of surprises; I was expecting something totally bland. It began with some bland statements like, &ldquo;the Irish nation is all who share this island&rdquo;&mdash; I wish the Constitution said so: it does not say anything like that.  The Constitution does not refer to another phrase used by the Minister, &ldquo;the unity of all the people of this island&rdquo;.  From there on the Minister's statement went towards answering some of the questions contained in my motion.  It spelled out day-to-day Government policy.  It does not agree with my position.  I did not expect that it would but it was a great deal better than I expected.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon's contribution was very little different in its rhetoric from the Provo position.  He used works like &ldquo;occupied&rdquo;, &ldquo;freed from occupation&rdquo; and &ldquo;British occupation&rdquo;.  He never mentioned once that the real British in the North, as James Molyneaux said long ago, are the Unionists.  &ldquo;We are the British,&rdquo; said James Molyneaux, &ldquo;and we have no intention of getting out&rdquo;.  Senator Lydon did not address himself to that problem.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Norris's ultimate position on this.  When I say that I now am against the whole idea of territorial unity what I mean, of course, is that I would love to see a united Ireland.  Would not everybody from the tradition from which we came?  It would be, apart from anything else, an emotionally fulfilling concept but I hold the view that at the moment the aspiration to a united Ireland is insincere, the territorial claim is counterproductive.  It is a barrier to peace and understanding and we do not need it anymore because if the Anglo-Irish Agreement could be implemented properly &mdash; and we must continue to put pressure on the British to work it properly &mdash; then that agreement gives us that role of being guarantors and of being supervisors, as it were, to discharge our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland.  It is because I believe the territorial claim is desperately counterproductive and a continual source of supicion that I think it would be in the national interest to drop it totally.  A <Col N="919" /> united Ireland, if it ever comes, will come at the end of a long process.  It will certainly not come at the beginning.  It will come as a result of peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>When I seem to criticise Fianna Fáil I criticise those elements of Fianna Fáil who will not examine the question as it is being painfully revealed now before their eyes.  In that respect they share the same mentality as Messrs. Paisley and Molyneux who now want, apparently, a resurrection of the old Stormont.  What they had to say in the last few days of the talks with the Northern Ireland Office is a sure proof that like the Bourbons they have forgotten nothing and learnt nothing.  Einstein said something profoundly true about the dilemma of the world in the nuclear age.  &ldquo;Mankind&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;will have to learn new ways of thinking if it is to survive&rdquo;.  I suggest that in Ireland, if we are to survive in terms of peace and reconciliation, then we must learn new ways of thinking.</P>

    <P>I am very pleased that the Cathaoirleach was able to make this time available this evening to discuss a number of very serious matters which in some ways follow on almost directly from the last debate we were having until a few moments ago.  The past four days have been the most potentially dangerous for Anglo-Irish relations since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement two years ago.  Two events have conspired to create the sense of danger and threat to Anglo-Irish relations.  The second one was one over which the British Government or British executive had no control.  The first, the one which happened at the beginning of this week, was one over <Col N="920" /> which it had direct control and for which it must be held directly responsible.</P>
    <P>The second of these events was the decision of the British Court of Appeal within the last hour or so to reject the appeal of those who had become known as the Birmingham Six.  That decision will be received with, I believe, a great deal of sadness in this country and I am sure also with a great deal of frustration and for many people a deep sense of anger and helplessness.  I am not going to say that the appeal was not properly carried out, I am not going to say that the judges are not honourable men, I am not going to say that the Birmingham Six did not get every chance to make their case.</P>
    <P>I would say from reading the reports that the level of commitment and the skill of their advocates was of the very highest level and that they were indeed very well served by those who made their case over the long weeks of that appeal.  Nor this afternoon am I going to talk about the quality of British justice especially as it affects Irish people in Britain.  I believe that such talk is unhelpful and I believe that it is frequently inaccurate and often offensive to those who are of good will towards this country.  Most important of all I believe that talk of this kind, attacking the British legal system, the British judicial system, does not get us very far in trying to redress those things about which we feel more strongly and where we feel there has been a miscarriage of justice.  I am going to say, however, that it would be almost impossible for any British court to be objective, to be dispassionate, to be disinterested or uninvolved as far as the issues raised by the Birmingham Six Case are concerned. This, perhaps, as happens only rarely in the history of a country, was a case of the British legal establishment trying the legal establishment.  As had been said by Lord Denning very early on in all of this process, a verdict which overturned the original decision of the lower courts would virtually turn the whole judicial system, the whole system of British justice on its head, and nothing would be secure after that.</P>
    <P>I believe the great weakness in what <Col N="921" /> has happened is that it was so much a case of the establishment trying the establishment and that, no matter how hard the judges may have tried, that this, subconsciously or consciously, was always part of the process.  Had that appeal been carried out in an international court, had there been international judges on the bench, then whatever the verdict was it would have been easier to accept and there would not be the great sense of frustration which is so manifest at the outcome of today's decision.  As it is it is a fact that a great many people will simply not accept this result.</P>
    <P>The whole process is reminiscent of that great issue which tore apart the Third Republic of France at the end of the last century, the whole issue of Dreyfus, whether he was innocent or guilty.  I believe that the question now of innocence or guilt is for most people a matter almost of faith, belief or principle rather than of an assessment of the evidence.</P>
    <P>The decision today, for whatever reason, has now created and placed on the agenda a new source of enmity between the peoples of the two islands and a sore that can fester.  This issue and the issue of the Birmingham Six, the result of which has become known since this motion was raised this morning, are very much tied up.  The British Government, who acted so crassly, so brazenly and with such insensitivity in the early part of this week on the Stalker-Sampson affair can rescue something from the wreckage of this black week by listening to the very honest doubts which have been raised by so many honourable people, some of them in the Conservative Party, in the Labour Party, in the other political parties in Britain and in all the Churches in Britain right across the political, social and cultural divides in that country.</P>
    <P>That Government can rescue something from the wreckage all round them at the moment by listening to those doubts.  If they feel their hands are bound by the legal decision today, at least they can act quickly in a humanitarian way and do something to lessen the damage by proceeding for a quick parole for those <Col N="922" /> people.  This is not what they want.  They want their names cleared but, at least, on the outcome of today, with so much other wreckage all around, there is that possibility for the British Government to act in a way which is humanitarian.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning that the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the process established by that agreement are the context within which we are looking at this issue.  In spite of what I may have said last week, I do not have to stress in this House the over-riding importance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and of the overwhelming commitment of the vast majority of the people in this part of the country and a growing number in Northern Ireland to ensuring that that process will work.  Progress has been made and there is a real possibility for future progress arising from the Agreement.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the agreement was to be in a position to resolve difficulties like this.  If the agreement is to work it needs to be worked in a way which shows sensitivity on the part of both Governments.  That applies equally to us.  Insensitive Anglophobia on the part of members of our Government or Members of either House is something which, intentionally or unintentionally, can do damage to the very delicate process set up.  It needs sensitivity; it involves a great deal of give and take; it is a two-way process.</P>
    <P>The problem, however, is that on this Stalker-Sampson affair the British Government have, for whatever reasons which have not been explained either publicly or privately, pre-empted the possibility of this being treated with sensitivity and with a certain amount of respect.  The British Government have behaved in a way which showed that no calculation was made about the results of the acts which they were taking in Northern Ireland or on the Anglo-Irish process.</P>
    <P>What has happened at the beginning of this week has given the Provisional IRA the biggest boost that evil organisation have had for many a long day. They can now point to their shoot-to-kill <Col N="923" /> policy as being no different from that carried out by the alleged forces of the crown, the forces of law and order.  They have the example of that to bolster up their own threadbare position.  It is the biggest boost of their credibility for many a long day.  What has happened also has greatly boosted those who say that, where Britain is concerned in a matter like this, reasons of State, State security, will always make a casualty of truth or make a casualty of the delicate situation existing in this country and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What happened this week also makes it very difficult for those who still believe in the inherent goodwill of the British Government as far as resolving in a political and acceptable way the problem of Northern Ireland.  It is very difficult to be sustained in that sense of goodwill, to be sustained in a sense of believing in the honest motives of the British Government as a result of what happened last Monday.  The British Government had long enough to calculate and predict the results of their action last Monday.  They had long enough to work out who were the people who would be hurt by what they were doing, to know that it was the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, to know that it was the Government and the political parties in this country who would be most hurt by what they were doing and to know that the biggest casualty of all would be those in the Catholic Nationalist community of Northern Ireland who are striving to promote peaceful political solutions, who are trying against many odds and a great deal of inherited enmity to promote a belief in the honesty and even-handedness of the RUC.  The British Government must have known that these would be the casualties of the announcement made last week.</P>
    <P>When we look back on what happened, we see that Mr. Stalker was appointed to investigate allegations of a shoot-to-kill policy allegedly implemented by senior members of the RUC.  His <Col N="924" /> appointment was made by the Chief Constable after the Director of Public Prosecutions had requested that such an investigation should be made.  In all of this sorry episode the Director of Public Prosecutions appears to be the fall-guy, the one who is suffering as much as anybody else.</P>
    <P>Two trials have taken place already and members of the RUC have been acquitted.  After these trials the DPP concluded that the evidence did not warrant criminal proceedings but, when it transpired afterwards that there had been omissions and that the evidence given was at the very least misleading, there was a need for the urgent investigation. When John Stalker was appointed to lead this investigation it was seen to highlight the concern felt by both the British and Northern Ireland authorities.  However, after two years heading this report Mr. Stalker was replaced in circumstances which have never been explained and which the British establishment have never sought to justify or explain.</P>
    <P>The last Government led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald had reason to believe that a number of RUC members could be faced with serious charges.  This had come directly from high British political sources.  It is astonishing now to hear from the British Attorney General that no charges are to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>After the previous trial the DPP in Northern Ireland said:</P>
    <P>The director has, however, concluded that there is evidence of the commission of offences, of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice or of obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty and that this evidence is sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions are required in the public interest.</P>
    <P>However, after the DPP and the Attorney General had consultations, it was agreed that no proceedings would take place in the interests of &ldquo;national security&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;. The questions which we must now ask are the questions of national security, <Col N="925" /> where the trial led, why this support is being suppressed, to whose door would the trial eventually have led and what is so embarrassing for the British establishment that the future of the Anglo-Irish process and the Anglo-Irish Agreement can be jeopardised in this interest.</P>
    <P>This brings to mind Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which deals with relations in the security forces.  In Article 7 of this agreement it is stated that policy issues and serious incidents would be addressed regularly at joint Anglo-Irish meetings.  These serious allegations against members of the RUC, made in the Stalker-Sampson report, should without any doubt be discussed and addressed at some such meeting.  The British would have no reason whatsoever for refusing to proceed or for drawing back from treatment of the issue under this particular Article of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>This issue is one which gives nobody any great joy in this part of the country. At this stage the British Government have only one option, one acceptable option, and that is to ensure that the matter is examined in the fullest possible way at the next and most urgent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference and to ensure that a full disclosure of the report is made to the Irish Government.  The Irish Government will decide in their wisdom as to whether to make this public but at least they are entitled to be given full possession of the Stalker-Sampson report and to be told the reasons the British Government did not proceed.</P>
    <P>The whole episode is unnecessary and as I have said it constitutes the biggest threat to the stability, survival and workability of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I believe that the British Government have no alternative but to see it in that context. Their treatment of the Irish Government and of the Anglo-Irish process in this matter has been shabby and unworthy and the onus is now on them to persuade us that there are good reasons for what they have done &mdash; which I think will be very difficult to do &mdash; and, failing that, to treat the matter as it should have been <Col N="926" /> treated in the first place, which is openly and honourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who comes from the North or who is associated with the difficulties there will have been very saddened this afternoon on hearing the news in regard to the decision on the appeal of the Birmingham Six.  We also have had the unpalatable decision of the DPP not to furnish the Stalker-Sampson report.  I think that there is a crisis at present &mdash; and I welcome the Taoiseach's speech which was crisp and positive.  Few of us would have known who John Stalker was before the shoot-to-kill policy became public knowledge.  There was an outcry about this policy that had been evident and public knowledge in the North.  It is important to recognise that the seriousness of the shoot-to-kill policy which was being implemented, whether by M15 or M16, has now surfaced because the refusal to publish the Stalker-Sampson report implies and insinuates that people of a higher level were involved.  I want to say a few words on this.</P>
      <P>I live very near the Border and fear is very rife in that area.  I compliment and admire Senator John Robb's contribution even though I did not totally agree with everything he said.  If we have fallen down in any area it is that we have failed to convince the British that their go-stop policy and their entrenchment has helped keep the fires burning in the North.  I will not delay this House by covering areas that have already been well covered in speeches, documents, reports and so on but let me go back to Bloody Sunday when the British went in and shot 13 innocent people in Derry.  The frustrations which the people felt were such that it was of great relief when the British Embassy was burned down.  At least, it provided a channel for the venting of the frustrations which the people felt.  They were in a very serious mood at that time. Tonight I would say that the frustration the people are feeling is not much different from that experienced in the days following Bloody Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cross the Border three or four times a day and I do business with people in the <Col N="927" /> North whose politics and religion differ from mine.  You can never blanketly condemn and categorise.  The ordinary reasonable people in the North are trying desperately to get away from being classified as a tribal people and to shake off the mantle of being tagged as bandits. John Robb's presence in this Seanad has been of benefit in this regard.  I am delighted to see him here and that he has the courage of his convictions to speak his mind.  He is a Northern voice in this House and one I value very much.</P>
    <P>I do not have the answers but I do know that, as Senator Manning has said, this is a glorious day for the Provisional IRA.  They will be able to claim that politics have failed both North and South and with some justification.  I could give, without having to document, numerous examples.  The British not too long ago said that they wanted to make politics work in the North but at the very same time that that statement was being made, the Assembly in the North was being abandoned along with the people elected to it.  We realise that politics is a way of life and that it is not a richman's club by any means.  Those who were part of that Assembly put everything in to it and had little home life during that time.  Their salaries were withdrawn at one stroke of a pen.  I could never understand why the British made statements to the effect that they would like to see politics work in the North of Ireland while at the very same time eliminating those who were elected by the people on the ground.  By eliminating the people who were elected to represent a very difficult area it will prove harder to get politics going again.  That sticks out in my mind as a clear example of how Britain has yet to grasp the nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>Merlyn Rees in Opposition had all the answers but when in Government he had very few answers.  I am deeply concerned about the repercussions of this decision. The hopes of the people who hold the middle of the road have been dashed.  I do not know what the response of the British Government will be, only time will tell.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> The reasons behind the decision to withhold the publication of the Stalker-Sampson report will come to the surface but, unfortunately, will not come out quickly enough to prevent many innocent young people being encouraged to join paramilitary groups and from going out to commit murders and atrocities and plant bombs.  Those who now hold the middle of the road and those who are not involved will commit themselves and feelings will run to the point where people will be prepared to put money on the plate which will be used to buy arms. Unfortunately, this is that kind of seesaw. If the IRA were to commit atrocities and kill innocent people tomorrow there would be an anti response to them but the British have also committed atrocities and the British Government are fairly and squarely behind those.  There was M15, M16 and local police involvement. The policy was crystal clear and I am interpreting it as I see it.  The policy was to eliminate those who might be carrying out military operations in the North.  The policy was crystal clear and it is policy not carried on anywhere else in Europe. If it were to happen in any other part of the world, we would despise it.  We see it happening in Africa and we despise it.  In Northern Ireland there is only one step short and that is the banning of the media. Those atrocities have been condoned and it is crystal clear that the decision was taken by the British Government and it is one I fear which will have very dangerous repercussions.  It will encourage the paramilitaries to keep going and the biggest tragedy of all is that it will encourage people who would not normally get involved to support the paramilitaries. The British Government have created this problem and I will wait with interest to hear what their answers to those charges are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support what Senator Manning has said.  I am very much in agreement with his analysis of the situation.  If this kind of brazen denial was given in the United States, in a hypothetically similar situation, we would be absolutely appalled.  In fact, it <Col N="929" /> is only the British who can get away with that cocking a snook, so to speak, at all proper values in a situation like that. There attitude towards the Stalker-Sampson report and their admission that justice was perverted but that the national interest must prevail is as blatant a piece of Machiavellianism as you could possibly get in modern politics.  It is really quite breathtaking.  It illustrates some eternal historical truths, one of which was enunciated long ago by the Rev. Sidney Smith.  His exact words excape me but it was to the intent that when it comes to Ireland all the decent values that the British like to attribute to themselves simply disappear and sanity goes out the window.  That seems to have been borne out in this case again.</P>
      <P>It also illustrates something which we find very hard to take and grasp and that is that Ireland and Irish affairs are of only marginal interest to the Government of the United Kingdom and always have been whereas with us they occupy a major part of the forefront of our attentions. That is why we feel so upset, I think, at not alone the blatant injustice and cynicism but at the underlying implication that we do not really count so far as they are concerned.  The report has revealed, quite nakedly, a measure of cynicism and indifference to Ireland which has always been part of the British establishment.  It is my view that there is far more evidence of anti-Irishness in British establishment circles than there is of anti-Britishness in Irish political circles. This may be my day for praising the Fianna Fáil Government but I think their reaction so far has been a very correct one and, indeed, the Opposition have been similarly responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Birmingham Six, Senator Manning has again expressed the views of most of us.  Even if their innocence in the last analysis was not proved, certainly there were so many shadows of suspicion about their guilt and so many reservations expressed by so many people that the most fundamental principle of humane British law should apply in that case.  It is, as Senator Manning suggested, over and above the machinery of the <Col N="930" /> judicial process.  This is surely a case which calls for Government clemency, for an act of prerogative.  After all, a Government here had to save face over the imprisonment of Nicky Kelly.  In the end they bit the bullet and I see no reason that the bad work of this week cannot be undone in Britain in the same way.</P>
    <P>Another casualty of the events in the House of Commons earlier this week will be the Royal Ulster Constabulary which is going to be enormously damaged by what has happened and here I mean the rank and file member of the RUC, the constable who over the last difficult two to three years in the North has done his best to discharge his duties, frequently at the cost of a tremendous conflict of allegiance with his own tribe, as it were. The rank and file in the RUC deserve a great deal of admiration.  Their position is going to be made doubly dangerous by this week's decision.</P>
    <P>All that being said, I would deprecate any self-indulgence in anti-British feeling. It is too late in the day for reacting in the blind and instinctive way we did in 1972 at the time of Bloody Sunday.  Too much blood has flowed under the bridge since then, most of it the blood of our own people.  Therefore, we cannot afford to be stampeded into a display as I have said of self-indulgent anti-Britishness. There is no future in that, it is totally pointless and negative.  We have to continue the dialogue and to put pressure on the British through the constitutional means available and I am sure the Government will do that responsibly.  We must always remember that our real interests are with the British security forces, the security forces in the North. The real alignment of sanity in this island lies in British-Irish relations and the real enemy is not the British but those paramilitaries who have murdered for so long in our name.</P>
    <P>This is a week which also saw the discovery of some more of these bunkers which pose such a great security threat and a week that saw the Provisional IRA in possession of armour-piercing grenades in Belfast and with all the implications that go with that.  I will conclude by saying <Col N="931" /> we must not lose our sense of balance or our sense of proportion here and that the policy of bombing and shooting to kill is also exercised in this island by paramilitaries from both communities, but particularly those paramilitaries who have been responsible for most of the fatalities in the North since 1971 and who are the main cause of the continuing violence and who act in the name of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>When travelling down here this morning at some speed I had to suddenly stop at Newry because of a tail back a mile long of large articulated trucks.  I must confess it was the first time in my life that I took myself off onto an unregistered road in order to get here, as I hoped I would, for the Order of Business.  On my way down I listened to a report from England on the radio.  In that report the Chief Justice who was managing the appeal was reported to have said at the opening of today's events that he saw absolutely no reason for a retrial and my heart sank.  He went on to say that in a number of hours time he would give his verdict and, quite obviously, there is just one thing to be decided: will the conviction be quashed or will it be sustained? I felt that he was preparing us and the people in England for the fact that the convictions would be quashed.  In not having a retrial, the dirty linen that the English seem to be particularly worried about would not have to be viewed in public.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, with a bitter sense of disappointment that I heard the news about the outcome and it was all the more so, as other Senators have said, as it came on top of a fortnight in which we first suffered the insensitivity and arrogance of the decision in regard Trawsfynydd and then the decision in regard to the Stalker-Sampson report.  Last night I took the precaution of sending a letter to the Irish newspapers about the latter and I will conclude my short delivery by reading it to you after I have made one or two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like first of all, to support what <Col N="932" /> Senator Murphy has said concerning Senator Manning's contribution.  It should give us all hope for the future that both Government and Opposition, in spite of feeling tremendous resentment which they must feel following their years of endeavour to change things and to change things for the better, and in spite of the enormous setbacks they have had to suffer in the last fortnight have appealed &mdash; and I would like to join in that appeal &mdash; to the people of Ireland to show themselves to be bigger people than the people across the water and to show that we can occupy the moral high ground rather than the imperial high ground.  In doing so we can patiently ferret away to ensure that these men will get justice.  I am certain that if the Irish diaspora, the diplomatic corps, exercise themselves positively, albeit in a constrained way, to ensure that what has not happened today will happen, we will be able to obtain mercy for these men.  As has been suggested, even if their guilt could not be disproved, there comes a point where there is so much doubt in a case such as this &mdash; so many other people's lives are involved and they have already served such a long period of time incarcerated in a jail &mdash; that we have to come back to the old dictum that justice should always be tempered with mercy.  In this case it has not been, and we are all the poorer for it and no more so than the English.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a formal word of praise for the work which has been done by people such as Fr. Denis Faul in this case and by our friend and former Senator, Seamus Mallon, who probably first brought our attention to the shoot-to-kill policy way back in 1982.  There have been other people involved in this in the North of Ireland who have appeared to come out honourably.  Sir Barry Shaw seems, as far as one can detect, to be a man who honourably intended to play fair.  I also think that my old neighbour Richard Ferguson did the appeal proud with his defence of the members of the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would now like to make one appeal to this House as a person coming from the North of Ireland <Col N="933" /> and living in a predominently Loyalist area.  Do not forget that these decisions have been made in England.  They were not made by Irishmen in Northern Ireland.  It comes back to what I said in my other contribution earlier today and that was that such unworthy developments in England should not become a pretext for anything less than the fullest possible co-operation in Ireland between Irish &mdash; and I emphasise Irish &mdash; security forces in all legitimate action against those who seek political change and who seek to obtain political change by deliberate killing.  We must always hold that in the forefront of our minds.</P>
    <P>We may be facing something like the Dreyfus situation.  We are quite entitled and justified to use that famous statement by Emile Zola in relation to that trial in which he turned to the French Government, as I am now turning to the English Government, to say &ldquo;j'accuse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the people of Britain must be made to realise what the feelings are in Ireland today about what has happened. At least one of those shot way back in 1982 was a young boy who had no association with any paramilitary organisation.  I do not know the details about the others.  How are his parents feeling today?  How does John Stalker feel today?  If an injustice has been done to anyone, one has only to read the story of what happened in the whole evolution to feel that probably a very profound injustice was done to John Stalker himself.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to read this short statement:</P>
    <P>In contrast to sincere attempts which have been made to create a political climate less conducive to violence the Stalkerisation of justice is an indictment of Mrs. Thatcher's Government. In a settled society failure to equate law and order with justice would be a source of dissension.  In a bitterly divided society such a failure would undermine the work of men and women of goodwill, further erode confidence in institutions and seriously affect the strenuous efforts which were <Col N="934" /> being made to advance the acceptability of the Royal Ulster Constabulary throughout the whole community in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courage, generosity and impartiality in allowing this very important debate which was moved by Senator Manning to go ahead. It is a pity that this debate is now taking place in the light of what has happened in regard to the appeal of the Birmingham Six, which has been referred to previously in this House and which has been the subject of many comments.  Many of us were worried, to say the least, about the outcome of that appeal but at all times we were hopeful that, having gone through the process that the British Government decided should take place, justice would be meted out to those unfortunate people.  However, that was not the case.  Now, as other speakers have said, the only recourse available to the Birmingham Six is to the political process or whatever intervention our Government can make through diplomatic channels, and other political channels, to ensure that a pardon is forthcoming from the British Government.  It is obvious that they have ruled out any court of appeal, an appeal to the House of Lords or any other process, and that leaves the unfortunate people convicted for this crime no process to which they can resort. I hope the Government will use every conceivable effort to ensure that political pressure is brought to bear on the British Government in the case of the Birmingham Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday last the leader of our party, Deputy Dick Spring, issued a statement in connection with the Stalker report.  Deputy Dick Spring, who played a major role in the last Government and was co-signatory of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, resorted to making a statement in which he said that the situation which was now developing in Anglo-Irish relations was, perhaps, the most serious since the early 1970s and that it was rapidly reaching a point where it transcended the ordinary Anglo-Irish process.  He said <Col N="935" /> the apparent willingness of the British Government to sanction the perversion of justice displayed an arrogance which was unworthy of any democratic State and which must raise concern in Britain itself as well as here.  It would unfortunately, be seen by many as a sign of the increasing authoritarianism of the British establishment.</P>
    <P>That was a very strong statement by a person who was involved in a process of dialogue with the British Government over a number of years culminating, after the Forum report, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  This House, and Members of it from all sides, and councils throughout the country of which many of us are members, have never been slow to condemn the Provisional IRA for indiscriminate acts which resulted in loss of life of people of another tradition in the North of Ireland.  On many occasions, like Enniskillen, where there was the loss of the lives of innocent bystanders we rightly condemned such acts.  Our Garda and Army have made every effort to bring the people responsible to justice. Quite often our efforts in this regard were subjected to snide remarks in the British media, and in some of the Northern Ireland media, and, indeed, from some Unionists in the North.  We were the subject of cheap jokes in connection with the efforts of our security forces but we are now dealing with a subject for which the British Government must stand accused in that they decided on Monday not to proceed to prosecute anybody following the Stalker-Sampson report or to publish its findings.</P>
    <P>The least we can hope for in this House, and that the Government should look for, is the privilege of having access to the full findings of the Stalker-Sampson report.  How can any sovereign government of an adjoining State with which we have continuous trade possibly justify a decision of their DPP in this regard?  We must take it that if evidence was available following that report that there was no shoot-to-kill policy then, as sure as night follows day, that headline <Col N="936" /> would be emblazoned across every British newspaper.  We can also assume that if the DPP found evidence that there was no need to prosecute anybody that would be publicised and the reasons given.  It is obvious to everybody, impartial or otherwise, in this House that there was something to hide, that the British Government were afraid of something.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to the political decision.  I have no doubt &mdash; I accept the point made by Senator Robb that this was a political decision by the British Government &mdash; that the North of Ireland authority had no influence over this and that the findings, if they were allowed to be published, would indict people in very high authority as the only people who could issue instructions on a shoot-to-kill policy.  We have to be extremely worried in this House, and in this country, about the developments that have taken place over this week with the Stalker-Sampson report, the judgment in the case of the Birmingham Six and the decisions of the nuclear industry in Britain, that they tend not to treat us with the respect that we deserve as a sovereign State.  The least we can expect from them is that there should be dialogue in those areas that concern us, particularly when the Government and the Opposition parties have adopted a common policy against the violence that has led to the loss of 2,500 lives in the North.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that there was something sinister behind the decision not to publish the report.  We can take it that if the report indicated that maverick members of the RUC decided that there should be a shoot-to-kill policy it would have been published because that would immediately take the political decision-makers off the hook.  I have no doubt in regard to the decisions or instructions which Mr. Stalker, and later Mr. Sampson, obviously solicited from their inquiry that it was in the interests of British politicians to have that information suppressed. Through this resolution from the House we must call on the Government in Britain to be forthcoming with us. After all, there is a binding agreement between the two sovereign States relating <Col N="937" /> to Anglo-Irish relations at all levels, including security.  If any security forces are guilty of any misdemeanour or any acts which are not in accordance with normal procedure within a security service of any country, then the Government responsible for that have a moral and a legally binding obligation to communicate those findings to the other party to that agreement.  I am not sure if the Anglo-Irish forum is the appropriate one to deal with this matter but it is a forum to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Once the Conference meeting takes place next week specifically to deal with this item the findings and the results of that meeting should be communicated widely.  The efforts of our Government in that regard should be emblazoned across the Irish media.  Otherwise, we will be giving succour to the Provisional IRA. Today is the day when they have benefited from this propaganda.  Today is the day that they make all of us reasonable people look silly because we are trying to have dialogue with a Government who are, obviously, on matters like this, to say the least, unfriendly to us.  I hope that an improvement takes place in this dialogue.  The last number of weeks and, indeed, months have led us to believe that there is a deterioration in this dialogue. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that Britain lives up to their side of the Agreement which we signed in good faith with them.</P>

      <P>This is the second time that we have had an opportunity today to discuss this kind of area and so I will address myself briefly to the specific instances under consideration.  I have no difficulty whatever in supporting the resolution. It is remarkable that in this sensitive area of policy there should be such a degree of unanimity throughout the House, among persons of all shades of opinion, politically speaking, and from all areas of the country.  It seems clear that the British Government are indicating that although there may be people guilty in this regard they shall not be prosecuted, that the report will be suppressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> There appears to be an obsessive, neurotic need for secrecy in the Thatcher Government and this is not the first instance of it.  We have had it repeatedly. We had it with regard to the memoirs of various officials of the Secret Services and we had it with regard to Mrs. Thatcher's own behaviour over the Malvinas conflict which was successfully suppressed despite the efforts of Mr. Tam Dalyell to uncover it.</P>
    <P>I believe this is extremely wrong, immoral and also unfair to those members of the security forces in the North of Ireland who may not have been implicated in this policy because they will now inevitably come under suspicion.  I wonder if Mrs. Thatcher has now taken to herself the right to grant pardons because this is coming perilously close to it.  It seems to me that this is a very dangerous delusion of power for her to engage in.  It appears at least as if some policy decision was taken to allow a shoot-to-kill policy. This is an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do because it implies that the legitimate authorities of the State are descending to the level of terrorism and that we, therefore, have what amounts to State terrorism.</P>
    <P>I believe it is for institutions like the Oireachtas to make clear our strong feelings on this issue.  It ill-behoves, I may say, any representatives of Sinn Féin, or the Provisional IRA, to attack this policy because it is the same kind of policy in which they are engaged.  We are the only people, the democratically elected representatives of a sovereign people, who have the moral authority and status to make this strong complaint which I am very glad the Government are making to the British Government.</P>
    <P>I regret that the British Government appear to be unconcerned at the fact that they are themselves undermining the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my strong support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement and my hope that despite this set-back it will continue to function.  I congratulate the Government on their tenacity in holding to such an agreement <Col N="939" /> in what must be very difficult diplomatic circumstances.  I also would have to say that I regret very much the marginalising of a very responsible police officer, Mr. Stalker.  It is remarkable that he should be marginalised by somebody of the character of Mr. Anderton, who appears to receive his orders directly from God, if one places much credence in radio interviews that he has given.  It is worrying that a responsible police officer should be marginalised and an irresponsible police officer consolidated in his irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>I feel that the principle underlying this must be addressed.  The British Government appear to place the interests of particular organs of State above the individual's right to justice.  This is highly dangerous.  It is also the principle that underlies the most regrettable decision in the case of the Birmingham Six.  Other Senators have indicated that there will be general dismay in this country at this decision.  I would like to echo this dismay as somebody who was brought up to believe in the concept of British justice, of fair play, and one of the cardinal principles of that is that you are entitled to something known as the benefit of the doubt.  On the technical evidence alone in this case there is clear room for doubt. It is obnoxious that the accused in this case should be required to demonstrate their innocence.  All that is necessary is to demonstrate doubt and that has effectively been done.</P>
    <P>I would like also to say that I was deeply shocked by the interventions of several of the judges, including one at least whom I regretted to note has a distinguished Irish name.  I found the interventions of various judges in this case to be deplorable, as recorded in the extensive coverage by <i>The Irish Times.</i>  It seems almost as if the British Government are now operating a system of guilt by attainder.  I would very much like to think that the British Government would regain their good sense and return once more to what used to be regarded as internationally current standards of <Col N="940" /> morality in judgment.  I very much hope that they will do so.</P>
    <P>I hope, despite what may appear to be provocation, that our own Army and police force will continue to maintain their high standards.  I congratulate them on the arms finds they have made over the past few days.  I am afraid it may be discouraging to our armed forces to realise that they are expected to co-operate with forces who do not have the standards which we would all feel entitled to expect from those who are, after all, our servants.  An army, whether it be the British Army, the Irish Army, the Israeli Army or any other army, are nothing other than the servants of the people.  It is extremely dangerous to allow any organ or arm of State to place itself above the law.  That way, in my opinion, lies disaster and that is what is wrong with the suppression of the Stalker-Sampson report.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all the Members of the House for their interest in this subject and to thank Senator Manning who tabled the motion.  I propose to read for the House the statement by the Taoiseach made just a short time ago:</P>
      <P>It would normally fall to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister and as Joint Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to make this statement to the House.  However, in his absence and in view of the importance and urgency of the matter and the serious concern of the Irish people, the Members of the Oireachtas and the Government about recent developments, I have thought it appropriate to make this statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, 25 January, the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the course of a statement in the House of Commons in relation to the Stalker-Sampson report, announced that the Director of Public <Col N="941" /> Prosecutions in Northern Ireland had concluded that the evidence did not warrant any further prosecutions in respect of shootings which occurred in Armagh on 11 November 1982 and 12 December 1982 and did not warrant any prosecutions in respect of either the fatal shooting of Michael Tighe or the wounding of Martin McCauley which occurred in Armagh on 24 November 1982.</P>
    <P>The British Attorney General also announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions had concluded that there was evidence of the commission of offences of perverting, or attempting or conspiring to pervert, the course of justice, or of obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty, and that this evidence was sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions were required in the public interest. The Attorney General stated that he had taken steps to acquaint himself with all relevant circumstances, including matters concerning the public interest and, in particular, considerations of national security which he felt might properly affect the decision or not to institute proceedings. He said that he had informed the director fully with regard to his consultations as to the public interest, and in the light of all the facts and information brought to his notice, the director had concluded, with the Attorney General's full agreement, that it would not be proper to initiate any criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The language used by the British Attorney General was of an elaborate and complex construction but in essence amounted to a blunt admission that while prosecutions were warranted they were not going to be taken for reasons of national security.  It was also stated that the report would not be published.</P>
    <P>My Government immediately indicated that they were deeply dismayed by the decision of the British authorities not to proceed with prosecutions in respect of those matters which were the subject of the inquiry <Col N="942" /> initiated by Mr. Stalker and completed by Mr. Sampson concerning allegations of a &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy by the security forces in Northern Ireland in 1982 and allegations of a subsequent perversion of the course of justice.  The Government further stated that they would be seeking urgent clarification of the announcement by the British Attorney General and of those other matters addressed by the inquiry &mdash; specifically, questions relating to the management and structure of the RUC, to Constable Robinson's statement on an incursion on the night of 12 December 1982 and to the question of the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be further aware that on Tuesday, 26 January the Government decided that, because of the serious implications of the British Attorney General's statement for public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and for cross-Border security co-operation, they would seek an immediate special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of clarifying the issues involved.  A meeting which had been arranged between officials and members of both the Garda and the RUC on policing matters was deferred in view of the call for a special meeting of the conference.  I can inform the House that the special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference sought under Article 3 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will take place in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Let me say immediately that the Government were neither consulted nor informed under the procedures of the Agreement, or in any other manner, about any aspect of the statement made by Sir Patrick Mayhew to the House of Commons on Monday.  It is a point to which I will return.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline for the Dáil the sequence of events and the principal happenings in this long-drawn out affair.</P>
    <P>Allegations of a deliberate shoot-to-kill policy on the part of the RUC first arose following the deaths of six <Col N="943" /> people in three separate incidents in County Armagh in the period November-December 1982.</P>
    <P>The three incidents concerned were as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  On 11 November, three men, Eugene Toman, Gervaise McKerr and Sean Burns, were shot dead by the RUC at a road block near Lurgan;</P>
    <P>(ii)  On 24 November, a 17 year old youth, Michael Tighe, was shot dead, and a companion, Martin McCauley, was injured, by the RUC in a hay shed near Lurgan; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  On 12 December, two men, Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll, were shot dead by the RUC on the outskirts of Armagh.</P>
    <P>The court trials which followed these incidents lent credence to allegations of a deliberate shoot-to-kill policy and a co-ordinated attempt by members of the RUC to cover this up:</P>
    <P>&mdash; During the trial of Constable John Robinson, charged with the murder of Seamus Grew, Constable Robinson stated that he and other members of the RUC had been involved in a &ldquo;cover up&rdquo; of the existence of a special anti-terrorist group in Northern Ireland and also of the fact that members of the RUC Special Branch had operated outside the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland. An incursion by the Northern Ireland security forces on 12 December 1982 was subsequently admitted by the British Government. It was shown, furthermore, in the trial, that several of the shots which had killed Seamus Grew had been fired from a distance of only 30-36 inches.  It was also shown that Constable Robinson had emptied his weapon, reloaded and continued to fire.</P>
    <P>&mdash; During the trial of Martin <Col N="944" /> McCauley (Michael Tighe's companion) who was charged with possession of arms in suspicious circumstances, it was revealed that RUC officers had lied in statements about the incident. The officers claimed that this had been on the orders of senior RUC officers who wanted to conceal the part played in the operation by the Special Branch and by an informer.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The conduct of two of the trials (the Robinson trial and the trial of three RUC officers charged with the murder of Eugene Toman), was itself a source of concern on a number of counts. Mr. Justice McDermott's decision to acquit Robinson was widely criticised, for example, on the grounds that Constable Robinson's decision to reload and continue to fire into the car at unarmed men did not appear to be consistent with the judgment of the Court that he was firing in self-defence.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Furthermore, Mr. Justice McDermott did not refer the evidence of a cover-up to the DPP. A number of Mr. Justice McDermott's comments, notably his praise of Constable Robinson's marksmanship, were also a cause of deep concern.  In the case arising from the murder of Eugene Toman, the late Lord Justice Gibson's acquittal of the three RUC defendants and his remarks on the occasion were also deeply disturbing.</P>
    <P>An investigation into the question of the appearance of a cover-up was instigated by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions.  The results of this investigation, however, did not satisfy the DPP who exercised his statutory power to require full information with regard to the circumstances in which false or misleading evidence was provided by the <Col N="945" /> RUC.  Consequently, on 24 May 1984, Deputy Chief Constable John Stalker of the Greater Manchester police was appointed by the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon, to the investigation.  Mr. Stalker's initial inquiry took 15 months and in September 1985 he submitted an interim report to the RUC Chief Constable. There have been persistent suggestions that this report was highly critical of the RUC and that it recommended the prosecution of a number of RUC officers.  It was submitted by the Chief Constable to the DPP in February 1986, and the DPP requested additional information before deciding whether or not to press charges.</P>
    <P>Mr. Stalker was continuing his work on the inquiry when, on 29 May 1986, he was suspended on leave pending the investigation of certain charges against him.  Following his suspension as Deputy Chief Constable, he was removed from the RUC inquiry and Mr. Colin Sampson, the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, who had been appointed to carry out the investigation into allegations of misconduct against Mr. Stalker, was asked by the Chief Constable of the RUC to take charge of the RUC investigation also. Mr. Stalker was cleared of all charges of misconduct and was reinstated as Deputy Chief Constable in August 1986.  He was not, however, returned to the RUC investigation.  On 19 December 1986, he announced his decision &mdash; for &ldquo;personal and family reasons&rdquo;&mdash; to take early retirement from the Manchester police force.  That is the background to this affair.</P>
    <P>There are four main elements which cause particular concern.  First, in the circumstances in which six people were killed and one injured in what have been called shoot-to-kill incidents in Armagh in 1982.  These incidents have been a cause of continuing deep anxiety to the Government, to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and to human rights organisations in these islands and elsewhere. Second, is the question of a covert <Col N="946" /> operation by the Northern Ireland security forces in this jurisdiction on 12 December 1982 which was revealed in court by Constable Robinson in 1984. Third, is the falsification of evidence, instructions to commit perjury and other actions designed to pervert the course of justice which were alleged against the RUC in the aftermath of the shoot-to-kill incidents and which the British Attorney General has now confirmed there is evidence to support. Fourth, is the question of the response of the British authorities to the many questions raised by this whole affair.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of the most serious and grave concern to the Government:</P>
    <P>&mdash; that it has taken over five years to decide on the question of further prosecutions;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that it has taken four years for the British authorities to reach a conclusion on the claims of perversion of the course of justice made by Constable Robinson under oath in 1984;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland failed to obtain the necessary co-operation from the RUC, and indeed was misled by the RUC, in regard to the shoot-to-kill incidents and the RUC investigation of them;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the subsequent formal police inquiry itself has taken almost four years, and is still not complete in that general recommendations of Mr. Sampson are being considered further by another senior police officer;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the original leader of the inquiry, Deputy Chief Constable Stalker, was removed from the inquiry in circumstances which caused widespread unease; that no action or statement of intention has yet been undertaken by the British Government in regard to the structures, organisation and management of the RUC arising from the Stalker-Sampson inquiry other than the decision to refer the recommendations <Col N="947" /> in the report to a senior police officer, for further consideration;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that no prosecution has been taken in regard to the killing of Michael Tighe and the injuring of Martin McCauley on 24 November 1982; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; that after five years of consideration by the prosecuting authorities, by the Northern Ireland courts and again by the prosecuting authorities, no member of the security forces appears to have been held to account for the alleged shoot-to-kill incidents or for the attempt to pervert the course of justice.</P>
    <P>This is a most extraordinary series of events which has done the gravest damage to confidence in the ability and intention of the authorities to uphold the rule of law and to administer justice fairly.</P>
    <P>In his statement in the House of Commons, the British Attorney General has indicated that it was, apparently, not in the public interest to prosecute for a perversion of the course of justice in the police investigation of the &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents.  The Government are not aware of the basis for this decision.  Let me say that I recognise that the security forces in Northern Ireland are required to operate in a turbulent situation but this can never remove their solemn obligation always to uphold the law.  In our view it is most clearly in the public interest and in the interest of our Government who commit so much of their resources to security in this island that there should be confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and that there should be good relations between the community and the security forces.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is essential that there should be such confidence if we are to make progress towards the achievement of peace in Northern Ireland. Public confidence in the administration <Col N="948" /> of justice is a matter which cannot be divorced from the public interest.  In the Government's view, it should be possible for the British Government to provide a great deal more information than has so far been provided, by way of publication of the Stalker-Sampson report or otherwise, in order to answer the widespread unease which this affair has caused.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Intergovernmental Conference shall consider security policy in Article 7, relations between the security forces and the community in Article 7, issues of concern to both countries relating to the enforcement of the criminal law and the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice, Article 8.  The Agreement also provides that with a view to enhancing cross-Border co-operation in security matters, the conference shall set in hand a programme of work to be undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief Constable of the RUC and, where appropriate, groups of officials. Although it is clear that under the Agreement the Conference has no operational responsibilities, it is also clear from the provisions and practices established under the Agreement that consultation and the provision of information are the very least that should be expected of both Governments under the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The British Attorney General has stated to the House of Commons that he has taken steps to acquaint himself with all relevant circumstances in the matter of the Stalker-Sampson report, including matters concerning the public interest and in particular considerations of national security which might have properly affected the decision whether or not to institute proceedings.  It will be part of the purpose of the Government at the forthcoming special Intergovernmental Conference to establish what was the basis of the Attorney General's consideration of the public interest.  At this point I can only say that at no stage did <Col N="949" /> the British Government seek the views of the Irish Government on any of the issues dealt with in the Agreement which it seems to us should have been taken into account in any consideration of the public interest.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that the Government have attached the greatest importance to the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and have kept constantly in touch with developments.  As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has told the House on three occasions, in his Estimates statement on 28 May, 1987, in response to a parliamentary question on 16 June, 1987 and in response to a further parliamentary question on 4 November 1987, the Government have been concerned about the whole range of issues surrounding the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and believed that it was essential from all points of view that the matter be cleared up and the necessary follow-up action taken, as quickly as possible.  The Tánaiste indicated to the Dáil that he has been using the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to convey his concerns on this matter to the British Government.  The British Government have been left in no doubt through repeated references and inquiries at the Conference, in the Secretariat and through other means, right up to the present, of the Government's great concern and interest and of our wish to be informed.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to any reasonable observer that the only persons likely to benefit from what has now happened are the paramilitaries.  I would have thought that a decision to prosecute would be in the best interests of the RUC and that they would have welcomed action by the British authorities to uphold the principle that in a democratic society the use of lethal force by the police must be the very last resort; that perjury, misleading statements to the authorities and other actions <Col N="950" /> designed to pervert the course of justice should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I believe it is clear also that the British Attorney General's statement and any other decisions which may be taken on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report have serious implications for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and the relations between the security forces and the community.  A further improvement in those relations which might have been hoped for will be seriously affected by these recent events.  We have also indicated in our public statement our concern that it may have serious implications for cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>Co-operation and cross-Border security had been steadily developed in the face of the continued campaign of violence and attempts to import large quantities of arms for subversive use.  But such security co-operation can only be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust between the two police forces on the basis that the two Governments are firmly committed to political progress by peaceful constitutional means.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference exists as a forum in which Northern Ireland issues of mutual concern to the two Governments can be dealt with.  The Government will at the forthcoming special meeting of the Conference put forward their views on the serious crux which has arisen.  They will emphasise the importance of confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and will seek an appropriate course of action and a process by means of which the deep and widespread doubts and anxieties which have been aroused by the British Attorney General's statement can be removed.  Matters cannot be left as they are.</P>
    <P>That is the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 February 1988.</P>
