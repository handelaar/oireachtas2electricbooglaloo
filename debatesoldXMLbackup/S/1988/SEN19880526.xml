      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 1 until 12.30 p.m. and to adjourn until 1.30 p.m. At 1.30 p.m. we will take Item No. 2.  Last week it was agreed that, in conjunction with Item No. 2 we would take Items Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  On Wednesday of next week we will take the Companies (No. 2) Bill and we also hope to take the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill. <Col N="1536" /> We may sit longer hours next week in order to get as much business as possible done.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains provisions to counter drink abuse, especially under-age drinking while, at the same time, providing for some extension in the permitted hours and enabling restaurants of an acceptable standard to serve a full range of drinks with substantial meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interests of the licensed trade are represented by a number of organisations catering for various aspects of the trade, including licensed vintners, hoteliers and restaurant owners.  In framing this legislation, I have endeavoured to take into account the legitimate interests of each of these groups, but I need hardly say that <Col N="1537" /> the general public interest must always be paramount.  This demands that the licensing laws should not be unduly restrictive so that they do not inhibit the reasonable requirements of the public while, at the same time, being such as to curb actual or potential abuses where these are identified.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in considering new legislation in this field perhaps the most important principle to bear in mind is the necessity for striking the right balance between provisions that are too restrictive and those that are so liberal as to leave scope for abuse.  I should also mention that the licensing laws have a very complex statutory background stretching back to 1833 which adds to the difficulty of drafting new legislation.</P>
    <P>In my view there is a clear need for the rationalisation and consolidation of the existing legislation but I should emphasise that this will be a major task which the present Bill does not seek to accomplish.  I want to make it clear that the present Bill seeks to amend the licensing law in certain aspects only.  There are other aspects where, on examination, it may be found that change is desirable but where the necessary examination, consultation and drafting would take so much time that they cannot be accommodated in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill makes provision for a new type of special liquor licence &mdash; the Special Restaurant Licence.  The object of this Part is to enable restaurants of good standard to obtain licences which will enable them to supply a full range of drink with substantial meals, without having to extinguish an existing liquor licence.  Under the existing law regarding the acquisition of new licences, based largely on the Licensing Act, 1902, the position generally is that it is not possible to get a new licence to sell a full range of drink without extinguishing at least one existing such licence.  There are also requirements as to the location of the licence to be extinguished and as to increases in population in the locality that can make it impossible to obtain new full licences in some areas.  At the same time, <Col N="1538" /> there is clearly a demand, especially among tourists, that a full range of drinks should be available with meals in restaurants of good standard.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is clearly necessary to make special provision so that restaurants of the kind in question can get full licences without having to extinguish an existing licence.  Part II of the Bill makes provision accordingly. Section 12 will enable the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations prescribing standards which must be met in restaurants qualifying for the new licences.  It is intended that these regulations will be made before Part II is brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Where it is desired to obtain one of the new licences, application is first made to Bord Fáilte for a certificate, as defined in section 6, certifying that the restaurant concerned meets with the prescribed standards.  When a Bord Fáilte certificate has been obtained, application must next be made, in accordance with section 8, to the Circuit Court for its certificate. This will be issued unless the court prohibits the issue of the licence in consequence of an objection made to it at that stage.  When the Circuit Court certificate has been obtained, the special restaurant licence can then be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners, in accordance with section 9, on payment to the commissioners of a fee of £3,000 as specified in that section.  It is reasonable that this fee should be a substantial one in view of the considerable commercial value attaching to a full drinks licence and bearing in mind that the amount of the fee will be quite small in relation to the cost of establishing and running a restaurant of the kind which will qualify for the necessary Bord Fáilte certificate.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that this will be a once-off initial fee.  The only fee on annual renewal of the special licence thereafter will be the ordinary excise duty payable for liquor licences generally, which is £50 at present.  Since it may be necessary in due course to vary the amount of the initial fee, section 9 provides that this may be done by regulations made by the Minister for Justice.  Under <Col N="1539" /> section 24 a draft of any such regulations, and of regulations under section 12 prescribing standards for the restaurants concerned, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and such regulations will not come into effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>I should refer at this point to section 3 of the Bill the effect of which is that it will be construed together with existing Licensing Acts, and also to subsection (2) of section (7), by virtue of which a special restaurant licence will be deemed to be a retailer's on-licence.  One effect of these provisions is that all the normal procedural and enforcement provisions of the Acts will apply in relation to special restaurant licences.  This will mean that the special restaurant licence will be renewable annually and that any member of the public can object in the District Court to the renewal of a special restaurant licence, as in relation to any other liquor licence.  An additional ground of objection to renewal is given by section 10, that is, an objection on the grounds that the premises had not been bona fide and solely used as a restaurant.</P>
    <P>As to the particular attributes of a special restaurant licence, I should make it clear that it is a restricted licence which will not allow drink to be sold in the same way as in a public house.  Section 7 provides that drink may be sold on foot of a special restaurant licence only in connection with the ordering and consumption of a substantial meal, either in the waiting area of the restaurant before the meal, or in the dining area during the meal and up to 30 minutes after the meal has ended.  Furthermore, section 14, as amended in Dáil Éireann, will allow drink to be supplied on foot of a special restaurant licence on weekdays between 12.30 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. and on Sundays and on Christmas Day during the restricted hours set out in the section. The premises concerned will be able to stay open at any other time for normal restaurant business but the sale or consumption of alcohol will not be allowed during such other times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I have mentioned that a public house trade will not be permitted in the restaurants concerned.  In this connection it will be noted that section 16 provides that premises of this kind may not contain a bar.  Special restaurant licences will not enable the sale of alcohol for consumption off the premises and section 22 provides that they may not be used as a basis for obtaining occasional licences or special exemption orders.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, special licence restaurants will be subject to the ordinary enforcement provisions of the licensing laws.  In addition, they will be subject to the provisions of section 15 of the Bill, which provides a maximum fine of £500 for contravention of the terms of the licence, with mandatory endorsement of the licence itself.</P>
    <P>If I could sum up the provisions relating to special restaurant licences, they are intended to facilitate good quality restaurants in obtaining licences to serve a full range of drinks.  They will, therefore, help to meet the clearly established demand for such a facility as well as being an important aid to the tourist industry. They are, however, restricted licences and it is not intended that they should unfairly affect the legitimate commercial interests of the existing licensed trade.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with permitted hours in licensed premises.  This is a very important aspect of the licensing laws, an aspect in which the general public shows a particular interest and one, indeed, which is frequently the subject of controversy. On this aspect, as in the case of other aspects of the licensing laws, there is no ideal solution which can be established for once and for all.  The correct approach, in my view, is to make a periodic survey of the existing permitted hours so that they may be adjusted to meet public demand and also to help correct any abuses which may have emerged.</P>
    <P>The closing hours adopted in 1960 and 1962 have stood the test of time remarkably well and, I think, require comparatively little adjustment to meet the requirements of the present day.  The principle of uniformity in permitted hours <Col N="1541" /> established in 1960 is still a valid one and should continue to be reflected in the new legislation.  This establishes the principle that the opening hours for all categories of licensed premises, and for registered clubs, should be the same that there should be no variation from one locality to another throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The main provisions regarding prohibited hours in licensed premises are contained in section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927.  To help in getting a general picture of these prohibited hours, section 2 of the 1927 Act is now reproduced in full in section 25 of the Bill.  It is under that section that the aspects on which changes are now proposed are dealt with.  Likewise section 56 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, contains the main provisions regarding permitted hours in registered clubs and that section is now reproduced in full in section 26 of the Bill.  That section, as amended, continues the principle of basic conformity with the permitted hours in licensed premises.  Section 28 of the Bill continues the provision in the existing law whereby in licensed hotels and licensed restaurants drink can be supplied with substantial meals up to 12.30 a.m.  The existing exemptions in respect of Sunday and Christmas Day are also continued.</P>
    <P>So far as evening closing time are concerned &mdash; that is to say 11 p.m. in winter time and 11.30 p.m. in summer time &mdash; I think these times are still appropriate and I am not aware of any general demand for a change in these hours.  Indeed, it is only in relation to Sunday evening that any change is required.  I have received a large volume of representations for some extension to the present 10 o'clock Sunday closing time.  I have come to the conclusion that such an extension is justified and the Bill accordingly provides that general Sunday closing in licensed premises and clubs should be at 11 p.m. The reaction that I have received to the proposal indicates that it will be generally acceptable.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects of the general permitted hours in relation to which some change is required.  The first of <Col N="1542" /> these is drinking-up time.  This was established in 1962 as a period of ten minutes after the time for the supply of last drinks. During this ten minutes drink may not be supplied, but it is not an offence to remain on the premises to consume drink already supplied.  Having considered the views of all the interested parties I have come to the conclusion that the present ten minutes drinking up time is not sufficient to allow last drinks to be consumed in an unhurried atmosphere.  Accordingly, I am proposing that it should be extended from ten minutes to 30 minutes.  This will allow last drinks to be consumed in a leisurely manner without all the hustle and bustle at present experienced.  It will give bar staff an opportunity to begin tidying up before the premises are cleared and will, I hope, help to bring a calmer and more relaxed atmosphere to closing time generally.</P>
    <P>The other aspect on which I would like to say a few words is the question of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  This is the mandatory closing of licensed premises and clubs in Dublin and Cork between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on weekdays.  This was adopted to help prevent continuous drinking throughout the day and was originally applied in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. In 1962 the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; was abolished in Waterford and Limerick, leaving Dublin and Cork as the only areas where it remained.  I now propose to abolish it in these remaining areas in pursuance of the policy of establishing uniformity in the permitted hours throughout the country.  In any case, I believe the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; has outlived its usefulness and is no longer desirable, especially in view of the increasing tendency to take midday meals on licensed premises.  I have received representations to the effect that it has an adverse effect on tourism and on business generally in Dublin and Cork.  Senators may note that there is no specific reference to the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in the Bill.  Its abolition is effected by omitting reference to it in the new provisions inserted by sections 25 and 26. Under section 25, the fine for prohibited hours offences by licensees is increased to a maximum of £400 for a <Col N="1543" /> first offence and £800 for a second or subsequent offence.  The present maximum fines of £20 and £40 were fixed in 1927 and are clearly too low now in view of the fall in money values.  Conviction of a prohibited hours offence is endorsed on the licence, the licence being forfeited where there are three endorsements. Up to 1986 such endorsement was mandatory for prohibited hours offences but since 1986 endorsement in such cases is at the discretion of the court.  Endorsement of the licence is regarded as a more severe penalty than a monetary fine.  The fact that endorsement for prohibited hours offences is now at the discretion of the court must be taken into account in fixing the maximum amount of the monetary penalty.  I am satisfied that a substantial increase in the fines for prohibited hours offences, as now proposed in the Bill, is fully justified and I am determined that these prohibited hours provisions will be strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>The question of special exemption orders arises in relation to Part III of the Bill.  The District Court is enabled to grant these exemptions in respect of special occasions in licensed hotels and licensed restaurants.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of special exemptions in recent years and there have been complaints that they are now a source of abuse.  I have received representations, however, particularly from licensed hotels, that the late-evening drinking allowed under special exemptions meets an established demand, especially in rural areas, and that many hotels have come to rely on the income from these occasions for their economic survival and the continued employment of staff.  I have, nevertheless, decided that some restrictions are warranted.  Most special exemptions are granted in respect of dances at which substantial meals are required to be served.  Such &ldquo;substantial meals&rdquo; must be of a kind for which it would be reasonable to charge a sum whose amount may be prescribed by the Minister for Justice. This minimum figure was last prescribed in 1979, when it was put at £2.  I am satisfied that an increase in this amount <Col N="1544" /> is now justified, but this increase can be effected by ministerial order and accordingly requires no provision in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about special exemptions for Monday mornings since for most people Monday is the first working day of the week.  Under the present legislation it is a matter for the District Court to decide the time in respect of which any special exemption will be granted.  I am satisfied that some restriction on special exemptions for Monday mornings is justified and section 29 of the Bill accordingly provides that they may not be granted for any time after 1 a.m. on Monday.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to special exemptions, I am proposing that persons under 18 will not be allowed to be present while they are in operation and section 35 of the Bill contains a provision to that effect.</P>
    <P>I next come to the question of under-age drinking.  Provisions to combat this are contained in Part IV of the Bill. Before outlining these provisions I think it is necessary to say that, while legislation has a useful role to play in this area, its impact must always be limited. Other factors, such as parental control and example, the general social climate and factors such as the purchasing capacity of young people and the power of advertising, are at least equally important. That being said, however, the fact remains that legislation does have a significant role to play and my object in Part IV of the Bill is to ensure that legislation is framed which, if fully enforced, will have the maximum impact on this social evil.</P>
    <P>So far as under-age persons are concerned, legislative provisions have two aspects.  First, they place controls on the presence of young persons in licensed premises and registered clubs.  Secondly, the legislation contains provisions relating to the supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons and the consumption of drink by them.</P>
    <P>Provisions prohibiting the supply of drink to persons aged under 18 are contained in sections 31 and 32 of the Bill. Section 31 prohibits licence holders from <Col N="1545" /> supplying intoxicating liquor to persons aged under 18 and requires that licensees shall not permit under-age drinking on their premises.  This section replaces provisions in an Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1924 which are repealed by section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of section 31 which I should mention in particular. First, under the existing legislation it is an offence for a licensee to &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; supply drink to an under-aged person. Section 31 removes this word from the legislation, so that the licensee can be prosecuted on the basis that he has in fact supplied drink to an under-aged person. Up to the present it has not been possible to bring a charge unless the prosecution could prove that the licensee &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; supplied drink.  Subsection (4) of section 31 will give the licensee a defence that he had &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; for believing that the person concerned was over the age of 18 years.  Secondly, subsection (3) of section 31 provides substantial increases in the maximum fines that may be imposed on licensees. Section 32 will make it an offence for any person, whether a licensee or not, to make intoxicating liquor available to a person aged under 18.  I should mention that section 4 of the Bill, in repealing section 12 of the 1924 Act concerned, will remove the anomaly under the present law whereby drink can be sold in sealed containers of not less than one pint to anyone aged over 15.</P>
    <P>Under section 33 it is made an offence for the first time for a person under 18 to purchase alcohol or to consume it in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    <P>I next come to the question of the presence of under-aged persons in licensed premises.  Subject to certain exceptions, it is an offence for a licence-holder to allow anyone under the age of 15 years to be in his bar.  I am satisfied that this provision should be relaxed, because there will be circumstances where it is convenient or even necessary, especially in the country, for a parent with young children to remain for some time in a licensed premises.  This could happen, for example, when the person concerned was <Col N="1546" /> waiting to catch a bus or to keep an appointment with a doctor or dentist. Section 34 of the Bill accordingly proposes that children should be allowed in bars at any time during permitted hours if they are accompanied by their parents or guardian.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made about drinking by under-aged persons at late night functions.  Section 35 of the Bill makes it an offence, both for the licence holder and the under-aged person concerned, where anyone under the age of 18 is on the part of a licensed premises to which an exemption order applies.</P>
    <P>Section 36 restricts the presence of under-aged persons in off-licenses.  Under this section, persons under 18 will be allowed on such premises only if accompanied by a parent or guardian, or where their employment in the premises is not prohibited.  Penalties are provided for contraventions of section 36 by the licence-holder and the under aged persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is an important new provision giving the Garda power to seize containers of alcohol which are in the possession of under-aged persons in any place other than an occupied private residence, where the Garda suspects that an under-age drinking offence had been committed.  The Garda are given a power of arrest in such cases where the young person concerned refuses to supply his correct name, address and age.  This will give the Garda powers to deal with the so-called &ldquo;drinks parties&rdquo; about which many complaints have been received.</P>
    <P>Section 38 deals with the employment of under-aged persons in licensed premises. Under a 1924 provision, now being repealed, no female under 18 and no male under 16, with certain exceptions, can be employed to sell drink in a licensed premises.  Section 38 now gives a common minimum age limit of 18 for males and females, with a minimum age of 16 for apprentices and specified relatives.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal next with an aspect which has given rise to a good deal of discussion.  This is the provision for the introduction of a system of age cards, contained in section 40 of the Bill.  What <Col N="1547" /> is contemplated is that the Minister for Justice will be empowered to introduce by regulations a system for the issue of these cards to persons requesting them, showing that the person concerned is aged over 18 years.  Under section 40, these regulations can prescribe such matters as the person or authority by whom such cards will be issued, the format of the cards and the fee, if any, to be charged for the issue of the cards.  Section 41 provides a penalty for the forging or wrongful use of such cards.  Subsection (4) of section 31 provides that, where a document which appears to be an age card is produced to a licence-holder, this will constitute reasonable grounds for believing the person concerned was aged over 18 years and accordingly will be a defence to a charge against the licence-holder under section 31 of the Bill.  It will also be a defence to a charge under section 35 or section 36 that the licence-holder allowed a person under 18 years to be on his premises in contravention of those sections.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few general points about the proposed system of age cards.  The provision is being introduced in response to a widespread demand from public representatives and from the licensees themselves as an aid in combatting under-age drinking.  The system envisaged will be completely voluntary, in the sense that there will be no compulsion on any person to obtain such a card and licence-holders will not be compelled to demand the production of them. Such a system would undoubtedly facilitate young persons aged just over 18 years who wish to obtain a drink in a licensed premises and, conversely, it will help to dissuade persons aged under 18 who might wish to purchase or consume drink in licensed premises, since they will know that without possession of such card they are likely to be refused drink.  The system should also be of considerable help to licensees who are often in genuine doubt as to whether a particular person is aged over 18.  The provision as to age cards in section 40 will, of course, come into <Col N="1548" /> operation only when the necessary regulations have been made by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn next to Part V of the Bill, which contains a number of provisions relating to the supply of intoxicating liquor in registered clubs.  In accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, intoxicating liquor may be supplied in such clubs only to the members themselves and their guests.  Many complaints have been made that this provision is not being observed and that in many such clubs drink is being supplied to the public, especially at late-night extensions, contrary to the intentions of the Act.  Part VI contains provisions to help remedy these abuses.</P>
    <P>Section 42 will make it clear that the club rules must forbid the supply of drink to persons aged under 18.  At present an order from an inspector is required before a club can be inspected by the Garda Síochána.  Section 43 will remove this requirement and allow clubs to be inspected by the Garda on the same basis as licensed premises.  Section 44 will allow objection to be made to renewal of club certificates by persons living outside the parish where the club premises is situated and will bring clubs into line with licensed premises generally so far as objection to certificates is concerned.  There have been many complaints that some clubs are openly flouting the law by advertising drinking facilities, such as late-night extensions, to the public at large.</P>
    <P>Section 45 seeks to remedy this situation by making it an offence to advertise functions in registered clubs, save by means of a notice within the club or by circular issued to the club members.  The prohibition will not apply to the advertising of any sport or physical recreation in the club which takes place within the ordinary permitted hours for the supply of drink.  Section 46 will make it a ground of objection to the issue of new certificates of registration of clubs if they have less than 150 members.  Section 46, with the Schedule to the Bill, will provide increased penalties for a range of offences in relation to registered clubs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> Finally, Part VII of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  The first of these, in section 47, is a provision to ensure that intoxicating liquor may be sold in mixed premises such as supermarkets only from a separate drinks counter and that it may not be sold by self-service.  This provision is included in response to widespread demand for the placing of some curbs on the sales of drink from supermarket-type premises, where at present intoxicating liquor can be sold by self-service with the same freedom as ordinary commodities such as soap flakes and breakfast cereals.  It has been strongly represented that this is a source of widespread abuse, both from impulse buying by adults and as a source of supply for under-aged persons.  So that premises affected may have time to adjust their sales arrangements, it is provided that section 47 will not come into operation until the Minister for Justice so appoints by order.</P>
    <P>Section 49 makes a minor adjustment in the time for the sale of intoxicating liquor at licensed greyhound racetracks. Section 50, with the Schedule to the Bill, increases the penalties for a number of offences under the Licensing Acts and the Registration of Clubs Act, where the level of fines at present fixed has fallen out of line with current monetary values. Many of these fines have been on the Statute Book since the last century and the substantial increases now proposed are justified on that ground alone.</P>
    <P>Column 2 of the Schedule gives a general indication of the offence in respect of which the penalty is being increased. One such penalty which I should like to mention in particular is that provided in section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, for the offence of being &ldquo;found on&rdquo;.  It is proposed that the present minimum penalty in this instance should be increased from £1 to £25 and that the maximum should be increased from £5 to £50.  This will give an incentive to customers to leave licensed premises when licensees are clearing their premises at closing time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say again that <Col N="1550" /> this is not intended to be a comprehensive Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  There are a number of matters, including, for example, the general question of late-night drinking provisions, which would need to be throughly examined and dealt with in a subsequent Bill.  There are many such matters which cannot be dealt with in the timescale available for this Bill, but it would be my intention to bring forward a second Bill to deal with matters which are not covered by this Bill but which require detailed study and to deal also with any provision of the present Bill which may need to be remedied in the light of experience of its working. However, I consider it is important to proceed now as expeditiously as possible with the matters covered by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome the Minister to the House.  The legislation he is bringing in today has found and will find fairly general acceptance and welcome from all groups in both Houses and throughout the country generally.</P>
      <P>The first thing to be said about any licensing legislation is that it must, by its very nature, seek to get the proper balance between the various interests and the various needs.  In this case the balance being sought is between the rights of people to drink socially, freely and in enjoyable circumstances and, at the same time, the counter-need to protect vulnerable people, especially young people, against excess or exploitation of alcohol. The other balance being sought in this Bill is between the rights of publicans and the rights of restaurateurs, which has been a continuing area of conflict, uncertainty and perhaps even sharp practice over the past number of years.  The uncertainty which existed has, in many cases, meant that the existing law has been brought into disrepute because it simply has not been enforced.  Probably there was not much point in enforcing it. Nonetheless, the clarification of that is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large the Minister has succeeded in getting the balance right.  This <Col N="1551" /> is a Bill which has been significantly improved in its passage through the Dáil. I welcome the fact that the Minister took on board a number of amendments from different parties in the Dáil.  These amendments have meant a better Bill. We will be making a small number of proposals on Committee Stage in this House which we hope will further improve the quality and effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In many ways we would all like to have a situation where restrictions on hours of opening were not at all necessary.  In many other countries the opening hours of licensed premises are dictated solely by the demand.  Public houses open when there is a demand for the sale of drink and they close when there is no demand. That is not the case in this country.  Many publicans feel an obligation to open at hours when they must be losing money, when there is no particular demand.  This is very true especially in country areas where pubs feel obliged to stay open, perhaps for fear of losing some small amount of foothold in the market, when they would be better off being closed.</P>
    <P>The idea of no restrictions on opening hours has many very attractive possibilities. It would mean that pubs would not be obliged to stay open when there is no demand.  It would mean that pubs could open early where there is a demand, that they could close early where there is no demand, or that they could open late where the demand was for late drinking.  It would mean we would not have to rush from public houses in the evening.  There is no doubt whatsoever that, no matter how strictly the gardaí seek to enforce the laws against drinking and driving, the fact that the public houses all close within ten, 15 or 20 minutes of each other, especially at weekends, is an important contributor to road traffic accidents and to death on our roads.  If we had staggered closing times &mdash; it is probably an unfortunate adjective to use &mdash; and if the hours of closing could be varied, this problem might not be so great and might allow the gardaí more scope to enforce this law more rigorously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> I am sure the Minister is very well aware of the experiment which was carried out and which has now led to the change in licensing laws in parts of Scotland and in Edinburgh in particular.  Variance in the licensing laws and optionality appear to have worked in Scotland, with its particular tradition of very heavy drinking and moving from a situation which was unduly restrictive before this change came about.  We saw in Edinburgh a massive change in the whole culture and the whole attitude towards drinking.  It appears to have worked reasonably well.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to have been any great abuse of the new opportunities. Many people regard the change as being quite civilised and quite practicable.  I am sure the Minister and his Department have studied the situation in Edinburgh and I would be interested to hear his comments.  However, I think it is somewhat Utopian to hope for a change like that.  I am fairly certain that we have not reached the level of maturity in this country where we are ready for such an experiment.  We are certainly not ready for the introduction of widespread changes such as have taken place there.</P>
    <P>However, I hope that at some stage some future Minister for Justice will be able to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas and say that we have matured in such a way as a society that we do not need these Victorian regulations or this hang over from Victorian days to control the way in which people are allowed to drink.  As a Senator said, it probably will be a long day but it would be very desirable if we reached that stage where there was less rather than more law needed.</P>
    <P>If I may digress slightly but within the limits of the debate, the Minister has had a very soft run on this legislation compared with some of his predecessors who attempted to bring about major changes in the licensing laws.  We have come a very long way and the present debate has seen the various interest groups involved make their case in an ordered way.  One of the characteristics which struck me, and I am sure many other Members of both Houses who have <Col N="1553" /> spoken with the different interests, is the general acceptance that no group were going to get their way, that each side had their own case.  After the initial but strong demand was made, there was a general acceptance that the other groups also had a point of view and that any law would have to take into account first of all the general interest and that there would have to be a great deal of compromise between the various groups.</P>
    <P>That has been reflected in the Bill.  I regret that in the previous Oireachtas the work of the Committee on Legislation, which had taken upon itself the task of examining the licensing laws and which was providing a forum for the various groups to make their points, was not completed and that the Oireachtas rather than the Government did not have an important initiating role in legislation.</P>
    <P>When I say that the Minister may reflect on the fact that he has got off very lightly compared with some of his predecessors I will just come to one or two instances of that.  The first major attempt, as the Minister said, to redraft the licensing laws after independence came in the mid-twenties when the then Minister for Home Affairs, Kevin O'Higgins, found that the licensing laws were in a mess.  There were far too many public houses.  They were generally badly run. They were dirty.  Drunkeness was a major national problem.  The licensing hours were not in any way enforced and the giving out of licences was not in any serious way restricted.</P>
    <P>He tried to bring in draconian changes in the licensing laws but like my hope that someday we will not need laws, the country at that time certainly was not ready.  The first thing his Government tried to do was to bring in not the holy hour but to have public houses closed all afternoon.  The reason given at the time was that this would help to get the civil servants back to work.  Civil servants now have their lunch at their desks, a glass of Coca Cola and a sandwich, so that would not arise.  There was a revolt over the closing of public houses for the entire afternoon.  Fianna Fáil had not yet <Col N="1554" /> entered the Dáil so the revolt was confined to his backbenchers.</P>
    <P>The end result was that the intention to close the public houses for the entire afternoon forced the Government into a great compromise.  That great compromise was the holy hour.  In one sense it is sad today to see the end of another great Irish compromise, the holy hour, which was the result of a successful backbencher revolt against the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>A second revolt from that period arose when the Minister tried to bring about widespread changes which would revolutionise the entire licensing laws.  The vintners opposed this very, very strongly. The effect of the vintners' revolt was to be the catalyst which got a new political party off the ground.  That political party was the National League led by Captain Willie Redmond drawn from Parnellites, Redmondites, ex-service men and from the licensed trade who saw this as the vehicle through which they could impose their views on the Government.</P>
    <P>This new party set out &mdash; I am not inventing the phrase &mdash; to break the civil war mould of Irish politics.  They appealed to both Mr. de Valera and to Mr. Cosgrave to retire from Irish politics and to leave the field to those who would represent the new Ireland and the new thinking and those who were not encumbered by any old prejudices.  They did very well in the early stages.  The National League won eight seats in the election of June 1927.  The future had arrived as far as they were concerned.  They immediatley tried to form a minority Government. Mr. de Valera was being somewhat mischievous &mdash; he supported them.  The vote ended in a tie helped by the absence of Alderman Jinx and so the Government survived.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards Mr. Cosgrave called a sudden general election and the National League were reduced to one seat.  Alderman Jinx lost his seat in Sligo but a horse was named after him which subsequently won the Derby, so he at least attained some sort of fame.  The mould was not broken on that occasion and I do not believe it will be broken on <Col N="1555" /> this occasion either.  However, all of this is slightly by the way.  I will finish by telling the Minister the type of Opposition which his predecessor faced in those days.  I am quoting from a very good book written by an American political scientist who came to Ireland in 1933, Warner Moss.  It is called <i>Political Parties in the Irish Free State</i>.  It states:</P>
    <P>In Dublin virtually all the licensed traders organised to oppose the Government candidates if the Bill was not modified.  The spirited Cork publicans organised a fighting fund and directed their secretary to write threatening letters to all members of the: Dáil.  The Waterford Vintners' Association accused the Government of treating them like Mexicans and threatened to join with Labour, the National League and the Farmers.  One realistic member said the difficulty with the new legislation was that it gave power to the new District Justices who were appointed by the Government and who could not be influenced like the old Justices of the Peace.</P>
    <P>So it went on right throughout the country.  In every county the Minister of the day had to face the vintners organised and thundering to make sure that the changes did not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a fair share of flak myself over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but you have not been accused of behaving like a Mexican.  I would like to deal with some of the main features of the Bill as outlined by the Minister.  The special restaurant licences are very welcome and they will certainly remove much of the confusion and much of the breaking of the law, not in a very serious way, as it is at present. We have seen over the past number of years a huge growth in the number of restaurants, not alone in number but in quality, inventiveness and the variety of food on offer.  If we compare the situation in the restaurant business as it is now with the way it was 20 years ago, it has been <Col N="1556" /> one of the big revolutions in Irish social and economic life.  The number of young people who are getting into the restaurant business, who are being trained abroad and in this country and who are also playing a very big part in making Irish produce attractive and using it in inventive new ways is very significant indeed. Anything which can help the Irish restaurant industry deserves our full support. That industry has made a very good point in highlighting the ludicrous situation that the only drinks which could not legally be served in their premises were Irish drinks.  The removal of that anomoly and restriction is welcome.</P>
      <P>By the same token, the increase in the number of pubs serving food over the past number of years has also been very welcome.  There is no doubt that right throughout the country as people are taking shorter lunch breaks, as fewer people go home for their midday meal, the pubs are providing a very useful service. They generally serve good food.  It is inexpensive.  It is fast and very little alcoholic drink is being consumed at lunchtime.  Ballygowan, Tipperary or the new County Meath mineral water or soft drinks are being consumed with this food. Every effort should be made to ensure that no restrictions are put on publicans in providing food and that they are playing on the same level playing pitch as the restaurants.  Subject to restrictions of hygiene, fire and so forth, they should be given every encouragement to develop along these lines.  This is very important, from a health point of view.  The more people are encouraged to eat and drink together, the less is the likelihood of people becoming drunk.  One of the great problems with drink in the past was that people would start drinking on an empty stomach.  There was no food available. Even a few sandwiches would make all the difference.  Anything which does that is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the granting of licences and the standards has been very extensively debated in the Dáil.  I found myself very much taken by the point of view put across by Deputy Patrick Cooney in the Dáil on the question of there being no <Col N="1557" /> appeal from Bord Fáilte, a very reputable organisation.  The provisions in this Bill go a very long way to ensure that reasons must be given and that there will be a very high degree of openness as far as the decisions about the granting of licences are concerned.  Nevertheless, I and other Members have some sort of a niggling reservation about not having some final court of appeal.  Clearly, nobody wants to have the courts cluttered up by disappointed restaurateurs or would-be restaurateurs who have refused to get a licence.  I am not sure the court is the right vehicle for this.</P>
    <P>There could be reasons of vindictivness, or the officers in charge might have some sort of commercial interest.  It is unlikely, but these things can happen. Between now and Committee Stage in this House I would like to see if it is possible to put down an amendment which would allow for some sort of inexpensive, straightforward appeal mechanism for those who feel they have been hard done by.  It may not be possible to draft an amendment which meets that need but it is my intention to have a go at that and to talk to the Minister about it.</P>
    <P>Another point which was mentioned by Deputy Cooney in the Dáil which deserves some attention also is the possibility &mdash; I know this was discussed extensively and the Minister has changed the Bill to a certain extent of anterooms to a restaurant in effect becoming a public house, or a restaurant which is not doing a great business which provides some sort of token food but having a large anteroom there which would, in effect, serve as a public house and thus establishing a public house on the cheap and against the spirit of this law.  I know the Minister has gone a substantial part of the way in trying to meet this possibility but I am worried about the level of enforcement. I hope if there is any evidence of this happening or any indication that restaurateurs are tempted to try to develop their restaurant into effectively what is a pub, there will be very clear monitoring of this in the early stages and if restaurateurs are seen to behave in this way <Col N="1558" /> examples, as far as possible, will be made of the first ones to breach these regulations. Many publicans suspected that this was behind much of the agitation by restaurateurs.  If this is seen to be the case, the entire spirit of this legislation will be defeated and the good faith of those who asked for the changes will be brought into question.  The Minister took on board a number of recommendations in the Lower House, I wonder if it is strong enough.  I will be coming back to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of the prohibited hours, this section is welcome.  In spite of what I said earlier about the absence of hours, I believe the Minister has got it right.  I believe the old licensing hours worked and they have stood the test of time.  If we are to have uniform hours the present hours have just about got it right. I do not think there is any demand for a change.  The Sunday change is also the right one.</P>
    <P>On the question of the drinking up time there was a need for a change here.  I have my doubts about the half hour because, even under the present ten minute rule, it is not infrequent that a publican or a bar man will, under special entreaty, serve a drink during that time.  We have all seen it happen, I have anyway and I have to confess that I have on occasion been the recipient of the largesse of the person who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confessing.  Sometimes it is good for the soul.  The half hour worries me slightly because I believe there will be enormous pressure on publicans during that half hour of drinking up time to serve more drink.  Once people are settled in and they are comfortable, they will frequently want one for the road or whatever it happens to be.  Publicans may not be as grateful for this concession as might appear to be the case at this stage because it will put them under greater pressure.  It is not a question on which one can be dogmatic.  It is an area where the Minister might, a year or two down <Col N="1559" /> the road, examine this provision to see if it is leading to widespread abuse.  If there is widespread selling of drink during that half hour he can either change the law to extend the time of drinking or restrict the amount of drinking up time.  This is an area at which the Minister would be well advised to take a further look.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke at some length on the whole question of under-age drinking. I have no doubt that this is the part of the present licensing situation which most concerns a great number of people throughout the country, parents, teachers, social workers and all of us.  There is a problem, and the scale of the problem may vary from place to place throughout the country but the scale of the problem is sufficiently extensive to be a cause for great concern.  Like the Minister, I believe that in areas like drinking and the abuse of the drinking laws, legislation can only go so far.  You can legislate all you like and you still will not cure the problem of alcoholism.  You cannot impose temperate drinking habits on people.</P>
      <P>Prohibition in the US was the great experiment which failed, the great experiment to make people good, to make them give up alcohol, to make it impossible for people to drink.  It led to the greatest bout of lawlessness, crime, murder and mayhem in the history of that country.  Legislation can only go part of the way.  I believe, like the Minister and anybody who observes the situation, that there are far more elements involved, and education is one of them.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, in spite of the cutbacks and the budgetary restrictions, to ensure the provision of a much wider degree of education for children especially, but also for adults because there is a greal deal of ignorance about alcohol.  The financial provisions should be extended if at all possible in the future. It would be desirable to see some of the lottery money going towards helping the different agencies invovled in the provision of education for young people on the question of drugs and alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure how much education can <Col N="1560" /> do in this regard.  Education of the proper kind can put the whole question of alcohol into a proper perspective.  It can warn young people of the effects of alcohol.  It can try to show them that there are other ways of enjoying themselves other than going into a smokey public house and drinking their heads off, or buying bottles of cider and going behind some wall and getting involved in a cider party which frequently can lead them to do appalling things which they would never do if they were sober.</P>
    <P>I believe we have only begun to look at the possibilities of education as a counter move against saturation advertising, against peer group pressure, against frequently the example of parents which all work against children having a balanced approach to and a balanced view of alcohol. I appeal to the Minister to see if anything can be done to increase the resources available and to ensure that the small number of experts in this field are fully brought into this battle.</P>
    <P>I suppose schools are only in the second place and that the example of parents is perhaps the biggest single factor in influencing young people into a proper view of alcohol.  Clearly, as is the case if one or both parents are themselves victims of excessive drinking, it is very difficult to expect young children to have a balanced view.  In many cases they will have a total revulsion against drinking which itself is perhaps not the healthiest way either.  A balance is always desirable. In other cases, they will very quickly be absorbed into the drinking culture of the family and may well have serious drinking problems themselves at a very early age. Again, there is very little we in this House, or the other-House, or the Government, or the Hierarchy, or anybody else can do to bring about change in the free will choices of people in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister can only do so much in his attempt to curb under-age drinking. Broadly I go along with the line the Minister has taken in the Bill to date.  Certainly, I am very pleased, indeed, that the Garda will be given much greater power to act against the drinking parties <Col N="1561" /> which are such a frequent part of life in some of our cities especially.  I am very pleased indeed about that.  I am pleased as well that steps are being taken to make the sale of alcohol in supermarkets that bit more restrictive.  I do not believe it actually goes far enough.  It certainly is a very welcome step in the right direction. I am not sure that the Bill addresses the problem of other outlets for drink, for cider especially, for young people.  I would like to have a word about that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of age cards yes, there is a general need for them.  Yes, they are generally welcome.  It is what the publicans want.  It is what many community groups want throughout the country. The age cards will work to the benefit of publicans and they will work to the benefit of those people who may well be over 18 years of age and who have difficulties in getting drink.  I am very glad, however, that the Minister has insisted that the system should be voluntary. I would not like to see a system of compulsory cards.  Clearly the cards are in the interests of those groups I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a uniformity of practice on the part of the publicans, that they would agree that these cards should be needed in all premises.  Frequently in the country they are not necessary because the publicans know their customers very well and know their ages.  If there was a uniform policy, that would show the public that this was the licensed trade taking a very positive view to curb excesses, rather than an imposition by the State, an imposition by big brother. I am one of those people who certainly do not relish the thought of compulsory ID cards for all.  I do not want to see a situation where a person at birth is given a number and is tagged for life with that number and is on every Government computer under that number and God knows what other computers there are.</P>
    <P>I believe that any system of compulsory identification cards, compulsory registration of this sort which exists in many other countries is something which we should move into very very slowly <Col N="1562" /> indeed, and it has too many shades of Orwell's &ldquo;1984&rdquo; about it.  It is too much open to abuse and manipulation.  I wonder what some of the older parliamentarians who served here, but mainly in the other House, over the years, people like James Dillon, Seán MacEntee and others who always had a very strong sense of individual liberty, would think of the idea of compulsory identity cards.  I believe they would be appalled at the prospect and certainly see no need for it.  I know times have changed but I believe we should move very slowly in this direction.  I am glad the Minister is insisting that this system will be voluntary but I would also appeal to the publicans to ensure that there is uniformity of practice throughout the country so that the system is enforced by the publicans in their interests and in the interest of curbing under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy, however &mdash; and I will put down an amendment &mdash; with one section of the Bill dealing with the card and the Minister referred to it in his speech.  Section 31 (4) may take on a new meaning when this Bill becomes law.  It refers to a document which &ldquo;appeared to be an age card&rdquo;.  I do not understand the need for the words &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo;. Either it is an age card or it is not.  The age card should be sufficiently distinctive to have a visibility.  It is known that the person has the age card.  Even if the person flashes it at the bar man late at night in a crowded pub, there is ample evidence for believing that it is an age card.  I may be talking myself out of an amendment here.  At this stage, however, I think the words &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo; are unnecessary.  They could allow far too much scope afterwards for publicans to say what appeared to be an age card was shown to them.  Either we have it or we do not.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we could flesh this out a little bit.  I am sure the Minister will do so.  We can talk about this later, but I am unhappy with the words &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The publican should look at it and see that it is what it is.  It is not just a case of saying: &ldquo;I glanced at <Col N="1563" /> something and I thought it was or it appeared to be&rdquo;.  Either it is, or is not the card.  The responsibility must be on him to say it is or is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why it may not be necessary.  We can talk about it on Committee Stage.  All in all, I welcome this legislation.  It has taken a long time to arrive here.  It has been well thought out.  It will improve significantly the way in which the licensed business in the country is being run at present.  I welcome also &mdash; but I feel it does not go far enough &mdash; the attempt to bring greater control on clubs.  There is no doubt that there has been widespread abuse of the position by various clubs throghout the country.  The competition from the clubs has frequently not been fair as far as hoteliers and publicans are concerned.  The game has not been played on the level pitch and I believe that the removal of the favourable status which clubs enjoyed &mdash; which is being removed in this legislation &mdash; is long overdue and is something which I welcome.  I welcome the legislation.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we will be putting forward a number of amendments.  I wish this Bill well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988.  This Bill deals in general with licensed vintners and hoteliers and now especially, restaurant owners.  I congratulate the Minister on updating the legislation.  An Intoxicating Liquor Bill was introduced in 1962, which is a long time ago.  Indeed, it is about time that some of the most important aspects of the legislation were updated. We can be very grateful to the Minister for updating that legislation in this Bill. The Minister has done his very best to satisfy all sections who are interested in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I am quite sure that, when he was formulating the Bill, he had many representations from the different sectors, pub owners, hotel owners, and the consumers because they have a certain interest too.  The licensing laws are concerned essentially with the number and nature of licensed outlets <Col N="1564" /> and the persons to be licensed, as well as the times at which drink can be sold. Naturally the amended legislation has to be carefully thought out and dealt with in a very efficient manner.  The Minister has dealt with it very efficiently.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill introduces a special restaurant licence to enable restaurants to get intoxicating liquor licences in certain instances.  This is very important as some of our better restaurants should be licensed.  Food and drink go very well together.  People found it very unsatisfactory in the past when they frequented certain restaurants and were unable to get a drink with their meal.  I come from a tourist county where we have some of the best restaurants in the country, or they are equally as good as anywhere in the country.  From a tourist point of view, I welcome the fact that good restaurants can be licensed in future.  It will benefit my county and the country as a whole from a tourist point of view.  When we want to go out for a meal in the evening, most of us would like to go to a restaurant that is licensed.</P>
      <P>This legislation will enable all the better restaurants in the country to get a licence.  My county will benefit very much from it as many of the restaurants in County Kerry will qualify for this licence. In the past it was very difficult for restaurants to get a licence because they had to extinguish a licence to obtain one.  This caused a certain amount of difficulty and confusion.  It was very difficult for some restaurants to purchase a liquor licence. Under this legislation a restaurant can get a licence.  If the standard of the restaurant is approved by Bord Fáilte, the Department of Justice can issue a licence to that restaurant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise one point which the Minister covered pretty well in his speech.  Publicans in my own county and outside it emphasised that the Minister should ensure that those restaurants who are granted a special licence should obey the regulations and should not be allowed to have a bar or any type of counter or barrier.  The Minister has dealt with this but I think we should emphasise <Col N="1565" /> it.  It has been brought to our notice that the special licence can be abused if restaurants are turned into ordinary bars.  I understand the gardaí can now visit those restaurants and investigate whether drink is being served after 12.30 at night.</P>
    <P>It has also been mentioned to me &mdash; and I would like the Minister to give me an assurance on this &mdash; that fish and chip shops will not get a licence eventually. That has been claimed by some publicans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator that assurance here and now.  They will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that to the publicans who approached me.  I had a group of publicans with me during the weekend and they were making the case that restaurants should not be open-until 12.30 a.m. or licensed until 12.30 a.m., which I did not agree with.  The publicans pointed out that perhaps a fish and chip shop could be classified in the future as serving a substantial meal for a certain number of people and that they may qualify for a licence.  I know the Minister is going to come back to me and say Bord Fáilte would not recommend them for a licence. The publicans I met brought that to my notice and I would like the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have squashed totally any doubts the Senator might have in his mind about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The £3,000 fee to take out a special restaurant licence is just about right.  There was a lot of discussion on how much a licence should cost.  The Minister has come up with a very acceptable figure of £3,000.  I have met some restaurant owners in Kerry who are quite happy with the £3,000 charge.  It is quite acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a great idea that the Garda superintendent can object to a restaurant licence if the owners are not adhering to the law, that is, if they are breaking the law on the serving of drink in any restaurant. It is a good idea and a good safeguard to ensure that they are keeping <Col N="1566" /> to the regulations that a superintendent can object to the licence being granted the following year.  Some of the publicans were worred that the 12.30 a.m. closing time would not be observed by restaurants. I am quite sure the Minister for Justice will take steps to ensure that those hours will be observed and that restaurants will not be allowed serve drink after 12.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is a 500 fine for any restaurant in breach of these regulations.  That is a good deterrent. Also gardaí will be visiting those premises to ensure that drink is not served after 12.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with opening and closing hours.  Licensed premises closing hours are frequently the subject of a great deal of controversy.  The closing hour of 11 p.m. in winter time is very acceptable.  I am delighted the Minister did not extend this time.  The 30 minutes drinking up time is welcome.  Legislation on intoxicating liquor has not been introduced for over 20 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas so I suppose it is no wonder the ten minutes drinking up time was not adequate.  This 30 minutes extra drinking up time is essential.  It is very important because some people are inclined to drink up pretty quickly.  They get a drink.  It may be one minute before 11 o'clock and they have to drink it up quickly to have it finished at 11.10 p.m.</P>
    <P>That 30 minutes extra is very well accepted around the country.  It will mean that people will not get in under the influence of drink.  We all know that if we drink too quickly we are inclined to get intoxicated more quickly.  That 30 minutes will allow plenty of time for drinking up.  During the summer the 11.30 p.m. closing time with the 30 minutes drinking up time is adequate for our country.  Some people in seaside towns especially, in my own county and throughout the country were anxious that there would be a 12 o'clock midnight closing and a 30 minute drinking up time. I made a case to the Minister when he was formualting the legislation, as representations had been made to me, but I <Col N="1567" /> was satisifed with the reason the Minister could not do this.</P>
    <P>It is better to have a uniform time throughout the country rather than some seaside towns having half an hour extra; then people might rush from one village to a seaside village because they had a half an hour extra drinking time.  Some of our seaside towns have only a three month season.  They thought it would be desirable to have a half an hour extra but I can see the Minister's difficulty in enforcing that and differentiating between seaside towns and other towns. I am sure that, in general, the publicans and the people who frequent our seaside town will be happy at the 11.30 p.m. closing time with an extra 30 minutes drinking up time allowed as well.</P>
    <P>One of the most important parts of this Bill is the extension of the closing hours from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday night, with a half an hour drinking up time. There has been a great demand for this for many years.  On Sunday night people found they had to get out of pubs and hotels at 10 p.m. which was unreasonable. Everybody I have met, publicians and people who frequent pubs and hotels for a few drinks on Sunday night, welcome the extended time to 11 p.m. which means they have to get out of the public house by 11.30 p.m.  Everybody seems to be delighted with the extra hour on Sunday night.</P>
    <P>The closing time of registered clubs has been very contentious in every county, including County Kerry.  Some people who had a few drinks in the local village and found out that a GAA club or a registered club, which had a bar down the road was open for a little longer than the pub, would flock to the registered club after the pub had closed.  The publicans resented this.  I am delighted that in future the registered clubs will have the same closing hours as the pubs.  This will be welcomed by the publicans.  I do not know how the drinking fraternity will react to it but I welcome it.  In Kerry there was a lot of criticism about the registered clubs being open later than the pubs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> I also welcome the provision in this legislation that the Garda can visit clubs and the same regulations will apply as applies in pubs or hotels except where a substantial meal is being served in the registered club when they can stay open later.  The fact that the Garda can visit those clubs in future will ensure that their closing time will be on a par with the pubs and there will be more harmony between the club owners and the publicans.</P>
    <P>The fines of between £20 and £40 for a publican or a hotelier who breached the licensing laws was outdated.  No legislation had been introduced since 1962 so we have to accept that.  The £400 fine for a first offence is welcome.  Some of the publicans were critical of the extent of the fine but it will make them more vigilant in future in abiding by the law.  They will not be anxious to be caught a second time as the fine for a second offence will be £800. The customers will be fined £25 to £50, which will be an incentive to them to ensure that they get out of the pub in time.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the holy hour does not apply to people in rural Ireland.  I remember when I got into politics 20 years ago when I came to Dublin and found the pubs closed between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.  I wondered what it was all about.  It was strange to have the holy hour.  I hope the Dublin people will welcome the fact that it has been done away with which leaves the people free to have drinks between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the special exemptions and I would like the Minister to clarify something for me.  On the Second Stage in the Seanad the Minister said the closing hours on Monday morning would be 1 a.m. but in his Second Stage speech in the Dáil he said 1.30 a.m. That may have been amended in the Dáil, I do not know as I had not time to read the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It will cause some difficulty.  I am delighted the Minister did not change the special exemption order as this is used by clubs and different organisations for dances where they have a meal.  Most of the special exemption orders were used on a <Col N="1569" /> Friday night, Saturday night, or Sunday night and I am glad he did not change them.  They keep our hotels ticking over in the winter when they do not have the tourist business.  This is great for the hotels in County Kerry.  I am delighted that the Minister has not changed any of the special exemption orders.</P>
    <P>The next item of the Bill deals with under-age drinking in pubs.  A practice that has crept into society is that people under 18 years of age are accepted in pubs and are served drink.  It is about time the regulation was enforced.  It is important that our young people should not be allowed in pubs.  The publicans alone are not to blame for this.  We are all to blame, and parents, teachers, clergy and so on should encourage young people not to drink until they are 18 years of age.  I advise my children not to drink until they are 18 years of age and as far as I know they adhere to my request.  All parents should try to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>I notice that under this Bill females under 18 years of age cannot serve in bars.  This had been a great practice in many pubs, especially in the tourist areas. Many people under 18 years of age get summer jobs in pubs and hotels.  A pub is a bad environment for girls aged under 18 years.  It is not a proper place for them to be.  They are too young for some of the conduct and for some of the abuse to which they might be subjected in bars.  I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>I notice that boys and men under 16 years of age can serve in bars.  I would have preferred if boys or men under 18 years of age could not serve in bars, but I am sure the Minister has made a thorough investigation into this, and that men or boys of 16 years of age should not be allowed to serve drink.</P>
    <P>Everybody congratulates the Minister on not allowing children under 18 years of age to participate in drinking in pubs. I welcome the provision which allows children under 18 years of age into pubs with their guardians or parents.  It is very important that they are under supervision. Indeed, if families go to the seaside for a day out, it is not right that their <Col N="1570" /> children should have to stay in the car and cannot go into a pub with their parents.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill also.</P>
    <P>There will be a greater onus on the publican now to ensure that people under 18 years of age are not served drink.  It is very difficult for a publican to know whether or not a person is under 18 years of age.  I accept the recommendation that identification or age cards should be introduced on a voluntary basis.  I presume that any person over 18 years of age who finds it difficult to get a drink because he looks under 18 years of age, will now be able to get an identification card proving that he is over 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that identification cards should be compulsory.  Recently in Australia the Government there were on the point of trying to introduce identification cards for everyone and they failed.  I welcome the way in which the Minister has handled this, so that, the holding of identification cards is voluntary, that if the young people think it necessary to have an identification or age card, they can get it.</P>
    <P>In this country we have some six-day licences.  I appeal to the Minister to allow six-day licensees to get a seven-day licence.  A six-day licence is not much good in this day and age.  I presume that a six-day licence was appropriate 30 or 40 years ago but in this day and age a six-day licence is not satisfactory.  When introducing legislation in the near future the Minister may consider this or he might make an amendment to this Bill. There are a number of six-day licensees in County Kerry and I have been approached to raise this with the Minister. I am just passing on the request.</P>
    <P>The most important provisions in this Bill are the extra half an hour drinking-up time, the restaurant licences, and the 11 p.m. closing time on Sunday nights, which means that pubs need not close until 11.30 p.m. because of the half hour drinking-up time.  I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has handled this Bill to the satisfaction of everyone after 23 or 24 years when no drink legislation was introduced here.  I have had <Col N="1571" /> very few complaints against the Bill and I assure the Minister that both the drinkers and publicans, the hoteliers and the majority of people are quite satisfied with it.  I am quite sure that many parents and probably many young people will eventually thank the Minister for not allowing people under 18 years of age into pubs to be served with drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the last words of Senator McEllistrim who commended the Minister for his handling of the Bill since it has been published.  I would qualify that by saying that I congratulate him for handling it within the very limited parameters of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is indicative of a new and constructive attitude on the part of the Government that this Bill was amended materially in the Dáil this week, when sensible suggestions were made by the Opposition and by vested interest groups. The Government were quite happy, especially as regards the 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock rule for the restaurants, to change the Bill when reasonable arguments were put to them.  That is extremely helpful and constructive.  If amendments are put down in the Seanad I hope they will be looked at in the same way.  I know there is a desire on the part of the Government to get this Bill through as quickly as possible, presumably because of the tourist season, but that does not mean it cannot be improved.</P>
      <P>The Bill is well overdue.  For the past 15 years I have heard the complaints from restaurateurs and publicans about the licensing laws.  Indeed, I sat on the Committee on Legislation which considered this subject and came to no particular sensible conclusions.  I am very glad that Committee on Legislation has not been resurrected by the Government.  It considered many things like drink, radio and so on, and achieved absolutely nothing. I say in passing that it considered this subject as well and came to no particular conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the Bill in a limited way.  I wonder what is the thinking behind the whole attitude to <Col N="1572" /> drink in this country.  I believe that there should be virtually no restrictions on opening hours of public houses and restaurants. The attitudes of Governments and of the people is that drink is (a) inherently wrong and therefore should be restricted but not banned and (b) that the people are incapable of coping with it. Therefore, what the Government do is restrict it as far as is possible and set down fairly arbitrary rules to restrict people's consumption, and opening and closing hours.  As a result, it seems from the new rules in the Bill, that the drink laws have been liberalised to a limited extent but have not been liberalised enough.  I do not understand the reasons for these restrictions.  It seems to me that they are plucked out of the air, to a certain extent. The 11.30 p.m. rule, the 10 p.m. rule, and the 12.30 a.m. rules are plucked out of the air as an arbitrary way of restricting people's drinking.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects a movement, a trend in liberalisation of attitudes to drink, but no more.  Since the foundation of the State, and before, the rules as regards intoxicating liquor have been seriously abused, and to a large extent ignored, and those rules have not been policed properly.  There has been a very simple acceptance by the Government, by the Garda and by the people that the rules are made, but they are not enforced.  I challenge anyone in this House to say that he has not been in a public house during the holy hour, that he has not had a drink in a pub during the holy hour and that he has not had a drink in a restaurant after hours.  Everybody knows that this has been happening.  Everybody knows that the pubs stay open too late.  Everybody knows that the restaurateurs have been serving gin, vodka and brandy and everything which is not allowed for years. What we are doing here, to some extent, is legalising an existing situation.  That is a pity.  The law should be enforced or it should be recognised as being irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We should look further down this road and admit that the restrictions which are imposed in this Bill, even though they are more liberal, will also be abused and ignored.  Despite the protestations of <Col N="1573" /> some people during the debate on this Bill, the law of the land as regards intoxicating liquor will not be enforced any more strictly after the Bill has been passed.  That line of thought should being us to a deep re-examination of our attitude to drink and our restrictions on drink.  I wonder whether it would be more enlightened if the Government were to say: &ldquo;Yes, perhaps public houses could be open 24 hours a day&rdquo;.  Is it the Government's role to tell people what they ought to drink, when they ought to drink and how much they ought to drink?  The Bill is saying that pubs should close at 11.30 p.m. or 11 o'clock in winter time and it is saying that the Government know when people should go to bed, that the pubs should close at 11.30 p.m. because it is bed time.</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's role to tell people when to go to bed and when to get up in the morning.  The Government might like to be able to do that, and the Minister for Justice might enjoy doing that, but he should not do it.  The Minister for Justice ought to be saying that the people of Ireland are mature enough to decide how much they ought to drink and when they ought to drink.  I see very little evidence that there would be riots in the streets, or more trouble in the streets, if people were allowed to decide when they drank and what they drank.  Indeed, there appears to be evidence to the contrary. It appears that when people know they have to stop drinking at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m., they drink too much too quickly. The Minister is giving people a half hour drinking up time, but what he is really doing is just giving them a little more time to drink a little more.  The same rush and the same pressure to drink the same amount in the last half hour will be there. The Minister says it is his intention to introduce further legislation on this, but before he does so he ought to re-think the whole attitude about restricting people's times and amounts of drinking.  That is most important.  The Bill is very limited in that way.</P>
    <P>The other principal element in the Bill is the restriction on under-age drinking. This is very necessary.  In many ways, the <Col N="1574" /> introduction of age cards, as a voluntary method of restricting under-age drinking is a very sensible way of doing it.  The Bill also legitimises what happens in many public houses at the moment by allowing children in with their parents.  That is quite sensible.  It recognises the fact that public houses are not purely and simply places where adults go and get drunk.  It recognises the social element of it, that pubs are places where people go to have meals, where families get together and where people meet.  The idea of having children in with their parents is certainly a mature and sensible attitude on the part of the Minister.  I would like the Minister to look again at far less restrictive legislation on restaurants and on public houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the ground has been covered already, and I am sure the Minister has probably heard enough about pub debates.  The preamble to the Minister's speech this morning sums it up.  We have a long way to go in the whole debate on drink.  Senator Ross encapsulated that very well in this contribution this morning.</P>
      <P>There are a number of elements in the Bill to which I would like to address myself.  The debate on altering opening hours, and so on, has been going on for about ten or 11 years.  Public reaction to the Bill has been that the mixture is almost 100 per cent correct.  There was a desire in some seaside resorts for pubs to stay open a little longer.</P>
      <P>The counter argument about members of the public racing from non-designated areas into designated areas is very valid. While it might have been great to allow seaside resorts a little later opening time the temptation had to be resisted for that very reason.  Anybody who lives in a tourist area where there are a number of festivals, regattas and so on throughout the summer, becomes quite conscious of traffic arriving into the town fifteen minutes or half an hour before pubs with extensions are due to close.  It is quite obvious that the demand for later opening hours for seaside resorts had to be resisted for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> All in all, the mixture is quite acceptable. The Minister had a particular problem in that there are two pub cultures in this country.  City dwellers in Dublin and Cork quite often do not have an understanding of the important and significant role that pubs play in rural parts of the country.  The Minister obviously had a great difficulty in trying to get the right mixture.  We could almost have two separate Bills to address the subject but obviously that would not be realistic.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will deal with the severity of the fines.  Anybody who has occasion to peruse provincial papers will see that people will be reported as being found on public house premises playing 25 at 2 o'clock in the morning. This is not a joke, it is dead serious in a country place.  A pub is not a haven of debauchery and drunkenness.  It is virtually a community centre.  I am quite serious about that, and it is why I will be exhorting the Minister at a later date, to be a little more gentle particularly on the publicans, and possibly reverse the penalty and have the person found on the premises fined the £500 and the publican £25.  That would be more just.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have many of the publicans getting to bed earlier at night, which might help them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated in getting the mixture right.  Solomon himself would not be able solve the problem for the publicans.  As a publican I must say that, because we are a very difficult group of people to deal with at any time. There is a general acceptance that the mix is now right.  The fact that the Minister has committed himself here to an ongoing review of the various alterations is welcome.  Publicans and the drink industry generally should use this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of unfair criticism of publicans in relation to under-age drinking and so on.  I have spent all my adult life working in a pub and I am not <Col N="1576" /> aware of any publican who consciously doles out drink to young people.  It is a difficult matter that needs to be addressed. If publicans approach this Bill in the proper spirit many of the problems can be resolved.  These problems must be addressed because they are becoming a serious national problem.</P>
    <P>In England control is exerted by publicans in relation to closing.  If one goes into a pub in the UK and the publican says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; he means very definitely &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but if a publican in Ireland says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; it is something that can be negotiated.  This provision will have to be used as an opportunity to enforce the law.  It is not to be seen as a device to close pubs at 12.30 a.m. which I suspect it may quite easily become.  A publican should use this opportunity to say that at 11.40 p.m. he is going to throw the glass cloth over the dispenser and leave.  Then we may get a proper implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllistrim touched on this a moment ago.  Most people come into a pub quite often at drinking up time.  They come for their last drink at night, or for their only drink at night, at 11.30 p.m. and they are expected to be off the premises at 11.40 p.m. and, of course, they are not, they stroll away nonchalantly at about 12.5 a.m. having availed of an extra 20 minutes. indeed, it is very difficult for the Garda and quite unfair to them to expect them to come, stormtrooper like, into a pub at 11.45 p.m. on an ordinary week night and start clearing the premises. The normal reaction of a drinker is to say &rdquo;Have you not got something better to be doing with your time?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on publicans to avail of the opportunity to impose a new procedure in this case and say at 11.30 p.m. that they have served the last drink, and people can then drink in comfort.  I have often been confronted at 11.40 p.m. on a summer's night when clearing up glasses in the pub with guys with four or five pints each in front of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they are <Col N="1577" /> supposed to be off the premises at 11.40 p.m. it would be a fair feat to drink three or four pints in four or five minutes, and, of course, they had no notion of doing that.  The difficulty is imposed upon the publican, as he has to physically take £6 or £7 worth of drink from every customer and throw it down the drain or put it behind the bar.  Indeed, if a garda comes on the premises, that is what he is going to be asked to do and it is not his job. There has to be a new beginning in this regard.  It is up to the publicans and it should be used as a new departure.  It can and should be done.  The Minister has got the mixture right now and it is up to the trade to take the initiative in this regard.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other very vexed subject of under-age drinking, everybody who addressed the subject here this morning said that it is not the legislators' job and most definitely not the publicans job to do what is basically the business of parents.  I was very amused by a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme in Limerick about a year ago where parents were irately saying, &ldquo;That was the pub where my 13-year-old child was served drink one night last week.&rdquo;  I would consider myself a very deficient parent, if I did not know where my 13-year-old child was at any time of the day or night.</P>
      <P>It is slightly different in relation to an 18-year-old; because they are now leaving the country at 18 years of age, they are working at 18, are away from home in third level institutions at 18 and so on and.  There is a difficulty with the 18-year-old threshold in that the role of an 18-year-old has changed very dramatically in the past ten years.  I mentioned to the Minister, that it might have been a better idea to drop that threshold to 17 years and enforce it with all the vigour at the disposal of the law.  I know somebody could say, &ldquo;Why not make it 16?&rdquo;  An 18-year-old today is much more mature than an 18-year-old in the 1962 era.  That is an aspect that could possibly have been looked at, but I accept the Minister's point that it is difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole phenomenon of under-age drinking has changed dramatically.  In <Col N="1578" /> Cork last year there was a riot on the streets of the city after an inter cert party. The average inter cert student is 14 or 15 years of age at most, and there was a riot after a party, after they got their inter cert results.</P>

      <P>I believe there was. It all happened in the precincts of the court house, which was rather funny.  It is an indication of how things have changed and is an indication of the scale of the difficulty.  I still go back to the point that there must be major responsibility attaching to parents.  If and when we find under-age drinkers being prosecuted under this new legislation, I will be putting it to the Minister that he should include also a facility whereby the child's parents can be prosecuted.  The public can be prosecuted and the under-age drinker can be prosecuted but surely there is another responsible party in this whole debate.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad today on this important topic.  It has already been the subject of a very useful debate in the Dáil last week and I welcome the initiative of the Seanad in also debating the subject.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the issue of the internal market was discussed in great detail in the Seanad, in the Dáil and elsewhere, in the period leading up to the Referendum on the Single European Act in May 1987.  The completion of the internal market was one of the main elements in the Single Act.  It was, therefore, one of the main issues in the Referendum campaign, the outcome of which was the overwhelming approval of ratification of the Single Act.</P>
      <P>The publication of the series of studies, which are being generally referred to as the Cecchini Report, is very timely for a number of reasons.  The Community is today almost half-way through the eight-year timespan allotted for the achievement of the Single Market by the European Council at Fontainebleau in 1984. The Commission's White Paper <i>Completing the Internal Market,</i> published in 1985, listed all the pieces of Community legislation &mdash; over 300 of them &mdash; it then envisaged as necessary to achieve that objective.  As we approach the half-way stage, the Commission has now presented drafts of over 200 of what it expects to be a final total of 286 proposals to the Council.  It expects to have tabled all of them by the end of this year.  The ball is now in the Council's court, and we can expect the pace of negotiations on the Internal Market to increase considerably over the next few years, as 1992 approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent developments have facilitated this change in tempo.  The entry into force of the Single European Act on 1 July 1987 means that over two-thirds of the 286 proposals will now be decided on by a qualified majority in the Council, rather than unanimously as previously required. <Col N="1580" /> Already more and more items are being decided upon by a qualified majority, except, of course, in the most sensitive areas such as harmonisation of indirect taxes, which will remain subject to unanimous agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the future financing of the community reached at the Brussels European Council in February of this year has secured the Community's finances into the medium term, and removed from the agenda, for the time being, the subject which has done most to sidetrack and bog down the Community in the last ten years.  The Community is now free to devote its full attention to implementation of the Single Act, of which the completion of the internal market is a major part.</P>
    <P>The current German Presidency of the Council has made the internal market one of the main items on its agenda and has vigorously pushed forward negotiations in a number of areas.  We can expect the internal market to be one of the dominant issues at the Hanover European Council and to remain a key issue for some years to come, including the period when Ireland will next hold the Presidency in the first half of 1990.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market has been an objective of the Community since its establishment in 1957.  Since accession in 1973 Ireland has strongly supported the drive to achieve its completion and we have welcomed the renewed effort which has followed the negotiation of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>A small, less developed country on the edge of the Community, Ireland is critically dependent on exports for its prosperity and for the maintenance of employment.  This is especially true at the present time, when the Government's determined efforts to restore the public finances have seriously curtailed their ability directly to stimulate growth in domestic demand.  Growth must for the moment depend heavily on the expansion of our exports and geography alone dictates that that must mean expansion of our trade with our Community partners, who in 1986 absorbed 72 per cent of our exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The studies which I have been referring to as the Cecchini Report were initiated by the Commission in 1986 and the Commission team was headed by Mr. Paolo Cecchini.  In fact the report consists of a number of publications, all deriving from the studies, conducted by various experts, consultants and institutions supported by the Commission Services.  Most Senators will probably only have seen a little of the documentation produced by the studies and will have had time only to absorb its basic thrust.  The total output of the research when it is finally published is estimated to run to some 6,000 pages. In will be useful, therefore, if I outline the main conclusions of the report.</P>
    <P>The aim of the report is to provide a body of scientific analysis identifying and quantifying the immense costs of existing barriers to trade and the potential benefits for the Community as a whole of the completion of the internal market.  The report attempted to estimate the costs to Governments, business and consumers of various constraints such as market barriers, unnecessary customs procedures, administrative delays, artificial technical barriers and discrimination in public procurement policies.  It contains a wealth of analysis, but its basic conclusions are as follows.</P>
    <P>It found that industrialists reckoned the direct costs of the various barriers to trade as about 3½ per cent of the value of goods produced, with further very considerable indirect costs resulting from these barriers.  It estimated that up to one-third of European industry could reduce its costs by from 1 per cent to 7 per cent, or about 2 per cent of Community GDP; from economies of scale, with certain sectors such as financial services able to make even bigger savings.</P>
    <P>At a macroeconomic level, the report has estimated the likely impact of the completion of the internal market on the economy of the Community as a whole. In the current economic environment, it suggests that over a five to six-year period the programme could result in an increase of about 4½ per cent of Community GDP, a decrease in prices of the order of 6 per <Col N="1582" /> cent and some two million new jobs.  If, in addition, Community Governments take the opportunity offered by the completion of the internal market to switch to more growth-oriented policies, the benefits could increase considerably.  In those circumstances, the report estimates gains as some 7 per cent of Community GDP and up to five million new jobs.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that these figures refer to extra growth on top of what the Community would normally achieve and to net job increases, above those needed to absorb losses from streamlining as a result of the completion of the internal market.  It is also hopeful to note that this growth would be accompained by a deflation of prices rather than higher inflation.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Taoiseach in his speech to the Dáil on Thursday last welcomed the report on behalf of the Government.  The report can contribute usefully to the debate on the internal market which the Government hope to stimulate throughout the country over the coming months, and indeed right up to 1992.  We welcome in particular the emphasis in the report on the need for the adoption across the Community of growth-oriented policies if the full benefits of the internal market are to be realised.  Only by taking measures to stimulate growth in demand will the full potential of the principally supply-side benefits of the internal market be achievable, thus enabling the Community to achieve higher overall growth and so begin seriously to reduce the great burden of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The quantitative aspects of the report must, as many commentators point out, be treated with some caution, as they represent broad orders of magnitude rather than concrete predictions.  There is no reason, however, to doubt the broad correctness of the report's analysis especially in its expectation of a more vigorous competitive environment for which we must be prepared.</P>
    <P>There are, unfortunately, some deficiencies in the report from Ireland's point of view, which reduce its usefulness to both Government and industry in this <Col N="1583" /> country.  In the Dáil last week the Taoiseach drew attention to these deficiencies. There are two principal shortcomings in the report, as the Government see it &mdash; it does not analyse the regional distribution of gains and losses and its analysis does not embrace all of the members states.</P>
    <P>Rather surprisingly the report barely touches on the likely distribution across the Community of the effects, positive and negative, of the completion of the internal market, and no quantitative analysis is undertaken of the distribution of the likely effects.  Thus while the report powerfully supports the assumption that the Community as a whole will benefit from the internal market, it does not help to assess in any detail the likely effect upon the specific member states.  It will not, therefore, assist us in analsysing the impact of the completion of the internal market on the less prosperous regions of the Community, of which Ireland is one.</P>
    <P>The analysis presented is based on research done almost entirely in seven of the 12 member states.  Furthermore, six of the seven states chosen were the more developed, central states of the Community: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.  The peripheral or lesser developed States were largely ignored by the detailed research. The thinking has been that the more developed central states stand to gain more from the internal market, and the study should have addressed this important question.  This deficiency is all the more disappointing in view of the substantial time, resources and effort which obviously went in to producing such a weighty body of analysis.</P>
    <P>The member states in drawing up the Single European Act, which enshrined the completion of the internal market by 1992 as a central objective of the Community, recognised the likelihood that the larger economies stood to gain most from the process.  For this reason they established the achievement of economic and social cohesion as an equally important objective to be purused in parallel with the completion of the internal <Col N="1584" /> market.  Their intentions to reduce the disparities between the richer and poorer regions and to develop the backward regions are outlined in the new Article 130 of the Treaty.  Provision was made for amendments and improvements in the Community structural Funds and Article 130B states that the achievement of cohesion shall be taken into account in the implementation of all Community policies, including the internal market.</P>
    <P>The cohesion objective is part of the mainstream of Community policy.  At the last three European Councils there has been detailed discussions on the Structural Funds.  This has led to agreement in Brussels in February last to a doubling in the size of the funds between 1987 and 1993.  For the less developed regions, of which Ireland is one, assistance from the funds will be doubled by 1992.  In addition there has been agreement on higher rates of Community contributions.  The aim is to help the less prosperous regions of the Community to reach a level of economic and infrastructural development which will allow them to avail fully and effectively of the opportunities which will be presented by the opening of the large European market.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that while the Cecchini study is relatively silent on cohesion, President Delors in his introduction to the summary of the study maintains the balance and recognises that the large market without frontiers has a social as well as an economic dimension. The Government will be working to ensure that the cohesion dimension remains in the forefront in Community negotiations in the coming years.  The declaration made when the Single European Act was ratified recalls the provisions of the Protocol on Ireland negotiated at the time of accession.  The cohesion commitment is reflected in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and will be pursued with full vigour to ensure that this country is geared as well as possible to maximise the benefits available from the internal market.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has stated in the Dáil, no one should suppose that benefits will flow automatically to Ireland from the <Col N="1585" /> achievement of the Single European Market.  Now is the time for what he called &ldquo;a cool, careful assessment of what is involved&rdquo;, and for us in Ireland to anticipate the impact of 1992 and to take action in plenty of time to make what changes and preparations are necessary. For some firms it will be a question of preparing for difficult challenges, for others, perhaps, a period to gear up for the opportunities ahead.  No sector of the economy should be complacent, as some were on our accession to the Community in 1973.  Senators will recall that while Ireland as a whole has benefited greatly from our membership of the Community, some sectors such as textiles and footwear suffered a sharp decline partly through failure to prepare to operate in a more harshly competitive atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Some specific areas of difficulty for Ireland with the completion of the Internal Market have already been identified and addressed.  The Minister for Finance spoke in the Dáil of our difficulties with the proposals for the harmonisation of indirect taxes.  The Government have publicly stated their acceptance in principle of tax harmonisation, but have impressed firmly upon our partners and the Commission that in the current budgetary situation it would impose losses on our finances which we are simply not in a position to support at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have estimated that these losses would amount at a minimum to £350 million per annum, plus a further loss of £120 million in the first year due to the loss of VAT at the point of entry.  As the Minister for Finance has explained, in our current position we cannot cover this loss either by increased borrowings, higher direct taxes or additional expenditure cuts, and we shall, therefore, be seeking a solution at Community level when the negotiations on tax harmonisation begin in earnest.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that larger firms will be better placed to capitalise on the changes to come, and we in Ireland must take careful note of the implications this will have for our economy, which at <Col N="1586" /> present is overwhelmingly composed of small firms.  It would be wrong, however, to be gloomy about the prospects for Irish business.  I am encouraged to note that Irish industrialists sampled in the surveys undertaken as part of the Cecchini studies were very optimistic about 1992.  Two-thirds of businessmen and women questioned felt that the internal market would bring increased business for them.  Questioning also revealed that Irish companies consider administrative barriers, national standards and regulations, and physical frontier delays, in that order, to be their principal barriers to increased exports.</P>
    <P>These types of barrier weigh more heavily on small firms than on large ones, and all will be substantially eased, if not removed altogether, by 1992.  It is worth bearing in mind that Ireland has one of the most open economies in the Community, and in general stands only to gain from the removal of the barriers.  Such challenges as 1992 will pose for Irish industry will arise rather from the subsequent increase in competition which our exports will have to face in all Community markets.</P>
    <P>The internal market can be expected to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location for extra-Community investment. As the House is aware, many non-Community firms are anxious to set up subsidiaries within the Community, and Ireland has in the past benefited greatly from this.  The Cecchini report confirms that the location decisions of such investors can be heavily influenced by threats to discriminate against their products on the part of the larger member states, whose markets are most valuable.  The internal market, by ensuring the free movement of Irish-made goods and services throughout Community, will eliminate this trend and improve our attractiveness as an investment location.</P>
    <P>The potential implications of 1992 are clearly enormous for the economy as a whole but specific and different to each firm involved.  It is in the end the responsibility of the individual firm &mdash; and of every firm in the country &mdash; to assess for themselves how 1992 will impact on their business, and how best to prepare for <Col N="1587" /> that.  The Government will, however, do everything they can to assist firms in that analysis and preparation, and will take all such steps as lie directly in their power to help the economy prepare for the challenges and opportunties ahead.  The Government have already been very active in this regard.</P>
    <P>In their management of the economy as a whole and in specific initiatives, the Government have been acting to improve the business environment in Ireland. Inflation is currently at its lowest point for 20 years.  Interest rates have dropped dramatically, and the costs to industry of electricity and telecommunications services are being reduced.  Steps are in hand to reduce insurance costs, lighten the administrative burden on firms, permit increased competition in transport and improve the transport infrastructure.  In short, the Government have given top priority to creating the environment in which Irish firms will be well placed to benefit from the internal market.</P>
    <P>At the operating level the Taoiseach has set up a special committee of Ministers and departmental secretaries.  He is chairing this committee which meets as frequently as once every week.  Their function is to consider what steps will be necessary to help the economy to adjust to specific features of the internal market programme, and to consider the best and most effective use that can be made of the increased receipts to be expected from the structural funds.  The committee have already commenced on a substantial programme of work to ensure that the Government give an effective and coordinated lead in preparing for 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government have been preparing since October 1987, in anticipation of the decisions reached at Brussels in February this year for the introduction probably, in January 1989, of the operation of the new programmed approach to the structural funds.  We took the initiative late last year when we started preparations for the programme approach.  We are beginning with pilot studies in three regions &mdash; Dublin, Cork and Galway &mdash; and the approach will be gradually extended to cover the entire country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> By taking rapid decisions to go over to the programme approach as quickly as possible the Government have demonstrated their readiness to maximise Ireland's benefits from the structural funds.  As I already mentioned, the Brussels European Council in February provided for a progressive doubling of the resources of the funds.  Furthermore the rate of assistance from the funds can now be up to 75 per cent in the less-developed regions, as compared with a maximum of 55 per cent at present.  We would expect to benefit substantially from these improvements in the structural funds regime.  They will make a considerable contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> not least in areas such as the food industry, the maritime industry, forestry and tourism.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government are about to launch a national campaign to increase awareness among the public, but particularly among industry, of the implications of 1992, and to encourage consideration of how best to meet the changes ahead.  The House will wish to be aware of the shape of the campaign as it is being planned.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach will reflect the co-operative approach involving all the sectors affected by the opening of the internal market.  A subcommittee of the Geoghegan-Quinn committee who co-ordinate our position on EC matters, will bring together the various Departments involved in the internal market. In addition a joint committee has been established bringing together these Departments and the parties to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This sub-committee will provide a forum for liaison and co-ordination of approaches to a greater awareness of the opportunities and risk involved as we move towards 1992.</P>
    <P>While final details of the awareness campaign have yet to be settled, it will cover all sectors affected by the internal market, focus on their specific problems and involve decentralised delivery of information through the representative bodies.  The campaign will be launched <Col N="1589" /> with a major national conference, which will be co-sponsored by the organisations party to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The conference will be addressed by the Taoiseach and by other distinguished national and Community figures.</P>
    <P>As regards what is happening elsewhere in the Community, I should say that with the exception of the UK and Germany, which began their campaigns last month and France where there has been an active campaign since 1986, all other member states are still at the planning stage, and many indeed are considerably behind us.  Indeed my Department have received inquiries from a number of our partners concering the shape of our emerging campaign, presumably in order to assist them in their own planning.</P>
    <P>The Government plan, after the national launch, to operate on a smaller scale, more specifically targeted campaign, more appropriate to our resources and the scale of our economy rather than the large scale, expensive and rather diffuse and generalised style of campaign operating for example, in the UK.  The campaign will, as I have said, operate in a decentralised manner, with Government Departments giving such help as is required to the sectors with which they are concerned, but relying to a large extent on the sectoral, regional and functional organisations to provide the fora at which information can be put across. Departments and State bodies, such as the IDA, CTT and SFADCo, will provide speakers and information where possible, and members of the Government will be very active in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, the primary emphasis will be on the delivery of necessary information and stimuli to specific sectors, rather than more general publicity. The Government hope that this campaign, and debates such as that in the Seanad today, will ensure that Irish firms take early steps to inform themselves on the implications of 1992 and take measures to get the maximum benefit.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the message to send out <Col N="1590" /> concerning the internal market is one of careful and realistic assessment, but also one of hope and optimism.  The Government are playing their part to ensure that Irish business will be operating in the best possible conditions by 1992, and I see no reason to doubt that Irish industry is alert to the challenge, and will ready itself to reap the undoubted potential benefits of the internal market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for what has been a very helpful full account of the current state of play and views of the Government on our approach to 1992. There was much interesting detail and new material in what the Minister had to say.</P>
      <P>Obviously the approach to the completion of the internal market has implications which are potentially enormous for this country.  If even half of the new jobs which are estimated in the report materialise, the impact of this will be enormous, as will be the impact of the many other benefits, the dangers to this country and to the different sectors will also be enormous.</P>
      <P>The Minister got to the nub of the problem in debating the Cecchini Report when he highlighted the deficiancies in the report from this country's point of view.  The report does not analyse the regional distribution of gains and losses. The analysis in the report does not embrace all the member states.  This is one of the major drawbacks.  It is what makes this report, to some extent, a flawed report, and certainly a report which will need to be followed up by a great deal of further research and study within this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report does not tell us what the effects, positive and negative, of the completion of the internal market will be.  No quantative analysis is undertaken of the distribution of the likely effects.  As the Minister said, while the report powerfully supports the asusmption that the Community as a whole will benefit from the internal market, it does not help us to assess in any detail the likely effects upon <Col N="1591" /> the specific member states.  It is our job in this House, as part of a national parliament, to be in fact more concerned with the effects of the completion of the internal market on this member state than will be the effects on Europe as a whole.  It is precisely here that the report falls down.  We are one of the less prosperous regions of the Community.  The remedying of this defect is something upon which we cannot depend on the European Community as a whole to make good.  This is something which we, on our own behalf, must tackle straight away.</P>
    <P>I have already seen a number of academic studies on the different effects and on the impact which different changes in the completion of the internal market will have on this country.  I would like to see, if possible, some sort of task force set in place, made up of people from Government Departments, academics, people from consultancy firms &mdash; who now seem to have a very fashionable entrée although not a very welcome one, into Government thinking on economic matters &mdash; and, indeed, for the various interest groups.  We are concerned with getting the fullest possible information on the implications and consequences for this country of the completion of the internal market.  I hope the Government give that the priority which the Minister seemed to indicate in his speech.</P>
    <P>Before looking at the Cecchini Report as such I would like to say a few words about one aspect of the approach to 1992 which is causing me a great deal of concern, that is, the absence of any common educational policy.  I believe that a move towards a common educational policy would enormously benefit this country. At the moment we have some of the best qualified young graduates in Europe.  We see coming out of our schools today the products of a very talented generation of young people.  It is very clear from the demand for our graduates and from their performance outside this country that this is recognised elsewhere.  I am told that at the moment in London, in the south east of England and in other parts <Col N="1592" /> of Britain Irish graduates are, after Oxford and Cambridge graduates, the most sought after in many sectors of the labour force.  Frequently, they are ahead of all others, including those from Oxford and Cambridge.  Some of our graduates are also very much in demand by some of the major international firms based in Germany and Holland and France, to a lesser extent.</P>
    <P>More and more we can see that the other countries of Europe are looking to this country to supply their needs of very highly qualified personnel.  Each year the big international companies are trawling around in our third level institutes for students who may be only in their second or third year of a three, four or five year course.  Our graduates are being snapped up.  In many cases they are lost forever to the country.  Obviously, we must have very mixed views about this.  First of all, it is a great compliment to Irish education, to the quality of our young people and to the quality of our educational system that there is such demand for these people.  This is a new development. It certainly makes a reality of the idea of free movement of labour within the Community and of greater mobility and greater opportunities for people within the Community.</P>
    <P>I suppose we can say that if we cannot provide jobs for these young people here, then at least it is comforting that they are getting high quality jobs in other countries within the European Community.  It does also raise a very important question of policy.  It means that in effect we, as a less prosperous country are subsidising the educational needs of other countries in the Community.  We are financing the needs of the multinational companies and we are making up for deficiencies in the provision of graduates to other countries. Part of the reason for this, of course, is the change in demographic pattern. Britain, Germany, France and Holland all find themselves in a situation where, because of falling birthrate, there are fewer graduates coming out of the universities each year to fill demands made by industry and financial concerns.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves subsidising the <Col N="1593" /> educational needs of other richer states. It is only fair to ask at this stage if there should not be some recognition of this and some return to our educational system on the basis of what is happening. It will only happen if we have some structured, common educational policy.  I would like to see much more attention being paid to this problem.  It is one which is going to cause great problems to Irish industry itself in the coming years.  We are going to have difficulty in finding a sufficient number of the right people to make the financial services sector operate as quickly as people would hope.  The draw from Britain for people who are qualified in these areas is very great at the present time for various reasons &mdash; partly restrictive practices and partly the way in which we organise our third level education.  We are not producing enough relevant graduates.  This is a problem which is recognised by the financial services industry itself.  A major study has been undertaken, the results of which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons I would like, in the context of 1992, to see more attention being paid to the implications of what is happening and what is going to cause very great problems for us.  I was interested to hear the Minister outline the plans for a greater campaign to bring home to people the implications of the completion of the internal market.  I am glad to see that there is a top level committee in place.  I am glad to see that it is meeting on a regular basis.  I am glad to see also that the various sectoral groups will be included in this.  Certainly, a short six month campaign, such as a blitz campaign in 1990-91, will not be enough. There was need to move months ago but what is happening now is welcome.  What we need in all of this is a concerted national campaign with a strong emphasis on information geared to the understanding of ordinary people.  The European Community is still for many people a remote concept, something vaguely hostile and threatening.  It is certainly not something with which people easily identify.  It is an institution of unnecessary complications and difficulty and often <Col N="1594" /> obscure language.  There is a need in all of this to bring the European Community itself and its workings closer to people and to explain in straightforward language just what is happening with the completion of the internal market and what the implications of all of this will be.  There is, without any doubt, the absence of any sense of a European awareness in this country.  It may well be that Europe has appeared to be élitist.  It may have much to do with the absence of any course of European studies in our schools.  It may have something to do with the way in which we downgrade the teaching of European languages at first, second and, indeed, third level in our schools.</P>
    <P>There is need to raise the level of awareness.  It is very important that we approach this with a great sense of realism.  Any attempt to turn this into a pro-European movement, or any attempt not to spell out clearly and truthfully the implications of what is involved, will backfire very badly.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent we have fooled ourselves about the impact of European membership on this country over the past nine or ten years.  We have persuaded ourselves that the benefits have been greater than they are.  We have persuaded ourselves that the benefits have been properly directed while, in fact, the opposite has often been the case.  There is no great evidence to show that we have used our membership as well as we should have.  There is no great evidence that we were as well prepared for membership as we should have been, or that our civil service, politicians, industrialists and trade unions were as well prepared for the changes as we might have had a right to expect.</P>
    <P>I hope that the forthcoming election to the European Parliament next year will give us an opportunity to debate once again many of these issues.  Our place in Europe can once again be put under scrutiny in a realistic way.  We can benefit from some of our earlier mistakes.  There is no evidence that we have used our membership as well as we should have or that even yet we have any clear sense <Col N="1595" /> of purpose in regard to the European Community.  This operates at all levels. We have missed many opportunities in foreign policy.  We are missing an opportunity at the moment in the area of development aid.  We are missing opportunities also in terms of redevelopment of the regional and structural funds.  We must as a country define our own priorities. We must decide what we can give to Europe and what we want from Europe. We must choose an explicit development path if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, are very clear on where our priorities must be within the developing Community.  We must tackle, first of all, a number of major problems which beset us as a country.  The first of these is the problem posed to us by virtue of the fact that we are an island behind an island.  This problem is posed to us by our remoteness from the main markets of the Community.  If our truckers have to do two journeys right down through Europe, if they have got to go first of all from Dublin, drive right through Britain to cross over for the long sea journey to France or some of the other ports, this obviously imposes greater cost strictures on us than on any of the other countries. We have, as a priority, to push as vigorously as we can to ensure that air, sea, telephone and postal costs between here and Europe are brought down as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In asking for this we are not asking for any change in the laws of nature.  We are not asking for things which cannot be done by concerted action of Governments at national and international level.  There are far too many unjustified restrictions operating at present.  At long last the Commission is taking a lead in trying to break some of the cartels and some of these restrictions.  We have seen a very welcome move in this country over the past year or two to bring down the cost of air, sea and road travel.  In almost all cases it has to be said that this has been the result not so much of Government policy as of vigorous competition from new companies coming in and putting the pressure on the established companies &mdash;<Col N="1596" /> usually State companies &mdash; to open up the market and to engage in real competition.</P>
    <P>Air service costs in Europe are still significantly higher than in the US.  Air costs are higher and sea transport costs are higher than in other comparable areas.  That is the first task that has to be undertaken.  That relates to the whole question of our access.  If we cannot get our goods onto the European mainland at the cheapest possible price in the best possible condition and in the fastest way possible, a huge burden is imposed on us from the very beginning.  That awareness has to be brought home to us.  No vested interest, State body or group can stand in the way of that objective.  If we do not start from that point, we are not even at the races.</P>
    <P>All of this applies as well to the cost of telephone, telex, fax, and so on.  We are delighted with the tremendous improvement in recent years in the telephone service and with the direct access to almost all parts of Europe through direct phoning.  We are pleased with the great improvement in telexes, fax, and so on. Once again we are into the cost factor. If An Bord Telecom or An Post are not able to react to the challenge, very serious steps must be taken.  There is no substantial evidence to date of any great new spirit in Bord Telecom or in An Post. There is no evidence that many of the problems, such as the lethargic approach and the absence of any innovatory policy which characterised the operations of these bodies in the past, have been overcome. With the advent of the completion of the internal market it is important that An Post and An Bord Telecom should be made aware that they have not been as effective as they might have been. They are not showing the sort of determination that might be expected of them. They cannot be allowed to place extra costs on Irish industry which make it impossible for us to compete effectively on the European mainland.  As a consequence extra jobs in this country are not available.</P>
    <P>In terms of competition, Ireland starts the race with some very serious disadvantages. <Col N="1597" /> The problem of access has been mentioned.  It is a vital one.  We will only win out in the battle for the markets of Europe if we are more competitive. We start with a variety to disadvantages, largely because of our geographical location.  In some cases we have created problems ourselves.  We will only win if we are more competitive and if we are leaner, hungrier, sharper and fitter than our opponents.  That is why it is so important that we do not pat ourselves on the back today and say that, apart from Britain and Germany, we are ahead of the other countries in preparing for the internal market.  That is the way it should be.  We should be ahead of all the other countries in our preparations.  There should be a much greater degree of common awareness of what is involved. It is we who are starting from behind.  It is we who have the major disadvantages going into this race.</P>
    <P>We must look hard at restrictive practices in this country, as my colleague Deputy John Bruton said last week.  If this means restrictions on numbers entering a profession, if it means that scales of fees are being held unrealistically high in some of the sheltered professions, that problem must be tackled.  If we are having problems in providing the right type of people, the right type of graduates, the right type of highly-trained people from our second and third level institutions, priority must be given to all these areas.</P>
    <P>A third problem we have is the absence among very many of our people of any strong sense of being part of the Community. I mentioned earlier the absence of European studies at second level, primary level and many areas of third level. I believe it is vitally important that, just as we expect people going through our schools to know about our Constitution, how our democratic system works, our electoral system and about local government, our people should know about the existence of the European Community, why we have chosen to a a member of it, how it operates, what the obligations are and what the benefits to us are.</P>
    <P>Unless we can create among people at <Col N="1598" /> an early stage some sense of idealism about Europe, the purpose of the EC and the benefits of Europe, we are not going to grab their attention as they grow older. I would like to see real attention given to some core group of studies labelled &ldquo;European Studies&rdquo; and giving the subject an important place in the curriculum at all levels.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that many of our engineers and accountants who are highly qualified graduates do not have any real sense about how the European Community works or of the issues I raised earlier.  Side-by-side with that goes the scandalous way in which we have approached the teaching of European languages in our schools over the years. If people do not feel comfortable with languages &mdash; German, French or Italian &mdash; they are likely to be inhibited in doing business.  They are likely to seek other markets where English is the dominant language.  People do not like to feel inadequate. We have probably been the worst performers in terms of language of any of the EC countries, with the exception of Britain.</P>
    <P>Figures given here show us that only 3.5 per cent of students doing the leaving certificate achieved grade D or higher in German; only 1.8 per cent achieved that grade in Spanish; only one-fifth of our secondary schools offer German as a subject; only one-tenth offer Spanish and one-fiftieth offer Italian.  We have concentrated on two very fine languages &mdash; the Irish language and the French language. However, the time has come to shift the emphasis away from French to German and Spanish and to have a reappraisal of our attitude to Irish and of the place of Irish in our curriculum.  We must ask whether the over-emphasis on Irish inhibits the teaching of other European languages.  We must ask ourselves whether the policies to date towards the teaching of Irish have been successful? Are they well regarded by the people?  Is there a better way of teaching Irish?  Is there a better way of offering inducements so that people will want to study Irish rather than having it as a compulsory <Col N="1599" /> subject for so many different outlets as it is at the present time?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the professional groups concerned with the teaching of Italian, Spanish, French and German are seriously concerned and anxious to be involved in seeking to remedy this deficiency.  That can only happen if there is a political lead on this and if the goodwill of these people is channelled in a positive way.  This may mean approaching the subject in ways not thought of before.  It may mean sending people out for subsidised crash courses to the countries in question.  It may mean bringing in teachers on a short-term basis to this country from these countries.  It may mean spending more money hiring teachers at various levels, but it is something which we have to tackle as a priority.  If people are not comfortable with a language and if they do not feel reasonably relaxed, they are unlikely to feel confident doing business.  They are unlikely to be out there knocking on doors looking for new markets and seeking out new customers.  It is to our great disgrace that our educational system and Government policy over the years &mdash; this includes all parties &mdash; has not served us well.  It is time for a major change.</P>
    <P>In looking back on the past ten years or 14 years of membership, it is time we had a stronger sense of belief in ourselves. We need to build up a more robust sense of belief in ourselves and our capacity to fare in a competitive climate. There is no doubt that when we entered the European Community back in 1972 there was for many people a fear and a sense of inferiority as to how would we, who had been sheltered for so long behind protective tariff barriers, who had for generations exported some of our best people, who had not been innovative in any area of industry or agriculture, were going to fare with people from much more developed communities who had been mixing and intermingling with each other for generations.  We have seen that where Irish people are good, they are superb.  Irish people have proved themselves capable at every level in the Community, <Col N="1600" /> at the level of civil servants, industrialists and trade unionists.  All of those who have been involved at different levels in the Community, where they are good, are every bit as good and often better than their European counterparts. As I have said earlier, we have some of the brightest young people coming out of any set of schools or universities in Europe at present.  They are as well educated and well trained as anybody in any of the other countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>Where we have developed products with the emphasis on quality we have shown we can compete.  The message has not got home sufficiently to us that we are a young country and that if we have sufficient belief in ourselves and our own capacity, this can psychologically affect the way in which we perform in Europe. We need to get rid of the sense of dependency, of going to Europe with the begging bowl, that Europe was something to be milked, that there is some sort of dole, that we took what we could out of it but we did not think we could contribute very much because we did did not have a belief in ourselves.  Until we get that psychological change the dependency mentality is going to stay with us.</P>
    <P>There must be a new way of looking at EC funds.  We must not look at them as stop-gaps, hand-outs or as handy ways of solving problems whose roots go far deeper than the stop-gap can ever provide for.  We must be realistic.  We must ask ourselves with some courage if the use of the funds which are being given to us is in our best interests.  If we look at our food industry in the ten to 12 years since our accession to the Community, our farmers never had it so good.  Our farmers were never more prosperous.  A great number of them believed the bonanza would go on forever.  They simply reared more cattle and produced more milk and that was it.  There was very little spin-off to the Community.  Many of the farmers quickly discovered that the bonanza could not last and many of them ended up in debt.  Either they were badly advised or they were greedy, but many of them ended up with enormous debts, some of which are still crippling them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> We must ask ourselves, did our food industry develop during those ten years? Did we use the funds during those ten years to develop new processes?  All we can think of is Bailey's Irish Cream.  Can we think of any significant new Irish cheese that has been developed during those ten years?  Can we think of any new meat products which we could sell on the European market?.  We cannot.  Today we are running fast to try to catch up with the failure to use the funds properly during those ten or 12 years.  We were greedy and shortsighted, and we are paying the price.  We do not yet have the products which our natural resources would warrant and which would give us a real niche in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that over the coming years if we can establish the niche for Irish agricultural products in the Community it will happen in the quality area. We are still the most uncontaminated country in Europe.  We are still the country least likely to be affected by nuclear fall-out.  If we can trade upon the image of this country as a country which produces pure quality and good quality foods, we have a real niche.  By the same token the damage inflicted on this country by Sellafield is something which could do our image in Europe enormous harm.  If it is seen that there is contamination from the disposal of nuclear waste from Sellafield, it will have enormous deleterious consequences for our image abroad and, most important, for the whole concept of pure and quality food products which should be at the core of our agricultural success.  It is not a problem of this Government or the last Government.  It is a problem of the Irish people, of this country.  There is no issue on which there is a greater degree of unity in this country than on the undesirability of Sellafield and on the need for us to in some way see that it is closed down.</P>
    <P>When we ask ourselves about the use of funds, we have some very serious problems to face up to.  Nobody would argue that the use of funds through AnCO over the past number of years has been planned, well-organised and beneficial.  We have all seen European funds go into <Col N="1602" /> courses for which there were no jobs in the end, in which the training was at best questionable.  These funds were understandable sops.  They were there to help take young people off the unemployment market.  They were there in the hope of helping with their training, but nobody would argue that we thought about it properly, that we asked if this was the best way of spending that money to help these same young people and to help the country.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly a lot of the resources that came to this country over the earlier years of membership have gone down the drain, sometimes in a real sense through the over-provision of milk, and so forth, where we did not think through what we wanted to do.  I hope the degree of national consensus which exists on the debt at present can also extend over to the way in which we look at the funds coming from Europe and that we are prepared to ask the hard questions even when the asking of these questions will offend important interest groups at present.</P>
    <P>To sum up the effects for us of the completion of the internal market, there are huge dangers.  Many Irish companies could lose out to foreign competition in 1992 if major changes are not made in our industrial policy here.  I come back again to the central point, as I see it, in the Minister's contribution here today, that is, unless we as a country can find out in far greater detail, and very soon, just what these implications are, to a great extent there is not an awful lot of point in having a debate of this kind and going into the whole exercise.  I know the Minister accepts that just as as much as I do.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the danger that, if we do not increase the level of awareness, no matter what the Government do, no matter what interest groups do, it will have very little effect.  Thirdly, there is at present here a strong sense of fear among many Irish business people, a negative sense about 1992.  That has to be converted into a sense of positive opportunity. There is also a great need between <Col N="1603" /> now and 1992 to be aware that one particularly vulnerable sector of our economy, capital intensive, labour intensive industries, and those in the food sector, which account for over 60 per cent of our exports, are likely to be extremely vulnerable to foreign competition unless major changes are made and major developments are put in place between now and 1992.</P>
    <P>We will have to tackle the whole question of achieving a cost advantage, given many of the drawbacks I mentioned earlier such as geographical drawbacks. How do we achieve cost effectiveness and a cost advantage over our neighbours between now and then?  It will be important that our industry qualifies on quality over the coming few years.  We need to build up a pool of specialised skilled labour.  We need to develop our technological resources and we need to face up to the very real problem I referred to at the beginning, the likelihood of a major drain of our best graduates, best qualified people from third level education over the coming years, because, there is no doubt about it, there is a huge demand for them outside this country. Industries in Britain and Germany will pay top prices for them and we may well find ourselves training people to the highest levels in a very expensive way and not having them here to be of service to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>We need to look at our use of the £200 million from the European Social Fund to see if we are using it in the proper way towards the funding of skilled labour, and we are not at present.  The current policy of offering low corporation tax in order to attract international companies to this country is, I believe, seriously flawed.  It is a wrong policy and certainly it is having an inhibiting affect on many Irish companies. It offers an unfair advantage without real commitment and inhibits many of our local companies.  We must also look very hard at the way in which we bring our indirect taxes into line with the European Community.  Otherwise we will be stuck with the cost of maintaining frontiers after 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> I would like to bring the Minister back to one point he made in his speech, the promise that the Government will work with small industries throughout the country to ensure that they are kept fully informed and are shown how to go about fully preparing themselves for the completion of the internal market.  I hope this is more than an aspiration.  I would like to see the details of how this will be done.  I would like to see how it will be structured.  I would like to see it being monitored.  I do not want it to be a case of fellows in shiny suits, collars and ties from Dublin going around in big cars from Dublin, staying for a few hours, patronising the small local industries and then going away.  This has to be an effective programme.  One of the most important parts of our preparation for 1992 is that our industries are helped in the proper way.  I agree with the Minister that it is their primary concern first and last but, in between, if there is to be Government help, let it be effective.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution. It was a very helpful one and I hope that the major deficiency in the Cecchini report, its failure to estimate the impact on this country of the completion of the internal market, is taken on board by Government as an absolutely urgent priority and that we can begin to see a stream of studies on this in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning I would like to thank the Minister for coming here today and thank him also for his very informative address and for outlining what the Government are doing in relation to the completion of the internal market.  I would also like to thank the Leader of the House, and indeed the Government, for allowing the Seanad to debate this issue today, to have a discussion on the Cecchini Report and on the completion of the internal European market.  A major discussion took place last week in the Dáil on the Cecchini Report.  It is important now that the Seanad should also have a major discussion on it.  This demonstrates very clearly that the Government are very <Col N="1605" /> concerned and committed to ensure that the internal market is completed in 1992. The fact that two major debates have taken place in the Oireachtas in the past week clearly demonstrates that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Government last week in the Dáil and also by the Minister here today in relation to the internal market and in particular their commitment to launch a campaign very shortly to alert all economic interests to the implications of the 1992 market beginning with a major conference for business leaders and other leaders in the Community.  The Minister outlined several things which will be happening over the next few months in order to heighten public awareness on this issue.  I am delighted also that the Government have set up a special committee of Ministers and departmental secretaries to examine this whole issue and to ensure that we are fully prepared for the completion of the internal market.  I very much welcome the publication of this document.  It is indeed a very lengthy document.  However, it will act as a stimulus for us all to prepare for the completion of the internal market and we should all very much welcome the publication of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is fully committed to the EC, to the advancement of the EC and to the process of integration.  This process of intergration has speeded up in the past couple of months and will proceed speedily over the next few years.  I am confident that this process of integration in relation to Europe has got the support of the vast majority of the Irish people.  This was demonstrated clearly by the result of the referendum last year and also by the result of the initial referendum which brought us into the EC.  Our public awareness of Europe and the EC is developing and the whole process of EC integration is now apparent to the general public.  Our commitment to Europe is increasing and we are much more aware of what Europe is all about and of what our role is.  Our age-old inferiority complex as a nation is disappearing and we are now a truly independent, strong and confident nation and well able to take our <Col N="1606" /> place among the nations of the world and the nations in Europe.  We have nothing to fear from this process of integration in Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the Government are strongly committed to the completion of the internal market and recognise that this is the only way forward for us as a nation in the years ahead.  There are a number of advantages in the single European market, which will apply to Ireland in particular.  We are heavily dependent on Europe for exports.  A total of 73 per cent of our exports go to EC countries. By the completion of the single European market we will have full access to a gigantic market.  The completion of this market will result in the creation of the largest, wealthiest market in the world comprising 320 million people.  Another advantage to us of the single European market is that it will lower costs and production costs, particularly in relation to other non-European countries.  As Senator Manning mentioned, it will also increase our awareness of the importance of competition and of the need to strive towards efficiency and to be more competitive in our production techniques.</P>
    <P>The single European market will have other advantages for Ireland.  It will allow the free movement of goods, capital and labour within Europe and will allow Europe and Ireland, being a component of that, the same advantages now enjoyed by other industrial countries such as Japan and the United States.  This will be welcomed by industrialists when the elimination of barriers and so forth have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>As outlined by the Minister the completion of the market will also bring a number of advantages to the Community as a whole.  It is estimated that combined with a growth-orientated economic policy the implementation of the 1992 programme will result in an increased Community output of 7 per cent.  It is hoped it will create five million net jobs, that it will lower the price level by 6 per cent and improve the budget balance of member states.  These are all to be welcomed and to be striven for.</P>
    <P>The process of integration presents a <Col N="1607" /> major challenge to this country and indeed to the EC.  By January 1988 the Commission had only produced two-thirds of the 300 proposals in the original White Paper dealing with this issue.  Of these the Council has only adopted 70. Much work remains to be done.  It is a challenge to the Community and to member states to agree on the remaining proposals at the Council of Ministers. Every member state must, from now on, treat the completion of the internal market as a matter of great urgency.  I know that Ireland in the Council of Ministers will not slow up the process.  While defending our interests our Ministers will strive towards the speedy implementation of these directives, which will be of benefit to us all.</P>
    <P>There is one major danger in relation to the completion of the internal market, that is that all wealth may in fact flow to the centre of Europe, to the detriment of those poor countries on the periphery. As the Minister mentioned, one of the major drawbacks in relation to the Cecchini Report is the fact that no consideration is given to the issue of distribution of resources between member states and also within member states.  It is generally accepted that there will be aggregate net gains in relation to wealth as a result of the completion of the internal market but there is no mention whatever in the report of where these gains will end up, for example, to what countries they will flow.  This is a serious question and must be seriously addressed by the Government over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Ireland at the periphery of Europe has a number of disadvantages.  It is quite conceivable that all wealth will flow to the centre unless the Government are extremely diligent in the negotiations over the next few years.  The Government must ensure that Community policies promote convergence rather than divergence within the EC.  This will present a major challenge to them.  This challenge in relation to the issue of distribution represents the greatest threat to the whole success of the development of the <Col N="1608" /> EC as a whole, in that every country must be seen to be prospering from the completion of the internal market.  If some countries are left behind, then the whole process of integration will be seen to have been a failure to the total disadvantage of member states at the periphery.</P>
    <P>Already we have had the commitment for the doubling of the structural funds by 1992.  This is to be welcomed. However, on a number of specific issues, particularly in relation to tax harmonisation, further concessions will have to be brought about for this country in order to ensure that we can share in the aggregate net gains brought about by the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, the harmonisation of taxes will present a major challenge to us.  The exact nature of this challenge is not as yet clear.  However, it would seem that the proposals envisaged in the programme for 1992 will have serious implications for our public finances. There is no suggestion that we should not participate in this process but we will have to be very diligent in order to ensure that we are not placed under a severe disadvantage in relation to our taxation régime.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the 1992 programme will result in a big decrease of several hundred millions in revenue due, in particular, to the harmonisation of excise duties measures.  Our provision in relation to VAT at the point of entry will also have to be abolished.  There is a strong possibility that VAT on children's clothing and footwear, books and passenger transport and many other items, will be introduced.  How will we tackle this situation?  Will we have massive increases in PAYE or will we have massive reductions in public expenditure in order to meet the huge decrease in revenue accruing to the Government?</P>
    <P>These are issues which will now have to be seriously addressed over the next year or so.  It presents a great challenge to the Government in negotiating our position at the Council of Ministers.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, <Col N="1609" /> suggested recently in Europe that we do not have to fully accept the proposals in relation to taxation harmonisation. That is a good bargaining position to begin with.  He suggested that we will have to exmaine the possibility of getting exemptions in relation to some of the taxation measures.</P>
    <P>He suggested also that we will have to seek financial compensation for the revenue loss in this country.  This would be totally separate from the doubling of the structural funds already announced. This will be a major challenge for the Minister for Finance.  I am confident that he will represent our interests very well and ensure that we cannot be left in an intolerable position in relation to taxation. I appeal to him also to try to have specific items excluded from VAT particularly food, childrens' clothing and so on. I am sure that all these issues are now in the melting pot and they are not a <i>fait accompli</i> that we cannot make representations on.</P>
    <P>As I said already, I welcome the doubling of the Structural Funds already announced.  As the Minister for Finance has already said this may not be enough to compensate us for our loss.  However, having said that, there is no question but that we will play our full role and should play our full role in the completion of the internal market and the items involved in that.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had a mixed economy since the foundation of the State.  Indeed, the mixed economy structure is very suitable to our people and to our economic development.  As I said in the Seanad on previous occasions over the last few years we got the balance very wrong in relation to the mixed economy.  Over the last 15 months the country has been given a quick sharp does of free enterprise and competition in order to stimulate industry and to bring about economic development. The Government are to be congratulated on the measures they have taken over the last year in order to bring about increased competition, increased efficiency and a better economic climate.</P>
    <P>Competition is a major aspect of this single European market proposal and it <Col N="1610" /> is important that we realise that and that we will have to become more competitive. The completion of the internal market will ensure that we will have to address ourselves to that issue.  Senator Manning said we will have to get our costs under control, particularly in relation to air, sea, telephone, telex charges, postal costs and so on.  The Government are producing the right environment at the moment but we will have to seriously address that matter over the next few years and meet this challenge head on. We will have to become more competitive if we are not to be left behind in this process.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points I would like to make regarding this issue.  One of them has been mentioned already, that is the whole are of foreign languages. It has been suggested already that this country has an appalling record when it comes to foreign languages.  This will not be tolerable if we are to play our full role in Europe in the coming years.  Senator Manning suggested that maybe it would not be necessary to attach so much importance to the Irish language in our educational system but I would disagree with him there and suggest that any language, especially the Irish language, has not been taught very well in our schools and that once we master the techniques of learning a language and the importance of learning a language, we will realise it is as easy to learn one language as it is another.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if Irish is encouraged it will open up a whole new culture to many people and that culture will certainly enrich the European Community as a whole.  All languages have not been treated as importantly as they should be in our schools and this must be seriously addressed over the next few years.  We have adopted a lazy attitude in relation to languages when we consider that when most Irish people are considering emigration they go to the USA or Australia where they do not have to learn a foreign language.  This highlights clearly that we will have to become more fluent in European languages if we are to encourage our people to move about Europe in search of <Col N="1611" /> work and experience.  That is a major issue which must be addressed.  We will certainly be left behind if we cannot communicate with our partners in Europe in the language they are fluent in.</P>
    <P>This completion of the internal market presents a very important challenge to us.  A lot of work remains to be done over the next few years.  I am confident that the Government will ensure that Ireland's position will not be eroded in relation to a number of areas that I have mentioned already and that they will negotiate our position in a strong and determined fashion.  There is no doubt that everybody is behind them in ensuring that the 1992 programme is implemented to the benefit of all the people of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Minister for his contribution at the start.  I certainly found it very informative and very useful in trying to assess the matter.  I will not pretend for one second that I have read the Cecchini report.  Certainly all 6,000 pages over three volumes is a fairly daunting prospect. The report itself generates a fair level of excitement.  It also generates the kind of programmed responses which in a sense saddened me.  I want to deal with the comments of two of the previous speakers before I get into the report proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously I have a very strong vested interest in the whole education area.  It always saddens me at times like this to hear the discussion on the lack of European languages in schools and people's lack of facility in the use of foreign languages. I will even spell it out in more stark terms than anybody else.  Our worst export market in Europe is in Italy, the largest market there for us.  It is also the European language where we have fewest graduates or fewest qualified people.  That in itself tells a very sad story.  It means that we are not able to exploit the Italian market.  I have not got the figures here with me but in terms of the balance of trade with various European countries our balance of trade figures with Italy are the worst in Europe. <Col N="1612" /> One of the reasons they are so bad is the lack of facility in speaking the Italian language.  I could go beyond that and say the greatest potential expanding market in the world is China.  The most influential language at the moment, in terms of development in many areas of industry, particularly the motor industry, is Japanese.  The whole of South America is there to be explored, we need Spanish for all of it except Brazil where we need Portuguese but these languages are not being taught in our schools.</P>
    <P>I can develop this point much further and carry it to a much more logical conclusion but it bothers and annoys me that in these discussions people never ask the question, &ldquo;why&rdquo;.  The reason these languages are not available at the moment is that we are not investing in facilities for teaching them.  There is no commitment from the Government. There is no commitment from the Department of Education to teach these languages.  We are cutting back on education provisions.  Our students, our teachers, our educational service are trying to run an obstacle course in competition with sprinters running on a tartan track.</P>
    <P>If people stand up here and say that we need European and foreign languages, will they also stand up and say the Government must invest in providing facilities to teach them.  There would be no problem in dealing with the teachers, parents, the service, unions or anybody else.  I challenge the Government to see to improve the foreign language provision in Irish education.  They do not want to.  They are not prepared to invest in it.  We have stopped investing in that kind of development in education and we are the losers.  I believe that anybody who speaks and demands that should also he prepared to pay for it.  The quality of our graduates, students, and teachers is there.  We can deliver on this if somebody provides the training, the teachers, the finance and the investment.</P>
    <P>In dealing with that I want to come back to the report and what it intends to do.  First, its objective is basically to <Col N="1613" /> implement the Treaty of Rome for the free movement of goods, labour and capital between various European countries or markets.  That was the commitment in the Treaty of Rome.  We are looking at a situation at present approaching 1992 when we complete the internal market &mdash; in laypersons terms it means we create one market where there were 12 before.</P>
    <P>A major change has taken place in one year.  We discussed this issue when we discussed the Single European Act on 25 April last year.  A major change has taken place in the meantime.  We are an exporting country and speakers must have regard to this fact.  We export more than we import at present.  That has been the case for most of the past year and the trade figures for the past five to seven months reflect that.  It is important.  Being an exporting country we are less vulnerable to the detrimental effects of an open market.  We are less vulnerable because we are already out there in the 12 marketplaces of Europe and in marketplaces worldwide.  We are not selling our products because somebody in France, Russia, the USA, South America or somewhere else wants to keep jobs in Ireland.  We are selling products because they are competitive and of good quality.</P>
    <P>I am trying to recall from memory the first line of that infamous report in <i>The Economist</i> where it said, &ldquo;Take a small open, post-peasant economy and leave it vulnerable to the worst that the free international market can do it&rdquo;.  We have moved somewhat from that position even in terms of the trade figures.  We are less vulnerable to international competition than before.  We can now go to the international marketplace and we can sell our products.  We can tie up markets and we can compete with the best.  We can do this for many reasons.  We can do it because we have quality people running our industry, who know and can see where they are going.  I was very pleased last night to hear of an international company being set up in Los Angeles which is being run by Irish graduates but I ask why it is not being run here?</P>
    <P>The reason I became involved in the conversation is that I was talking to an <Col N="1614" /> industrialist and I was berating him for the lack of commitment of industrialists &mdash; particularly multinational and international industrialists &mdash; and I was basing that criticism on the recent figures on the investment in research and development in European countries.  We have a disastrous record.  We were very firmly last in the league in terms of the percentage of our national product which we invest in research and development.  The second last was Belgium and they invested twice as much as we did.  So long as that continues we are going down a cul-de-sac. Unless we research, develop, test and produce new commodities and new products we are not going to expand in the way we need to expand.</P>
    <P>On the completion of the internal market in 1992 it will be necessary to get rid of all the technical barriers, the fiscal barriers and the actual physical barriers between countries.  I will deal with those one by one.  In general terms the attractiveness of that from the point of view of the ordinary consumer is that it should lead to a price convergence of products across the different countries.  We will get a closer price level for the same product in different countries.  A Ford Escort in Dublin should be more or less the same price as a Ford Escort in Rome, with just the differences created by distance which will always add to the cost, if not to the value, of a product.  That kind of price convergence is to the benefit of the consumer and is, therefore, to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I have studied the various technical regulations which are a barrier to trade and movement between different countries and I came across the statistics that there are approximately 100,000 different regulations for trade within the European Community at present.  These would arise from health, safety and consumer legislation in the different countries and I am sure there would be other legislation as well.  Each country would have very specific health laws governing food products, very specific safety laws governing the factories where products are produced and would certainly have very different consumer legislation.  I <Col N="1615" /> worry about that area and I would like to see that problem addressed.</P>
    <P>I think we fall behind in those three areas.  I am not saying that in the sense of an inferiority complex.  I am saying it in the sense that we have not developed our legislation satisfactorily in the area of health, safety and consumer legislation, I am worried about the way this is being dealt with in Europe.  It will be dealt with through the principle of mutual international recognition for the internal laws, regulations and legislation in these areas in different countries.  That, in effect, means going for the lowest common denominator.  I do not like that.</P>
    <P>The only example I can think of at present is the row which took place about the importation of beer in Germany.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be aware, the German brewing laws are 800 or 900 years old and they do not make exceptions for anyone.  Three years ago one of the few beers that matched the purity regulations required by German legislation and which, therefore, could be imported into Germany was Guinness. They have very strict legislation.  I do not like talking about brands but it makes the example easier: for example, Budweiser which is brewed from a combination of rice and hops could not be imported into Germany two or three years ago and neither could the Irish red beers like Smithwicks and so on.  They did not match the requirements and the standard of the German beer legislation.  Some other countries took the German authorities to court and Germany lost; in other words, it is now an open market for the importation of beer.</P>
    <P>That might be a good thing or a bad thing.  It is a good thing in the sense that the biggest beer market in Europe has now been opened up to the rest of Europe.  On the other hand, the Germans could say that they have always insisted on a pure brew of beer and now they have been overtaken by European legislation. That is the only example I can give to prove what I said about the lowest common denominator.  I do not like that: it could be a very bad thing.  I want to <Col N="1616" /> hear how can we process some sort of pan-European legislation to cover these areas?</P>
    <P>Legislation governs all these areas.  It is something which must be of major interest to us and it is something to which we must address ourselves.  In putting together that kind of legislation, it must be with a view to achieving the highest standards rather than the lowest common standards.  Therefore, in any particular product range, we look at the requirments of the 12 different countries and an assessment should be made of the requirements.  It should then be assessed and extrapolated from the mass &mdash; or maybe the mess &mdash; of regulations in the 12 different countries, that they would distill from that the requirements that would then be implemented in pan-European legislation or whatever.  I would like to hear from the Minister how that could be implemented.</P>
    <P>In a glance through the paper this morning I noticed that last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce launched a new European standard.  I presume that is a new European technical standard.  Is that something that would replace something like the British standards or the Irish standards?  Is this something which will overtake those particular standards?  These are some of the technical regulations which will have to be looked at and which will have to be changed.  The present regulations will go but what will replace them?  That is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>You only have to drive to Belfast and see half a mile of trucks on each side of the Border waiting for Customs clearance to recognise the cost of keeping hundreds of drivers idle every day and the mass of paperwork that has to be gone through in order to get a product, truck or whatever through a frontier.  Let us examine some of the various problems that arise physically at the barrier point.  They are astonishing.  VAT has already been discussed and dealt with.  Various items attract different rates of VAT in different European countries.  Senator Haughey, with a side swipe at Fine Gael members on this side, brought us back to the tax on <Col N="1617" /> children's clothes, etc.  That is something people understand but there is a lot more to it.</P>
    <P>There are also different excise duties in different countries.  We have this great rip-off of the famous duty-free shops at airports and on planes and most people when returning from holidays buy some supposedly cheap duty-free goods in the plane which they could have bought cheaper in the local supermarket.  This is because of different excise rates in countries. At the frontier point those things have to be checked.</P>
    <P>Because of the complicated bilateral or international legislation, dealing with, for instance the Common Agricultural Policy, where various foods attract various subsidies, that has to be assessed at the frontier point as to whether that product being brought in is liable for a payment, that there is some compensation for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the different health and food standards and this brings me back again to the other matter.  Senator Manning earlier talked about this country having the reputation of being clean. That is a bit pie-in-the-sky.  I think we are a filthy country and our legislation on food products is not good enough.  I can immediately give examples of additives, colourants, etc. which are allowable in certain countries in Europe and are illegal in others.  There is quite specific legislation in France and Germany and now also in Britain about items which cannot be added to food products in those countries but which are still quite legal here. Last year I looked at some common everyday products such as coke or Lucozode and a quick check of the ingredients in Ireland as against the ingredients on the same can or bottle in Europe showed a marked difference.  If this continues we will become the dump of Europe.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring the area of food legislation forward.  I do not like referring to E numbers because they have become almost a cant word; some of the products coded by E numbers are absolutely harmless &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; and some of them are quite <Col N="1618" /> natural products.  It is just simply a European standard codifying system but some of the items with E numbers are dangerous and have been shown to lead to cancer and other things.  I am not scaremongering here but I am using it as an example.  One of the things as of now which has to be checked going through customs is whether food complies with the regulations of other countries.  I am afraid that we will fall down to the lowest common denominator again on that general area.  There should be Euro-legislation covering that area also.</P>
    <P>In terms of customs, travel and transport there are different and differing standards required for something like driving licences in different European countries.  The need to check the qualification of the driver, etc. will now go. The statistical analysis that has been necessary in terms of counting, measuring and keeping statistics on the importation or exportation of products will no longer be done at the frontier point.  It will be done in some other way and that also will make for ease of movement. Some countries still have trade quotas with each other where they agree to import a certain amount from country A provided country A buys a certain amount from them as well, so that A and B might have bilateral arrangements in the present European Community and those are checked at border frontiers. That is also something that will go in the future.</P>
    <P>All the paperwork associated with all those activities, the collection of VAT, excise duty, monetary compensation, health and food standards, transport and driving qualifications, statistical analysis and the trade quotas will vanish.  This will facilitate the easy export and the easy movement of goods from one country to another and, therefore, will also reduce the cost of the product because the paperwork adds to the cost.  The cost of drivers sitting around for perhaps a couple of hours at every frontier point can add significantly to the cost and price of a product.</P>
    <P>It has now been estimated &mdash; although I have no faith in this kind of estimation <Col N="1619" />&mdash; that getting rid of the technical regulations can lead to a reduction of up to 2 per cent in the cost of the product; in other words, trying to meet the requirements of the various technical regulations in different countries can add about 2 per cent to the cost of a product in simple terms.  Similarly, the cost of the paperwork involved in frontier and customs checks has added more than 1 per cent to the cost of a product.  Therefore, the easy interpretation is that the removal of all those technical blocks or barriers, frontiers and customs' delays should give a net reduction of 3 per cent in the prices of products moving from one country to another.  That is very significant.</P>
    <P>Those are only two of the areas affected.  It can be developed far more than that because we then look at the economies of scale that are possible.  We can now put into operation a production line which is producing a commodity which can be sold in all Twelve countries, whereas before this slight adjustment or changes in order to meet the different requirements in different countries had to be made.  Obviously, the economies of scale that can be achieved through that kind of production are very significant. In other words, we start the production line, run the products off and simply send them into the different countries.  There is also a saving there.  It is not possible to quantify that, but it can be done.  We can produce more and cheaper products and sell them in a much easier way.  This should lead to fairly significant price reductions.</P>
    <P>In order to make that possible and in order to make it work for us, we have to look at quite a number of issues.  One of those issues is that we must provide efficient, instantaneous low costs audio visual communication between countries. There has been massive development in the internal communications network in Ireland.  In particular, I am talking about, the development of the telephone network.  The development of our telephone lines has been very significant. The growth in the use of FAX <Col N="1620" /> and the growth in the various spin-offs of that communications industry are significant. We must develop them more and make them cheaper.  Our telephone costs are still too high and it has a bearing in market terms.</P>
    <P>We have really fallen down in the area of information technology.  I had reason recently to investigate what was available, in other words, what can I plug my computer through a phone modem into in terms of information?  We are behind in that area.  Only this week I attended a function organised by a group from Corcha Duibhne who put together a programme on access to computer and VDU screens which will give all the back up information necessary for the tourism industry in that area.  This is very important. We need more of that.  It should be possible now for me to press a button on my computer and find out what the technical requirements in Italy are for the importation of spaghetti into Italy.  That kind of information should be freely available at the touch of a button.  Information of the kind of markets that are available should be there.  We must develop that area.  I will not go any further into those two areas except to say that we must have efficient and instantaneous audio visual communication and information technology.</P>
    <P>We must also look at where we are going.  I am back to the education area again with a more neutral approach to it this time.  I am not clear about a number of points on the free movement of labour. What exactly does that mean?  I am qualified as a teacher.  Can I go tomorrow or in 1992 and teach in Italy?  Can I go and teach in Paris?  Can I go and teach in Germany?  I certainly know that a German teacher cannot come and teach here unless he or she has managed to acquire the required knowledge of Gaeilge.  The present regulations would not allow him or her to work here.</P>
    <P>What work has been done in terms of the international, mutual recognition of the qualifications of professions?  Can a vet move from Dublin to somewhere in Germany.  What are the problems?  What has been done?  It is not just enough to <Col N="1621" /> open the market.  There must also be a recognition of the qualifications of people in the different countries.  Can a teacher, a vet, a doctor an engineer move from one country to the other?  I know they can physically move, but will their qualifications be recognised?  Will the Irish qualifications be recognised in Italy?  Will the Irish nurse's qualifications be recognised in Spain?  I suspect that this background work has not been completed. I cannot find any evidence of it.  It is essential.  That is one area that must be given a huge amount of development.</P>
    <P>If we are looking at developing one of the largest markets in the world, the Twelve countries becoming one, we also need to invest in education to exploit that area.  There are obviously going to be major changes and developments.  If I want to sell a product and I know I can sell it in 12 different countries without any obstacle in my way, means that advertising and marketing strategies are going to be different.  This means that we must have very high level quality control.  Will the Minister say what he intends to do about that?  It is all very well to say we are going to have a major information programme about what the completed internal market means.  We can do that in a word.  We say to people: &ldquo;There are 12 countries, 12 markets there now.  After 1992 it will be one market. You can sell in Nice in the same way as you can sell in Naas, as long as you can get your product there.&rdquo;  People can understand that.  It is quite simple.  What people will want to know is how the quality of life, the standard of living of the ordinary worker or citizen in this country will be affected and how that will be reflected?</P>
    <P>We must look at the whole area of advertising, market survey and quality control.  I could go back to my old bugbear and say, how we have let ourselves down.  I was the only person in Ireland who was delighted three weeks ago with the ferry strike when they could not export fish.  We have now educated our people to know that exporting cattle on the hoof means loss of jobs.  They still do not see that exporting fish &ldquo;on the hoof&rdquo;<Col N="1622" /> so to speak, also means job losses.  We should not be exporting raw fresh fish; we should be processing it here.  We should have ten times the number of jobs there are at the moment.  I want someone to tell me why Denmark &mdash; a country whose economic policies we should aspire to &mdash; a country very like our own in terms of economic comparisons, processes 15 million pigs per year and we do one million. I am not worried about being swamped in pigs or pig excrement, or anything else, but I want us to be competing on equal terms.  We are not preparing for that.  The agricultural sector is letting us down terribly in this area.  They are just some of the things we should be examining. The other main area is the area of quality control.  I noticed different groups, companies and service industries trying to put together a standard for their service.  Listening to the radio about two months ago I heard the security business people, people who put in alarms and all that kind of stuff, who are very conscious of cowboys and fly-by-nights in their work, discussing ways of trying to put together a standard and a bonding system.  It is great to hear that, but there should be a greater State involvement in that area.  There should be demands in that area that our quality control should be the best in Europe.  Ireland should be seen as the clean food centre of Europe. We should be the granary of Europe. We will not be the granary because our climate does not allow us to be that. However we can certainly be the food supply centre of Europe in many other ways.  We should be able to supply the best meats, the best fish and the best processes. We should have a standard of quality control which would leave us above reproach.</P>
    <P>We have five years to do those kind of things and they do not need a huge amount of money.  They need decisions. That is why I am going to be the only person who is critical of what should really be welcomed.  The Minister referred to the setting up by the Taoiseach of a high level committee of departmental secretaries and Ministers.  It saddens me to hear that.  That is a good, <Col N="1623" /> positive development, but if that committee is to work the social partners must be represented there.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, perhaps I misunderstood the point, but not all wisdom is invested in the people who happen to be elected and become Ministers, etc.  We must take it somewhat beyond that.</P>
      <P>The growth I have just talked about has come mainly from a very passive macroeconomic policy of allowing the market find its own level, but this growth creates wealth.  There are poor, disadvantaged, underprivileged, unemployed people all over Europe.  I want to hear how they get their share out of all of this.  I thought Senator Haughey was going to talk about the redistribution of this wealth, but what he was really asking was which country would it finish up in.  It does not matter to me whether an Irish capitalist or a German capitalist finally grabs the money.  If it does not do any good for the poor, or for the unemployed, then we have lost out.  We would all agree on that point.</P>
      <P>The whole area of wealth redistribution must be looked at and that means the personal taxation policies in individual countries.  I would like to hear how we are going to approach that.  We have now reached a stage where the whole barrier to service transactions and fiscal transactions is being removed. Does this not mean that we will now have a European stock exchange in real terms? It will not be called that; it will still be called the London Exchange, the Dublin Exchange, the Belfast Exchange, Paris, Cologne or wherever it is.  But the fact is that now I cannot go and say I want to buy shares in that German company in Cologne, because of the financial control and exchange regulations which are there, and it would be illegal for me to do so except where I can get certain provisions from the Central Bank.  In general terms it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> In 1992 I can buy stocks, shares, bonds or whatever in any of the European markets. That means that the stockbroker in Dublin will have a screen for every European stock exchange which, in effect, means there is a pan-European stock exchange with floors in Dublin, London, Paris, Cologne or wherever. The next step from that is that one does not need the floors any more, and one just does the work from the screen.  How is this connected with the Custom House development?  We are coming into a situation very shortly where we are going to have an options market and a futures market and where we will be part of a Europe-wide financial unit.  The implications of that are incredible.  Some of the companies who are setting up in Ireland are companies who are operating in a way that would not be allowed in other countries.  I certainly know that one company which is unwelcome in the Chicago futures market, which is the biggest futures market in the world, are setting up in the Custom House development.  What controls will be there to make sure that people act honourably within the regulations?  I notice that one of the items on today's Order of Business, which can be discussed now as well, is the stock exchange regulations in different European countries.  I have not read that, but I would like to know what the implications of it are.</P>
    <P>These are just some thoughts on where we are going.  I tried to do a number of things here.  I have tried to look at the barriers that are there, and some of the results that will come from the taking down of these barriers.  I have also tried to raise, just touching on them, some of the areas we should develop right now. We must look after our own reputation. In many ways our reputation as a centre for quality products and also our reputation for looking after the poor, the disadvantaged and the underprivileged, has taken some hammering in the last couple of years.  We need to have a new look at that, and to make demands on Europe now at this stage.  We should say that we want to know how we are going to <Col N="1625" /> redistribute this wealth.  I also want to know about the constraints on the movement of stocks, shares, bonds etc.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the start of my contribution that we were now an exporting country.  As far as I recall, our exports in the last year went up by 13.7 per cent. That should have meant a huge boom time for this country.  It should have reflected itself in an improved quality and standard of living for the ordinary people, but it did not.  The reason was that the wealth was created through the movement of cheap imports into the industry in Ireland with very little added value, which were then exported, and all we got out of the companies involved was the wages of the workers here.  The profits that the company made were in fact exported.  It now becomes wide open to do that quite legally and quite effectively. We cannot legislate against it.  How will we deal with the problems that that can create?</P>
    <P>I spoke vehemently against the Single European Act last year and the view I held then, I still hold.  I am speaking now purely in terms of the market-place here, and I am not talking about the political implications of being part of a united Europe, although I worry about the fact that things like defensive products, for instance, can move freely between countries. It is appropriate that the Minister who has just joined us is here, as he will be quite interested in this general area. There are now very good working arrangements between customs people in different countries with regard to the import and export of drugs, etc.  With the open frontier policy, we need to have a look at that as well.  These are some of the areas of interest.  I could go on and go on, but I am beginning to lose my voice, so I will spare the House any more.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution and I am delighted we have had the opportunity to debate this.  I look forward to the developments and I look forward also to hearing an up-date on what is happening in order to prepare this country and our people for the completed internal market of 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if I had sufficient time to read this report, it would not be possible to do it justice in this House due to the time constraints and for other reasons.  It is a very important, positive report and I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on areas where we have a particular concern. I thank the Leader of the House for including this on the Order of Business and also six other very important reports from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  These are individually very important reports and perhaps it is unfortunate, that with such an extensive Order of Business, it is not possible to do justice to each and every one of them. Nevertheless, I will make a few comments on the areas that I feel apply particularly to me.</P>
      <P>This report is a positive one.  There is always a danger in extrapolation.  It more or less comes into the realm of fortune telling or looking into the future.  Nevertheless, having regard to historical fact and progress to date, I am sure that most of the projects and the improvements highlighted in the report will take place. I welcome the news that two million more people will be employed in the EC when the internal market is developed by 1992. I also welcome the fact that £200 billion will be added to the economy.  That is a considerable amount and apparently it will increase in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a very helpful and a very comprehensive introduction, which was a great help, at the start of this debate.  He said the Government should attempt to switch to growth-orientated policies because there will be greater capacity there.  The estimates are that the gain will be as high as 7 per cent of Community GDP and up to five million jobs.  That is important.  I would have liked if the Minister had developed this theme a little more.  Perhaps this is not the correct forum in which to do so, but in the months ahead I would like to see development of this area and this information given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that deflation of prices is expected, rather than inflation, which <Col N="1627" /> will please everybody.  It is a matter of history, that while we have benefited to a very considerable extent, in some areas we have suffered.  The Minister particularly picked out textiles and footwear.  I am aware of the problems in the footwear industry, because in Kells, over the years we had a very important footwear factory which gave considerable employment but because of the problems which arose through the importation of footwear that factory has closed.  It is only when one sees the problems of former employees and how their families suffer, that this problem comes into proper focus.  I am not sure if anything can be done about it.  In the context of the factories that have suffered in this respect, I am sure that very little can be done for them but it is a lesson and from that point of view we should be prepared for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the report suggests that larger firms will be better placed to capitalise on the changes to come.  In Ireland we have a predominance of small firms, so we must be concerned in this regard.  There is a lot to be said in favour of small firms.  There was a time when large profits were associated with large firms for many reasons. That is not the situation any longer.  In many cases, small firms can also amass considerable profits.  We have a policy, a correct policy, to encourage small firms. We have a big problem in this regard.  It is a matter for the Government to look after the interests of small firms, because, after all, this not only affects the proprietors and the people involved in these firms, it is something about which the country should be very concerned.</P>
    <P>There will be challenges after 1992 for Irish industry.  They will have to face exports from other countries and all the Community markets.  The Minister has emphasised that.  It is important to realise that we must give value and that our exports must be up to a very high standard in order to compete in the European markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us, and other members have commented on the fact, that non-community firms are anxious to <Col N="1628" /> set up subsidiaries in the Community. Ireland has benefited greatly in the past from this.  Senator O'Toole made some comments in this regard.  We should be glad that firms have come to this country and have given considerable employment. We have experience of this also in Kells, where the Zenith factory is giving considerable employment.  Nevertheless, it would be preferable if a native firm could do this work.  We have a problem with the expatriation of funds.  While incoming firms have expertise and finances that perhaps would pose a problem for native firms, nevertheless it should be possible for the Government to set up some kind of procedures where information, finance and help would be available to search for areas in the market where there would be a demand, and to encourage native firms or an amalgamation of native firms to invest.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the end it was the responsibility of every firm in the country to assess for themselves how 1992 will impact on their business and how best to prepare for it.  It may be the responsibility of the individual firm from the point of view of carrying on a viable business but it is in the interests of the country that each and every firm would be encouraged and helped to survive and to make a profit.</P>
    <P>It is more than the responsibility of the individual firm: it is the responsibility of the Government to help out in this regard.  I join with the other Members who have paid tribute to the Government for the advances they have made.  In recent times I have heard nothing but the highest praise for the Government.  I have heard no criticism whatever of their handling of the situation.  It is easy to ask, as did Senator Manning, if we benefited enough at the start, and if we benefited enough all along.  I do not know if that question can be answered properly.  At this stage, it is an academic matter, the important thing is how we proceed.  We could have done far more in one area, and that is with regard to our roads.  This report dwells largely on the removal of barriers, customs posts and so on.  I know from an individual who set up a transport <Col N="1629" /> firm that on the Continent this is a major problem, and people have to be prepared for it.  This man was not, and consequently pulled out of that business.  In Ireland we have a problem with regard to transport problems on our roads.  I have made a case many times in this House about the road I travel on when I come up to Dublin from Clonee.  If there is a tractor on the road it is impossible to pass and consequently there is a delay. This could be repeated for many areas throughout the country.  This in the long run increases costs.</P>
    <P>The begging bowl syndrome always comes up when a debate of this kind takes place.  It is hard to reconcile that kind of criticism with saying that at the start, we did not get enough.  In both instances we are looking for more as was Oliver but by and large it is agreed that we are only looking for what we deserve and for what we are entitled to, and we have plenty to give in return.</P>
    <P>With regard to languages, I agree there is a problem.  I was interested to hear Senator O'Toole refer to the Italian market, because in recent times my native town of Kells has twinned with Torres San Patrizio in Italy on the Adriatic coast, and consequently I have an interest in that area.  I am sure that twinning will be of benefit to both countries. Senator O'Toole referred to the language problem and felt that this is an investment matter and that, without investment, we cannot make any strides in this area.  I would agree that to some extent investment is important, but that is not the whole picture.  Even if we had invested more in this area in the past, more than money would be needed in order to make it a success.  There must be a demand for a language.  I have been involved with the VEC which ran day and evening courses which were very attractive and many of them fell through for want of support. The same holds true in this area.  To simply invest money in teaching languages will not be sufficient to ensure that it will be a success.</P>
    <P>I value very highly any contribution Senator Manning makes.  I am sure that his suggestions in relation to Irish from <Col N="1630" /> the intellectual point of view was thrown out for consideration.  I am opposed to any diminution of the drive to teach Irish and have it spoken.  We have lost ground up to now.  It was unfortunate that at the start we did not make an effort to invest in the Gaeltacht areas and keep people who spoke the language in those areas. From that point of view we have missed out, but we have learned or we should have learned.  In my county we have two areas where Irish is the spoken language &mdash; Baile Gib and Ráth Cairn.  It would be unfortunate for the country and for our culture if Irish were to suffer through the teaching of foreign languages and I hope this will not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning said that perhaps we were too greedy in the early years when we joined the EC.  He referred to farmers having suffered to a considerable extent, and asked whether they were too greedy. They were not too greedy, but certainly they suffered.  The unfortunate thing was that it was the enterprising farmers who suffered, those who invested and went out to work hard, and those who did not invest were better off in the long run.  We must remember that farmers at that time were badly advised by the banks and so on.  We should guard against this in the future and make sure that will not happen again.  I saw land sold at £4,200 an acre in my area and in a short period after the same land had to be sold back at less than half that price.  We must guard against that sort of thing in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a failure in the report to spell out its effect on the different regions.  We could have expected this from the report, but perhaps the Government might do it.  It is a matter for the Government to consider what effect the report will have on the country in a positive and negative sense.  In compiling this report, only seven countries were considered and Ireland was not one of these, but that is not of any great consequence. It is for the Government to consider the repercussions of what has been stated in the report and relate that to this country and take steps to deal with areas that may lose out.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a campaign will be <Col N="1631" /> launched shortly, to bring home to industrialists and to those who are involved in that area, the market that will be available and how they should prepare for it. Competition will be important and the cost of what is produced is an important feature.  This will be a matter both of the workers and employers.  Information technology in this day and age is a matter of prime importance.  We have lost out in different areas.  Some years back in the building area we had a centre where information was available to people who called in.  It must not have been a success from the point of view of finance as we no longer have that service.  In the building area we have no service of that kind. It is pie in the sky looking for computerised information with regard to 1992 when in important areas at home at present it is not possible or easy to get information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  It is comprehensive, and it would be an intrepid Member who would stand up and feel capable of delivering a worthwhile contribution on it.  Again I thank the Minister for his introduction which was very helpful in starting this debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other reports, it is unfortunate that there is a time constraint on the debate because they are all important in their own right.  For example, the report on the Community trade mark would take a day to debate if we were to do justice to it.  It seems there will be no research done to determine if the European Community trade mark is already in existence, and it will be the responsibility of the firm or the individual who is legally entitled to use the trade mark to follow up situations where the same trade mark may be used.  This will be unsatisfactory and perhaps in the long term some arrangement may be made to deal with that.  The report makes the suggestion, and indeed the plea, that the office which will deal with the Community trade mark should be set up in Dublin.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that the Community trade mark office will be set up in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> There are two other reports to which I would like to refer, one is report No. 2 which deals with 19 statutory instruments. In particular I would like to refer to Statutory Instrument No. 11 of 1986. This implements Council Directive 80/77/EEC which deals with the harmonisation of the national laws of the member states relating to the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters.  The Irish regulations provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person shall not market or exploit natural mineral waters unless they comply with the provisions of the Council Directive and these regulations. I agree with the criticism of the report that it may not be possible for the ordinary Irish citizen to be familiar with these regulations and also that it is not the responsibility of an Irish individual to be familiar with them; it is up to the Government to comply with the regulations. In that sense it does develop what has been discussed in this House before, that to incorporate the terms of the Directives two methods may be used, primary legislation or secondary legislation. Primary legislation would give Members of the Dáil and Seanad an opportunity to make amendments and recommendations and to discuss the matters in detail so that the public would become familiar with the legislation.  The other method is a regulation introduced by a Minister and I think this is a method that should be employed as seldom as possible.  All the reports we have dealt with have made the point that the Dáil and Seanad should get the opportunity to discuss legislation before it is incorporated into Irish law.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to report No. 1 which deals with the implementation of the Directive on product liability.  This is an important report, particularly in regard to what we are discussing and the completion of the internal market in four years time.  This introduces an additional legal redress to liability in tort and contract law.  Apparently an injured party can proceed with actions under any of these laws henceforward.  I understand also that this Directive will be implemented in the next month, so it is <Col N="1633" /> rather important.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Indeed, depending on the nature of the damage, there would be nothing to stop claims, in respect of the same offence, being made under each of the laws.</P>
    <P>That is difficult to understand.  I would like to have gone through this report in some detail because it is an important one, but other Members want to make their contributions and I do not want to delay the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the recommendations in the report.  Paragraph 34 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The alternative to enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas to implement the Directive is for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.  Oversight of such Regulations has been delegated by the Oireachtas to the Joint Committee which has been assigned the statutory power to recommend annulment of the Regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas, if it sees fit. The Joint Committee has, however, no statutory power to recommend amendment of the Regulations.</P>
    <P>This is unfortunate.  It is an important issue and perhaps it could be looked at in time.  The best method &mdash; and I think this is the view of the Joint Committee &mdash; is to introduce the legislation as a statute so that the Dáil and Seanad will have an opportunity to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 35 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Where EC Directives have been implemented in the past through Ministerial Regulations, the Joint Committee has been critical of the practice of incorporation of the terms of the Directives by reference as this procedure frequently employed technology not familiar in the Irish legislative context.  The Joint Committee feels that it would be singularly inappropriate on this occasion to resort to secondary legislation as the terms of the Directive need to be defined with <Col N="1634" /> precision and accuracy.  This is a legislative function appropriate to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Insurance Federation have stated that introducing the legislation by ministerial regulation means that there is less chance of divergence with regard to other European countries.  In other words, if it was introduced in the same way in all the countries there would be no legal problem, but if we introduced a separate statute perhaps we would in some way differ from our European colleagues. This matter has come up time after time in the reports of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation that we have dealt with in this House and perhaps it could be looked at in some depth in the near future so that we could come to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the reports and thank the Minister for his very comprehensive and helpful introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I should like to follow on from where the previous speaker left off.  The debate on these reports is of particular importance because of their impact on industrial and commercial life over the next number of years.  The research project undertaken on behalf of the Commission by Mr. Cecchini is important but the seven reports of the joint committee now before the House are also important.  I am very glad that we have the opportunity to discuss these reports because they represent a considerable amount of the work undertaken by the joint committee over the past few years.  I am glad that we have a number of them before us for discussion and I hope many Members will avail of this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzsimons's assessment of the two reports &mdash; Report No. 1 of the Fifth Joint Committee: The Implementation of the Directive on Product Liability; Report No. 2: 19 Statutory Instruments.  We are also discussing Report No. 3 of the Fifth Joint Committee: Council Directives Relating to Credit, Suretyship and Legal Expenses <Col N="1635" /> Insurance; Report No. 30 of the Fourth Joint Committee &mdash; which is quite an old report and has been on the stocks for a long time &mdash; Stock Exchange Regulations; Report No. 4 of the Fifth Joint Committee: Community Trade Mark; and Report No. 5 of the Fifth Joint Committee: Proposed Directive Relating to Mortgage Credit.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be excused if I spend some time on these reports because the joint committee and the sub-committee, so ably chaired by our colleague, Senator Robinson, put many hours of work and consideration into each and every one of those reports.  In addition the committee had the advantage of having submissions from all of the interested parties in the economic and professional spheres and also of people coming before the committee to give of their experience and assist the committee in the formation of these reports, which must be of tremendous benefit to people whose livelihood and professions are perhaps touched by the regulations to which these reports refer.</P>
    <P>The report on the Implementation of the Directive on Product Liability was prepared for the joint committee by the sub-committee on legal affairs and statutory instruments.  The joint committee are, indeed, indebted to their colleagues who worked on this.  In the course of the preparation of the report the sub-committee considered written and oral submissions from the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Insurance Federation.  The committee also considered views expressed by Mr. John G. Roche, director of the quality assurance research unit at University College, Galway.  I should like to take this opportunity to express our thanks for the amount of work and energy and thought each of the people involved put into that.</P>
    <P>The joint committee have followed the progress of the directive since its first publication in draft form in 1976 and are pleased that it is now about to be <Col N="1636" /> implemented into domestic law.  They see the Directive as the bench-mark in consumer protection policy.  They urge implementation through primary legislation where debates in the Dáil and the Seanad on the various stages of the enabling Bill would allow for the incorporation into Irish law of the terms of the Directive, precisely and accurately, in familiar Irish legislative terminology, and would appraise consumers of their newly acquired rights and encourage their exercise. The joint committee commend the representative bodies of industrialists for their endeavours to familiarise their members with the implications of the directive and endorse their conclusion that the best defence industry has against possible debilitating claims for compensation is proper quality control and adequate insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Report No. 2 on the 19 Statutory Instruments is a collection of technical documents.  They are of the utmost importance to the general public.  Instrument No. 1 deals with aliens regulations, S.I. No. 39 of 1985; Instrument No. 2 deals with the introduction of organisms harmful to plants and plant products, S.I. No. 88 of 1985; Instrument No. 3 deals with exemption from value-added tax on permanent importation of certain goods; Instrument No. 4 deals with the removal of restrictions on immature spirits; Instrument No. 5 deals with the labelling of textile products; Instrument No. 6 deals with aliens amendment regulations, S.I. No. 441 of 1985; Instrument no. 7 deals with the natural mineral waters regulations and was dealt with by my colleague Senator Fitzsimons; Instrument No. 8 deals with dangerous substances classification, packaging and labelling; Instrument No. 9 deals with the co-responsibility levy on cereals regulation; Instrument No. 10 deals with feeding stuffs, tolerance of undesirable substances; Instrument No. 11 deals with road transport, recording equipment regulations, which the haulage people are fairly familiar with; Instrument No. 12 deals with protein feeding stuffs; Instrument No. 13 deals with fruit and vegetables regulations; Instrument No. 14 <Col N="1637" /> deals with non-automatic weighing machines; Instrument No. 15 deals with dehydrated preserved milk; Instrument No. 16 deals with recognition of qualifications in veterinary medicine amendment regulations; Instrument No. 17 deals with scheduled inter-regional air services regulations; Instrument No. 18 deals with marketing standards for eggs; and Instrument No. 19 deals with cereal seed regulations.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put those on the record of the House because the list itself is an indication of the very wide-ranging technical work and thought put into the examination of this secondary legislation by the joint committee.  It is perhaps unfair that we should have seven of those regulations before the House at the one time. A few years ago we had a better system of debating regulations &mdash; one regulation was taken on a more formal basis every month.  It is unfair to our colleagues because they devoted so much time to this work.  The committee meet in public but they do not get the same prominence as others do.  It is important that the public should have an opportunity to know that those regulations exist and, by bringing them to their attention, they may be able to purchase copies of them from the Government Publications Sale Office.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Report No. 4 of the Fifth Committee which deals with the Community Trade Mark.  The Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing has been in the House several times and he is putting a lot of effort into encouraging Irish engineers and scientists to provide technology that will be of benefit right across the Community.  With regard to the draft regulation on the Community Trade Mark the committee received written submissions from the Patents Office, the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents and the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The committee gratefully acknowledges the cooperation received from those bodies. We also had the expert assistance of the distinguished former civil servant, Mr. John Hogan, in preparing this report. The subcommittee had consultations <Col N="1638" /> with the Controller of Patents, the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents and the CII and these consultations provided a valuable opportunity for discussion and examination of the many points raised in the written submissions.  When the committee were making their recommendations they said &mdash; and I think it is important to put this on the record of the House:</P>
    <P>The draft regulation on the Community Trade Mark makes no provision for an official search of its register by the Community Trade Marks Office for prior conflicting registrations, nor for subsequent examination. Owners of registered rights would, if this provision were implemented, be obliged to keep applications under constant surveillance &mdash; an exercise which would be costly and disproportionately so in the case of small and medium enterprises.  Given its structure, Irish industry would be put at an unfair disadvantage.  The Committee recommends, accordingly, that every effort be made to secure that, at least, a search be made and that the new application be notified to owners of appropriate prior registrations. In this connection the Committee notes that the early drafts of the regulation contains such provision.</P>
    <P>I am trying to highlight some of the points that have activated the minds of my colleagues on the joint committee.  I want to take this opportunity of complimenting them on the diligence they have shown in their work during the years.</P>
    <P>I suppose the main thrust of the debate this evening is on the research project which is referred to as the Cecchini report.  This has set many people thinking about the development of the Community and the status and the evolvement of the European Community after the Single European Act.  I hope that we in this country will be prepared to be at the forefront of developments there.</P>
    <P>I came to the House this afternoon prepared not to attack the Minister but to ask for a greater effort.  During the recent French general election I listened <Col N="1639" /> to the emphasis French politicians put on the benefits the French will receive on the completion of the internal market. Similarly, one can see from British television the work that has gone on there in trying to bring the British public up-to-date with the opportunities that will be available.  In line with that, the completion by 1992 of the Channel Tunnel will give the UK a further benefit as they will have closer access to the concentrated European market.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; I have no scientific base for making this observation &mdash; that after 1992 the original golden triangle is going to shine forth again.  It is up to us in the peripheral area to ensure that it does not attract in a magnetic fashion all the wealth of the Community.  It is because of that that the recent Council meeting agreed to greatly increase the funds available for distribution through the regional policy.  I do not think we will be justified in complaining, crying or, as some of my colleagues said, rattling the begging bowl if this happens to our detriment because we have four years to make preparations to ensure that we will be in a position to export high quality products to the market.</P>
    <P>This will not be just an opportunity for the brighter people on the Irish export scene.  As 1992 looms large, I believe there will be a new strategic approach to European marketing based on added-value, high quality management skills, and on speed of information transfer. That is the kind of thing that is urgently required here.  We should be equipped to get in with the best and we should be able to target concentrated areas in, say, Germany.  We should be able to zoom in on a city like Hamburg, which has a huge population, and be able to concentrate our selling in a wealthy area like that where the population and consumers appreciate high quality produce.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I sent to the people in Kilkenny Design Workshops a problem which is exercising the mind of my colleague, Senator Hogan &mdash; and asked them if they would consider setting up in Hamburg an Irish shopwindow, which <Col N="1640" /> would be both retail and wholesale.  I went as far as identifying a suitable store chain who were agreeable but they did not see that as being an option at that time.  We must still pursue the market. I believe we can produce high quality produce and we must trade on what we have.  We have a few years in which to do that.</P>
    <P>The Cecchini report has concentrated the minds of politicians and economists in Europe to a great extent.  I watched with great interest the developments in the European Parliament during the past number of months.  The European Parliament's Committee on Institutional Affairs have been active since early last year.  They appointed Sir Fred Catherwood as rapporteur and they have drawn up a very interesting report.  The findings in the committee they were passed by 18 in favour with one abstention, if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; represent the same kind of views we hold.  I think a Danish member pointed out during one of the debates that a truck with produce travelling from the north of Denmark to the toe of Italy averaged 12 miles per hour by virtue of the fact that it had to pass through 27 custom posts and had to prepare over 30 sets of documentation, whereas a similar consignment travelling State on the west coast averaged 72 miles per hour and absolutely no documentation was required.</P>
    <P>We must make up our minds that we are going to benefit from free and easy access to the markets of our choice in a huge market which is now the European Community.  I was very pleased the Minister gave the House details of the sub-committee the Government have set up, which is working on assisting the different sectors of Irish industry in this very valuable and natural interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the <Col N="1641" /> motion for the Adjournment I have notice from Senator Philip Hogan that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to recognise the important contribution that Kilkenny Design Workshop has made to industrial and economic development in Ireland, and ask the Minister to confirm his support for the continuation of the Kilkenny Design Workshop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister of State for joining us in the Seanad this evening to listen to what I have to say in relation to this very important motion.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops, as the Minister will be aware, were established in 1965 by the Government of Ireland to raise standards of design in industry and increase consumer awareness.  At that time there were few designers in the country and the quality of goods was poor.  Individual workshops, which included textiles, ceramics, woodware, goldsmithing, graphics and packaging were established in 1965, each with their own designers, technicians and trainees. Those workshops developed designs and prototypes in response to market intelligence and their production was licensed to industry.  Kilkenny Design Workshops co-ordinated and assisted the development of all those workshops.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny Design Workshops were charged with primary responsibility for the advancement of good design in industry and among consumers.  They were also responsible for advising the Minister for Industry and Commerce in matters relating to design and for conveying the design needs of industry to the relevant education authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic objectives of Kilkenny Design could be divided into three parts. First, it assisted manufacturers in auditing their design requirements and in planning their corporate design development. In other words, it gave design advice to manufacturing industry.  Second, it was to provide industry with practical design and technical support and services of a high international standard, and to <Col N="1642" /> extend designer training so that a wide base of talent was established in Ireland in design.  Third, it was to raise the level of design awareness in Ireland by exhibitions, awards, retailing and other means and thus to increase the demand and acceptance for good product design among traders and consumers.</P>
    <P>As a result of the work of Kilkenny Design over the years there has been a considerable improvement in design quality in Irish industry.  Independent private design consultancies and retail outlets have sprung up indirectly from the work of Kilkenny Design Workshops. Many small craft industries have mushroomed throughout the south-east region as a direct result of the presence of Kilkenny Design Workshops.  While the presence of so many craft industries is attributed to the work of Kilkenny Design Workshops the organisation has undergone reassessment over the past few years and is now performing a very important role in small indigenous and multinational industry, in assisting them to gain more market share by appropriate design and presentation of product.  In fact, 26 per cent of this total operation is concentrated on overseas business.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary for the Irish economy that Irish industry continues to have the back-up service of KDW to assist it through the difficult and challenging process of adapting to the EC internal market by 1992.  This should be under the direct responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce so that Ireland can take full advantage of the many new consumer opportunities that will be available to our country in a wider European market.  Certainly, when one considers a recent statement made by the Taoiseach, that he intends to appoint a Minister of State to co-ordinate an information and media campaign to highlight to business the important advantages that will accrue to Irish industry from participating fully in the internal market, it is appropriate that the readymade vehicle for industrial promotion and design through Kilkenny Design Workshops would provide it with an opportunity to adapt itself and to assist <Col N="1643" /> in that process of preparing Irish industry for that ominous year of 1992.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable at any time that the Government should reassess the role of the State in any area of activity.  I would not come here to the House this evening to suggest otherwise.  However, I appeal to the Minister to provide reasonable assurance to those small businesses which have been supplying goods to the Kilkenny Design Workshops of their continued ability to have access to the consumers.  That assurance is urgently being sought in view of recent, correctly stated media reports to the local provincial paper, <i>The Kilkenny People</i>, that the Government and the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops were seeking to sell off the entire organisation of KDW.  We are told that financial difficulties have arisen.  The Government should remember that the small suppliers I speak about are in no way responsible for any trading difficulties KDW may be experiencing.  I regret to say that the 1986 annual report of KDW was only available from 5 February 1988, which may be a contributory cause of the financial difficulties of KDW and of the fact that it took so long to have these difficulties detected.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops took on a new direction under the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in 1979 when it was charged, like other semi-State organisations, with becoming more financially independent and self-supporting by diversification into business which would generate a means of finance to assist the financing of the entire organisation.  That policy was put in train in 1979 and expanded on in 1986 by the Minister of the day, Deputy Bruton, who gave permission to the board of Kilkenny Design to borrow sufficient capital in order to get into the English market, in a premises based in New Bond Street in London.  That was not a satisfactory experience for Kilkenny Design Workshops.  History, and the recent past, have shown us that the losses incurred in that operation alone bear substantially on the financial difficulties <Col N="1644" /> the organisation are experiencing today.  It was an experiment which cost Kilkenny Design dearly, in so far as the entire organisation has been brought under scrutiny to such an extent that the very future of the organisation has been cast in doubt by the fact that the chief executive has not been reappointed. There is an acting chief executive there at present, but no chief executive was appointed recently.</P>
    <P>The statements issued by the local media were not commented on by chairman of the board of directors in Kilkenny Design.  This added fuel to the view that the rumours that were circulating about Kilkenny Design had some foundation. The suppliers and creditors of Kilkenny Design Workshops certainly found that the manner in which the news of financial difficulties was conveyed to those individuals left a very great cloud of secrecy and uncertainty in relation to their future employment, or the possibility of ever being paid for the goods they supplied as bona fide small business, for the benefit of the economy and themselves.  These goods were displayed by Kilkenny Design Workshops in their shop windows.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the importance of the craft industry that built up over the years, particularly in the earlier part of Kilkenny Design Workshops development. Many of those people who were taught the design and the presentation of products through the good offices of Kilkenny Design and worked as employees in Kilkenny Design have now set up on their own in many small businesses, providing employment for up to 500 people, because of the direct contribution of Kilkenny Design Workshops. Those people owe an enormous debt of gratitude for the assistance they received through the State organisation at that time.  Names like Mosses, Stoneware Jackson, Jerpoint Glass, Hiltze and Cushendale are now internationally known on the export market and are establishing and helping to establish Ireland as a very lucrative market for craft material and craft products to such an extent that we have developed a very <Col N="1645" /> reputable location through our craft fairs each year for products with the internationally recognised names which I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove this evening the cloud of uncertainty that has arisen in relation to Kilkenny Design Workshops.  I was glad to be part of a deputation who met the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, last week.  We impressed upon him the seriousness with which this situation was being viewed by the local authorities in Kilkenny.  It is essential, in the course of any review that will be taking place, that a shop window for the promotion of Irish goods should remain, so that Irish firms can continue to benefit from the display of Irish manufactured goods by Kilkenny Design Workshops.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that many overseas buyers have purchased goods directly from Irish manufacturers as a result of this display outlet.  The Government should also be aware that Kilkenny Design contributed enormously, directly and indirectly, to the economy of Kilkenny city and county.  The very name of the organisation alone has brought considerable stature to the city.  The location of the high quality design work makes a very important contribution to tourism.  The Minister of State will be very interested to know that Kilkenny Design by their location are a tremendous source of attraction for many visitors from abroad when they visit Kilkenny city.  I know the Minister of State will be more than pleased about that.  I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops are internationally recognised for high quality. The State cannot afford to throw away the investment it has already made in building up the very name of Kilkenny Design Workshops, which is synonymous with high quality Irish goods.  Tourism policy also emphasises the need to redirect State resources away from generalised promotion and towards the support for specific tourist products.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister of State to outline <Col N="1646" /> the decision of the Government regarding the future of Kilkenny Design Workshops, so that the worries of the outstanding creditors and suppliers can be allayed, as well as the worries of the employees, and that their future careers, whether it be in Kilkenny Design Workshops or otherwise, is brought into focus. I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the value to the economy of high quality, well-presented products and the contribution that Kilkenny Design can make to this process.  It is imperative that the State should continue to provide design advice and support services to Irish industry.  I am confident that, through the medium of Kilkenny Design Workshops, based in Kilkenny, we can meet that challenge with confidence.  I took forward very much to the Minister's reply.  I hope he will be able to assist in the information I am seeking by making a very frank and detailed statement in answer to some of my questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of the opportunity presented by Senator Hogan in his request for an adjournment debate on this matter.  I agree that the overall position with regard to Kilkenny Design Workshops needs to be clarified.  We are availing of the opportunity to do so now. I thank the Seanad for this opportunity.</P>
      <P>The importance of the contribution Kilkenny Design Workshops have made over the past 25 years to the development of good design practice in industry and, through that development, to industry itself is without question.  Established by CTT in 1963 to provide a design resource for the improvement of industrial design in Ireland, they were the first industrial design practice set up, even indirectly, by the Government concentrating on craft based industries.  At this point I should like to say that I, too, was a craftsman before I entered this profession and hence my interest in the crafts.  I am also aware of the importance of Kilkenny Design Workshops from the tourism aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The craft-based industries developed <Col N="1647" /> in non-craft industrial design in the Seventies. In 1974 the direct link with CTT was ended and Kilkenny Design Workshops came under the direct control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. During the early Seventies Kilkenny had also adopted their craft-based manufacturing activities but, as the growth of other Kilkenny Design Workshops activities continued to demand more space and resources, many of these small manufacturing activities were turned over to private enterprise.  By 1980 the transition was complete when Kilkenny Design Workshops design capabilities and work for the non-craft industries became the more dominant.  In more recent years the activities of Kilkenny Design Workshops have fallen into four main programmes. Their design services provide both consultancy assistance to business organisations in auditing their design requirements and planning corporate design development, as well as practical design and technical support services, to meet the specific needs of industry through their design development.  On-the-job training to recently qualified designers is provided at the Kilkenny workshop.  Their design promotion programme is aimed at promoting the concept of good design by way of seminars, exhibitions and awards such as the designer of the year awards.</P>
    <P>The KDW retail trading shops at Kilkenny, Dublin and London were conceived to be the show pieces of what is best in Irish design, while operating as commercial units.  The current benefits from KDW's efforts in the past years are self-evident.  Considerable progress has been achieved in improving the standard of design in Irish indigenous industry. A self-sufficient and independent private sector design industry has been established, owned and staffed in many instances by former employees and trainees of KDW.</P>
    <P>In recent times Kilkenny Design Workshops have been making more and more use of their specialist agencies by subcontracting design work out to other people.  Consumer awareness of good <Col N="1648" /> design is now much better developed while our crafts and craft-based industries have expanded considerably, with over 700 studio skilled workers producing a diverse range of well designed products for sale at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>During the 1970s Kilkenny Design Workshops was largely dependent on State assistance by way of annual grant-in-aid to support its activities, but in the early 1980s the move to achieve full commerciality by the early 1990s began.  To facilitate this, Kilkenny Design Workshops were provided with a proper capital structure in 1982.  The Kilkenny Design Workshops Act, passed by the Oireachtas in December 1982 set the authorised share capital of the company at £1 million, of which £500,000 was put into the company before the end of that year.  The company then achieved surpluses on its overall activities in 1983 and 1984, mainly due to the profits from its retail shops.</P>
    <P>In mid-1985 the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops presented a commercialisation programme to the Minister which was agreed at that time.  This programme envisaged that in the period 1984-1987 the design practice would be developed and become self-supporting, while growing profits from the design shops would facilitate new product development and the provision of market information to manufacturers.  The grant aid would be concentrated on fulfilling Kilkenny Design Workshops primary responsibility for design promotion.  In the period 1988-1990 it was envisaged that Kilkenny Design Workshops would move towards total commerciality, when profits on design retail activities would be sufficient to replace the grant-in-aid.  In line with that plan, further capital of £262,000 was put into the company by the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>For some time past Kilkenny Design Workshops had been considering opening a design shop in London.  After detailed research, including a consultancy study which indicated good commercial prospects, the decision of the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops to open the shop at London was taken in <Col N="1649" /> mid-1985.  Arrangements were finalised in May 1986 and the shop commenced business in November 1986.  In March 1987, a further capital injection of £250,000 was provided for the company. In January 1987 the then Government had approved the phasing out of Exchequer grant-in-aid to Kilkenny Design Workshops over three years, commencing in 1988.</P>
    <P>In fixing the Estimates for 1988 the Government decided to implement this in three stages.  The allocation for 1988 was fixed at £536,000, a reduction of £178,000 over that allocated for 1987. This decision reflected the realities of the budgetary situation facing the Government and the options available to it. There is simply no justification for the continuing high levels of State support for commercial activities and services which are becoming increasingly available from the private sector at no cost to the State.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the Kilkenny Design Workshops commercialisation plan has failed.  In 1986, despite the provision of a grant-in-aid of £740,000 the company had a deficit of £376,000, largely due to losses on retail trading in Ireland.  The final deficit in 1987 is expected to have even been larger, this being due primarily to the losses incurred in the London retail operation, an operation which I visited recently when I was in Ireland House.</P>
    <P>In response to these setbacks, since 1987 Kilkenny Design Workshops have had to implement staff rationalisation measures, the effect of which has been to reduce staff numbers in Ireland from 124 at the beginning of 1987 to a current level of about 85, of which only 13 are employed in the design services activity. This illustrates the extent to which the resources of Kilkenny Design Workshops have been diverted away from the core design activities to supporting the retail operations.</P>
    <P>A more serious outcome of the retail losses in the past two years has been the very serious financial situation that Kilkenny Design Workshops has now reached.  It was never the intention that the retail activities of Kilkenny Design <Col N="1650" /> Workshops should be subject to Government subsidy by way of grant-in-aid, nor could such a subsidy be justified.  In the light of the serious losses incurred on retail in the past two years and the difficult financial situation that was emerging, the Government asked the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops to prepare rationalisation proposals.  These proposals were recently considered by the Government.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House that Kilkenny Design Workshops will be making arrangements for the sale of its shops in Dublin and Kilkenny as going concerns.  The shops will be placed on the market shortly.</P>
    <P>I believe that this decision will allay any concerns which suppliers to Kilkenny Design Workshops have had in recent weeks about the future of the shops as outlets for their products.  The suppliers in many cases are small producers who are dependent on quality outlets for their goods.  The decision to sell the shops follows recommendations in the report by the board to the Government in relation to the position of the company, following its losses in its London shop.  The Government have decided that the design function, which was the original core business of Kilkenny Design Workshops, will continue. Suitable arrangements will be made in the course of the restructuring of Kilkenny Design Workshops.  The craft centre in Kilkenny city will be retained.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senators will understand from all I have said that the importance of the design function, which Kilkenny Design has performed so well over the years, will not be overlooked or lost. Equally, the special significance of the workshops in the life of Kilkenny city cannot be disregarded.  The Government will have particular regard to these aspects in considering the arrangements for the restructuring of the company.  Mr. Michael McNulty of Ernst and Whinney, Chartered Accountants, has been appointed as acting chief executive of the company to assist the board in carrying through its rationalisation.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the time available to me I have answered the queries posed by <Col N="1651" /> Senator Hogan and that some of the fears expressed by him are taken care of in what I have just said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister inform me if the finance owed by Kilkenny Design Workshops to creditors and to people who have been supplying material to them and the liabilities of Kilkenny <Col N="1652" /> Design Workshops will be discharged to those people in due course?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point I suggest that the question raised by the Senator would be best dealt with by the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops, and Kilkenny Design Workshops themselves.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 1 June 1988.</P>
