      <P>I have notice from Seantor Joe Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the deteriorating air quality in Dublin, the need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the Special Control Area (Ballyfermot) Order, 1988, sought under section 39 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and to initiate a public awareness campaign for citizens residing outside the area covered by the Order of the existence and availability of alternative non-polluting fuels at little or no extra cost to the public.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Doyle as suitable for discussion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if business has been concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that we take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  It is proposed that Item No. 2 be taken until 5.30 p.m. or earlier if the debate is concluded, that Item No. 4 be taken between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and that the <Col N="450" /> remainder of Item No. 3 be taken at 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask that in future when a report of major public importance is issued it be issued to all Members of the Oireachtas and not just to one House, as happened yesterday.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House two very simple questions.  Could he today, as promised in the past, give us an up-date on upcoming legislation.  This was promised before; we need to know what legislation to expect this session and when.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I should also like to refer to Item No. 6, the debate on Anglo-Irish relations.  I will not rehearse one more time the reasons this debate is both timely and necessary.  I am asking the Leader of the House whether on foot of the many requests and the assurances given by him he can now give us a definite time and date for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>To reiterate what obviously fell on deaf ears last week, the need to have outlined for us a programme of legislation which would take us through this term, I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether he now accepts that the Leader of the Lower House scooped the pot when it came to legislation this term and that he has failed miserably to provide us with legislation initiated in this House for this term.  He is quite likely to bring this House into disrepute and to make it irrelevant if he does not bring before us some reasonable volume of work to keep us going from now until Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House the dog-in-the-manger attitude of the Leader of the House.  Even though he cannot provide us with fresh legislation from Government he ignores the fact that there is a fair amount of legislation on the Order Paper; I refer specifically to Item No. 9 on the Order Paper, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1987, Item No. 10, the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1987, Item No. 11, the Nuclear Free Zone Bill, 1988, and Item No. 12, the Extradition (European Convention on <Col N="451" /> the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  Those Bills, in the names of Senator B. Ryan, Senator Ross, Senator Norris and the rest of the Independent Senators, have been lying there for some time.  Could he tell us why, if the Government are not prepared to bring forward legislation of their own, they will not deal with and dispose of important items of legislation which have been on the Order Paper for months?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would also like to refer to the numerous reports and other business that are still on the Order Paper and to remind the Leader of the House once again of the various commitments he gave over different periods of time to deal with these on Thursdays, Tuesdays or on days other than Wednesdays.  This has been raised by people on both sides of the House and it has certainly been referred to by Senator McGowan on a number of occasions in the past number of months.</P>
    <P>May I also please appeal to the Leader of the House through you, a Chathaoirligh, not to stand up and tell us that we worked very hard this year because we were all of X number of days in session. That is of no relevance to the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to respond in a very frank and open fashion to the question I have put to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share the concern that has been expressed about the apparent lack of legislation.  I think it is very much regretted on all sides of the House, particularly in the light of the fact that in the last year the Seanad was paid the compliment of being the Chamber into which on a number of occasions, legislation was introduced first of all.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, are we having repetition?  Senator O'Toole has made an excellent case.  I hate repetition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had actually noticed this trait in your character, a Chathaoirligh, and it is one to which I will, of course, defer.  I do want to place on record my support&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give an instance, if I may, to illustrate what I mean and that is the Planning Bill which is going first to the Dáil despite the fact that a number of us had placed quite important resolutions on the Order Paper and invited the Government over a long period to introduce the Bill in the Seanad. It is precisely the kind of legislation that it would be appropriate to have taken first in this House.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree with me that because this is the senior House and because it is a House in which there should be expert examination of legislation, it is important that we are given notice so that we can prepare ourselves.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask one specific question of the Cathaoirleach.  I inquired last week whether it would be possible for a group of Senators to inspect the work that is going on in the Seanad Chamber next door.  You did, of course, give a progress report &mdash; for which we are grateful &mdash; but I did not actually get an answer as to whether it would be possible or useful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, without being repetitious, that the Seanad is limping into some sort of irrelevant obscurity <Col N="453" /> at the moment and the reason is quite simple.  Not only are we getting no legislation, we are getting no programme of legislation.  None of us knows what is coming up between now and Christmas. We do not know what is coming out of the Dáil and we do not know what is coming to us first of all.  I would plead with the Leader of the House to give the following assurances to us on the Order of Business today.  When can we have a debate on Anglo-Irish relations and if we are not going to have it for God's sake tell us we are not going to have it.  Secondly, what legislation does he propose to bring before this House and will he tell us in advance?  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House to reply, I have been in the Seanad for quite a few years now: I may be a few years ahead of Senator Ross, I am not too sure.  I do not ever remember legislation being laid out for us weeks ahead.  I agree with Senators knowing what is coming up but if the Senator is asking for legislation that might come before us in three week's time or in a month's time, that is not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for that. What I would like is to have some indication. There are 20 Bills in the Dáil.  I would like to know whether we are going to get one or none before Christmas, some indication of what we are going to get.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Lanigan, I wish that the nice relationship that existed between the Whips, when they would talk to each other and understand where each was going with legislation would continue rather than having this discussion on the floor of the Chamber every Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning was quite right when he suggested that there was a lack of courtesy to this House in <Col N="454" /> the fact that we did not get the report on the constituencies.  The Minister rang my office this morning to apologise.  It was not his fault.  There was a mix-up in the administrative section.  The report will be available to us today.</P>
      <P>There is no point in my saying here today that I can give an outline of work for the coming session.  It was never done before and, unfortunately, I cannot give an outline of work in advance of getting the programme of work from the other House.  There is a lot of hot air on the Order of Business every day since this session began.  This House has initiated more important work in the past session than was ever done before.  Two of the most important Bills that have ever come before the Houses of the Oireachtas have been initiated in this House.  Unfortunately because these pieces of legislation are now with the other House it is not possible for us to have new business as readily as we would like.</P>
      <P>There are a number of Bills which will be introduced in this House in the next couple of weeks.  One Bill was completed in the other House this morning, the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Bill. There will be a Bill on pollution coming in within the next two weeks and it will probably be ordered next week. However, it has to be said that because the Dáil gave priority to a Bill by Deputy Alan Shatter, which I am sure many people in this House would wish to discuss, quite a number of hours will be taken up on that Bill and that, again, is pushing back the volume of legislation we can get from the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in Senators getting up here week after week criticising.  We have got a fair crack of the whip on new legislation, better than ever before.  The Government have given a commitment that we will have work coming forward on a regular basis from now on, but at this stage there is a block because of the fact that we have the Insurance Bill, the Companies Bill and Deputy Alan Shatter's Bill which is coming in next week. We have been working extremely hard to try to have as much business as possible for the House but it is the Government's <Col N="455" /> prerogative to give us business in whichever order they decide.  We are doing well.  All I can guarantee is that as soon as business comes it will be brought before you.  On the question of Items Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12, just because somebody puts down a Private Members' motion here does not mean that the Government are going to give them time.  Just because somebody decides he wants to bring a Bill before this House does not mean that it is going to be taken by the Government. I cannot give any guarantee that Items Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12 will be taken in this House.  Government business will take priority over Private Members' business at all times.  On Item No. 6 which was queried by Senator Manning, as soon as the Government decide when we should <Col N="456" /> discuss that I will introduce the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House leaves me no option whatsoever. He simply is not fighting for the rights of this House.  What he has brought before us is a disgrace.  He promised us a debate on Anglo-Irish relations but he has refused to give us that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> The purpose of this Bill is to approve the terms of the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and to enable this country to honour the financial and other obligations associated with membership of that agency.</P>
    <P>The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, usually referred to as MIGA, came into being last April and is the most recent member of the World Bank group.  Its primary function is to encourage investment flows to developing countries by providing insurance guarantees against non-commercial risks. Four types of risk are specified in the convention: the currency transfer risk resulting from host government restrictions and delays in converting and transferring local currency earned by an investor, expropriation and similar measures, breach of contract and the risk of war and civil disturbance.</P>
    <P>The idea of establishing an agency such as MIGA emerged in the 1950s.  While various proposals were discussed within the World Bank on a number of occasions, no concrete steps towards realisation of the concept were taken until the beginning of this decade.  The onset of the debt crisis, and the dramatic reduction in commercial bank financing, clearly provided added impetus to the development of a scheme which was designed to encourage the growth of foreign direct investment in developing countries.  The draft convention establishing MIGA was finalised by the Executive Directors of the World Bank in September 1985 and the resolution opening the convention for signature was passed by the board of governors of that institution in October, 1985.  Ireland, along with the majority of our EC partners, subsequently signed the convention in the following year, 1986.</P>
    <P>To date, the MIGA Convention has been ratified by 44 States, representing just under 64 per cent of the agency's capital.  Major industrial countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, the United <Col N="459" /> Kingdom and the United States are all members.  For the many developing countries which have joined, membership of MIGA is seen as an important signal to potential investors of their willingness to take whatever reasonable measures might be required for them to attract more foreign direct investment into their economies.</P>
    <P>MIGA is, in essence, an investment insurer.  A number of countries have official schemes which provide guarantees similar to MIGA to their nationals for investments in developing countries. MIGA will complement these existing schemes.  Moreover, its multilateral dimension is bound to give it a particular status and should engender confidence in its activities among both the developed and the developing nations.</P>
    <P>MIGA's guarantee operations will extend to a wide range of investments. These will include equity investments, different forms of direct investment and medium or long-term loans made or guaranteed by the owners of equity in the enterprise concerned.  While retrospective cover will not be available, investments made to develop an existing investment, or to reinvest earnings which might otherwise be transferred outside the host country will be eligible for cover. Under certain circumstances, the reinvestment of what is commonly referred to as flight capital may also be eligible. The extent of MIGA's guarantee operations is a testimony to the agency's commitment to ensuring that available investment opportunities are acted upon where possible.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the developed and developing countries will be fully equal partners within the organisation of MIGA.  It is the intention that voting power will be split evenly between the two groups and, in judging whether or not a particular investment should be guaranteed, the agency will assess both its financial soundness and its contribution to the economic and social development of the host country.  Furthermore, no contract of guarantee may be concluded without the approval of the <Col N="460" /> host country concerned.  In this way, that country will be able to evaluate the proposed investment and ensure that it does not run counter to its overall development needs.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about MIGA's guarantee function.  However, there is also another important aspect to MIGA's operations which relates to the promotion of investment flows.  This facility includes the provision of technical assistance to a member with the objective of improving investment conditions.  The agency will also conduct research and make information available on investment opportunities in developing member countries, thereby enabling potential investors to be kept fully informed of developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>Part of MIGA's importance lies in the fact that it is an integral part of the World Bank Group.  In particular, it will complement the International Finance Corporation which shares MIGA's aim but which strives to achieve it mainly through investing in companies in developing countries.  With MIGA's establishment, the World Bank Group is in a position to offer a valuable and extensive range of services to its members.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for MIGA to have an initial share capital of $1.082 billion.  Ten per cent of the price of the subscribed shares is to be paid in cash and 10 per cent in promissory notes, both within 90 days of a country ratifying the convention.  The balance of 80 per cent will be subject to call by the agency to meet any exceptional obligations that might arise.  The agency is expected to build up its reserves over time and to be largely self-financing.  In consequence, it is unlikely that there will be recourse either to the promissory notes or to the callable capital.  Ireland's initial paid-in contribution, which will amount to approximately £0.275 million, will be paid from the Central Fund and will count as part of our Official Development Assistance programme.  Our maximum liability under the scheme is £2.75 million.</P>
    <P>No one in this House will deny the seriousness of the debt problem which <Col N="461" /> confronts many developing countries. Their plight is not helped by the fact that in recent years commercial bank flows have fallen significantly.  MIGA, in itself, does not purport to offer a solution to the difficulties which beset these countries, and which require a global response from both the countries themselves and from the industrial nations.  However, by fostering a climate favourable to investment in developing countries, MIGA can play an important part in helping them to attain adequate levels of growth.  Such growth is essential if their citizens are to escape from poverty and deprivation and enjoy a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the direct foreign investment in developing countries which will be covered by MIGA are manifold. In the first place, as I have already indicated, any investment insured by MIGA must have the imprimatur of the host country concerned.  This will ensure that such investment activity accords with the recipients wishes.  Secondly, this direct investment will have a quick-acting beneficial impact in terms of output and employment.  Thirdly, it will not give rise to additional debt servicing liabilities for the host country and it may be a source of much-needed foreign exchange.  Finally, additional benefits may also accrue in the form of technology transfers, modern management skills and marketing expertise.</P>
    <P>MIGA's aims are pragmatic and business-oriented. As I mentioned before, the agency only came into being last April and is obviously at a very early stage in its development.  The Bill before the House, by enabling us to ratify the convention, will ensure that we can play our part in providing this important service to developing countries.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks, I should like to run briefly through the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines various terms. Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the convention.  Section 3 provides for the financial arrangements associated with our membership.  Section 4 provides for the recognition of MIGA's subrogation rights.  In other words, where the agency pays compensation to an <Col N="462" /> investor, it is then entitled to assume the rights of that investor against the host country where the investment was located.  Section 5 ensures that arbitration judgments involving MIGA will have the force of law in this country. Section 6 contains the short title to the Bill.  The terms of the convention itself are set out in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in the course of this full explanation, indicated that this Bill is a pragmatic and business-oriented measure, which it is in one sense.  I will, in the course of my contribution, deal with what I want to describe as the relatively desiccated side of the facts and figures, the accountancy measures, the insurance, the investment, and so on.  There is another side to this, and that is why I find it somewhat strange that this measure is being introduced by a Minister of State from the Department of Finance.  Because this measure is so closely inter-related with overseas development and with foreign affairs, I would like to have seen it perhaps in some way become the remit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or at least the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation.</P>
      <P>While I understand it is a financial measure, nevertheless I feel that really to talk about the nuts and bolts of this we need somebody who is prepared to devote some time in consideration of this measure to speak about overseas development aid and what it means in the Third World countries to the people on the ground for whom presumably, it is designated.  I think it is important to cover this.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to give recognition to the fact that the deputy leader of my own party, Deputy John Bruton, when Minister for Finance was involved in the negotiations which led to the establishment of MIGA.  It is important to recognise that fact and to pay tribute to his concern and to the very earnest way in which he promoted the establishment of MIGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> The international convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, MIGA &mdash; an organisation that will help developing countries attract productive foreign investment &mdash; become effective in April 1988.  We are to be members of it.  It will enable us to honour our financial commitments by virtue of our membership of this agency, which is, of course, the most recent member of the World Bank group and all the major industrial countries.  To date some seven of our EC partners have signed up.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a good and honourable tradition in relation to its World Bank membership and in its contacts with the various affiliate bodies of the World Bank.  We have to remember that primarily we are involved because we recognise the fact that developing countries need foreign direct investment.  Why do they need it?  They need it for many of the same reasons for which we need it to some degree or other, such as for expansion, for development, for growth and to help in employment and in the balance of payments.  Investors on the other side have certain needs also in addition to the obvious one of profit motive.  They also need, in Third World countries, certain insurance guarantees against non-commercial risk.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to read in the World Bank annual report for 1988, a list of what exactly the risks were which led to the need to establish MIGA.  I would like to place those risks on the record of the House.  They are the transfer risk resulting from post-Government restrictions on currency conversion and transfer, and the risk of loss resulting from legislative or administrative actions and omissions of the host government that would have the effect of depriving the foreign investor of his ownership or control of, or substantial benefits from his investment, the repudiation by government of contracts with investors in cases in which the investor has no access to a competent forum, faces unreasonable delays in such a forum, or is unable to enforce a judicial decision issued in his <Col N="464" /> favour, and the risk of armed conflict and civil unrest.  MIGA provides a safety net or a cushion against the eventuality of the risks I have outlined from the World Bank annual report.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, have always had a principled, steady and growing commitment to development co-operation. We initiated the Ministry of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for co-operation with developing countries.  For one brief period when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach in the early 1980s he abolished that ministry.  He called it superfluous and supernumerary, which I thought were unthinking, unfeeling, harsh and, indeed, callous words and an extraordinary approach to what the Irish people quite evidently saw as a most important ministry and as a most important focus for their generosity, concern and care.  I am pleased he has had second thoughts.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a Minister at that Department with special responsibility for development co-operation.  I must say &mdash; I do not mean this in any personal sense, because I am sure the Minister does the best he can within the financial restraints imposed on him &mdash; I find the actual activity in that area to be somewhat lacklustre and disappointing. It is a criticism that I have voiced before and I have not noted any particular dynamism, thrust, activity or energy coming from that area.  There are many people outside who care deeply about Third World issues and who look to government for an appropriate response.  It is a clear case of the people being light years ahead of the politicians in terms of involvement, fund raising, knowledge and activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Senator Bulbulia, you are well aware of how far you can criticise either a Taoiseach of today or yesterday or a Minister when they are not here to defend themselves.  I am sure the Senator appreciates that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate it.  I was quite careful to say that I was not making any personal criticisms but that I was <Col N="465" /> merely criticising actions.  It is very important that people in politics are able to separate criticism of actions from criticisms of individuals.  I hope that as long as I may be in politics I am able to make that distinction.  I feel that my criticisms are valid.  I have made them before.  I hope I do not have to make them again but, if necessary, I will not hesitate to do so because part of my function in being a Member of the Oireachtas is to be able to raise my voice in legitimate criticism, provided I can sustain, justify and argue that criticism reasonably well and ably.</P>
      <P>I am back again to discussing the Irish people and their very generous response. They have a right to expect that their politicians will reflect their wishes and their aspirations.  That is a basic tenet of democracy.  That expectation should result in a decent allocation of resources to save people who are starving.  We saw evidence of that starvation and disaster on television last night on the nine o'clock news.  Pictures came from Sudan.  They were poignant, heartrending and disturbing in the extreme.  We must remember that they form the backdrop against which we speak when we concern ourselves with the debate on ODA and MIGA, all of which is tied in together.</P>
      <P>I want this country to be a witness and an example to Europe and to the world in its ability to show its genuine concern. The people do that.  The people give witness over and over again of that genuine concern and commitment.  This Government have failed.  Last year there were savage cuts and this year it is not much better.  I propose to speak about that in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the area of the country that I know best and to demonstrate awareness, compassion, and a practical outpouring of all of those feelings in relation to Third World matters. I speak about Waterford which for some ten years has been involved in a development partnership with Kitui in Kenya. Tremendous amounts of funds, expertise and material have flowed from Waterford to Kitui in Kenya.  Over and above all that, there has been an education programme on the factory floor, in the office, <Col N="466" /> in the schools, in every forum in that city and county.  This has led to a heightening in Waterford of awareness of the needs of Third World countries.  I would like to pay tribute to the founder members of the Waterford Kitui partnership and to those who have, with unremitting zeal and tireless enthusiasm, kept up this venture over a ten year period.  That is one activity that is taking place in Waterford.</P>
    <P>In September the Mayor of Waterford who is a member of the Minister of State's party, launched an appeal.  It was called &ldquo;Let September Stand for Sudan&rdquo;.  The idea was to collect as much money as possible specifically for Sudan, bearing in mind that other moneys are flowing out continuously to Kitui in Kenya.  This was an additional activity with a Third World bias.  That project &ldquo;Let September Stand for Sudan&rdquo;, as late as yesterday when the final amounts of money were coming in, realised £93,000.  That was four times the initial target.  The cheque was handed over a little while ago to John O'Shea of GOAL who was the very pleased recipient of that.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to all the people who rode in behind that appeal to the Mayor who unhesitatingly launched it and backed it, to all the people who donated and to those who slogged around on a house-to-house campaign, to those who had cake sales, to those who organised fasts, bible readings, soup kitchens and tennis marathons.  Out in Tramore, a satellite town, the town commissioners got busy and supported it.  That town alone brought in £6,000.  The Active Retirement Group in Waterford city and its environs raised £8,000.  They had a caravan down in the square in Barrowstrand Street, in the triangle.  The children of the town got together and in a very imaginative exercise joined hands, which was symbolic in so many ways, right around the People's Park.  They looked for sponsorship for that and raised £8,000.</P>
    <P>Credit must be given to such amazing, constructive, wholehearted generosity. That is just an illustration of the generosity of the people of Ireland based in the area I know best and where I work day <Col N="467" /> in, day out.  It makes all the more shocking and disturbing the lack of commitment and the poor record which this Government have in the area of overseas aid, despite introducing this measure here today.  I see the Minister shaking his head.  I do not expect the Minister will agree with me, but nevertheless I will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will point out the facts later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course you will.  That is what debate is all about.  I look forward to that.  Again, I want to consider the Government's callousness in not meeting our development aid commitments.  We have not fulfilled the target of contributing 0.7 per cent of GNP.  We are now well below the 0.3 per cent average for OECD countries.  If the industrialised countries had lived up to their aid targets, the Third World debt problem would have been solved by now, or at least it would have been well on the way to being solved.  We have got to remember that and to recognise it in all that we say.</P>
      <P>Something strikes me as being disturbing about this Bill.  I notice that one of the countries listed as having membership and having paid subscriptions is South Africa.  It is to me the supreme irony, that South Africa should involve itself in a project like this when it is engaged in a policy within its own country which is so immoral as to defy description and when it is busy destabilising all the frontline states and causing havoc and chaos in the region.  It is extraordinary that it would have been considered fitting for membership of MIGA.  I hope the Minister in some way in his reply can indicate why South Africa is a member of MIGA.  Does he think there is something ironic about that?  Has Ireland expressed its concern?  Has it voiced its objections? Does the Minister feel there is anything constructive or concrete that we can do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back to the figures of ODA for this year, I understand that we were able <Col N="468" /> to increase slightly our ODA by £1 million to £33.7 million.  We have got to remember that the cut last year was 26 per cent.  I am sure the Minister has not forgotten that there was widespread anger and indignation at that cut.  Every concerned body, grouping and voluntary organisation voiced its dismay and anger in the aftermath of that announcement.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to list organisations because there is always the difficulty that you will leave one out but I would like to pay tribute to the major organisations concerned such as Trocaire, GOAL, Comhlamh &mdash; the returned development workers' organisation &mdash; and the very many other bodies who involve themselves in this area and who, in addition to co-ordinating fund-raising and seeing that disaster relief is rapidly put in place, also had a programme of public education. In particular I want to place on record the fact that Trocaire, in alerting people to the human rights which lie behind the necessity to fund Third World projects and to get involved on the ground, do us proud.  They perform an enormous service for all of us.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy, too, about the fact that a token sum has been put in again this year for disaster relief.  Of course, we are back then to boosting that from time to time with allocations from the national lottery.  There was a debate about that during the summer.  The bottom line taken appeared to be that people in Third World countries would not really mind where the money was coming from so long as they got the necessary and desired relief.</P>
    <P>I can see a certain very basic logic in that but it is not a view to which I would subscribe.  If we feel that it is moral, proper and right and is part of our feeling about the brotherhood of mankind, it is only right that our allocation to the Third World should form part of our Estimate and part of our budget.  Our contribution from the lottery fund to give moneys to disaster relief in the Third World should not be on a par with moneys given to golf clubs or community facilities.  It begs a very basic principle.  I am unhappy that we should have slipped into a situation <Col N="469" /> where we just slot in a small sum as a token for disaster relief and then think that it is all right to beef it up from the lottery funding as and when necessary.  I do not think it is a principled approach. I do not think it reflects the wishes of the Irish people.  I would like to place that on record.</P>
    <P>I could go over the ground the Minister has so well covered in his speech about the various mechanics of MIGA but that is all in the explanatory memorandum and it would be repetitious of me.  I know there are other people who wish to make a contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, this Bill enables this Government and this country to comply with its financial and other obligations of membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, or as it is known for short MIGA.  We are one of the major industrialised countries. Included with us are many of our EC partners who have joined this particular Investment Guarantee Agency.  This move is consistent with our belief and our support for the World Bank.  It is true to say that we have for a long time been a strong and loyal supporter of the World Bank.  We have long realised the great benefits to so many countries of the world as a result of the activities of the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new agency, as the Minister has indicated, is the most recent member of the World Bank group, being established last April.  Hopefully, MIGA will complement the activities and priorities of all the organisations involved in this particular kind of work.  The main objective of MIGA is to help create or encourage foreign, direct investment in developing countries.  To achieve this foreign investment, I believe that potential investors must be provided with the kind of financial guarantees that are important in areas of civil unrest, in the area of insurance, which was referred to by the Minister, and in respect of all the other hazards associated with trading in the developing nations.  Indeed I know, from personal experience, that the insurance industry in these countries needs a lot of attention.  It is my opinion that many <Col N="470" /> potential investors will not get involved in the activities of developing countries because of these particular insurance problems.</P>
    <P>We have all heard the expression that the world is badly divided.  It is an old expression and it is very true; it is particularly apt in this debate in respect of the developed <i>versus</i> developing nations of the world.  I read recently an investment commentary for the month ending 28 September 1988 and I will quote one paragraph from it:</P>
    <P>September was a good month for financial markets.  Among the major equity markets Wall Street rose around 6 per cent, as did London, while Tokyo only managed to rise 1.4 per cent. European markets were also very strong.  The rise in New York and London can be put down to an improvement in sentiment as the U.S. trade deficit for July at $9.5 billion and the August U.K. figure at £1.3 billion were both better than expected.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that kind of activity is not necessary.  The worries expressed in that commentary reflect the problems of the super developed economies, the rich countries of the world.  We are all aware of the problems, for example, the Stock Market crash of October 1987 which had implications for the economies of many of these rich countries.  One half of the world does not know how the other half lives.  For example, the pet food market of the world is worth £10 billion while in some countries of the world hundreds of thousands of children die annually from starvation.</P>
    <P>Investment is vital in Third World countries if growth and development are to take place.  We are told that conditions have improved in parts of Asia.  We know, for example, that there are problems in Sudan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and in parts of South America and Africa which have resulted in a lower standard of life, in disease, starvation and death. If we are to prevent tragedies such as those we have seen depicted on our television screens in countries such as Ethiopia, Bangladesh and others and if we <Col N="471" /> are to prevent scenes such as the ones we saw on our television screens last night from Sudan, then foreign investment is essential in order to eliminate the horrors in these regions.  We cannot continue to allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper on an occasion like this that we express suitable words of praise for the many voluntary organisations like Concern, Trocaire, GOAL, Gorta and others who are doing great work in these countries.  Who will ever forget the activities of Bob Geldof?  He is a world hero as a result and rightly so. We should not forget also the great work which is being done by so many volunteers in parts of the Third World.  I know of one volunteer working with Concern from my own town, a young nurse by the name of Maura Mannion, and I am aware of the kind of work she does, around the clock, in saving lives, and fighting disease in the most primitive conditions. We could talk for a very long time about the conditions, the poverty, the squalor, the disease and the deaths from starvation in these centres but, as Senator Bulbulia rightly pointed out, we can learn more from what our television screens can show us in two minutes than from all the words we could write or state.  As I said, last night's television programme on Sudan said it all.  Meanwhile, the super powers continue to hoard food mountains.  America, we are told, will burn its grain rather than let its price drop.  While this mentality prevails, unfortunately the problems of the Third World will continue.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the Irish people have responded, as individuals, magnificently to pleas for aid for the Third World.  Senator Bulbulia outlined what happened in her particular region.  This kind of activity is happening in many other parts of the country and long may it continue.  I hope that the Government, who I know would like to give more money, will do so to the Third World when the finances of this country improve so that we can play a greater role in this particular area.  Under this Bill we will contribute, compared to other nations, <Col N="472" /> only a trickle of funds, as the Minister indicated our share allocation in MIGA is 369 shares, at a total cost of £2.75 million from a capital base of MIGA $1.082 billion.  Indeed of the figure of £2.75 million, only 10 per cent will be paid in cash.  It is expected, and we would hope, that MIGA will operate on a commercial basis and will be financed largely from premiums charged to investors seeking guarantees and from returns on investments.</P>
    <P>There could be many new investment opportunities for investors in developing countries particularly if a favourable investment climate can be created.  One of the main aims of MIGA should be to work for the creation of a good investment climate in countries where it operates. I would like to think that the profits made in these developing countries would be ploughed back into them rather than whipped away back to the base country.  The success of MIGA will be gauged by the amount of finance it can introduce in developing countries.  I hope it will be successful.  Developing countries will see direct foreign investment as a way of creating new jobs, of reducing bank lending, and the advent of new marketing and new technology skills.  I am sure they will welcome such investment for many other obvious good reasons.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill we could talk about for a long time.  I know the Minister and the rest of us could elaborate on the squalor, poverty, starvation and deaths in Third World countries but I would just like to conclude by wishing the agency well and to congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for bringing it forward.  I hope the much needed foreign investment will be forthcoming.  Certainly such investment is necessary if the citizens in the countries in question are to escape from the poverty, starvation and deprivation we know exists.  I hope and pray this particular agency will be truly successful.</P>

      <P>I must say I am getting quite sick of this Government, who have an unprecedented record in taking money out of the mouths of the poor of the world <Col N="473" /> via their cutbacks in Official Development Aid, hiding behind the generosity of our young people and sheltering their own meanness by touting the generosity of our young people and the extraordinary work of our voluntary organisations and, unfortunately, getting a remarkably soft ride in the process.  I have to say at this stage, for reasons that escape me, that I am convinced that if the Government who took the decision to cut back Official Development Aid were not of the present political complexion, my church in particular would have a lot more enthusiasm for criticising them.  I have to say that, unfortunately, a lot of people in our society apparently would be very vocal if a Coalition were seen to be perhaps less suspect on some of the issues that really matter to my church, as distinct from the ones it talks about from time to time.  That is not in any way to undervalue the vehemence of the contributions of Cardinal Ó Fiaich and Bishop Casey but I could, and one could, envisage much more thundering from pulpits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time or the last.  There would be much more thundering from pulpits if a less sound Government were to do these awful things.  They are awful things.  There is a philosophical problem and a problem of language at this stage in dealing with development.  The philosophical problem is the extraordinary dominance of economics and economists in our thinking.  It needs to be asserted again and again that economists cannot measure human well-being. Economists cannot measure development.  Economists cannot measure what is good for humanity.  They can only measure one small area of human need satisfaction.  They have been allowed quite an extraordinary amount of latitude to extend the tentacles of their influence into all areas in which they have absolutely no competence and in which they have no expertise.  They have tried to pretend to us that somehow you can <Col N="474" /> use one very limited analytical tool to attempt to understand the complex nature of human activities and of human relationships which goes under the general title of development.</P>
      <P>There are extraordinary assumptions written into this Bill about development, many of which are fly in the face of the evidence of the past 30 years, which fly in the face of the ecological crisis facing the world, which fly in the face of the appalling structural inequalities that are not only built into many developing countries but are being reinforced by the policies of one of the agencies behind this legislation.  That raises fundamental philosophical questions and if people had not been almost intimidated by the dominance of econometrics and economists in their thinking, they would realise just how much of a pup we have been sold in attempting to describe something as complex and as magnificent as humanity in terms of one limited attempt at scientific analysis.</P>
      <P>That runs through all of this Bill.  I can assure the Minister I do not intend to be as abstract as in those initial remarks but they underline a lot of what is wrong with this Bill, a lot of the questions that deserve to be answered, questions that I hope the Minister will answer.  There is a large number of questions that I want to ask him, particularly about the convention, because there are extraordinary statements all the way through this Bill that need very detailed scrutiny.  I am sure he will be able to give me very detailed and precise answers.</P>
      <P>There is an idea that everything we do for Third World countries is by definition a good thing, that as long as anything we do directs money in their direction it is a good thing, that as long as we feel good about development it is a good thing. The truth is that unless we understand something about the nature of the problems of developing countries, the nature of the problems of development or indeed if we even push ourselves to think about what we really mean by development we cannot at all approach the issue of what is good for developing countries and what is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The usual simple answer is to say that they have subscribed to MIGA.  Most developing countries are so impoverished that they have no choice but to subscribe to agencies like this.  As a great Nicaraguan priest once said, poverty is the absence of choice.  Those of us who are not poor have the time both to choose and articulate choice.  Those who are poor have no such luxury.  As I said, the Bill makes assumptions about development that fly in the face of the experience of ordinary human beings.  One of the most fundamental political problems which many people all over western Europe are beginning to talk about, is the failure to appreciate what ordinary people want, need and experience.</P>
    <P>We have an obsession with gross national product as a measure of well-being. If it goes up we are supposed to be increasing in our well-being, if it goes down our well-being is decreasing.  Let me give a simple example which demonstrates how ridiculous is that concept. Let us suppose we spend £500 million or £600 million a year on overseas holidays and all that money goes out of the country. That is not going to cause a growth in our GNP.  If the Irish people were to decide instead that they were not going to go overseas on holidays, that they were going to spend the £500 million or £600 million on cigarettes that would push up our GNP.  Theoretically, therefore, we would be better off according to the whole simplistic, one-dimensional model of humanity that economists have foisted on us in recent years.  Of course that is rubbish, because the more we smoke the more damage we will do to our own well-being. There is no way that conventional economics can measure that sort of well-being. I will come back to this later on.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that nowhere in the stated objectives of this agency, apart from a passing reference to the development programmes of the host countries, is there reference to the ecological damage of a particular investment. Nowhere is there a reference to the effects of development on indigenous peoples.  It is based on an attempt to <Col N="476" /> superimpose western concepts on investment, development and improvements on countries that have very different views, and indeed very different priorities of needs.  It is built around the philosophy and ideology of the World Bank.</P>
    <P>I should at least refer the Minister and his Department to some of the recent writings on the question of development. I have in front of me a book called <i>The Living Economy</i> published by Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul which ought to be compulsory reading for every economist in this country and I would like to know what their response to it would be.  I would be fairly confident that their response would be to say that it is not really what they want to talk about because it involves things other than simplistic one-dimensional measurements of humanity's well-being in terms of money. It raises fundamental questions about what we want to do with ourselves, not about what a particular model would want us to do.</P>
    <P>The book refers to another publication called <i>Another Development: Approaches and Strategies,</i> published by the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation in 1977.  I do not want to delay the House but what this particular book suggests to the ordinary person who has not been swamped by economics and who realises that econiomics is a tool for human beings to analyse some situations, not a control mechanism which tells them what they must do, is that, for instance, real development ought to be geared to meeting human needs, both material and nonmaterial. The trouble about economics is that any need that is not material, no matter how fundamental, cannot be measured, priced, or quantified and, therefore, cannot be considered.  The assumption, therefore, is that if somebody is 50 per cent better off living in a polluted city then he is better off than somebody who is half as well off and living in a clean environment in the country because one is a less obvious need than the other.  Somebody who has a good job which pays well but who is lonely, separated from his family and under stress is presumed to be better off than <Col N="477" /> somebody who is in company with his or her family and has a smaller income.  The first person is presumed by economics to be better off because their income is better.  That is palpable nonsense.  Most human beings know that that is nonsense but we are in the grip of the high priests of orthodoxy at this stage who have a stronger influence on our thinking than even the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church had in the fifties.</P>
    <P>It is time that the new high priests of orthodoxy were challenged to return to the one area where they have competence, which is in the measurement of material production and they should leave the rest of humanity's needs to the ordinary people who understand these things far better than they do.  Written into this document is an attempt to equate development with economic growth without any other reflection on any other area of human need, be it physical or spiritual.  That is the fundamental philosophical flaw in this activity.</P>
    <P>The second philosophical flaw is the contradiction between the aspiration and the reality.  Article 34 on page 15 of the Bill which relates to prohibited political activity states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the right of the Agency to take into account all the circumstances surrounding an investment, they shall not be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned. Considerations relevant to their decisions shall be weighted impartially in order to achieve the purposes stated in Article 2.</P>
    <P>How is one going to be impartial while at the same time taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the investment? I do not know but MIGA is part of the World Bank group.  Let me remind this House of the record of the World Bank as regards being impartial.  The World Bank is seen by many people as being, effectively, an extension of the United States and its financial interests. Since 1984 the World Bank has refused to loan any money to Nicaragua on the insistence of the Reagan administration that it should not do so.  Despite a positive <Col N="478" /> technical evaluation of the value and worth of the World Bank's projects in Nicaragua, it has refused to lend money or make money available to Nicaragua, not because they were doing anything wrong but because the Reagan administration disapproved of Nicaragua. Therefore, it could not give money to Nicaragua.  It is as simple as that.  The World Bank will not aid Nicaragua, not for any reason to do with objective economics, if such exists which I doubt, but because of the fact that its American masters disapprove of the politics of Nicaragua.  It is an absolute mythology to insert something like that into the terms of reference of MIGA and not advert to the truth of what the World Bank does and continues to do.  That is the sort of benovolence that appears to underlie this legislation but which, in fact, is not contained in it.  I will come back to that again.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the Bill is a pragmatic response.  It appears to me that far from being a pragmatic response it is based on assumptions, which might or might not be justified depending on one's view of the world, that a certain form of development is better than other forms of development.  It is based on the assumption, and my good friend Deputy M. Higgins spent some time on this in the other House, that foreign investment in developing countries is <i>per se</i> a good thing.  It omits any reference because it cannot, will not or because it would make it too difficult, to the meddling of many foreign multinationals in developing countries.  It would be regarded as going outside the terms of reference of MIGA to refer to the fact that it was an American multinational which destroyed and was responsible for the death of the democratically elected president of Chile in the early seventies.</P>
    <P>We are not supposed to talk about these things because foreign investment is a good thing.  It is not necessarily a good thing; it may be of benefit to a country or it may not.  As I said earlier, if a multinational decides to set up in Brazil in order to speed up the destruction of the rain forests, that will increase the gross national product of Brazil but <Col N="479" /> it could destabilise inside 20 years the entire world ecology.  However, we cannot mention the second, we must look at the first.  We are told it will generate employment.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the activities of the multinationals at present.  Where are their preferred sources of investment?  They talk about the low-cost developing countries, the newly industrialised countries, such as Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, etc.  These are the places where we are told they like to invest because the tax regimes are attractive, because, in the Minister's words, there is a climate favourable to investment there.  We are supposed to look at this in terms of what economics can measure i.e. wages, costs, infrastructural investment, etc.  The truth is a large part of their attractiveness is the fact that trade unions are not allowed in those countries and if they are allowed they are severely restricted.  Those who work in the sweat shops, of multinationals in these countries as they often are, have got to work for very low wages. There is very little labour relations legislation to protect their rights, to protect them on the grounds of safety, hazardous substances and so on and, in the case of Korea, they are expected to work at least 55 hours a week before they can begin to be paid overtime.</P>
    <P>This has got nothing to do with tangible cost benefits; it has all to do with the fact that in those countries one side of the equasion i.e. the industrial workforce is severely handicapped <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other. It is, therefore, much easier for them to be profitable, it is much easier to make money and, therefore, it is much easier to invest there and sell goods back to the consuming countries at an improved competitive price.  None of this is referred to, even by way of implication, in this legislation because it presupposes a model of development based on only those things which have a very limited view of human well-being and development. That is what is wrong with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Chile in recent years has been quoted as a model of impeccable development, <Col N="480" /> with growth rates of 5 per cent, with exports booming and so on.  Of course, we are not supposed to say that Chile is no longer a democracy because that is not a term that bothers economists.  They are not really interested in those sort of things.  That is not the sort of thing that bothers world banks or international monetary funds.  They have not shown a particular interest in differentiating between countries with a good human rights record and those with a bad human rights record; whether they are on the left or the right is irrelevant.  They have not shown much interest in what countries do with this growth in GNP, whether it is used to make the already rich élite even richer or whether it is used to develop the country.  These things do not matter.  This is more relevant to the International Monetary Fund, but they actually conspire <i>de facto</i> to reduce freedom in those countries by making impossible economic demands on governments which can only be implemented by the suppression of basic freedoms.  We blissfully then introduce legislation like this and say that its aim is to provide Official Development Aid.</P>
    <P>Let us remember what this legislation is about.  Not one penny of our contributions under the provisions of this Bill will go to a Third World country.  Rather its provisions constitute a guarantee to overseas investors against loss.  Effectively what we are doing is subsidising multinational corporations.  We are saying that if their investments fail or if a country misbehaves under the four headings in Chapter III &mdash; Currency Transfer Expropriation and Similar Measures, Breach of Contract and War and Civil Disturbance &mdash; the investor will be compensated.  We will compensate the investor, not the country.  Therefore, the money will go to the overseas investor who will be one of the countries from category one of the list of countries in the Schedule by and large, if not always.  If you like, that means that we are protecting each other from possible upheavals in Third World countries.  We are not really doing much.</P>
    <P>My good friend, Deputy M. Higgins, <Col N="481" /> in the other House, adverted to this.  We are effectively telling multinationals that they are safe to invest in even the most repressive of countries &mdash; even those where there are no rights &mdash; because, if it all goes wrong, and these nasty people decide to throw out their benevolent rulers, we will look after their investments. It is a regrettable fact that a lot of money has been wasted in development co-operation because we refuse to look at real models of human development. The sort of economics we are fed about investment, return on investment and so on sound lovely except for the fact that, were they to be implemented in reality, there would be nobody in agriculture in this country.  It would then be much more economical and be a more efficient use of capital for a farmer to sell his farm, invest the proceeds and live off that investment.  There is no economic justification for most of agriculture in this country.  The money that is invested in the land could provide a much greater rate of return were it invested elsewhere. However, people do not do that because people are not economic animals alone; they are much more complex than that.</P>
    <P>That is the underlying flaw in all of this World Bank model of development. apart from the fact that it is politically biased, it is also philosophically bankrupt because it does not appreciate either the needs or capacity of ordinary people to contribute to their development.  Neither is it able to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable forms of economic growth, unacceptable forms being those which do harm to a society, to the environment. There are many such forms being tolerated in developing countries. The more extreme are represented by the apparent continuing determination of developed countries to offload their toxic waste to impoverished Third World countries who will be paid for the privilege of storing our deadly waste.  We will not have it but they are so desperately short of money they will accept it.</P>
    <P>We do not know the extent to which this is going on.  From the point of view of abstract economics, that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> There is nothing in abstract economics to distinguish that from other forms of activity.  As has been said quite rightly on a few occasions, there is nothing in economics to suggest that the heroin trade in the United States should not be aggregated as part of its gross national product.  It is a convention that excludes it; the fact that it is illegal does not render it in any way not part of the development of the United States economy.  We cannot base concepts of human well-being, which is what development is about, on simple straight line, one-dimensional economics.</P>
    <P>The other side of this equation of course is represented by the extraordinary cutbacks in Official Development Aid.  I presume the Minister is aware of the scale of these cutbacks.  I need not refer to them again.  There is the contradictory philosophy underlying our cutbacks and here I will quote the present Taoiseach speaking to the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University on 22 April 1988:</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the few nations of the European Community which has suffered colonisation and because of our history in that regard we are in a privileged position in regard to most of the small and emerging nations of the modern world.  Our work in the mission fields and in health and welfare projects makes us keenly aware of the plight of the smaller Third World nations with whom we have the privilege of special relationships.  We stand, respected, in the middle ground between the affluent North and the underdeveloped South, ideally suited to play a valuable bridging role.</P>
    <P>I am not allowed to use the word which I was going to use; I will think of another one in a moment.  There is something distinctly distasteful about a speech like that being made by the Leader of our Government at a time when our Official Development Aid is being cut back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that is a distinct improvement.  The basic facts cannot be avoided, no matter what the Minister may like to blissfully pretend to himself.  If the Government keep on, as they have done, we are depriving the poor of the limited amount of aid we give them.  Remember we are in the process of disengaging effectively from Sudan where the need is greatest; we are likely to run down entirely our projects in Tanzania because they cannot be sustained any longer.  I have had the pleasure and privilege of seeing our work in Tanzania. I know the pain and shock that will be caused to the people in the areas where Irish development aid has been so useful if we decide to cut it out completely.</P>
      <P>The decision to cutback on Official Development Aid is difficult to justify even in the terms under which economists and economics operate.  As Trócaire point out in their simple booklet entitled <i>The Costs of Cutting Third World Aid,</i> we are not necessarily losing anything from Official Development Aid; if anything we are beneficiaries because a large part of our bilateral aid is either paid for Irish goods and services or paid to Irish people.  On a wider basis the success of Irish companies in trading with Third World countries, particularly through DEVCO, could be generating in the order of £70 million to £90 million a year which is well in excess of our Official Development Aid.  A lot of that business by Irish companies in Third World countries is able to be there because we are seen to have a good record on Official Development Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go from one country seen to be progressive to one which we will shortly be seen as one of the meanest-minded of the 27 or 30 relatively rich countries, then that sort of goodwill will evaporate.  Any sort of mythology that we are somehow <Col N="484" /> a middle ground between the developed and developing, somehow the honest broker, will be eliminated as we clearly begin to subscribe to the dominant ideology of the rich west, which is that private investment is the route forward, that the idea of aid as part of development is played down, as we withdraw into a large international institution like the World Bank and tie up increasing amounts of our resources in those areas.</P>
    <P>We have lost a lot of credibility.  We will lose more if the present Government continue with their philosophy, their deliberate playing down of Official Development Aid crystalised in their apparent refusal to consider the re-establishment of a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Development Co-operation. Perhaps because they forgot about it or because they deliberately decided not to have one, we have not got one now. Nothing more than that shows that the Government would like us all to forget about Official Development Aid; they would like us to forget about development co-operation; would like to avoid a forum where we could be advised systematically about what is happening in the area of Official Development Aid.  So we do not have a committee.  We have a Minister who is a very nice man but I do not think he is in a position to talk much about development aid since basically all we are spending now is money that we are stuck with spending and on which we cannot renege.</P>
    <P>There is a shameful lack of thinking on issues such as those covered by the provisions of this Bill.  There is a shameful lack of thinking in the philosophy of this Government about Official Development Aid.  There is a shameful lack of thinking in the fact that apparently an increasing part of our resources, under what we call Official Development Aid is controlled by the Department of Finance. With the philosophy and ideology that now dominates that Department it appears that we are not going to see much in the area of enlightened or imaginative development emanating from that source given their lack of enlightenment and imagination in many other areas.  The <Col N="485" /> letter of T. J. Barrington to <i>The Irish Times</i> about a fortnight ago speaks more eloquently than I could about the lack of imagination in that Department.</P>
    <P>May I say, in conclusion, that the stench of politics, of a particularly right-wing kind of politics, of a particularly inhuman kind of politics, runs through the assumptions contained in this Bill. Nothing crystallises the fact that this is a highly political issue with far more involved than simply benevolent attempts to assist Third World countries than a careful perusal of the list of countries in category two, those classified as developing.  The one that I notice that is missing is the richest and most successful Third World country which is Cuba.  Presumably that is either because the Cubans had the good sense to stay out or perhaps because the Americans would not let them in.  I do not know which; the Minister might tell us.  Reading through the list one finds Israel.  I am fascinated by the fact that Israel is seen as a developing country, I am not sure what it is developing. Just below Israel are listed the Ivory Coast, Jamaica and Jordan.  Then there is listed this intriging one &mdash; Kampuchea Democratic.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister know what Kampuchea Democratic represents? Democratic Kampuchea is not the Government of Kampuchea.  It is not even based in Kampuchea.  Democratic Kampuchea is the Khmer Rouge, the second greatest genocidists of this century who managed to massacre between one and two million of their own people and were then finally ejected out of their country by the Vietnamise who are in Kampuchea still only because the Kampucheans are so terrified of so-called Democratic Kampuchea.  The country of Kampuchea is actually the People's Republic of Kampuchea.  Democratic Kampuchea is an exiled Government, funded by the United States and China, which operates from the borders between Thailand and Kampuchea.  It is not even a Government.  It does not even have a foothold in the country and it is there allowed to represent among the poorest, the most deprived and greatest victims of <Col N="486" /> 20th century injustice.  Then I am supposed to believe that this is a benevolent document about international development, about help for poor countries.</P>
    <P>This is a highly political document in which clear political choices and lines are drawn.  As Senator Bulbulia already said, we have pragmatism extended to the nth degree &mdash; with South Africa seen as fit people to give money to help other countries to develop when they spend probably one-quarter of their GNP in destabilising every country within a 500 mile or 1,000 mile radius of their country. Then, on the back of it, we have those who have the blood of millions on their hands allowed to purport to represent one of the most oppressed countries in the world.</P>
    <P>I am not defending in any way anything about the present Government of Kampuchea. I am simply saying that there is a Government in Kampuchea, that the people who call themselves Democratic Kampuchea are the greatest terrorists the world has known, who have massacred a million or two million of their own people not by accident, not by mistake but quite deliberately in campaigns of extermination and mass murder; but because international politics dictates that they are seen to be the representatives of Kampuchea, in here, in what is supposed to be an innocuous benevolent document about Official Development Aid, we find them allowed to represent Kampuchea. I am intrigued as to what they are doing. Is there going to be foreign investment in the refugee camps or what are they doing there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to this in more detail on Committee Stage.  I should love the Minister to explain to me the logic under which Democratic Kampuchea, which is a Government in exile, feared by its own people, supported by the United States and China with no territory and no foothold in Kampuchea, is allowed to become a participant in what is supposed to be an agreement about <Col N="487" /> Official Development Aid.  It has got nothing to do with development but everything to do with politics.  Incidentally, this country has a good record on the issue of Democratic Kampuchea and the realities of life.  At least we do not vote to keep them in the United Nations where they occupy the seat of Kampuchea.  At least we abstain which is something progressive but to allow that to happen, to allow them to be inserted there, is a statement about values, about ideology, about a lot of things.</P>
      <P>It underlines how pragmatic is this Bill in one way.  It is pragmatic about the truth because, to insert Democratic Kampuchea in there, is to fly in the face of the truth.  It is pragmatic about human rights because it does not care about South Africa and does not care about Democratic Kampuchea.  Of course all of this would be fine if the Minister could say: these are the realities of life but the realities of life have not prevented the World Bank from discriminating against Nicaragua because the United States does not like it.  Therefore, what we actually have here is another instrument to maintain a particular view of the world in the face of the realities obtaining.  It is an outrageous attempt to pretend that this is somehow a benevolent Bill meant to benevolently help development.</P>
      <P>It is an inadequate Bill.  It is incomplete in its thinking.  It contains a considerable number of clauses that I hope the Minister will be able to explain to me.  I cannot see their purpose or understand their ramifications at all.  The bottom line is that it is based on an inadequate philosophy, an inadequate set of values. Above all, it is based on a view of development which flies in the face of most of the experience of the past 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on introducing this Bill in the House.  Its provisions will help to alleviate poverty in other countries, allowing them an opportunity to borrow some money.  Rather than seek charity they can borrow and repay these borrowings. Its provisions will provide much badly needed infrastructure and services in those countries.</P>
      <P>We hear much talk about cutbacks in overseas aid.  Therefore, it is difficult to understand opposition to this Bill.  It amazes me that we say on the one hand we should give more charity but on the other hand say: we should not allow people to borrow, that they should be independent and make their own way. The provisions of this Bill will afford them some independence but then I have to say that socialist policy and philosophy always amuse and intrigue me.  I just cannot recall the name of that great professor who spent his life preaching socialism. At the end of his days he realised the truth and wrote: socialism is preached by a class of people whom socialism itself would destroy.  It always amazes me that many people today who preach socialism all over this country, who attack our bishops, and clergy are all people who have from two to four paypackets coming in. Yet I never hear of them giving any away. There are some in Sligo County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It must be absolutely free because every one of them engages in the same old prattle.  They follow the same line of thought.

      <P>I am talking about the socialist philosophy in general and the type of people I hear preaching it right across our country.  I do not purport to be an expert on high finance.  I am not going to get involved in that aspect.  God knows, the management of household moneys and little business matters is as much as I can accomplish reasonably successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is a very wide ideal.  I am pleased that Ireland is joining with countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to provide capital and guarantees to international organisations, to provide moneys for many infrastructures and services within those developing countries. It is preferable to give such countries the money, allow them develop and repay, than continually give them handouts. Gorbachev is beginning to realise that the philosophies pushed on to people in Russia for many years were a failure.  He is now giving land back to the Russian people, telling them to go out and till that land because they realise that their country is bankrupt.  They have experienced all sorts of problems we have never encountered here.  For so long they kept events in Russia under wraps and nobody knew what was happening.  We did not know what was happening there &mdash; now we are getting some sight of events there. <Col N="491" /> When all is said and done capitalism, with all its faults and follies, might be the best way for people to learn how to work, earn money, invest it and develop.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill afford an opportunity to many of those poor countries to develop in a way they would not have had in the past.  I am delighted Ireland is playing its part and becoming involved in the economies of those Third World countries.  When we look at television we see the terrible starvation, poverty and conditions those people endure. Yet had they the money to provide such facilities for themselves there is no reason they would not be self-supporting, even exporting in order to provide a better standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that such aid has been talked about since 1950 and only now coming to fruition.  I congratulate the Government on their initiative in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the convention will involve research, innovation and investment opportunities.  This is important because many of those countries have not engaged in research to date.  Many do not even realise what is their potential, they have not a clue.  Now, they will be able to engage experts of one kind or another &mdash; economists, engineers or others &mdash; who will be able to undertake the necessary research, advise them on how they can help themselves, how they can develop all the potential within their territories. Money spent in that way will be well spent.  There is no way such countries could harness that type of expertise and manpower except through some form of loan being made available by this agency.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on their initiative and foresight in introducing this Bill.  I would ask them not to be too worried about some of the criticism raised here today.  We are in good company when we are being criticised continually, when we are grouped with our bishops and priests.  Remember that our bishops, priests and nuns have done a tremendous amount for our poor, have given of their own time and energy for low pay or none.  Were it not for them, <Col N="492" /> many of their critics, today might not have had any education.  They should remember that they might have a hod on their backs or shovels in their hands were it not for the good education provided by many priests and nuns throughout the length and breadth of this country.  It is a bad dog that bites the hand that feeds it.  That is exactly the analogy to be drawn in the case of many people who criticise. I regret that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Government not to be diverted from their course in any way. They are doing a good job and should be allowed to continue to do so.  They are now going to do a good job for the Third World.  I am delighted they are proceeding along that path.  Long may they remain on it.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Farrell who is, as we all know, one of the most respected and decent Members of this House, but I was a little surprised at the line he was taking. I am afraid his last remarks in particular sent alarm bells ringing in my head.  I felt he must have a very poor argument when he starts sending up smokescreens like those he was emitting in the last few minutes.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that some of the major critics of the Government's abysmal performance on development aid over the past few years &mdash; I do not mean the bishops, the bishops are too cute for that &mdash; have been the priests and the nuns who have been working in the field, the workers themselves, who have seen the decline in the overall contribution from this country to Official Development Aid.  All any Member of this House has to do is talk to the people working on the ground, who are at the hard end of all of this, to realise the sense of disappointment many of them feel at the reversal of policy in recent years.  They feel a shame that in the orgy of cost-cutting in which the country is indulging at present, we have not been able to safeguard this area which in the past, in spite of cuts in other areas, was always preserved and in many cases helped more in difficult times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> It is in the nature of such people that they do not go public, that they do not issue statements and so forth, that they make their views known elsewhere. Senator Farrell, I am sure, has many friends among the nuns, the priests and the other workers who have done us all proud over the years.  Neither Senator Ryan nor anybody else was making any criticism of these people.  If Senator Farrell approaches them and talks to them, he will get a full picture of what they feel about all of this.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan, if I am not misquoting him, I am a little surprised at the new found vow of silence of so many of our bishops on this subject.  The strict observance of the vow of silence which they seem to have imposed upon themselves sits rather at variance with their performance through the lifetime of the previous Government &mdash; that is just in response to the remarks of Senator Farrell. I would say, of course, that one exception to all of this among the bishops has been the bishop of Galway, Dr. Eamonn Casey, who has been critical of this Government and critical of the last Government; he has not pulled his punches in what he had to say.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael welcome the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill, not only because it is a useful addition to the range of instruments available to us in helping those in the Third World but also because it does give us a chance to discuss the abysmal performance of the Government in this area. This Bill gives Third World countries the opportunity to help themselves by producing more goods and sending them overseas.  It is, therefore, preferable to merely doling out money in the form of aid to try to keep them satisfied in their present position.</P>
    <P>The Bill does have one major shortcoming. It tends to benefit middle income developing countries and it does little or nothing for the least developed countries. This, coupled with the massive cuts, and they have been massive, in the Government's bilateral aid programme, means that the Irish Government aid to the poorest of the poor in these countries <Col N="494" /> targeted for Irish bilateral aid, Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho and Sudan, is now at a disgracefully low level.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael left office in 1987 the overseas aid programme had increased to about £45 million.  There had been slow but steady progress towards the attainment of the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  Senator Farrell must recognise this as a fact.  Fianna Fáil in office have undone all of that progress.  In 1988 the Government slashed Official Development Aid by 26 per cent.  Irish aid to the Third World fell from £43 million in 1987 to £32 million in 1988, leaving Irish aid at the lowest level it had been since 1981 when Fianna Fáil had previously been in power.  This is a cut of 26 per cent in aid compared with a reduction in total Exchequer expenditure of less than 6 per cent.  That is where the axe really fell.</P>
    <P>About half of Ireland's aid is consequent on membership of the European Community and the UN and cannot, therefore, be cut no matter how much the Minister and others might like to do so.  The cuts have fallen disproportionately on the other half of the programme; bilateral aid to individual Third World countries which has been cut by £11 million indicating that the Government sees aid to those suffering from hunger, malnutrition and starvation as the soft option.</P>
    <P>In recently published estimates our official aid was again severely attacked leaving us in the shameful position of being third lowest of the OECD countries in the provision of aid.  The bilateral aid fund has again been slashed by 10 per cent in the 1989 Estimates.  As in 1988, the Government have allotted a ridiculously small sum of £1,000 for disaster relief aid.</P>
    <P>I could mention the shameful situation of the pledges given to the members of Irish Shipping, that their pension rights would be safeguarded, that an Irish marine service would be restored.  In this as in so many other areas this Government have broken their commitment to aid to developing countries.  The difference is that the people who are suffering from these cuts cannot complain to <Col N="495" /> their local TDs or to their local Senators. They cannot write to the press, they cannot march on the Dáil, they are not in a position to call press conferences in or outside the House.  They are unable to defend themselves from these harsh measures.  They depend on the elected representatives of the Irish people in this House.  They depend on us to cry &ldquo;no&rdquo;, to say that we will not stand for further cuts in Official Development Aid; to say that this Government must stop picking on the poorest of the poor because these cuts will cause death.</P>
    <P>That is the stark reality as we talk here in this comfortable House in November 1988.  The cuts which have come about in Official Development Aid do mean death, death that could have been avoided had they not been made.  We have to ask ourselves if we can stand by and let this happen.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude on the whole question of our official aid programme has been both cynical and hypocritical. For example, in 1975 Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, Foreign Affairs spokesman, said that Fianna Fáil would and I quote &ldquo;set aside year after year the appropriate sum to ensure that we reach at least the target set by the Minister.  &ldquo;That is 0.35 per cent of GNP within five years.  Thirteen years later we are moving down from rather than towards this target which is still much lower than the UN target of 0.7 per cent.  Similarly, in 1982 the present Taoiseach dismissed the reappointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid as superfluous.  He described the appointment as being supernumerary.  But in 1984, when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, Deputy Charles Haughey had the gall to claim that the problem of famine in Africa was of such proportions that Ireland should have a full Cabinet Minister to deal with it.  Such an appointment has not been made to date by the Fianna Fáil Government. Maybe in the upcoming reshuffle the Minister might suggest to the Taoiseach that such an appointment might well at this stage be appropriate.</P>

      <P>What an excellent idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister seeing the size of the problem could not but support the idea of a Cabinet Minister with responsibility in this area and certainly we, on this side of the House, would give full support to that idea.  I would be interested to see the Minister express his support for it.</P>
      <P>The question is whether we in Ireland have an obligation, as the 27th richest country in the world, to the people of the poorest countries, four of which &mdash; Tanzania, Lesotho, Zambia and Sudan are targeted by our bilateral aid programme. On what moral basis can we accept our entitlements to European Community support for the poorest regions of the Community, of which we are one, when we ignore the plight of those in a much worse position than ourselves such as the people of Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Sudan?  Surely, and we all agree on this, we have a moral obligation as a Christian country to help those millions of people in need, to try to narrow the gap in living standards between the industrialised countries and those of the Third World?</P>
      <P>Obviously, the ordinary people of Ireland, the generality of people in this country, believe that we have such a responsibility to those in developing countries.  The Irish people are known for their generosity in contributing to organisations such as Trocaire, Concern and GOAL who help in such a constructive, structured and organised way the starving people of the Third World. The Irish contributed more money <i>per capita</i> in Live Aid than any other nation gaining us recognition worldwide for this contribution.  The attitude of our people is reflected in the results of a survey carried out for Trocaire in October 1987 where almost three-quarters of those surveyed favoured the Government giving aid to the Third World, even in the current climate of recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting how the device of opinion polls is able to tell us something <Col N="497" /> which we all perhaps intuitively recognise: for example, the intuitive negative reaction to the way in which the national lottery has been abused but also in a positive way, the sense in which people would be prepared even in difficult times to give more to causes which they see as manifestly just and deserving.  The Fianna Fáil cuts in the overseas development agency budget not only crippled the people of the Third World but also genuinely offend and embarrass large sections of the Irish people who do not like to see their Government being so niggardly, so parsimonious, so cheeseparing, so mean, when they themselves are prepared to give so much to individual organisations.</P>
    <P>Although the primary motive for giving Official Development Aid is moral and humanitarian, it has to be remembered that such aid does not constitute a one-way traffic.  There is a return to the country at many levels, including the financial level.  For example a recent DEVCO report indicates the substantial overseas earnings mainly in the developing world of our semi-State bodies now totalling about £100 million.  The developing countries provide a growing market for Irish exports.  In 1987, of the £17.29 million provided by Ireland as bilateral assistance to developing countries, approximately 70 per cent, over £12 million, was spent either on goods and services in Ireland or as payment to Irish personnel working with the bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, bilateral aid also helps Irish companies compete in international markets generally by creating a positive impression of Ireland abroad and by providing Irish companies and personnel with vital expertise and the opportunity to demonstrate this expertise to prospective multilateral clients.  Thus, Fianna Fáil's drastic cutting of the Official Development Aid budget means more than the loss of vital development resources to the poor in the Third World, it also involves a loss of international credibility and moral authority in Ireland and a number of economic costs not the least of which is the threatening of the <Col N="498" /> jobs of over 600 people currently employed as a result of Irish bilateral assistance.  A reduction of the ODA budget, therefore, involves a far smaller saving to the economy than might at first sight appear to be the case.  It is, again, one of these false economies.  It looks bigger on paper.  When the hidden costs are investigated, in fact, in many ways, apart from the moral implications, it is a false saving.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Minister to reverse immediately the present trend in Irish Government aid to the developing world. It is yet another national disgrace, caused by the Government, that overseas aid should be slashed so drastically at a time when malnutrition and infant mortality is increasing in many countries.  With over 500 million chronically hungry in the Third World and 25 children dying every minute, the Irish Government can no longer pursue the present policy of milking the ODA budget for all it is worth.</P>
    <P>The ODA budget is about to run dry. Official Development Aid is crucial for Ireland's priority aid recipients.  Cuts in this such as the ones suggested in the Book of Estimates will cost lives.  I am calling on the Minister to try to bring about a drastic change in Fianna Fáil's attitude to such aid.  It cannot be regarded as a soft target.  The budget must be returned at least to its 1987 level of 0.25 per cent of GNP and the Government must commit itself to seeking an all-party approach to a phased increase in our aid, with a time table agreed for the attainment of the UN target.  Otherwise Fianna Fáil's policy will continue to endanger and even cost lives in the Third World.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have to say that one of the most retrograde steps taken by the Government was their refusal to re-establish an all-party committee on development aid.  That committee in the last Oireachtas was, I believe, the most successful of all the Oireachtas committees. It focused public and official attention on the problem, it raised consciousness to a hitherto unknown level, it acted as a force to educate people from all parties as to the realities of development aid and the politics of Third World <Col N="499" /> countries.  It was a genuine force for good in this House and some of its most active members were those who are today on the Government side.  The decision not to reconstitute that committee was a cowardly, shortsighted decision.  It was done perhaps because it was felt that such a committee might be an embarrassment or perhaps the Government did not want well-informed criticism coming from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The failure to re-establish that committee, together with the continued failure to establish a committee on foreign affairs, indicates the poverty of thinking of this Government in this area, their unwillingness to submit themselves to detailed searching criticism from backbenchers and from members of all parties in the House.  But more than all of that, they are losing an opportunity to develop public opinion in a positive way to allow these committees to become agents for change so that this country can go back to being where it was a small number of years ago, a country moving in the right direction, seeking to fulfil decent targets in our obligation to provide aid to these countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. All afternoon I have listened with great interest to the speeches that have been made and I support and sympathise with almost all of them.  Senator Ryan made a very telling speech, as also did Senator Manning.  I subscribe to the view that we need to make a determined effort to reach our commitment of, I think, 0.07 per cent of GNP as a contribution towards the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it is a positive development and an encouragement to multinationals or private companies, to invest in Third World countries.  I have had the advantage over the past ten years of visiting some 27 or 28 of the African countries.  I heartily concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Manning, who deplored the dropping of the Joint Committee on Development Aid because in my view no speaker, no matter how eloquent or how <Col N="500" /> accomplished in letters, can adequately describe the abject poverty, the oppression, the usury, the slavery or semi-slavery in every modern form under which millions of people are forced to exist.</P>
    <P>More Oireachtas Members should have an opportunity of visiting the under-developed countries and the media, who so quickly denigrate any and every mission abroad as a junket, ought to examine their role in the scandal of diminishing Irish contributions to under-developed countries and to the emerging nations.  I would call on the Department to expose Members of the Oireachtas, right-wing, left-wing or centre, to the stench of human poverty and have them visit these refugee camps, some of which have been there for 20, 25 and 30 years and possibly longer.  No Irish person can truthfully say: &ldquo;We have never heard of Ethiopia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those of us who have had the opportunity of seeing Third World countries recognise the contribution in human effort that so many Irish people, both religious and lay, make in these situations. I would venture to say that even the most ardent tax dodger would have a different view if it could be brought home to him what the Irish contribution would mean.  We are a Christian country with a particular sense of value of which we are proud but there is a missing dimension if we do not play our part and give a lead and shame the other countries who are financially capable of making a much bigger contribution because most of those large countries have milked those countries dry for several hundred years.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>In this House for several years we have had impassioned speeches and pleas on cutbacks in Government services.  There is one thing I can guarantee.  You cannot cut back Government services in 40 countries on the African Continent because the services scarcely exist.  You may have to travel several hundred miles to a clinic, not to mention a hospital.  We are talking about a different ball game.  Clean water is a luxury.</P>
    <P>Our missionaries for the past 50 years have done marvellous work.  They have <Col N="501" /> been joined since the sixties by lay people.  The late President Kennedy made it fashionable to give of one's time to Third World activities.  He encouraged young people to donate a couple of years of their lives to this work.</P>
    <P>Last August when I had the honour to represent this House at the inaugural meeting of the new Houses of Parliament in Canberra I took the opportunity <i>en route</i> of visiting a couple of African countries on behalf of a charity with which I am associated.  What a small number of people can achieve there is very encouraging. People would indeed be very generous if they could see what a measly contribution, even a ten penny piece, can do to improve the quality of life of so many people out there.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because I hope it will encourage investment in all of these countries.  I do not subscribe to the strong views expressed by Senator Ryan on the composition of the list of countries in category two.  Even if we get a partial improvement under this, we can carry the categories that some people might find objectionable.  In the entire area of the Third World the small print does not count for very much.  I hope this Bill will have the result that is intended.</P>
    <P>From a cursory glance at the Bill it is obvious that my old friends in Finance are taking a very firm grip on this piece of legislation, just like everything else. That is a great pity.  The Department of Foreign Affairs have a network of embassies and listening posts and indeed development structures.  It is a pity that this year they had to close one or two of those offices that were spearheading important work in some of the African countries.  It is a pity we did not take the opportunity in this legislation of strengthening the operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the Irish contribution from here on will be stronger.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to enable this country to honour our financial obligations. We have to be prepared now as Europeans to harmonise our laws and to <Col N="502" /> participate in every form of legislation that caters for peripheral areas.  Major industrial development looks after those who are lucky enough to be covered by legislation.  I am glad to see this Government introducing legislation that will provide for peripheral areas.  The difficulty that I see, looking forward to 1992, is that we will have giants in Europe that are economically strong and financially organised to survive.  Therefore, there could be serious dangers for small organisations and small industries, that are located in rural parts of Europe including&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Senator has grasped the implications of the Bill. It is not about peripheral areas in Europe, it is about investment in Third World countries.  Maybe there is a misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I am coming to deal with the need to provide for Third World countries and peripheral areas in our own country as well. There has to be a balance.  This Government have to recognise, just as other European Governments have to recognise, that while Third World development is very important, at the very same time there are underdeveloped areas in this country and they have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for somebody to get up and advocate increased expenditure. It is nice to be on the delivery side.  I appreciate the number of agencies that are there.  They call on the Government to provide more all the time but this can only be done as the wealth of our country increases.  I recognise that this country has always participated, perhaps not as much financially as we would have liked. It is important that we are identified as contributors and supporters of the Third World and of those who are economically disadvantaged.  That has been done.  It has been done by agencies who have had a tremendous input.  This country has contributed in a private way.  People went out and organised aid.  They participated <Col N="503" /> in organising and contributing to the Third World.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Government can only contribute finance to the extent that the taxpayer can bear the brunt.  These are difficult times.  We have survived a serious financial recession in this country and, indeed, in Europe.  Those who criticise the Government for not having had a big enough input should remember that it is very easy to call on the Government to contribute more money under different headings and to say that our contribution to the Third World should be greater.  There are a large number of privately organised groups as well as individuals who are in the front line.  They call for ever-increasing amounts of finance to support the worthy work which they are doing on the ground.  It is not possible for the Government, in my opinion, to accede to the requests on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government are doing a great job. They are recognising and financially supporting worthwhile projects.  On every single occasion where there is a serious crisis such as damage by flooding or by earthquakes, the Government are quick to get involved.  This may not involve millions but in proportion to our wealth and to the number of population the Government have never been lacking in making a worthwhile contribution.  That can only be done and measured by the economic situation on the ground in our own country.  We are by no means a wealthy country.  People who call on the Government have to be mindful of the fact that we have a large number of people unemployed in this country.  They are living at subsistence levels.  They are depending on the tax-payer to sustain them.  That has to be borne in mind when the Government are legislating and making provision for contributions to the Third World.  It is nice to be part of the campaign but one has to be realistic.  Aid has to be paid for by those who are already contributing out of their weekly income.  It is very commendable work.</P>
    <P>This country has to develop its natural resources.  I hope that as we develop our natural resources here we will commit <Col N="504" /> ourselves to an ever-increasing contribution to the Third World.  That is our dearest wish, but it does not go down well with organisations of any kind or bishops or people who are very committed.  All of us see the television pictures.  All of us see the need.  This is a matter that really touches the hearts of the people and one does not have to use too much pressure or persuasion.  This is a very sensitive area.  I commend the Government because they are mindful of the fact that there has to be a balanced approach.  It is a very important matter and one that has to be pursued very carefully.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill, I commend the Minister for his alertness and awareness and for participating by the contribution that he and the Government can make to Third World development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to sincerely thank all the Senators for their very wide-ranging remarks.  Some were very positive and some seemed to blame the Government for world poverty.  It is the responsibility collectively of all the developing nations. Many Senators have referred during the course of this debate to our deteriorating Official Development Aid performance. There are a few points which I would like to make in response to that charge.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government's contribution to development aid increased steadily through the 1970s and the early 1980s, rising from 0.08 per cent of GNP in 1975 to 0.25 per cent in 1985, a ten-year period.  The very severe financial difficulties facing the country had made it necessary for the Government to cut back spending on all programmes, even the most desirable.  In this context the provision for Official Development Aid for 1988 has had to be reduced to £32.6 million, a reduction of £6.5 million below the 1987 outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there have been significant improvements on some fronts, the economic situation is still such that the Government must continue to adopt a restrictive approach to all spending programmes. However, it has been possible <Col N="505" /> to increase the provision for Official Development Aid to £33.7 million.  This would keep it at 0.18 per cent of GNP the same percentage as this year.  This is as generous an amount as economic circumstances permit.  It is sufficient to maintain a basic programme of assistance to developing countries.  I should add that Ireland is meeting all existing commitments under our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>Looking at our Official Development Aid performance, it is important to bear in mind the fact that our aid programme is wholly in the form of grants and that it is not tied to the provision of supply or other contracts to Irish agencies or companies. Official Development Aid from other countries can involve, and often does, a mixture of loans and grants and is sometimes tied in the way in which I have indicated.  There are no strings like that attached to Ireland's contribution.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this matter we should not overlook the substantial contribution of the various non-governmental organisations which are active in this field and to which many Senators have referred. Indeed, I was very impressed with the contribution made by Senator Bulbulia and the reference she made to the efforts of the people of Waterford for Sudan during the month of September.  Many similar organisations throughout the country are doing trojan work.  It is indicative of the spirit and the humane approach of the Irish people over the years and over the centuries which has continued in modern times.  We can all take pride in that and hope it will continue in the future.  We always seem to be able to give priority to those in need, both at home and abroad, irrespective of the demands that are placed on ourselves at any time.</P>
    <P>Assistance from these sources does not count as Official Development Aid. However, the activities of the various voluntary organisations are a very particular feature of this country's aid performance and should be reckoned as such.  In reply to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil on this Bill the Minister for Finance, Deputy Mr. MacSharry said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> I would like to put on the record of the House that we have honoured all our commitments in this year and last year....  When Deputies made their contributions about what we can do for the developing countries in the Third World generally everybody who spoke said they were all in favour of fiscal measures, financial control and order in the public finances... not one Deputy has said where we could get the extra few million pounds....</P>
    <P>This was in respect of Official Development Aid.  Similarly, we had many contributions today from Senators who castigated the Government.  That is their privilege and is the privilege of any Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the performance of the Government. Nobody has mentioned that there is a serious financial crisis.  We are being extricated from that crisis by a very dedicated, co-ordinated Government. Nobody has been able to identify where we can get the extra resources that are needed to meet all our commitments right across the board.  We have a difficulty in that many organisations and individuals, both religious and lay, constantly demand resources from the Government and from Government agencies both at home and abroad, and particularly at home, so that we can eliminate poverty in our own country.</P>
    <P>It is said that if there was a common approach and a strong political will it should be possible to eliminate poverty in one fell swoop within one year.  It may be possible to do that.  That would be a major political decision with serious connotations.  To do that one would have to fold up some Department or abolish some Government agency which receives major State funding and put that funding into the poverty area.  By doing that the Government could make an artificial contribution towards eliminating poverty, which would eventually lead to permanent poverty.</P>
    <P>The political pragmatism that is needed must be such that the Government of the day must give priority to the demands that are there.  They must <Col N="507" /> ensure that the needs which are there are supplied with the necessary resources, taking into account the priorities attaching to each demand and taking into account the financial responsibility, the political responsibility and the moral responsibility that we have to our own people and to the people in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia suggested that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should take over responsibility for MIGA.  The position here is that the Minister for Finance has statutory responsibility for our relationships with the World Bank and its existing affiliated agencies.  This responsibility derives from the Breton Woods Act of 1957 and the International Development Association Act of 1960. On this basis, it is only logical and proper that the Minister for Finance should have similar responsibility in relation to MIGA.  It is the newest agency in the World Bank group.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with Senator Bulbulia's views on the nature of the South African régime, the fact is that South Africa remains a member of the World Bank and, as such, it is entitled to participate in affiliates of the World Bank.  I would point out, however, that South Africa has not yet signed, never mind ratified, the MIGA convention.  Neither for that matter has Kampuchea.  It is useful to note also that Ireland signed the MIGA Convention in 1986 and to recall that Senator Bulbulia commended the role which the then Minister for Finance, Mr. John Bruton, played in developing the MIGA Convention and bringing forward this Act.  I commend him, too, and say that he, in that Government as Minister for Finance, played a similar role to the job now being done by Deputy MacSharry in relation to this same matter.  Obviously, that means that this is a financial matter.  It is a matter to be handled by the Minister for Finance and not by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Consequently, that is why this Department are handling this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Senator Ryan, in a very wide-ranging speech, posed many questions.  In particular, he posed the question as to whether or not investment <i>per se</i> is necessarily a good thing.  In reply to that point, I wish to remind the Senator that investments will be guaranteed by MIGA only when the prior consent of the host country has been given.  This is a specific provision to ensure that the particular investment will accord with the development plans of that country.  It is there as a clear security valve to ensure that potential investors cannot utilise the opportunities or the resources, be they physical or otherwise, or, indeed, the conditions to make a vast amount of money on their investment to the detriment of the developing country.  This provision is there and we fully accept it.</P>
    <P>The Members of the House can be assured that until agreement is reached between MIGA, the host country and the developer investor and until such time as the investor accepts the conditions laid down, then no sanction or guarantee will be available for any investment, development or project.  I should also like to mention that MIGA will give particular priority to investments by developing countries in developing countries.  It should not be used merely as a channel for investments from the industrial North to the less developed South.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned Cuba and the reasons why they were not in, whether it was by choice or by some other body's involvement.  He did not say, or give any indication, as to whether they should or should not be in.  This is purely a matter for each country.  I could not give any reasons why Cuba are not in.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to generalise and to say that a Bill like this does not make a contribution to developing countries.  We must appreciate the fact that developed countries, industrialised nations and countries like Ireland are constantly trying to develop and expand and to ensure that equality of opportunity prevails for all.  We are making a special contribution in a very structured, organised, formalised manner to ensure that we as we have developed and have the <Col N="509" /> expertise and the resources &mdash; though they may be small &mdash; are making resources available in a very honourable way.  We are making a positive contribution to developing less well-off countries who are not able to develop themselves without international co-operation, without international assistance, be it by way of financial resources and structures or in the way of expertise, technology and other assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning contended that MIGA only helped middle income countries and that it would be of no assistance to low income countries.  I fail to see how the Senator could reach such a conclusion. Obviously, low income countries such as Bangladesh, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Sudan and Zambia think differently, because they have already ratified the MIGA Convention which is proof positive of how important they see this convention.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was very critical of what he alleged was a one-dimensional economic approach to the problems of underdevelopment and Third World poverty. The Senator's view of the activities of the World Bank and its affiliates in trying to solve these problems is over-simplified. The fact is that the World Bank consciously and positively takes the problem of poverty into account in framing its development programme for these countries. It is an indication of its commitment in this area that a poverty action programme is now an integral part of the Bank's overall development programme for low income countries.</P>
    <P>The Bank is also acutely conscious of the environmental needs of developing countries.  No programme is now formulated without a specific environmental input to it.  I can agree with the examples the Senator gave about the misleading nature of GNP as a measurement of welfare but that issue is not relevant to this Bill which is concerned with increasing the flow of investment to developing countries, thus increasing their output and reducing the poverty of their peoples.</P>
    <P>I note Senator MacDonald, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, has welcomed the scope of this Bill.  As I mentioned in my opening <Col N="510" /> remarks, MIGA is still at a very early stage in its development.  For the Senator's information, I should like to say that about 12 preliminary applications, totalling close to $700 million, have been received by MIGA to date.  Among the proposed investments are mining projects, manufacturing projects, agricultural projects and the development of a financial institution.  As yet, no detailed applications have been received.  No guarantees have issued but we are confident that very positive, humane decisions will be made by MIGA in the final analysis after very detailed, careful consideration and analysis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express my hope that Ireland will shortly be in a position to join those developed and developing countries which have already ratified the MIGA Convention and to unite with these countries in ensuring that the activities of the agency are serving the purposes of all its members and are making a major contribution to the elimination of poverty in the Third World and throughout the world at large.</P>

    <Title>Jewish Community in the Soviet Union: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann &mdash; recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Recalling the final act of the Helsinki conference on security and co-operation in which the participating States undertake to recognise and respect religious, cultural and national freedom and to deal in a positive and humanitarian way with applications to emigrate of persons who wish to reunite with members of their families or to go to their national homeland, and recalling that the concluding document of the <Col N="511" /> Madrid meeting reaffirms and strengthens these undertakings.</P>
    <P>&mdash;While welcoming recent positive developments in the attitude of the Soviet Union towards its Jewish minority nevertheless is disturbed by reports of continuing harassments and anti-Semitism towards Soviet Jews.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Noting that the Jewish community in the Soviet Union is still an oppressed cultural minority subject to systematic discriminatory action by the authorities and considering their position to be a cause for international concern.</P>
    <P>(1)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit all Soviet Jews applying to leave the Soviet Union to do so without impediment and to ensure that the presentation of such applications does not prejudice or modify the rights of the applicants or of members of their families in the areas of employment, housing, resident status, access to social, economic, or educational benefits or any other rights.</P>
    <P>(2)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue Jewish religious, cultural activities which includes the teaching and learning of Hebrew as a national dimension.</P>
    <P>(3)  Calls on the Soviet Union to limit refusals for emigration based on secrecy to a defined period of time.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to say that I very much welcome the fact that the Government have allowed this motion and provided time for it.  I believe it is important that we on this side of the House should not always be carping or critical of the Government and their attitude on these matters.  I would like to say that I am very grateful that the Government have taken this motion in the name of myself, Senator Bulbulia and a number of others.  I would like also to point out that if the Government wish to adopt certain other items that we have put down <Col N="512" /> on the clár we would be very happy to make these available.  I say that, not just humorously, but because I think there are a number of items which also relate to this area.  I will speak about one of them at least later.  That is the suggestion that Raoul Wallenberg, a man of extraordinary eminence and greatness and whose case has been forgotten very largely, should be recognised by this country and made an honorary citizen of Ireland in the manner this has been done in Canada, the United States of America and one or two other countries.  I shall perhaps return to that.</P>
    <P>This is I think, a very appropriate day on which to take this motion because this is, as the Minister knows, the anniversary of a shaming event that took place 50 years ago in Germany, the anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Jewish business premises were attacked by an orchestrated mob who had been provided with the weaponry to cause damage and destruction by organs of the State, such as the fire service.  There is this appalling irony, and I would say and would be happy for it to be on the record of this House, that as a Christian I feel deeply ashamed of what was allowed to happen in Germany in 1938.</P>
    <P>I would also have to say that I do not approach this issue in any spirit of antagonism towards the Soviet Union. This country has friendly relations with that great nation and the movement that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union as an independent republic took a lot of comfort and inspiration from the ideals of Irishmen like James Connolly who helped to establish this State.  I wish it to be understood that I do not wish to be antagonistic or confrontational to a country for whom, like an increasing number of Irish people, I have an affection, a respect and an admiration in many ways and never more so, may I say, than under the régime of now, I understand President Gorbachev.</P>
    <P>I also have to say that none of us in the west is guiltless.  Even this building heard to its shame in 1943 a Member of another House associating himself quite disgracefully with the operations of Adolf <Col N="513" /> Hitler in Germany.  Therefore, none of us can totally distance or detach ourselves from guilt in relation to the persecution of the Jewish people.  I do not, however, wish to speak of a Jewish problem because this phrase can be insulting to the Jewish people.  I wish to speak of certain problems relating to the treatment of a minority of people, citizens of the Soviet Union and it is for this reason that the motion has been quite carefully framed.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware, of course, that a roughly similar motion was passed unanimously by Dáil Éireann on 6 December 1984.  It is an interesting exercise to look at the shift in emphasis from that important Dáil motion which was heavily critical and deeply censorous of the Soviet Union.  The Minister, I am sure, will be aware that is the original wording of this motion tabled over a year ago in Seanad Éireann by myself, Senator Bulbulia, Senator Manning, Senator Robinson, and Senator George Eogan, we followed the lines of the original motion very closely and we were very critical.  We used words such as &ldquo;severe and systematic discriminatory action taken against the Jewish community by the Soviet authorities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Societ Embassy will take an interest in this debate.  I understand they already have and that they have provided briefing material to people who will speak in this debate and I greatly welcome that.  This is a very useful exercise in dialogue.  I am sure the Soviet Embassy will take note of the fact that there has been a change in the direction, of moderation of some of the most severe criticisms.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge also, for example, by deleting an entire paragraph that things have changed in the Soviet Union.  The Minister will note that the entire paragraph which runs as follows:</P>
    <P>Noting the increase in the number of Jews who are being allowed to leave this year which is small compared to the number of those wishing to leave, seriously disturbed by reports of thousands of Soviet Jews who would like <Col N="514" /> to leave the Soviet Union but who, according to the new regulations, cannot even apply unless they have first degree kin, relatives abroad</P>
    <P>has been removed from the motion altogether. In other words, acting responsibly, Seanad Éireann in the form of the sponsors of this motion wish to acknowledge the process of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> that has quite evidently been occurring in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to say that it is enough.  It would be wrong, it would be mean, it would be carping, it would be destructive not to recognise reality in political terms and not to recognise what is happening and what has been happening. We must all admire President Gorbachev for the way in which he has steered his administration through very difficult times.  Nobody here would wish to make his task more difficult but it would be equally irresponsible, simply in order not to cause any disturbance, that we should allow the pressure to be removed altogether because there is still very considerable room for a further amelioration of the position of the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union in terms both of political and cultural rights.</P>
    <P>The emphasis of this motion is clearly on emigration, either for repatriation to Israel or to the country of the citizen's choice, as well as for and the full right to religious and cultural expression.  I had already intended to say that the Irish people, of course, can closely identify with this because of our tragic history, in terms of the repression of a whole culture that was autonomous to the people here in this country, and also the tragic loss of our own language &mdash; and language is one of the principal items of grievance for the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>While I say that we view with encouragement and optimism the Soviet Union's attempt to solve problems concerning Soviet Jews on the levels of emigration, religious and cultural practices and while we are heartened by the fact that Hebrew as a language is now being taught, very recently allowed under the auspices of private enterprise schemes, <Col N="515" /> nevertheless, we want the Hebrew language to be recognised as the proper language of the Jews and to ask that they be allowed to have full access to books, libraries, theatre and seminars embracing their full cultural expression.  It is, I think, also a reasonable request that Jewish schools and chadars, Jewish Sunday schools, should be permitted so that kindergartens may develop to assist children to grow up with an identity of their ethnic culture.  The availability of kosher food, etc., we would feel, should all be sanctioned by the Government as it forms an integral part of Jewish life.  I feel that the question of the cultural life of the Jewish people is an exceedingly important one and one with which, as I have said, I believe the Irish people will find no difficulty whatever in understanding and empathising.</P>
    <P>I have to place on record the fact that the Soviet Government have long pursued a policy aimed at suppressing Jewish culture in the Soviet Union and at severing Soviet Jewry from its cultural heritage. A key element of that policy is the effort to deny Jews the right to study the Hebrew language.  Hebrew is the language of the Bible and the official language of the state of Israel.  It is historically the only language to have always been the common property of all Jews everywhere.  A knowledge of Hebrew is indispensable, not only to the practice of Judaism whose liturgy and sacred texts are written in Hebrew but also to secular Jewish culture.  Nevertheless, the Hebrew language has been rendered virtually inaccessible to Soviet Jews through an unpublicised ban enforced by various means.</P>
    <P>I have some very up-to-date information on the methodology by which this repression is still practised in the Soviet Union.  I hope that pressure will now be applied under the terms of various protocols on the Soviet Union to indicate to them that this subtle, invidious process is being closely monitored by us here in the west.  I make the point that the Jewish language is important for dispersed <Col N="516" /> people, it is an important factor in retaining their identity.  It was, of course, and to some extent remains a lingua franca among the Jews just as Latin was to pre-Vatican II Roman Catholicism and just as Latin also was until a couple of hundred years ago the language of international diplomacy.  It is a very important element.</P>
    <P>In the USSR, courses in the Hebrew language exist for certain narrow state purposes as part of the curriculum of three universities.  Jews as a rule &mdash; strangely, bizarrely are excluded from these courses.  They are denied participation in academic courses which explore the roots of their own culture.  This is even implicitly admitted by the Soviet Government themselves in a document prepared with the aim of showing how well Jews fare in the USSR.  In other words, it is incumbent upon us to examine and decode statements emerging from the Soviet Union, even under Mikhail Gorbachev, so that we understand precisely what is going on.  We cannot abrogate that responsibility.  We cannot just simply accept blandly what emerges from the Soviet Union.  It is our moral responsibility to examine and understand what may be going on under the surface.</P>
    <P>According to the document to which I have just referred, Hebrew is taught at Soviet higher educational establishments which train philologists or orientalists; for instance, at the Institute of Asia and Africa, affiliated to Moscow University, and at the University of Tbilisi and Leningrad. What about those who wish to study Hebrew for purposes other than philology or orientology?  I would like to make it plain that I do not intend, and it would be deeply insulting and wrong for me, to draw a parallel between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.  I really do not want to do that at all.  However, I have to point out that this freedom existed even in Nazi Germany, that it was possible to study oriental and semitic languages and even a person such as Adolf Eichman had studied and was familiar with the philology of Hebrew and the other semitic languages.  So it is, if I may use a phrase of the people, no big deal to <Col N="517" /> allow the study of philology or orientology in relation to Hebrew.</P>
    <P>Officially approved Hebrew instruction is available elsewhere only in a few Christian religious seminaries and Soviet Jews are thus denied the opportunity to study Hebrew, except for those few private enterprise classes that now appear, I am glad to say, to be springing up.  No textbooks of the Hebrew language are produced in the USSR and virtually no books of any kind in Hebrew have been published there for over 50 years.  That is an astonishing statement.  Indeed, almost no books at all are published on Jewish history and culture and there is also no institutional framework of any kind where Jews may study topics of Jewish interest.  Private seminars devoted to Jewish subjects in the past have been forcibly repressed by the police.</P>
    <P>Again, a little later on I hope to be able to place this in the context of international law.  I do not wish to make a song and dance about this kind of repression without demonstrating very clearly to the Minister how, under international instruments, it would be possible to apply pressure legally, the legal framework in which this can be done.  In addition broadcasts of Israel Radio, which are of a general educational character and which seek to transmit information on Jewish history and culture, are also systematically jammed.  I say that because I believe it comes under the Helsinki Agreement.</P>
    <P>I really intend and hope to be as responsible as possible, and it is important to state without going into it in too great detail that the treatment of the Jews in Soviet Russia must be distinguished and separated from the question of certain developments in the Middle East, particularly relating to Israel.  That is, in my opinion, a separate and different matter.  It is one which I hope this House will have the opportunity to address later on, and it is one I have no doubt to which the Foreign Affairs Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas will address themselves.  I am glad to see such a positive and pleasant expression flickering across the Minister's face and I know that <Col N="518" /> he will take this opportunity to welcome the establishment of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I would be most interested in receiving his help and encouragement on this very important committee that has, as he knows, been established.  I want to reiterate that there is no intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we better not get into parsing and analysis because there might be a possibility that &ldquo;book-serology&rdquo; would raise its head again and that might damage the dignity of the House.  I want to reiterate that I separate the question of the tragic events in the Middle East from the question of the cultural and political rights of Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Throughout the length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not one single officially recognised school with Hebrew as its language of instruction.  A small informal private Jewish kindergarten in Moscow where very young children were taught the rudiments of Hebrew was forcibly closed by the police in 1983.  Of course I am well aware that this is pre-Gorbachev but still it is worth placing on the record that it is a mere five years ago. Several other efforts by Jewish parents to organise extra curricular classes for their children have met with varying degrees of success.  However, even in the best of cases only a minuscule number of children is involved.  I would like to place on the record of the House the words of somebody who actually has personal experience of this.  I would like to quote from information supplied by a Jewish mother and long-time refusenik who describes the existing situation in her country as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the attempts of Jewish refuseniks to create children's groups where Jewish children can play together, acquire some knowledge of Jewish history, culture and traditions, learn about Jewish holidays, and learn the <Col N="519" /> Hebrew language, have been suppressed by various authorities using all sorts of pretexts.  The people who have selflessly undertaken the difficult task of organising such groups have been given strict warnings about the possible consequences that they could face.</P>
    <P>Given the total absence of Jewish schools and the almost complete lack of Jewish cultural and religious textbooks, even in the Russian language, the overwhelming majority of Jewish children, even those whose parents identify actively as Jews have almost no opportunity to learn about their Jewish heritage.  They experience anti-semitism and anti-zionism in greater or lesser degrees depending on the fluctuations of the political climate from the Soviet authorities and Soviet society but are unable to learn the corresponding, very positive side, of the inheritence of Jewish culture.</P>
    <P>In response to this they have attempted to create their own private classes, in informal groups.  This, of course, will strike another echo with Irish people for does it not remind us of the hedge schools where Irish people, also deprived of access to that most precious of gifts, education in their own culture, background and civilisation, had to resort to the hedgerows of this country because they would not yield up that essential human right, the right to knowledge of their own cultural background.</P>
    <P>The authorities have sought in the past, including in the very recent past, effective means to suppress such private Hebrew instruction by Jews without openly forbidding it.  They seem to have decided that the private teaching of Hebrew alone in contrast to the private teaching of all other languages &mdash; and again and again one comes back to the fact of the special treatment of the Jewish people &mdash; is not to be regarded as a legitimate employment. Newspapers have refused to accept advertisements for Hebrew lessons and the offices of the Ministery of Finance have rebuffed the efforts of private Hebrew teachers to pay income tax on their earnings.  That is most extraordinary <Col N="520" /> and bizarre, people actually queue up to pay income tax and a Government agency refusing to collect it because it has been earned by the teaching of a language of which they apparently disapprove. Only in novels have I recently come across anything quite so bizarre.  It is worrying.  The only parallel that I could remember, and I suppose it is mildly frivolous, is the intense embarrassment caused to certain local French authorities when prostitutes queued up to pay their income tax and the French state was terrified of being accused in the vulgar press of living on immoral earnings.  That is the only parallel I can think of.  It is not just absurd, I am sorry to say it is sinister.</P>
    <P>Until the end of 1986 private Hebrew teachers and their pupils were subjected to all manner of harassment, persecution and even imprisonment.  Hebrew books and educational materials were on numerous occasions confiscated.  Yosif Begun of Moscow, as an example to others, was sentenced to years of exile as a parasite, his teaching of Hebrew not even being considered &ldquo;socially useful labour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By all of the means outlined, the Soviet authorities attempted systematically to destroy any infrastructure for the informal teaching of Hebrew and the dissemination of the Jewish heritage among Jews.  Similar barriers are not constructed for any of the other languages which are officially taught.  However, the attitude of hostility has tended to subside in recent months.  Prison sentences are no longer likely but the overall behaviour of the Soviet authorities with regard to the study of Hebrew and Jewish culture and religion in general continues to be hostile and discouraging.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to information I recently received about attempts to create a Hebrew school in a region of the Soviet Union, in a town called Baku. I have received information about this, where young Hebrew teachers applied for and were given permission to hold classes in modern Hebrew in a rail-wayman's trade union called <i>Udarnik.</i> This was a matter of great excitement and so they overcame the various official <Col N="521" /> difficulties presented in their way.  Then in July they were evicted because it was felt by the authorities that repair and redecoration work was vitally necessary on this building.  The organisers, Mikhail Dvorkin, Lev Fuks and David Khants-kashvili, had protested fiercely that other language courses, Pharsee, Arabic and Azerbaidzhani were not being interrupted, only Hebrew appeared to be a matter for interior decoration.  The protest is being given backing by a former organiser of the classes, Vladimir Zeev Farber, who has written to President Mikhail Gorbachev from Israel, where he managed to emigrate a few weeks ago and I quote from part of his letter:</P>
    <P>It is not for me to tell you about the situation of Jewish culture in the USSR, or about the persecutions to which Hebrew teachers were subjected not so long ago.  Thus, the appearance of official Hebrew courses in Baku was understood by public opinion in the West as the beginning of the long expected changes in the authorities' policies in relation to the Jews.</P>
    <P>These courses also had special significance because they were the first and for the time being the only experience of successful co-operation between the authorities and an informal Jewish movement...</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, after several sessions the courses were closed under the pretext of remodelling work having to be done... I am convinced that this is either a misunderstanding or another attempt by opponents of the new policies to turn the clock back.  I cannot believe that anyone in the Soviet Union seriously believes that the study of the Hebrew language is contrary to the principles of socialism.</P>
    <P>I know that my friends in Baku will try to reopen the Hebrew courses in one of the city's clubs in the fall.  I ask you to remove from their path the senseless obstacles remaining from the time of stagnation.  As we all know it is difficult to remove these kinds of bureaucratic obstacles.</P>
    <P>President Gorbachev is attempting to <Col N="522" /> remove just such bureaucratic obstructions in the economic field.  We are all with him in this courageous attempt.  We do not blame him personally.  We regard him as an important beacon of hope.  But we wish to encourage him to apply the same vigour in removing these other parallel and equally unjustified obstacles in the cultural field.  We feel that this is an exceedingly important measure of the reality that underlies the words which have become so familiar to us now, <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i>.  In fact the world will be watching and expecting a lot. Hopes have been raised by Mikhail Gorbachev on the subject of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i>.  It is a tribute to the changes in the Soviet Union that we are watching so closely.</P>
    <P>I would like now to place this inside a legal context because Soviet policy towards Jewish culture, Jewish Hebrew teachers and Hebrew language instruction for Jews in general infringes the individual rights of teachers concerned, of their pupils or potential pupils, as well as the collective rights of the Jewish minority, on an individual level parents and, in appropriate cases legal guardians, have a right to choose for their children the kind of education that conforms to their religious and moral convictions. Once again surely this is the kind of thing with which the great majority of the Irish people will instantly sympathise &mdash; the right to choose the ethical as well as cultural context in which one's children are brought up.</P>
    <P>This right is guaranteed in several international instruments to which the Soviet Union is a party.  I would like to list some of them.  Article 26 (3) of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares:</P>
    <P>Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.</P>
    <P>Article 13 (3) of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights states:</P>
    <P>The States parties to the present <Col N="523" /> Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and, when applicable, legal guardians to choose for their children schools, other than those established by the public authorities, which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.</P>
    <P>Article 5 (1) (B) of the 1960 Convention against Discrimination in Education &mdash; concluded under the auspices of UNESCO stipulates as follows:</P>
    <P>It is essential to respect the liberty of parents and, where applicable, of legal guardians... to ensure in a manner consistent with the procedures followed in the State for the application of its legislation, the religious and moral education of the children in conformity with their own convictions...</P>
    <P>The main collective right, granted to minority groups, is defined in Article 27 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which declares:</P>
    <P>In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.</P>
    <P>It is clear from everything I have said that the Jewish people in the Soviet Union constitute just such an ethnic minority because it is a religious minority and a linguistic minority.  So, under all such headings, the Jewish people qualify for the protection of this internationally binding covenant to which the Soviet Union is a signatory.  We are entitled, as members of the international community, to ask that these solemn covenants be respected by all the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The USSR violates, in a systematic <Col N="524" /> way, the rights of this minority to self-preservation as an ethnic religious and linguistic group.  It does so in pursuit of a policy which is not just anti-minority. This is not Big Brother collectively wanting this huge corporate State and objecting to any kind of linguistic, ethnic or social dissent: it is not because one can look at any other number of linguistic minorities which are appropriately treated in the Soviet Union.  Indeed we are very glad that they are.  The Ukranian language, the Polish language, Hungarian, Moldavian and so on are freely available to people from the relevant ethnic minorities.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that, even when the Soviet authorities do intervene, they arrogantly assume to themselves the right to tell the Jewish people what is their language.  The Minister probably knows already that the Soviet Union believe that Yiddish is the language of the Jews.  It does seem to me, surely, that a fundamental right of a minority is to decide themselves what is their language.  We know all too well in this country how deeply destructive it is to be told by superior centralised Government forces what language rights we have, what language we should speak, what language we are able to speak.</P>
    <P>I was reading just last night &ldquo;Mo Scéil Féin&rdquo; by an tAthair Peadar O'Laoire, I am sorry to say, in an English translation. I was struck by a little snippet of dialogue between two children at the time of the Famine, overheard by the author.  One of them, a girl called Sheila, says: &ldquo;I have no talk now, Con,&rdquo; to the stable boy, and Con says: &ldquo;Why, what have you no talk?&rdquo; and she replies: &ldquo;I have no talk, only English&rdquo;.  I thought that the most heartrending thing, this transition from something that was deeply felt, spiritually and culturally, by a whole people, which was so tragically lost in the last century and recorded by the phrase: &ldquo;no talk, only English&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Jewish people are being presented with an option now: no talk, only Russian or, at the best Yiddish.  They are not <Col N="525" /> allowed their own language.  This suppression is a blatant violation of the collective cultural rights of the Jewish minority to use and study its own language. It is something of which we must be aware and to which we must be sensitive. That is why it is clearly expressed in various additional treaties to which the Soviet Union is a party.  I have already mentioned Article 27 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  There is also Article 5 (1) (c) of the 1960 UNESCO Convention Against Discrimination in Education which states:</P>
    <P>It is essential to recognise the right of members of national minorities to carry on their own educational activities, including the maintenance of schools and, depending on the educational policy of each State, the use or the teaching of their own language.</P>
    <P>This right has been, and still is, systematically denied.  There is also no opportunity for employment of Hebrew teachers.  The Soviet Government is obliged to respect the right of Hebrew teachers in this manner.  Article 23 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares:</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment to just and favourable conditions of work...</P>
    <P>The 1966 International Convenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 6 (1), states:</P>
    <P>The States parties to the present Covenant recognise the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.</P>
    <P>Article 6 (2) of the same Covenant states:</P>
    <P>The steps to be taken by a State party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realisation of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and <Col N="526" /> training programmes... under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual.</P>
    <P>Convention No. 122 (1964) of the International Labour Organisation &mdash; in Article 1 (2) reinforces the notion of freedom of choice of employment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I return to the question of the jamming of Israeli radio broadcasts which violates the International Telecommunication Convention and also contradicts the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act, with its specific provisions in section 2 (3) on wider and freer dissemination of information.</P>
    <P>That is international law.  In terms of Soviet law I believe that it can be demonstrated that, regrettably, there are clear infringements of the internal legislative provisions of the Soviet Union itself.  The discriminatory suppression of the Jewish national language and culture violates the Soviet Union's own Constitution as well as Soviet laws which prohibit any form of discrimination on the basis of nationality and any preference or limitation regarding the national languages of the peoples of the USSR.  Article 46 of the USSR Constitution stipulates:</P>
    <P>Citizens of the USSR have the right to enjoy cultural benefits.</P>
    <P>That is the wide umbrella.  Article 34 of the RSFSR, the Russian Socialist Republic Constitution states:</P>
    <P>Citizens of the RSFSR of different races and nationalities have equal rights.  The exercise of these rights is ensured by a policy of comprehensive development and rapprochement of all nations and nationalities of the USSR, ...and by the possibility to use one's native language and the languages of other peoples of the USSR.  Any direct or indirect restriction of rights whatsoever, the establishment of direct or indirect privileges for citizens on grounds of race or nationality, as well as any preaching of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility, or contempt are punished by law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> Again regretfully I would have to mention the publication of a scurrilously anti-Semitic paper called <i>Pamyat</i> which is a cause of concern to those of us in the West who are interested in these matters.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of the USSR Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>Citizens of the USSR have the right to work..., including the right to choose their trade or profession, type of job and work in accordance with their inclinations, abilities, training and education, with due account to the needs of society.</P>
    <P>I have got a great deal of further information on these laws.  But, rather than be tedious, I will perhaps mention merely the heads of the sections without specifying them with any greater particularity. Simply, by mentioning them under their headings, it can be demonstrated that, in terms of the internal legislation in the Soviet Union, there are violations going on.</P>
    <P>Article 17, paragraph 2 of the USSR Constitution protects the rights of people in terms of the teaching profession.  Article 6, paragraph 2, of their Constitution also protects certain labour activities and provides for appeal to an executive committee of a higher-ranking Soviet of Peoples Deputies in a case of controversy. However, in spite of these laws and in spite of new laws, problems still remain.  There is no question whatever of that.</P>
    <P>In concluding this section I would like to quote words which are not mine, words which were spoken by somebody who has a very direct experience of the situation. Just over a year ago, in August 1987 Yosif Begun posed the question:</P>
    <P>Has the situation of Soviet Jews improved recently?  Not at all.  Just as always, there are no classes in which to learn our language.  There are no Hebrew language or Jewish history textbooks.  There is nothing from which one can learn about Judaism; just as it always was.  There is not even any permission to teach Hebrew privately. <Col N="528" /> This is the situation of our culture in a State having millions of Jews in it.  Not all of them will be able to emigrate to Israel.  So what will their future be?</P>
    <P>Of course he concludes that, bereft of their culture, this noble people who throughout this diaspora have miraculously retained their identity will find that very identity evaporating away from them under the conditions that obtain still within the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a little about emigration. The situation here, I am very glad to say has improved considerably.  I do not want to go into this in too great detail because I may have an opportunity to come back on it later.  Nevertheless it is important to make the point that there is a certain perversely tantalising attitude in certain levels of the Soviet bureaucracy with regard to long-term refuseniks, people who have been denied permission to leave the Soviet Union on various grounds, sometimes contact with scientific material, classified information and so on.  Some of them have been left in this state of limbo for every long periods, I have a list here of a few of these people.</P>
    <P>On this day of <i>Kristallnacht</i> it is important that we remember these prisoners, cultural prisoners, prisoners of their identity.  One thinks of Yuly Koshorovsky, in Moscow, waiting for 18 years to be allowed to leave the land which is the land of his birth but which he no longer regards as his home.  There is this extraordinary homing instinct which we in Ireland can understand &mdash; the wish to return home.  Home for these people &mdash; and they have decided themselves at a deep level &mdash; is the State of Israel.  One thinks of Zinovy Ostrovsky waiting for eight years, of Roald Zelichenok, waiting for 17 years, Vladimir Kislik waiting for 20 years, of Evegeny Lein waiting 17 years, of Vladimir Rais, waiting 19 years, of Benjamin Charny waiting nine years, of Gennady Reznikov waiting 12 years and of Yuri Cherniak waiting 12 years.</P>
    <P>But the man of whom I think principally at this time is waiting longer than 19 years.  He has been waiting over 40 years.  It is highly likely that he is still <Col N="529" /> alive.  I have sought the permission of the Jewish community to mention him, to mention him with honour and respect. I speak of Raoul Wallenberg who was captured by the Soviet Army in 1945 attempting to continue his humanitarian work, who was taken to Moscow &mdash; although the Russian authorities denied this &mdash; who was held in prison in Moscow &mdash; although this was again denied. Eventually in 1957 a statement was issued that Wallenberg had died in Lubianka Prison in 1947, which was not correct. That is known to be a lie.  But still the mystery has not been explained.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider action rather than just words and rhetoric. It is very important that we take this opportunity here in Seanad Éireann to discuss, in a balanced way, this important human problem, this question of Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  It is important to ask these questions, but if the Government are really serious, if they want something more than a talking shop there is one thing they can do to measure <i>glasnost</i>.  It is something that is non-violent, non-aggressive, that is in the spirit of people like Wallenberg and Ghandi, that is, to set in motion the machinery whereby Raoul Wallenberg has the citizenship of this country conferred upon him so that, appropriately and with dignity, the representatives of the foreign service of this State of Ireland &mdash; a small neutral, military non-aggressive State &mdash; has the entitlement to question the position concerning the fate of Raoul Wallenberg.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.  I have listened with great interest to the impassioned proposal of the motion from Senator David Norris.  This motion has been on the Order Paper in the names of many Senators for some considerable time.  It is quite extraordinary that, through a series of accidents really, we come to discuss it on <i>Kristallnacht</i> and on the fortieth anniversary of the celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We wish to debate and discuss this motion in the context of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> My colleague dealt at particularly great length with the cultural aspect of this motion, with paragraph 2 as it is on the Order Paper.  I propose to speak at greater length on the actual prohibition or inhibition on leaving the Soviet Union because anybody who thinks about the refuseniks and the circumstances in which they find themselves must reflect that what we really are concerning ourselves about is a tremendous waste of human potential.  Many of them are forced to live lives of desperation, quiet desperation, mostly.  They do not know if they will ever be able to travel to the west, to Israel or wherever they choose to travel and whether they will ever be able to realise and develop their potential. As the years pass there must be a fear that their talents are growing less, perhaps being dissipated; they are growing physically old and spiritually weary. That is why it is of extreme importance that those of us who cherish freedom stand in this House and elsewhere and speak on behalf of these people who are being denied and have, over the centuries, been denied a certain basic right.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, since we first put this motion on the Order Paper, we have been able to amend it.  The changes are not purely textual.  They are in some ways substantive because we must recognise the fact that <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> have meant a certain amelioration of the position of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  I am happy to note that that is the case.  I am pleased to record the fact because it must be very clearly understood that those of us who speak on this motion are not anti-the Soviet Union.  We have reservations about a system which discriminates against and penalises certain Soviet citizens.  But that is separate from any suggestion that we would be anti-Soviet in our orientation or expression.</P>
    <P>All of these people experience fear and anguish.  They all face the prospect of seeing their lives wasted simply because they wish to emigrate.  There has been a history of oppression of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  It is important that we speak about the historical perspective <Col N="531" /> of this problem.  I am indebted, for briefing material, to the Irish National Council for Soviet Jewry incorporating the Dublin 35's women's campaign.  An eminent member of that organisation is in fact in the public gallery listening attentively to the debate here this evening. I would also like to express my gratitude for a very positive response from the Soviet Embassy to my request for briefing material.</P>
    <P>The oppression of Russian Jews predates Communism.  It is very important to state that.  Long before the Russian Revolution the Tzars founded and maintained the Russian Orthodox Church as the State religion and as a pillar of the official ideology.  As a consequence there were periodic oppressions of non-Russian, non-Orthodox minorities.  Jews had become Russian subjects when the Empire extended itself into eastern Poland, so really they became Russian subjects as a consequence of aggrandisement and not by choice.  But, of course, they were not Slavs; nor were they members of the Orthodox church. From time to time, during periods of strict enforcement of the laws, Jews were required to live in the pale of settlement, an area in the southern and western portions of the Empire.  Quotas governed their admission to higher education and periodically there were pogroms.  Of course, the word &ldquo;pogrom&rdquo; has come to be associated with the oppression of the Jewish people.  It is interesting to note that it is a Russian word and comes from the Russian verb &mdash; pogromit &mdash; to destroy.</P>
    <P>In 1903 there were protests in the United States because people there were concerned about the terrible pogrom in Kishinev.  At the time the Russian Revolution was good for Jews.  In fact many actively participated and others welcomed it, seeing in it some relief from oppression.  It is very interesting to look at this oppression in the context of Marxism which is, of course, fundamentally hostile to all religions.  In fact, Marx condemned anti-Semitism seeing it as a ruling class mechanism to divide and control the masses.  Lenin personally <Col N="532" /> denounced it.  But, of course what is said by the upper echelons of any system, very often, is out of kilter with what is actually happening on the ground and with concrete situations as people are experiencing them.  Under the Bolsheviks Jews became one of more than 100 minority nationalities living within the USSR. Unlike the Georgians, the Uzbeks and the Asabijanis and the other groupings they did not have a distinct territory and, therefore, they never formed a constituent republic of the USSR.  At that time they had their own schools.  The language that was recognised for them was Yiddish, as Senator Norris has so ably expressed it; it was not Hebrew, it was Yiddish.  At that time there was a special department in the Government dealing with Jewish affairs.  Several Jews occupied positions of political power, among them Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev.  These are perhaps the most famous or the better known names.</P>
    <P>Life at that time, at the start of the Revolution and in its aftermath, was by no means ideal but it was far better than anything experienced under the Tzars. Maxim Gorki boasted at the time: equality of the Jews is one of the more wonderful achievements of the Revolution. It would be interesting to know if those words of Gorki form part of the corpus of thought of Gorbachev and the school of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika.</i></P>
    <P>Stalin's period is of extreme significance in this historical perspective because, of course, equality for the Jews, as equality for so many other minority groups, took a nosedive under Stalin.  So did many of the ideals of the revolution. There was a campaign against Trotsky. In the thirties we witnessed the closure of Jewish schools, institutions and synagogues. During World War II there was something of a respite when Jews were enlisted into the fight against Fascism when very many of them took up arms for that cause.  In the late forties purges began.  Hundreds of Jewish intellectuals were shipped to the Gulag.  Trials for so-called economic crimes, in which a disproportionate number of defendants were Jews, were the order of the day. <Col N="533" /> During the Kruschev era things improved but only in the early years of that period. He rejected Jewish emigration to Israel. Prosecutions for economic crimes began again and many synagogues were closed.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the present day and the era of <i>glasnost</i>.  It is true to say that changes in the political climate of the USSR gathered momentum in 1987 and these have continued.  They are encouraging signs and are to be welcomed.  I expect that everybody who speaks in the debate will give due recognition to that fact and accord those changes a welcome. Mikhail Gorbachev, now President of the Soviet Communist Party, both in speeches and in an article in <i>Pravda</i> spoke of promoting and protecting human rights and stressed the obligation of governments to make their legislation conform with international norms in this area.  During 1987 the USSR ratified the UN Convention against Torture and a major review of the criminal law was embarked upon by Soviet legislators.</P>

    <Title>Registered Irish Charities: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the growing public concern at the lack of full accountability by registered Irish charities urges the Government to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator O'Connell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish public has a noble record regarding their support of a diverse range of worthy causes.  The Christian tradition of the country and the basic decency of the people have gained us respect across the globe.  Against this background it is deeply worrying that grave questions of accountability in relation to charitable bodies have arisen. The many genuine and committed individuals involved in such concerns rely on public trust and esteem.  Of primary importance is the issue of control of charitable endeavours.  This entails that <Col N="534" /> public satisfaction with the existing system of permits and licences as a means by which to control the pursuits of charities is reduced.  Senators leaving this House and walking down any street in the main shopping areas of this city will see unsealed and often insubstantial collection receptacles in use.  Members of the public face an assortment of buckets, cans and containers.  Those contributions are genuinely concerned regarding the safety of cash once donated.  It is not unreasonable to contend that a preferable situation would be one in which sealed containers only would be authorised. Once the collection is completed these containers would be returned to the appropriate charity.  Given existing unease the number of permits issued may have to be reviewed.  In the weeks leading to Christmas people find a succession of different groups soliciting funds in the streets.  With doubts as to the bona fides of certain charities it is possible that reputable organisations are losing funds to somewhat dubious ones.  At the administrative level the absence of concentration in control worries many observers.  Currently a number of Departments have an interest in charity dealings.  These include Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health, Social Welfare and Justice. Knowing the volume of work undertaken by the Departments the range of overseeing authority hardly adds efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of possible remedies have been suggested.  It has been contended that the appropriate level of accountability may require a charities administration.  This body would require powers to scrutinise and monitor charitable activity.  Even if such an effective administration were possible, and British experience gives us cause for doubt, any proposal to increase public service numbers will not be popular in Government circles in times of financial retrenchment.  Alternatively the larger charities may not welcome the notion that a percentage of the total donated <Col N="535" /> may have to be set aside to fund such a monitoring body.</P>
      <P>I make these observations to illustrate the obstacles which are strewn in the path to a resolution of these difficulties.  We cannot permit the continuation of a situation in which public confidence, the lifeblood of charities, remains contaminated by doubts and suspicion.  As a first step to allay public concern I urge the Minister to institute a full investigation of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by the Senators who have put down this motion to bring into focus the problems existing in relation to charities.  I share the concern that is referred to in the motion and would go further.  I am totally dissatisfied with the position we find ourselves in and have been giving it a great deal of attention.  Perhaps I should set out what, to my mind, is wrong with our situation.</P>
      <P>First of all, there is quite a widespread diffusion of responsibility for the whole area of collection and disposal of moneys provided for charitable purposes.  As far as the responsibility of the Minister for Justice is concerned fund raising is governed by two Acts.  First, the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962 which provides for the issue of Garda permits to take up collections in specified areas.  Applicants for such permits are not required to be a charity or to represent a charity.  Secondly, there is the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, sections 27 and 28 of which provide for the issue of garda permits and court licences respectively to hold lotteries.  Only lotteries held under court licence &mdash; section 28 &mdash; are required to be for charitable or philanthropic purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have responsibility for the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973 which provide for the jurisdiction and powers of the Commisisoners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in relation to charitable trusts.  However, it must be said at the outset that these powers are quite limited and do not extend to registration of charities and control of their operations.  Other <Col N="536" /> Ministers whose Departments have functions in relation to charities are the Minister for Health &mdash; some health related charities are grant-aided by the Department of Health &mdash; the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance who are responsible for tax exemption legislation for charities; the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; the Department of Foreign Affairs would have an interest in charities providing aid to the Third World; the Minister for Social Welfare because the Department of Social Welfare has responsibility for interaction with charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    <P>Whether or not this diffusion of responsibility is a causative factor in the present unsatisfactory situation may be arguable.  What is clear, however, is that there is a widespread public perception of the defects in our present situation. Among these defects identified in an RTE television programme last year were the following:</P>
    <P>Fund raisers get an excessive proportion of the amount they collect, which is very often 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>Fund raising is often done in open boxes so that there is no adequate control to ensure that the total amount collected is surrendered to the organisers of the collection.</P>
    <P>Professional fund raisers are often employed by charities to organise lotteries and other fund raising activities and occasionally at least there is no adequate check on the amount collected by the professionals to ensure that they surrender all amounts collected, less reasonable expenses and remuneration.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I have had a number of approaches from persons who are involved in genuine fund raising for charitable purposes and others.  They are all concerned with what they perceive to be abuses of the trust which the public places in persons and organisations approaching them for ostensibly good causes.  It is as a result of their approaches that I have become convinced that something must be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> It is easy to identify abuses and defects. It is another thing to come up with solutions which will be workable and which will not interfere unnecessarily with the legitimate freedom of citizens to go about their good works.  We are, unfortunately, talking about an area of activity which is particularly sensitive in that regard.  I will not go too far into the issue of freedom but I am sure that Senators will readily identify their own favourite charity which, they would argue, should not be subject to any element of State control. There is also a question of resources and some Senators have mentioned the desirability of having a system which would enable all income and disbursements, as well as expenses of collecting agencies, to be closely monitored.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House this evening refers to full accountability.  I have already mentioned that the charity commissioners in this jurisdiction do not have this responsibility and it is unknown to our law.  It is a feature of the law in Britain but Senators will undoubtedly be aware of the widespread dissatisfaction expressed in that country because of the sheer inability of the body charged with the registration and control of charities to carry out those functions.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that this failure was simply a matter of finding sufficient resources to deal with a rapidly expanding workload.  It is against this background that I have been considering the whole question of charities for some time now and this I regard as the first necessary step for which the motion calls to find a better system.  The next step is to bring my proposals in that regard before the Government and I am glad to be able to say that I have proposals at an advanced stage and will be bringing those proposals to the Government in the very near future.  I look forward to the day when I can introduce that legislation in the Seanad so that we can have a worthwhile debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of me not to say that I know the Minister is capable of giving replies on issues like this and indeed he is not wanting in saying <Col N="538" /> he recognises that there are areas and charities where there are problems. There are legalised charities which are doing excellent work throughout society. There is the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, and others.  Societies like those, whether we like it or not, are in doubt as to whether or not something will happen in the new legislation that is being considered. It is a worry.  In areas such as health if you want to get money from government you must collect pound for pound for, say, a hospital.  I am involved in one area and to collect moneys there are particular persons who are involved in trading situations.  They set up the scheme and get a certain amount of what is collected.  I have no objection to that when you need these persons.  I am not saying they are not within the law but in a local area where you want to collect moneys for a local hospital in particular, there is sympathy for that because the hospital is within that local area.  These people are brought in because the administrative staff would not have the expertise to get the money in.  They may have to get £100,000 in over a 12 month period or a two year period so that they can get another £100,000 from the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>It is a very good idea and there is nothing wrong in saying that we would be putting up pound for pound but we should look at the percentage amount that is given to these legalised bodies, these fund organisations.  They say: &ldquo;These are the people you should be seeing in the areas; these are the people you should be waiting to&rdquo;.  There is a fancy letter sent out to the local plants, to the local industrialists, a fancy letter to the local commercial people whether they be in service or production.  That is done through these organisations but at a cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of it, because he lives in an area that is not extraordinarily large and he knows that when you get the sympathy of these industrialists and commercial people in towns and cities who are totally committed to the local hospital or the local <Col N="539" /> club these fund raisers can make very easy money working on a percentage. When you look at it after a month or two you would say: &ldquo;If the administration had put their act together and employed one person on a part-time basis or on a 20 hour week they could have done this themselves&rdquo;.  That is what I am afraid of.</P>
    <P>There are people who come to my door every Saturday at 7.45 p.m. and they collect £1 for the sick poor.  These people put so much in.  We are in danger of saying in our legislation that these people might be in question.  We must not create that situation.  That is a worry to them.  I have spoken to people in Cork and in the St. Vincent de Paul Society who do excellent work throughout the city and throughout the country.  There must not be even a glimmer of a question about them because they know much more than any administrative officer on the welfare board.  They known more about cases than anybody.  Every week they provide money for people in need.  Suddenly, they may be in question.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there should not be questions asked.  Indeed there must be questions asked at this time.  I do not want to be quoted unduly or wrongly or illegally but even last week there was a question of a particular group that was collecting for some saint to be canonised. It is a very serious situation when such people can collect money and do not have to account to anybody and they can do it legally through legalised institutions like banks.  Why is it that we cannot implement something in the Finance Bill or in other legislation to prevent these people from collecting through the banks?  That is very serious.</P>
    <P>We should not allow these organisations to tell people: &ldquo;You can post money into us or you can pay it through your bank account into our bank account&rdquo;.  That is so easy and there are so many innocent people who are very considerate.  The Bob Geldof appeal proved that the Irish are the most decent and compassionate people.  They give much more than the people across the water.  Yet there is a problem in Britain <Col N="540" /> with the legalised charities.</P>
    <P>The legalising of people to collect money on behalf of other people or on behalf of a charity is a very, very subtle area.  Consider the moneys that are being collected for the Third World.  Consider the arguments that are being made and at the way it is being done.  Yet, even in that area there was a problem some time ago where some people who were totally trusted could not be trusted.  That is a sad situation and it puts a question mark elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We were speaking here last week and Senator Dr. John O'Connell and I had a few words on it.  Sadly, handicapped persons are being used to collect money by people from other areas.  I do not want to knock the handicapped person because we can be very proud of our wheelchair associations and what they did in Seoul a few weeks ago.  But we must not allow anybody to use a handicapped person to collect money and to get a percentage amount only.  That is a rotten idea; that is not nice at all, even though I know people in Cork are sitting on the side of the road and selling bingo tickets and cards and they are alive and moving about, which I appreciate, but I think they should be moving about for themselves. We should not allow a blind person or a person who is in a wheelchair or a person who has polio to collect for-somebody else and get only a percentage amount.  The Minister may ask: &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;  I appreciate that.  What do you do instead?  How do you ensure that nobody is allowed to use these people? That is the miserable side of it.</P>
    <P>Senator John O'Connell knows of a case in which a person was being used by people in mainland Europe for the sale of cards that were made somewhere else. He was getting a percentage amount and they were getting the rest.  The money was not going to any charity.  It was a business.  How do you ensure that people in Ireland get the most out of it?  There is the Third World situation.  I know we are very good but we are not half good enough, I suppose.  Consider the amount of money that could be given and that goes elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> When the Minister is talking to his officials he must tell them that we do not want to upset people who are very genuine.  One can see members of the St. Vincent de Paul outside one's own church gate once a month.  They are there hail, rain or snow.  They get only pennies or 2ps but they are there.  They are people who have been involved for 30 to 40 years.  You will see a bank official, you will see a Revenue Commissioner, you will see the coalman, you will see the fellow who delivers the blocks, you will see the teacher and you will see the fellow you play golf with and they are all collecting a few bob.  They are very discreet about their business.  They never work their own area, they always work in another area.  That is how discreet they are.  We must never question them.</P>
    <P>I am not a great man for collecting for charities.  I will give and I will not deny that but I do not want my brother or I do not want the Minister's brother or your brother, a Chathaoirligh, or anybody else stopped.  I would be sincere about that.  I know the Minister would show the concern that I am trying to show.  Handicapped people are used by other people in other areas for their gain and then they call it a business and no charity throughout Europe gains from it.  That is not fair. That is a ruthless business and we must not allow handicapped persons to be used in any way for anybody's gain except their own.  If one guy in a wheelchair is prepared to go out and the other guy in the wheelchair who cannot move gets something from it, I am all for that and we should be all for it.  That is a worry.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying but at the same time I would ask him, please, to show concern.</P>

      <P>We all know that there are many very worthy causes and there are many groups who do a wonderful job of work as far as collecting money and accounting and all the rest is concerned. We all know that there is a lot of money collected for which there is not the real accountability that there should be. Every organisation collecting money should publish an annual audit and that <Col N="542" /> should show what income the people concerned received.  Their total expenses should be shown.  Expenses can go over the top and the charities may be getting a very small proportion.  The expenses may exceed the total amount given to the charities.  We should know exactly how the money is dispersed; what use was made of it and where exactly it went and what service was provided with it.</P>
      <P>I am speaking as one who has collected money.  I hope in the next three weeks to launch a fund to raise £100,000 to finish an assessment unit and a holiday home which I am building in Bundoran for the mentally and physically handicapped &mdash; one of the most elaborate that there will be in the country.  I have been working on it for seven years but the first stage of it is completed.  We must have that kind of accountability.  I am doing my scheme through the health board.  The health board will take it over and run it when the job is complete and they are now involved in the process.  I believe that health boards should be more involved in all these services for the handicapped. All moneys should be channelled through health boards for those purposes.</P>
      <P>I worry when I see in my own village a car pulling up and maybe five, six, seven or eight youngsters let out.  We do not know where they are from.  They come into your counter and they produce an identity card.  They are collecting for this charity or that charity, always some very worthy charity but we do not know where they came from, we do not know where they go to and we never hear again what happened to that money or where it went to.  A very big business is being run here and many physically and mentally handicapped persons are being used.  No one objects to supporting genuine causes that are properly accounted for but we do get worried.  I have been told that some charities are collecting as much as £14 million without any accountability to the general public.  That is a hefty amount of money.  I do not know whether that is correct or not but I have heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hear all the talk about the national lottery.  That is all accounted for in detail. <Col N="543" /> Every penny of it is accounted for and this House or the other House can question it if they have any doubts.  The only thing that can be raised in that regard is, whether the money should have gone into some other cause rather than the cause to which it went but there are no discrepancies; all the money is accounted for.  This House and the other House know exactly where it went and what happened to it.  Yet we have so many other organisations that are collecting money from the general public and there is no way that those people can be questioned. They are not accountable to anybody.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cregan said, there are many very good charities that operate locally and we know that all that money is accounted for.  None of us wants to injure those but those who are running their business 100 per cent correctly will have no problem in providing the balance sheet because those people already provide a balance sheet for their own AGM. It is not generally released to the public. All they would be asked to do would be to make this information available to the general public.  The IDA and every other organisation that is handing out money have to have printed in the daily papers and the local papers exactly what everybody gets, where it goes, how it is used and what is done with it.  That has already been done with our national lottery but it is not being done with all the other lotteries that I see around the country.  I am not taking from them; I know they are doing good work.  I know every organisation says it is doing a really good job and I know it is but from time to time, I think that there are many people who are using physically and mentally handicapped disabilities and cancer scares to &ldquo;hype&rdquo; up sympathy to collect money. Reading the <i>Evening Press</i> any evening you will see advertisements looking for collectors.  They are paid on commission. They collect money.  No receipt is issued. I had a case of someone selling cards.  He said: &ldquo;I will give you 40 cards for £20 and then you can sell them for £40 or £50 and <Col N="544" /> double your money on them&rdquo;.  I showed him the door.</P>
    <P>Professional people have come to me saying that they gave up their job to work for charities.  In one case I had a man who told me he was a teacher but he sacrificed his job to work for charities.  I told him that he must think I am an idiot if he thought I believed that.  He must be making more money from collecting for charities than from teaching.  Experiences like that make me come to the conclusion that we must have checks and balances.  I believe that the amount of money collected is huge.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience of driving a trap from Bundoran to Ballsbridge in 1981 to highlight the International Year of the Disabled that in every town and village people came out to give £1 or £2.  If one wanted to be a crook, nobody would know the amount collected.  There should be more strict control.  The Irish people are very generous and I collected £21,000 on that trip.  This type of collection is open to abuse and I have no doubt it is being abused.  None of us wants in any way to hurt or hinder the genuine people.  I believe the genuine people will applaud us because they are annoyed.  Charities would get more if we could put out what I would regard as the business people who are making money out of it for their own basic use.  This is what we want to get at.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he comes to deal with this in legislation, will be helped by this debate here.  His officials know exactly how we are thinking.  I am convinced that those of us who have a handicap and who are involved in all this area know the temptations, dangers and problems that can arise.  For that reason I believe he will have better legislation as a result of our debate here.  I am sure the Minister will take those points into consideration and will bring in some suitable legislation.  Perhaps everything is being done above-board.  I hope it is. Justice must be done and that justice must be seen to be done.</P>

      <P>Before I call <Col N="545" /> Senator Reynolds &mdash; and this is breaking all the rules of the House &mdash; the Minister mentioned different Ministers who are responsible, such as the Minister for Social Welfare.  For 25 years I have been chairman of the Clare Federation for the Mentally Handicapped.  The kind of money we have collected over that period is perhaps over £300,000.  There is a section that has worried me.  I have tried to deal with it over the years with different doctors and different people who have served with me.  We would like to ask the Department of Justice to have some control over licences being handed to people from other countries coming in to County Clare collecting.  I am saying it because some of the gardaí have very graciously approached people whom they were not sure were above-board and yet they found they had licences from the Minister's Department.  We did a check on one particular one and found that it was not correct.  We never went into another county with a licence, either from our own Garda or from a Garda in another constituency.</P>
      <P>I feel that is one area where the Minister has absolute control.  I am sure that Senator Fennell, Senator O'Connell and Senator Reynolds &mdash; and all of us collecting a large amount of money &mdash; know that every pound is put into their schools for the children.  These other people come in and they usually move into an area where there is a success story and where people are giving willingly.  They see a £300,000 school being built and think that that is a good county to hit. The licences are given out by somebody in the Minister's Department.  The Minister might look at that part of it and remember that I said it here this evening. I should not be contributing.  I would love to be on the floor of the Seanad for this particular debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise that up to now &mdash; and this is totally apolitical &mdash; there was never any serious effort made by anybody to bring the whole thing together.  I am trying to do that because responsibility was spread right across the board.  I will <Col N="546" /> be very frank when I say that to try to pull all the threads together is much more difficult than it looks.  I have to try to do that because I admit the weakness in the legislation for which I have responsibility. It is totally insufficient and not good enough.  Anybody can go to the gardaí and get a licence under the Streets and House-to-House Collections Act, 1962.  I am not sure whether I can do anything about what An Cathaoirleach is saying about a geographical limitation.  We might try to tighten up the whole thing. It is going to be very difficult.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan made a very good point that some charities are doing excellent work.  Practically all charities are doing better work than the State could ever do.  Everybody will sing the praises of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other organisations.  We are all bound to help them, not hinder them.  We also have responsibility to the community. The Minister for Health has had an involvement here as has the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am putting it honestly to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last Government, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe as Junior Minister in the Department of Foreign Affairs made an effort to get the thing up and running. However, he got side-tracked or met obstacles that he was not able to overcome. I am not saying anything that he has not said himself in the Dáil when the matter was discussed.  My officials and I have been banging our heads and kicking tails in recent times to try to get the whole thing on the one table, so that we can see where we are going from there.  When we get the type of information we need we will have to see where we go from there. We will have to tread very carefully, bearing in mind the freedom that is required for the successful operation of genuine bona fide voluntary organisations. One cannot put obstacles in their way in the form of bureaucracy or red tape.  That would kill initiative.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society in Belmullet might apply to a central agency here in Dublin for permission from the Minister for Justice of the day for permission to <Col N="547" /> collect for St. Vincent de Paul and if they had to wait a week or two, or even three, they might get fed up.</P>
    <P>We have to take into account all the interests involved in charities.  We have to get all their views.  We have to set up the structures for that.  We have a lot of things to do.  I am not at liberty to go into what is in my mind as of now, because I have not the approval from the Government, but I hope to have it within the next couple of weeks with a plan, or a type of programme and some type of an approach to the problem where everybody's interest will be taken into account and everybody's interest will be examined in detail.  We hope to have people involved who can advise as to what we should do.  Certainly, the one overriding thing is that we will stop those who are exploiting others.  Everybody here would cry out to high heaven if we did not do that.  We must hit them as hard as we can and put them out of business immediately. Then we have to stop those who are siphoning off too much of what they collect.</P>
    <P>People are giving because they want to be generous.  Other speakers have said that we are very generous people by nature and we all give, and give and give more.  We are generous in other areas. In this area we could never be generous to a fault in helping out those less fortunate than we are.  We all want to do that on the understanding that the money will go where it should go, that we will not have the situation which we know exists in certain areas.  I would think that before Christmas I will have proposals for the Government.  Please God, they are going on the right road and in the right direction. I am sure that the House will agree at this particular time that we are making a worthwhile start in an area that has been left aside for a long time, perhaps too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  I know this is a very sensitive area.  No doubt his Department and everybody will have to tread very carefully in bringing in legislation which <Col N="548" /> would enable people to do the good charitable work that they have been doing but not to create too much bureaucracy that would hinder this work.  I do take your point as well a Chathaoirligh, about people coming into areas.  We are not as lucky in Leitrim as you are in Clare in that we have only a few small farmers. We are not affected as badly in the sense that we would not get as many people coming into our areas as you would in larger urban centres where there is more wealth and more people and the money is easier to collect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>You would have no problem.  That smile would dazzle them. A problem, of course, also is to be able to define a charity.  The legislation will have to be very specific.  That is something that will have to be given a lot of consideration.  If you take any local sports club, any type of football, or badminton club, you cannot very well deem it a charity, but such clubs do tremendous local community work along with charitable organisations.  In recent years organisations have done great community work.  Even charitable organisations have given employment.  For the record of the House I would like to compliment the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, where I come from.  In 1970 they came up with the idea that the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Government aided but basically self-funded, should raise money.  The money raised was sufficient to build 20 old persons' dwellings in Ballinamore and a community centre which was known by the name of &ldquo;Tráthnóna&rdquo;, which was a very appropriate name.  It has increased in size from 20 to 35 dwellings at the moment.  This has taken responsibility from local authorities. We are all aware of the pressures on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate for me to congratulate the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  I hope in the next number of years they can further expand.  It is tremendous work. It has given a lot of employment in the locality.  There are people looking after <Col N="549" /> maintenance.  It is all being looked after by the local St. Vincent de Paul organisation.</P>
    <P>We have to compliment a lot of charitable organisations countrywide who have done tremendous work nationally and internationally, such as Gorta, Concern, GOAL and the Simon Community.  No doubt, Senator B. Ryan will speak about these people who have done tremendous work.  They must be helped along as the Minister has said previously.  We have to be very careful as to what type of legislation charities would come under, because bureaucracy could hinder good work being done.</P>
    <P>I have just one further point to make. I listened to the Minister.  There is an Act covering door to door collections.  In my part of the country at around Christmas time, or a little before it, we have an organisation which I would say is illegal &mdash; the Provisional IRA &mdash; coming around collecting from door to door.  This is an intimidating factor to a lot of people. I used to wonder how this organisation could actually go from door to door collecting money.  That is a freedom that has to be looked at because there is an intimidatory factor.  People in my area will give them money but it is out of fear rather than out of agreement in what they are doing.  Certainly to me that is not a charitable organisation.  Legislation would have to take account of such activity and try to outlaw that type of collection.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point that I find disturbing.  In the last number of years everybody will have been aware of young people coming into areas representing different charities and different organisations and collecting for unemployed persons, for instance.  It is not that they are hustling.  It is a job as far as they are concerned, and it is not their fault.  I am not blaming those young people who have to try to make money.  It is a job as far as they are concerned.  It is a sad day for this country when young people have to hustle and to ask individuals to buy tickets so that they will get a commission. You ask them what they are for.  They give you an identity card.  As the Minister <Col N="550" /> has stated, people will see the card but do not know where the money is going or how it is to be spent.  It is the last thing you will hear about.  Organisations could be fronts for anything.  These young people are in a situation where they are gathering money and I would say that 90 per cent of them do not know where it is going.  That is a very sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The motion is a worthwhile motion and I am glad to hear the Minister is trying to get the position concerning charities under control.  I wish him every success in that.  I hope that he will have a more equitable situation as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed the Minister's speech.  We Irish people are extraordinarily generous by any standards. Irish people are generous to charities that operate within this country and they are generous to charities that operate outside this country.  A number of indicators of this have come to my attention through my involvement with the Simon Community, which is the one I know most about.  Notwithstanding the extraordinary increase, four or fivefold, in unemployment in Cork in the last seven or eight years, and the obvious huge drop in disposable income that people in that city had, the Simon Community has not experienced a similar decline in its income from public donations.  There has been perhaps a slight wavering.  It has not increased perhaps as fast as would have been desirable but, given the huge impact on people's spending power the facts are that people are prepared to dig even deeper into a restricted amount of money to sustain those charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also remember Christmas some years ago when we were all horrified by the scale of the famine in Ethiopia and when huge sums of money were raised in a <Col N="551" /> short time.  There was a huge focus of public attention at the time coming up to Christmas, which is a traditional period of giving to charities in this country. There was a huge focus of attention on Ethiopia.  At the same time I know that from the point of view of the Simon Community and other charities that I have discussed it with, like Share in Cork, they did not notice any significant drop in their income because of the huge public focus on Ethiopia.  People did not say: &ldquo;I will give it to Ethiopia this year instead of to Share in Cork or the St. Vincent de Paul Society&rdquo; or anybody else.  People said: &ldquo;we will give more because of the problems that people are made aware of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are a very compassionate people. We are still a country which is not so much infected with the sort of individualistic indifferentism that is more widespread in North America and Western Europe.  People do believe that they have a common bond with other people and an obligation.  They do not even think in terms of obligation.  They take it for granted that it is a good thing for us and for the individual to try to help other people.  Therefore, the generosity which is so extensive deserves above all to be protected.  It deserves to be protected so that that generosity is not exploited, and so that is not misrepresented and people cannot purport to be in charge of charitable organisations when, in fact, the organisation may perhaps be semi-commercial or indeed, the involvement of the individuals in it may be semi-commercial.</P>
    <P>I have a number of specific criticisms. It is, of course, extremely difficult to define a charity in a way which does not exclude many good causes.  I am aware in particular that in Britain the way charities regulations have worked has been felt by groups like OXFAM and Save the Children to seriously inhibit their ability to influence public opinion on issues of international aid, for instance, and things like that.  The registrar has on occasions required them to withdraw advertisements because he felt they were excessively political.</P>
    <P>In my view, you cannot really define <Col N="552" /> charities simply in terms of providers of a service.  In this country the initiators of re-thinking on this issue were the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  There is evidence in the Cork Society that they are more than able now, and more than willing, to issue quite trenchant criticisms of public policy where they feel that the needs of those they serve call for it.  They have done this in the area of social welfare. They have done it in the area of things like illegal money lending and the need for reform.  They have done it in a variety of areas.  They see that as an equal part of their job.  Though it may make life uncomfortable from time to time, I think most people in the political process feel that it is a worthwhile thing that those who devote themselves to the service of the less well off should contribute to the debate about how public policy should change to deal with the services for the less well off.  I do not think any of us would be happy if people got involved in specifically party politics but most volunteer organisations are far too sensible to do that.</P>
    <P>That is an area which we should identify. Therefore, to define charities in such narrow legal terms that their capacity to speak or to criticise or to make comments would be restricted would be undesirable. For instance, a particularly memorable contribution by the St. Vincent de Paul Society was on the issue of our child care services when they funded the provisional publication of the care memorandum almost &mdash; I hate to think of it &mdash; 20 years ago.  That produced, and is still producing, a change in public opinion.  It influenced thinking amongst political parties.  It influenced thinking in a variety of areas.  It was a contribution from the St. Vincent de Paul Society which facilitated that publication.</P>
    <P>One area that has given considerable concern is the activity of professional fund raisers.  It is a matter of considerable regret and a matter that deserves immediate regulation.  Nobody can be sure, when you are dealing with professional fund raising, what proportion of what you contribute is going to the voluntary organisation. If people are dealing with the traditional kind of raffles and things like <Col N="553" /> that, you are talking about small scale money very often, but with regard to the professional fund raisers going from door to door selling lines nobody is too sure.</P>
    <P>Figures are quoted and in some cases people talk about the voluntary organisations getting as low as 25 per cent. Other people say much higher figures are given.  It would be fairly simple to regulate so that where the people selling these things are not volunteers the literature which they use must contain a statement of the proportion of your contribution that is guaranteed to go to the voluntary organisation.  It is a bit like a Government health warning on a package of cigarretes, simply saying &ldquo;This is a professional fund raising exercise.  The people who work on it are being paid but the guarantee is that the voluntary organisations named will get 50 per cent&rdquo;, 25 per cent or whatever you like &mdash; in other words, a specific statement of the amount.  People would be quite taken aback if they discovered what precisely the money was going to.  It is not a criticism of the people involved.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the fact that many of the young people who sell lines on various raffles and various other fund raising activities here in Dublin and in Cork are doing it because they have no money and it is a way of raising a few bob.  If they are being paid as a proportion of what they raise the public are entitled to know that, too.  It is an extremely important area.  The people are entitled to know at least to a certain extent how voluntary organisations use their money. It ought to be possible to ensure that all registered charities publish at least a simple statement of accounts saying how much they raised, how much went into certain defined areas, such as administration and into services or into publicity and into paying salaries for fund raising.  A fairly simple form of accounts would identify the critical factor.</P>
    <P>I would not dream of telling the Minister or his Department how to draw up the details of this.  The fundamental question is, as the motion says, accountability and public information.  Ordinary people are extremely generous.  They do not get mean minded because organisations <Col N="554" /> spend money on administration but they like to know what is going on and they need to know what is going on.  One could speculate that perhaps even the salaries of persons employed by voluntary organisations ought to be public knowledge.  In most cases they are quite low and people would be surprised at how badly persons who work for voluntary organisations are paid.  At best they are paid the going rate in the public service and often considerably less than it.  We had a major dispute in a voluntary organisation which has its headquarters near here because people were quite far behind the official public service rates.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs to be looked at, which is not necessarily the brief of the Minister who is here, is the question of covenanting.  I cannot work out the ins and outs of what voluntary organisations can benefit from covenants and what cannot.  I know that most charities cannot benefit from covenanting.  I also know that certain bodies that would surprise you can benefit from covenanting.  For instance, I am aware of a private fee paying secondary school in my own city which was able to assure donors that if they signed a covenant they could get roughly £2.50 for every £1 that the donor contributed.  I find it rather peculiar that charities that are dealing with the poor are excluded from such provision when private fee paying second level schools are apparently included in such a provision. It seems like an anomaly.  It seems unfair and it does not seem like a proper way to do business.</P>
    <P>A system of covenanting directed and targeted towards charitable organisations dealing with the poor and the underprivileged would facilitate those organisations. It would cost the taxman a few bob, but, given the usual estimate of what is spent by voluntary organisations I do not think it would be enormous.  It would help a lot.  There is a lot of circular funding going on, where the State gives money and the charity pay VAT on things to pay money back to the State.  A lot of simplification could be done which would simplify the administrative work of voluntary organisations.</P>
    <Col N="555" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in areas where public funding is going to organisations there is no real accountability of the money spent.  Are moneys meant for charity really going for charitable purposes and charitable outlets?  There are instances I can recall on a personal basis where they are not.  So the accountability in State funding is not as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue on which I gather the Minister said there is a need for regulation but there is a need for a light-handed regulation which leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre, flexibility and imagination and for new organisations to develop, for instance, community action groups aimed at developing community initiatives to generate employment.  They might not be the conventional models of charities but they ought to get the status of charities because of the work they do in deprived communities.  It is a tossup and I think it needs a set of general principles.</P>
      <P>The real regulation is public opinion and, therefore, the more we insist that the public know about proportions of expenditure and salaries paid for fund raising etc. the more they will be able to distinguish between the bodies they want to help and the ones they do not.  There is also a necessity to ensure that any special benefits, i.e. convenants, are evenly available to all charities or are not available at all.  There should not be some bodies who because of historical reasons are able to claim this sort of status and many others who are not.  I think that is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, given the experience of worthwhile and important bodies like Oxfam and Save the Children Fund in the United Kingdom, we ought not to be excessively restrictive about the role of voluntary organisations in a country like our own where people are interested and concerned in the role of voluntary organisations in attempting to influence public policy.  I have a personal interest in this as I am connected with a voluntary organisation which sees itself as having a loud and often very noisy role to play in influencing public policy.  I do not think <Col N="556" /> voluntary organisations should get involved in party politics.  I do think they should be free in a broad way to contribute to public debate and be quite specific about what they think about specific issues.  I think that is the way to influence public opinion, it is the way to form public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Irish people deserve protection from those who would abuse their generosity.  The Irish people deserve to have their commitment to other people protected.  We need to foster voluntary organisations.  I do not see any sort of idealistic world where something called the State would provide all the services for everybody.  I regard that sort of model of socialism as quite antiquated.  There are other dynamics that need to be liberated and among them is the willingness of small communities to look after each other and be given structures that will facilitate that.</P>
    <P>People are over-powered very often by the scale of the State.  It does not have to be a geographical scale, it is simply the scale relative to an individual's experience. I think having voluntary organisations based in local communities is one of the ways in which people feel they can participate in the life of their community, and in the lives of people who are perhaps excluded in one way or another from their community.  Therefore, we should be fostering and encouraging voluntary services and organisations.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to do that if people can be absolutely certain of the bona fides of all the voluntary organisations they are dealing with.  As I said earlier on in my remarks, the best way to foster that sort of bona fides in my opinion is by public accountability based on the maximisation of information available to the public.  It is better than any amount of regulations to make sure the public and media know precisely what each organisation does with its money.  Therefore, I quite enthusiastically support the motion and hope that the Minister will be able to produce legislation or regulations or whatever is necessary quite quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak <Col N="557" /> but I have been inspired to rise to my feet having listened to fellow Senators.  I would like to approach the problem from two particular standpoints.  First, as a person who because of the good fortune of being in a profession and not having ever had to face the consequences of poverty, is inevitably approached from time to time to make a contribution to a charity.  Secondly, I would like to take up the point which Senator Brendan Ryan raised in relation to the need to preserve and indeed to encourage voluntary effort in a healthy state.  Thirdly, I would like to say that the point made by Senator Cregan is possibly of the essence of the dilemma.</P>
      <P>Let me start with the first point.  When you go to your front door, especially in the North of Ireland, at night when somebody knocks and you wonder who is on the other side you are quite relieved at first when you find it is somebody with a box looking for money.  Perhaps one's relief is the reason for one's next response which is indeed to respond as quickly as possible, to have the matter resolved there and then while not appearing to be too stingy.  At the same time you do not perhaps want to appear too generous in case you are opening the floodgates for the next few nights.  Having struck what one hopes to be a modest balance you make your contribution and it is only about 15 minutes later you suddenly wonder who he or she was and whether that wee box was going for the purpose they said.</P>
      <P>You do not have that problem in a small community if you recognise the face and you can relate it to the source and the bona fides about which Senator Ryan spoke but you certainly have it in a country which is in a considerable state of upset, as Ireland is at the moment, if you do not recognise the face and the person disappears into the dark and you wonder where your money is going and for what particular reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak now from the point of view of ignorance of the existing law, so forgive me if I am emphasising something which is already in position but I feel that there is a need for those collecting for charity <Col N="558" /> to wear a number.  The Garda Síochána should know when charitable collections are going to be made, who will be making them and have access to the names and the numbers.  That is not being offensive particularly if it is properly explained, as a good public relations exercise, and particularly if the reason for this is understood, the uncertainty, the fear and sometimes the resentment of those who are on the receiving end.  At least they should be given the assurance that there is some comeback and when number 1025 disappears out through the gate they should be satisfied that, if necessary, they can check on the matter.</P>
    <P>In respect of the first point, I would also say that notification, which perhaps is already provided for in the legislation, of any charitable collections which are to be made on any scale in the community should appear in advance in the press so that one can tie up the appeal with what one can read and, therefore, feel a certain amount of added security that one is not, as they say, being taken for a ride.</P>
    <P>The next question is the one of voluntary effort.  I think the Republic never suffered from what we almost suffered from, the eclipse of voluntary effort in the heyday of the State institutionalism. There was a belief prevalent in the sixties, having had almost 20 years of the welfare state, that only those who were qualified and trained and only those who had some special expertise for which they could carry a certificate should be allowed or permitted to carry out a social service, that the rest of us were unable to do so. One was trying to create a society in which everything could be classified and certified.</P>
    <P>We all know now that one cannot create good feeling and health in a community if that is the limit of one's approach.  There must be a blend of the statutory and the voluntary and any state will go underground if it cannot mobilise what Schumacher in his book <i>Small is Beautiful</i> referred to as the intangible assets, the assets of commitment, morale, enthusiasm, inter-relatedness, devotion and so on.  We must, therefore, encourage the charitable instinct and distinguish <Col N="559" /> between the charitable instinct and the patronising instinct.  Obviously, one does not want charity at the expense of patronage but what one does want is genuine charity that comes from the heart and the goodwill of the people, particularly in a community.  Here again we get back to the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;.  If the charitable instinct can be developed in a community and if we talk about scale and community rather than size and centre, then we are trying to develop a good feeling among our citizens where they are close enough and inter-relate closely enough to be able to respond, and have the goodwill to see the community flourish.  Therefore we must encourage this charitable instinct.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of accountability which other Senators have already referred to.  I agree entirely with Senator Willie Farrell when he said that no exceptions should be made.  The question is, how we go about it.  Judging by the Minister's responses, both verbal and non-verbal, to the proposals being made by Senator Cregan I feel quite confident that this will be done in a very sensitive manner.  I am quite certain that those organisations which are traditional to Ireland and which are highly respected will understand when the whole thing is explained to them, provided the trouble is taken to explain it to them, preferably in a direct rather than an indirect approach.  We want to have traditional charities with us.  I support fully the words of praise lavished on the St. Vincent de Paul Society which has done so much work throughout the world.  Those of us who have worked in Third World countries can testify to that.</P>
    <P>We want to know much more about the expenses paid by charities because, as we know, expenses can cover a multitude of sins.  What can be put down as expenses may, in fact, be a form of salary. We want to know about the fees, salaries and wages paid and we want to have this said openly.  If it is apparent that a charity is being run on a shoe string and that the officers of that charity are doing their work for a pittance that is an added reason why people will feel more <Col N="560" /> generosity in helping the charity to do their work.  If, on the other hand, vast salaries are being paid, then it is time questions were asked.  I would also ask the Minister to ban completely, which Senator Reynolds referred to, door to door collections where people can go around in a very threatening mood to collect money for organisations for which the person from whom money is being requested has little or no sympathy and may even have antipathy but who has to give money because of fear.</P>
    <P>In that respect, it is time we looked at the issue of canvassing for signatures at the doorstep.  Exactly the same thing applies when one is confronted by a heavy at the front door.  It takes a lot of courage to say no, that one is not prepared to sign.  It is time that we looked at that aspect of the door to door knock as well. Anyone who lives in Northern Ireland will be well aware of this, I am sure it happens here also.  At times of tension extraordinary things called referenda seem to be used as a means of bringing people to one's doorstep who certainly are not prepared to take no for an answer, if there is any way of not doing so.</P>
    <P>The question of charity by mail also needs to be looked at.  How can we deal with the vast amount of unsolicited mail that comes through our letterboxes? What controls are in place, particularly to help those who may be weak and who may respond in circumstances where if they were either more mature or aware they would not be so gullible?  I think the question of accountability in relation to the demand for funding for so-called charities by mail on a wide scale also needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made in regard to covenanting.  It is nonsensical that one can use the device of covenanting to enable people to have private education in privileged circumstances when deserving charities looking after the underprivileged have difficulty in obtaining the same degree of covenanting.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to what has already been said in giving the Minister encouragement.  I wish him every success. I have every confidence that he will <Col N="561" /> come up in his usual manner with very fine legislation and I hope by the time the legislation is thoroughly debated we will be glad to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this motion has received support from all sides of the House.  It has been a very useful debate.  Listening to Senator John Robb I am more convinced than ever that it is a great idea to have him in the Seanad, he has contributed so constructively on so many issues and legislation. I would like to congratulate him. He is a great asset to this House.</P>
      <P>We would all agree that most charities are bona fide and command our respect. As the Minister rightly said, without them there would be great problems and so much would land in the lap of the State that it would have to provide resources which it could ill-afford to provide. Having listened to the Members I must say I was much impressed with the support we received and with the very useful contributions they made.  More than anything else it was emphasised that there was a need for some form of action to protect the public.  I have received quite a number of letters of support from both members of the public and from legitimate charities, with the members of the public expressing their disquiet and the legitimate charities agreeing with the need for control and monitoring to eliminate these fly-by-night charities which exploit the generosity of the public and create great problems for established charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much impressed by what the Minister had to say.  I am happier now than ever that he intends to take some action.  I know this is a very difficult area and he has to tread very warily.  It is very easy to announce a five point plan, do this, that and the other but one creates more problems than one tries to solve in the process.  That is the big problem.  We do not want bureaucracy destroying all voluntary and individual effort; we do not want that at all.  That is why we cannot rush in.  We have emphasised that there is public disquiet, that something must be done, that it is going to be looked at <Col N="562" /> very soon and appropriate action will be taken.  We cannot claim to have a perfect answer and I recognise that the Minister cannot give one.  I must say that I was impressed by the recommendations of Gorta who wrote to me in 1987 with some proposals.  They said that charities should be registered or licensed with some statutory body, perhaps a companies registration office or a register of friendly societies.  Therefore, only charities properly registered could apply to the authority for a permit to collect money from the public.  Secondly, they recommended that all charities should account for their income or expenditure and that all charitable organisations should be subject to the Companies Act.  They suggested that administration costs should be determined by law, that clear guidelines should be laid down as to what constitutes administration and that commission arrangements are open to abuse.  They proposed that an exemption should be made in the case of bodies raising funds up to a maximum of £5,000 annually. They also recommended that there be control of the number of charities collecting at any one time and that serious attempts should be made to enforce the regulations regarding identification, the type of container, authorisation to collect and the minimum age of those collecting. These are guidelines the Minister could reflect on.  He has probably seen them and therefore I am not going to take up the time of this House unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>We have said all we need to say.  It was wonderful to see that there was all-party agreement on the need for action to be taken.  I was very impressed by what the Cathaoirleach had to say.  There is a provision in Standing Orders that enables the Cathoirleach or Ceann Comhairle to step down from the Chair to make a contribution from the floor of the House. The Cathaoirleach has her own views on the subject and she should be given the opportunity to make such a contribution. She expressed how she felt about this issue and she was quite entitled to say what she did.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success on what I said is a most difficult task.  I will <Col N="563" /> be looking forward very anxiously, along with everybody else in this House and indeed the public, to the proposals he will bring before the Government and the legislation he hopes to introduce to bring this problem under control.</P>
    <P>There was one case I referred to in Cork, and the Minister referred to this, in regard to an organisation sending out Christmas cards.  I admire the person's frankness and honesty.  He admitted he was not collecting for a charity at all, he said he had the franchise for Ireland and that the money never went to support the disabled.  He had the franchise for Ireland.  He kept 60 per cent of the profits and he sent the other 40 per cent back to some company in Liechtenstein.  He admitted this and was very honest about it.  He is not supporting a charity and his business will probably collapse.  I do not think he was making much profit; people did not return the moneys to him and he had suffered some losses.  He is from Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Doyle of his desire to raise on the Adjournment, in view of the deteriorating air quality in Dublin, the need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the Special Control Area (Ballyfermot) Order, 1988, sought under section 39 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and to initiate a public awareness campaign for citizens residing outside the area covered by the order of the existence and availability of alternative non-polluting fuels at little or no extra cost to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on the Adjournment in the Seanad on 20 January 1988 on this subject but it was not possible then to talk about air pollution and the effects it was having on our population. I informed the Seanad on 9 December 1987 that the meteorological services broadcast their very first smog alert as Dublin was surrounded by choking smoke from thousands of coal fires for the second night in succession with visibility in some of the worst affected areas reduced to 50 yards or less.  At that time the EC limit for smoke pollution was breached at a number of monitoring stations in and around Dublin.  It was fortunate for everyone that the atmospheric conditions improved and that that smog outbreak was not prolonged or severe.</P>
      <P>When air quality standards prescribed by ministerial order under the 1987 Air Pollution Act are breached there is a statutory obligation on the local authorities concerned to take appropriate steps, using their powers under the Act to secure compliance with standards. Dublin Corporation complied with this regulation and some time ago presented for ministerial sanction a Special Control Area, Ballyfermot &mdash; Order, 1988 &mdash; under section 39 of the Air Pollution Act. While awaiting ministerial approval of that smoke control order Dublin experienced yet again a very severe and prolonged smog outbreak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> The EC limit for smoke pollution was breached last Sunday in the Ballyfermot and Cabra areas of Dublin with levels of 311 and 259 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.  This followed the breaching of the EC limit of 250 micrograms on three successive days requiring the Government to notify the European Commission of the breach of EC Air Pollution Directive.  The level of smog was also very high in other areas of the city.  For instance, in Crumlin, on Saturday, a reading of 237 micrograms was taken, while in Mountjoy Square, on Sunday, the smog level reached 232 microgrammes.  Rathmines recorded a smog level of 185 micrograms on Sunday and the Sandymount area was affected also.</P>
    <P>When I asked that this matter be discussed on the Adjournment last week, that was prior to the Minister signing the order.  The Minister signed the order yesterday.  His delay in doing so was rather difficult to understand, especially in relation to the smog levels experienced over the last few weeks.  It is yet more difficult to explain the delay in the signing of this order to people who had to attend hospitals in Dublin suffering from respiratory problems.  It has been reported in the media that a medical practitioner &mdash; who gave his name &mdash; in Ballyfermot had to have two elderly people admitted to hospital.  He noted an increase of 20 per cent in respiratory ailments compared with this time last year.  While the signing of the order by the Minister would not have solved these problems, nevertheless it would have been a psychological factor and have been of some help to people who would have realised that something positive was being done about their problems and discomfort.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister has amended Dublin Corporation's original order for the first smoke control area in Ballyfermot by including briquettes and permitting the burning of bituminous coal in special appliances.  According to his press release the Minister stated that the weight of the evidence presented by the agents in favour of the full burning fire &mdash; which is claimed to reduce smoke <Col N="566" /> emissions by 80 per cent &mdash; was overwhelming, that he had to accept it, especially when it had not been refuted by anybody at the relevant inquiry.  Again according to his press release, the Minister stated that if these appliances did not live up to their claim, he would have no hesitation in withdrawing his approval. In that regard he said EOLAS were being asked to carry out some smoke emission tests and, dependent on their results, he would decide what appliances would be included in future orders.</P>
    <P>The people of Ballyfermot &mdash; psychologically &mdash; feel that no order has been made by the Minister.  Secondly, its provisions render the job of monitoring the consumption of coal more difficult.  When the burning of bituminous coal is allowed in a smoke control area, it completely defeats the purpose of having a smoke control area.  Dublin Corporation have prepared a case for a second application in respect of the Ballyfermot area.  There is now a doubt as to whether the Minister would confirm any further orders until such time as tests are carried out on the relevant approved appliances.  The Minister might clarify the position this evening so that there will be no undue delay in the making of a second order.</P>
    <P>It appears that the provisions of the grants scheme will apply from some future date whereas it should have been operative from February last when the Minister announced that he was setting aside £250,000 for that purpose.  Already over 200 people have converted to smokeless fuel.  It would appear to me to be a breach of confidence to exclude them from the grants scheme only because they acted voluntarily in response to the publicity campaign initiated by the Minister. It is important that the goodwill of all the people of Ballyfermot be harnessed so that, in that area at least, the original resolution of the city council could be more easily implemented without the need for coercion.  The intention of Dublin Corporation was to proceed with further orders.  However, this momentum would be slowed down if people in the special control area withheld their support through lack of confidence in the <Col N="567" /> grants scheme, as would the effectiveness of the ministerial order allowing exemptions.</P>
    <P>The use of smokeless fuel outside the control area must be encouraged also. First, there must be a clear educational campaign to bring home to the public the advantages and availability of smokeless fuel.  At present the Minister has initiated a positive publicity campaign to encourage motorists to use lead-free petrol. How much more acceptable would be a positive programme to encourage people to use in their fireplaces smokeless fuels now available.  While such smokeless fuels are a little dearer than bituminous coal, I understand they have a better heat content and last longer.  Secondly, I contend that the Minister for Finance should assist in the competitiveness of smokeless fuels by eliminating or reducing VAT along the same lines and for the same reasons as his recent welcome proposal in respect of the usage of lead-free petrol.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the implementation of some, or all, of these measures &mdash; at a minimum cost to public funds &mdash; would result in a drastic improvement in smoke pollution in the Dublin area over a relatively short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Senator Doyle welcomes the signing of the special control order which I attended to yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank him for his concern about Dublin's smoke pollution problems; they are shared by the Minister.  Of course he will be aware by now that, following the consideration of the report at the oral hearing held between 28 June and 4 July 1988, I confirmed the Special Control Area (Ballyfermot) Order, 1988 with modifications on 8 November 1988.  In deciding to confirm the order with modification I took into account the weight of evidence put forward at the oral hearing in favour of the appliance known as the full burning fire.  Having regard to the evidence presented at the hearing, I intend to make regulations as soon as possible under the Air Pollution Act, <Col N="568" /> 1987 specifying the full burning fire as an authorised fireplace for the purpose of the special control area order in this case. I will also make regulations on the same basis declaring Bord na Móna peat briquettes to be an authorised fuel also for the purposes of the order.</P>
    <P>I have exercised a quasi-judicial function in regard to the confirmation, with modifications, of the order.  I do not propose to discuss the making of that decision in the circumstances.  However, in confirming the order, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not a solution in itself, it is just a first step towards a solution.  A solution for this winter would require coercion at a level Ireland would not take and money would have to be provided at a level that we do not have.  We are not ready for a situation in which coal lorries are not allowed into certain streets or in which inspectors go into one's house to check what are is burning in one's grate.  We do not have the money to equalise the cost of smokeless and ordinary coals.  Therefore, an instant, complete, solution is not on but a solution is overdue and will happen within a three-year period.  It is going to start immediately with this order.  It could not start any sooner because I had to take into account the oral hearing evidence, all 585 closely typed pages.</P>
    <P>The confirmation of the order brings into operation now a scheme of grants to help householders in the special control area to meet the costs of adapting their household heating to comply with the order.  A sum of £250,000 is being provided this year and a sum of £1 million is being made available in the coming year to fund the grants scheme.  The sooner people take up the grant offer which is available now, the sooner they adapt their systems the sooner, we will have air we are happy to breathe.  The bottom line is that the order comes into operation in May 1989 which allows people a sufficient interim period within which to make the necessary changes.  The date of 31 May takes account of section 41 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, which provides that <Col N="569" /> an order cannot come into operation earlier than six months after its confirmation.</P>
    <P>I do not want the existence of this order to suggest to anybody that the problem is now under control; it is not.  The problem is not confined to a couple of smoke ghettoes within the city.  I do not want anybody to believe that one cures smog by making rules and merely giving out grants; there is more to it than that.  Last weekend in Dublin there was smog in a lot of areas way outside the Ballyfermot area, in some middle class areas, where smoke was coming out of chimneys and just sitting over those areas as well.  The problem is that many people who could afford smokeless fuels do not buy them because they do not see themselves as contributing to the smog that is putting people in hospital and keeping our children from school.  We are going to have to make that fact clear to everybody in this city; no matter where one lives one should not be using polluting fuels.  If everybody in this capital city bought smokeless fuels &mdash; and particularly those who can afford to make the choice &mdash; the problem would disappear virtually overnight.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned people who buy smokeless fuels are investing in their health.  I join the Senator and anybody else who will encourage people, other than those who live in Ballyfermot where they find difficulty in affording smokeless fuels, to use the resources available to them to change their lifestyles in so far as the purchasing of particular types of fuels are concerned.  To that end I called on all the suppliers of those fuels which do not pollute to promote them specifically in the suburbs of Dublin.  I was happy this morning to hear the first part of that call was heard on our airwaves. The campaign &mdash; following on my call to the promoters to promote the use of smokeless fuels &mdash; started this morning. I hope it will be effective.</P>
    <P>The confirming of the order is one of a number of measures that I plan to put into place to solve the problem.  For example, I intend to consider urgently possibilities such as the following: in <Col N="570" /> future new house grants will be confined to houses fitted with smokeless appliances in the heavily built-up parts of Dublin and possibly in many other built up areas with corresponding provisions for new public housing.  A general policy directive will be issued under the Planning Acts relating to the use of smokeless heating systems in any new or reconstructed premises, domestic or otherwise, in these same built-up areas.  Dublin Corporation houses are to be converted to smokeless-type fuels either through the existing remedial works scheme or a special scheme where major refurbishment work is taking place.  There will be also the conversion of Government and public buildings in Dublin to smokeless fuels.  There are other things that can be done also.  These are just some of the ideas I am considering at present to help out not just in the Ballyfermots of this city but also in the other areas which contribute to the general level of emissions throughout the whole city.</P>
    <P>I intend that there will be an information campaign to advise the public generally of the advantages of smokeless fuels, their existence, their availability and of heating conversion possibilities too.  That information campaign began today.  I want it to be just as important and effective as is the campaign for the use of lead-free petrol.  I hope that this campaign can be run in conjunction with local residents' associations and other groups with an interest in the matter.  I have been contacted by representatives of some residents' associations in the south part of the city who are talking about such conversion voluntarily.  I welcome that and am encouraged that people are taking the matter into their own hands, providing better health for themselves.</P>
    <P>This smoke pollution problem has been building up for three decades.  My action is the first attempt by any Minister for the Environment, Minister for Local Government or any other Minister, to do something positive about it and to provide the money necessary to make it possible.  On occasions one can be quite resentful when one hears people talking <Col N="571" /> about too little, too late, particularly those people who would not do anything about the problem in the past.  I say it is a little and much more will have to be done but it is going to be solved and can be solved within three years.  The grants available immediately for adaptation along with the promotion of smokeless fuels &mdash; which I expect on the part of fuel suppliers &mdash; could make a difference within a matter of months.  While people might say that it is not possible to get an immediate good result, I contend it is, if people would take and make the choice that is available to them.  Those who can afford to do so, should do so forthwith. Ballyfermot must deal with their situation immediately.  It is not for me to direct Dublin Corporation but Senator Doyle could help out in this matter by pressing Dublin Corporation to consider now other areas where they know there have been consequences quoted by the Senator himself, in breach, or close to being in breach of the relevant EC directive. I would advocate that they would now put forward other orders for ministerial consideration, when I will be happy to support them.</P>

In June I told people an order would be signed and implemented.  I told them that, from the date of signature, grants would be available.  Now people are asking: why do I not give grants to people who did make a genuine effort to do something about this problem themselves. They would have done so whether or not they received a grant.  I cannot make the order retrospective.  I feel I gave due notice in mid-1988.  Therefore, there was nobody under any illusion whatsoever as to where they stood.  I can appreciate Senator Doyle's concern in the matter but, equally, he will appreciate that it is standard practice in so far as grant assistance is concerned.</P>
