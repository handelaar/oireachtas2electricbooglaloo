      <P>I have notice from Senator Philip Hogan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the serious consequences her proposed change in the pupil teacher ratio will have on the pupils and staff of Tullow Community School, County Carlow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to seek an explanation from the British authorities of an incident at Leeds-Bradford Airport when a leading Irish cultural representative (name supplied) was forced to enter his name in English on a landing card and the implications of this incident for other Irish citizens using British provincial airports and seaports.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The rapidly deteriorating ophthalmic services in the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators <Col N="2032" /> Hogan, Mooney and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hogan's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Mooney and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I am very pleased that the Leader of the House has been able to arrange the debate on Anglo-Irish affairs for next week.  On the Order of Business, I would like to put a proposal to the House which I would like the House to consider.  A Chathaoirligh, I beg your indulgence for a moment. Probably the biggest change this country will face will result from the implementation of the single European market in 1992 and it will affect every single aspect of Irish industry.  My feeling is that the public is not very well prepared for this. I wonder if this House could find some way to provide either a series of debates or perhaps invite in distinguished people from the various sectors of Irish industry to provide the forum within which this debate could take place.  I think it would be a vital public service to the country.  I am simply making the proposal now and I would like if it could be received in a fairly open spirit by the other parties in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a comment on the Order of Business today and ask the Leader of the House a couple of questions.  First of all, I would like to thank him for agreeing to a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs.  It is probably in order that an Independent Member of the House should congratulate the Leader of the House on the way the business of the House on the whole has been run during this session.  We have got through a lot of legislation.  Secondly, it is only fair to say that the Leader of the House has been extremely accommodating, maybe sometimes a little slowly, in having debates on subjects like the Irish Constitution and Anglo-Irish affairs.  I genuinely think this is to be commended and it does the House nothing but good.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out one thing about the Order of Business today and yesterday.  Legislation is initiated in this House, which is a very good thing but we seem to be a little short of legislation in the House now.  Yesterday evening, in fact, the House adjourned because there was no legislation left.  In that context, I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether he would consider taking Item No. 13 which is a Bill to abolish the death penalty.  On the Independent benches we have certain Bills which, if the Leader of the House does not accommodate us, will quite simply not be taken and will not be debated.  The abolition of the death penalty is one.  Senator Ryan has another one which it is important that this House should take a decision.  This has been on the Order Paper in one way or another for five or six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to know is whether the Government are in favour of the abolition of the death penalty or whether the Government are actually against the abolition of the death penalty.  At the moment they are sitting on the Statute Book.  I should remind Senator Mooney, if he is here, that were it in force in England in 1974 the Birmingham Six, whose cause he champions, would in fact have been hanged at this stage.  They would have suffered the death penalty. In that context it is important.  The death <Col N="2034" /> penalty is on the Statute Book and I ask the Leader of the House to tell us whether the Government have a stand to make on this and whether he is actually prepared to give time to debate, not necessarily to pass, Private Members' Bills when there is no other legislation to be discussed which is Government legislation.  In general, I would like to say I am very grateful for the time given to debate those motions which the Opposition and the Independents have been in favour of talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House has committed the House to a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs next Thursday.  Has he any suggestion on what the format will be, what the length of time for each speaker will be and whether the Taoiseach is coming in?  I think he is the man to whom we want to speak on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I associate myself with Senator Ross's remarks and compliment the Leader of the House on the number of items of business of relevant interest he has arranged to have discussed here?  He is now suspicious that I am going to spring something on him, as I am being so complimentary.  However, I want to make a request to the House. I know in the previous Seanad there was a provision for invitations to distinguished visitors to speak to this House.  I am not quite sure of the present status of that provision.  A very eminent international figure will be in this country in two weeks time, the President of the African National Congress.  I think it would be quite fitting if we were to invite the President of the African National Congress to address this House.  It is not unprecedented. We had a provision for such an invitation.  I suggest, respectfully, to the House, given the present deteriorating situation in South Africa, that it would be a very useful idea to invite the President of the African National Congress to address this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever is dying out there I do not think it is the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan proposed that an invitation should be sent to the President of the ANC to address the House.  I agree with his sentiments on this matter.  The African National Congress should be allowed to address as many fora as they possibly can throughout the world because of the terribly repressive measures which have been imposed recently on the majority community and their supporters in Africa.  It is horrific that freedom of speech and freedom of association and now the freedom to aid the majority community out there have been taken away by this very repressive Government.</P>
      <P>I think the invitation should be left to the CPP to discuss.  I have no objection to it but it is a matter for the CPP.  I do not think it is for me to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, could I say that our group would support the invitation were it to be extended?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever we say here I think it should be left to the CPP to decide.  Regarding next week's debate on Anglo-Irish affairs I think the Whips should meet.  I am not running away from the question asked by Senator Ferris. That noise is probably a drill from the Chamber inside.  We decided when we moved into this room that we would allow people to work there because the longer they work the sooner we will return to the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>My head is a little more dense than those of certain other people. So, we should leave the Whips to get together on the format of the Anglo-Irish debate.  Senator Ross suggested that we should debate Item No. 13.  I accept what he says as being what he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of Senator Manning's suggestion about the implications for industry and so forth of the Single European Act, we had a debate here on the EC reports on developments in the EC since 1986.  That would have given everybody an opportunity to raise the implications of the Single European Act &mdash; the single market.  Unfortunately, during that debate only five Senators spoke.  We had two Ministers in on that debate and only five Senators took the opportunity to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Manning is on another side.  He is quite right regarding the unknown out there in the industrial world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could reiterate what I said, the single market is part of the Single European Act.  We had an opportunity here, which the other House did not have, to discuss the reports from the European Communities from January 1986 which included the legislation and the debate which took place on the implications of the Single European Act. There will be a 30th report which will be dated January 1987 and we can discuss it in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I asked the Leader of the House two questions and he has not answered either of them. First, are the Government in favour of the abolition of hanging and, secondly, is he prepared to give time to discuss it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two questions. The first question Senator Ross asked was in relation to the death penalty. He did not mention hanging.  I accept the question.  I agree with the Senator that legislation is a little short at present.  I addressed this matter yesterday with the Taoiseach and with the <Col N="2037" /> Chief Whip in the other House.  I hope we will not be short of legislation.  One of the problems we have had over the past number of months is the fact that the Dáil has been debating the budget and the Finance Bill.  That has meant that not much has been coming to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard a single point of relevance from the Leader of the House to the two questions I asked.  Are the Government in favour of the abolition of hanging and will the Leader of the House give time for a debate on it? Please, could the Leader of the House give me an answer to that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being frivolous.  I think the Leader of the House should address himself to the two questions which I asked.  I may not find the answers satisfactory but I think he could give me the courtesy of a reply to them.</P>

      <P>Is aoibhinn liom bheith ar ais maidin ghrianmhar mar seo.  I have noted Report No. 31 of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  I am happy to say that the Committee's recommendation that a derogation be availed of under EC Directive No. 79/409 on wild birds to allow for control of certain species in the interests of protection of agricultural crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry and any flora and fauna, has been implemented since July, 1986.  The committee has since expressed its satisfaction at this measure in its report, No. 35 of 10 December 1986.  As to the Committee's recommendations in its 31st report on the hunting of certain species of wild birds, the option to hunt brent and barnacle geese could only be introduced in the context of an amendment to the EC bird directives.  The matter will receive full consideration having regard to the scientific data on these species in the event of any amendment to the bird directives.  In regard to the recommendation of the committee on the hunting of the four species of gull, I do not intend to pursue this as the species in question are not regarded as traditional quarry species in Ireland.  The custom in this country is to hunt only those species which are used for human consumption and gulls do not come into this category.</P>

      <P>Mar athrú ar an ngnáth nós a bhíonn agam, ba mhaith liom an rud seo a mhíniú i mBéarla i dtosach.  Labhróidh mé i nGaeilge ar ball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history in brief of the bird directive in this: the council directive of 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds was elaborated during the period 1974/79 by member states of the European Community. The directive aimed at the provision of a uniform system of protection for all naturally occurring wild birds within the territories of the Community. The system of protection covered such matters as regulations of exploitation, including hunting and trade protection of habitats especially wet-lands and those of the species identified as rare, vulnerable and endangered in Annex I, for example, the Greenland white fronted goose and peregrine falcon and resolution of conflict arising from damage of it remained with individual member states to translate the provisions of the corrective international <Col N="2041" /> law in the most appropriate fashion.  The directive came into effect in April, 1981.</P>
    <P>The directive is implemented in Ireland under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The Act pre-dated the directive and had been drafted with one eye on the increasing international dimension of conservation of wildlife.  It was felt that with the minor exception of the making of a number of regulations, for example, to prohibit the sale of two species, Gadwall and Goldeneye, designation of special protection areas, for example, Wexford Wildfowl Reserve, Puffin Island and falconary regulations, Ireland was fully implementing the directive.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the Commission wrote to the Irish authorities querying certain aspects of implementation.  Many of the points raised by them were technical and had already been noted by the Wildlife Service for amendments to the Act for purposes of clarification.  The early issue which presented any difficulty was the inclusion of 12 species in the Third Schedule to the Act which effectively meant that there were no restrictions on the killing of these birds.  The 12 species were historically regarded as pest species and there were valid biological, social and administrative reasons for excluding them from the full scope of the Act. The Commission insisted that the general system of protection be applied to these birds regardless of ecological factors.  In effect, they sought a strict legalistic approach to the word of the directive and to a large extent, disregarded its spirit. Despite intensive negotiations with the Commission, they maintained their position. The Attorney General's office advised that there was a case in law against Ireland and that to avoid having a case stated against us in the European Court we should give the full protection of the Wildlife Act to the species involved.  The necessary amendments to the Wildlife Act were made by regulations under the European Communities Act in December, 1985.</P>
    <P>For practical purposes, it is necessary to consider the consequences of the protection <Col N="2042" /> of the former Third Schedule species only.  We were aware that there would be literally thousands of applications from farmers, fishermen, gun clubs and the like to control these species where they were causing damage and that we would be administratively unable to cope with these applications.  We, therefore, set about devising a system which would be in accordance with Article 9 of the directive &mdash; Article 9 deals with the control of species causing damage &mdash; and which would meet the legitimate control needs of interest groups without the need for each individual to obtain specific permission from the Wildlife Service.  Further regulations were made in July, 1986 which effectively allowed owners-occupiers of property or their agents to control named species where threat was posed to crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry, flora and fauna.  The system took six months to set in place.  In the interim, permissions to control these species were issued on demand.  Indeed, the National Association for Regional Gun Clubs and their affiliates and members were issued with a general permission within weeks of the problem arising.</P>
    <P>Following representations from the NARGC, the joint committee studied the amending regulations and issued a report on them.  The main issues raised in the joint committee report were (1), that Ireland should derogate from the protective provision of the directive to allow for control of pest species; (2), that some pest species and brent and barnacle geese be made huntable species; (3), that amendments made should have been effected by an amending Bill rather than by regulation under the Wildlife Act.</P>
    <P>The following points are relevant in regard to those issues.  First, Ireland was already making derogations under the Wildlife Act by issuing specific permissions to control.  The general system of permitting control which was subsequently introduced simplified matters considerably.  Secondly, the matter of seeking an amendment to the directive to allow the possibility of hunting brent and barnacle geese would be fully considered. <Col N="2043" /> The committee went on to say that there were no proposals to seek to have pest species declared as hunting species, except the pigeon, as this would not be in accordance with established practice in this country where traditional quarry species are edible.  People may not know it but there is now a pigeon shooting season which dates from 1 June to 31 January.  To make non-edible species huntable species would reduce them to the status of live targets.  It is important to maintain differentiation between legitimate control of species as a management option and hunting a species which as stated is usually confined to species which can be utilised as food.</P>
    <P>The amendments became necessary as a result of obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  The European Communities Acts were specifically designed to allow discharge of such obligations by the making of ministerial regulations.  The regulations were laid before the Oireachtas in the normal way.</P>
    <P>This case is a perfect example of the importance of international commitments and the reality of the extent to which wildlife conservation is now the concern of the international community. We found ourselves in a difficult situation in this instance despite the fact that there was no question of our good intentions and goodwill.  There are a number of other international measures to which the State has willingly become a party and which require positive conservation response.  We can only make that response if the political will exists to ensure adequate resources for conservation activities.  The alternative is to allow for the continuing degradation of our natural environment and the social and economic consequences of this for our own people are predictable.  There is also now the aspect that we will be guilty in international law of a breach of good faith and we will lessen our standing in the international community.</P>
    <P>Chun go mairfidh an cine daonna is gá an dúlra a chaomhnú.  Chuir an Straitéis Domhanda Caomhnaithe abhaile ar cheannasaithe in go leor tíortha go bhfuil <Col N="2044" /> an caomhnú agus an fhorbairt leanúnach ag brath ar a chéile; is iad dhá thaobh an aon bhoinn amháin iad.

    <P>Baineann an teachtaireacht seo le hÉirinn chomh maith le gach áit eile.  Ní fhéadfaimís bheith ag súil go n-éireodh linn an fhorbairt eacnamaíoch a iompar má leanaimíd orainn ag ligint don ola ár gcósta a thruailliú agus don sadhlas agus d'eisiltigh eile na héisc a mharú, nó má leanaimíd orainn ag leagan na gcrann aithghiniúnacha ar mhaithe le brabhach na gearrthréimhse.  Sna blianta atá romhainn amach beidh athshlánú na turasóireachta agus athnuachan na talmhaíochta araon ag brath ar chaomhnú.  Chun taca a chur faoin eacnamaíocht go fadtréimhseach agus chun go n-éireoidh linn ár n-oidhreacht a thabhairt slán ar mhaithe leis na glúnta a thiocfaidh, is anois a chaithfimíd an dúlra a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>Ní fearr beartas lena bhféadfadh an Rialtas réiteach a dhéanamh idir caomhnú agus forbairt ná glacadh leis an Straitéis Domhanda Caomhnaithe. Beidh an chéim eile níos dúshlánaí, Straitéis Náisiúnta Caomhnaithe na hÉireann a ullmhú a mbeadh in éineacht leis clár oibre dírithe ar chospóirí áirithe caomhnaithe agus forbairte leanúnaí.  Gan amhras d'fhéadfadh Treoir an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh a dtaobh Imshaol a mheas, a thiocfaidh i bhfeidhm i 1988, bheith ina cabhair mhór.  Ba bheag an tairbhe an chuid is lú di a chur i gcrích. Ach beidh ardtoradh ar an treoir seo más le hiomlán a brí a chuirfimíd i bhfeidhm í ar réimse leathan de thionscadail fhorbartha.</P>
    <P>Ag cuimhneamh dúinn ar a thábhachtaí atá forbairt na talmhaíochta in Éirinn tá sé riachtanach réiteach a dhéanamh idir é agus an caomhnú.  Is í an phráinn is mó go n-ainmneoimís na ceantair is mó a bhfuil an t-imshaol i mbaol iontu.  Ó 1988 amach beidh airgead le fáil ón gComhphobal chun go dtiocfaidh chun cinn na cleachtais thalmhaíochta úd a dhéanfaidh leas an dúlra in áit dochar a dhéanamh mar a tharlaíonn go rómhinic. <Col N="2045" /> Ar fud fhairsinge na tuaithe is ar tháirgithe nádúrtha den scoth a bheidh meas de bharr athruithe ar an gComhpholasaí Talmhaíochta agus solathróidh caomhnú an dúlra deiseanna nua chun fiontair thuaithe a fhorbairt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area which I regard as a vital interest.  Legislation has been introduced from time to time.  The Wildlife Act, 1976 was designed to provide an up-to-date statutory framework for wildlife conservation in Ireland.  It will be interesting to Senators to note that the Wildlife Act, 1976 was introduced in Seanad Éireann and in the course of discussing the legislation the Seanad made several amendments to the Bill and the legislation for the preservation of wildlife at the time was very much improved from the original format when it went to the other House.  It proves that this House was at that time and now is more so vital in our system of legislation.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting to note that the Act for the preservation of wild birds and the Game Preservation Act came from this House and would not be in existence but for the fact that in 1977 Members of the House initiated the Bills in question. The Game Preservation Act allowed people to set up gun clubs throughout the country.  I would like to put on record my congratulations to these gun clubs for their excellent work and especially for the disciplined manner in which they ensure that wildlife is protected and especially among their preserves.  The purpose of the legislation at the time was to encourage awareness among the people of the importance of preservation of our wildlife, complying with nature in the manner of the stronger making peace with the weaker.  Unless measures had been taken to protect endangered species their numbers would have decreased and that would have been a great loss.  The Wildlife Act, 1976 and the previous legislation ensured that people took notice of this fact and took appropriate measures to ensure these species would not disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us find it difficult to think clearly about wildlife.  We tend to talk as though we would like all types of species <Col N="2046" /> to be preserved.  Some wildlife live by eating each other and we generally feel more in favour of rare species than common ones.  No one seems to press for preservation of parasitic worms, rats, mice, cabbage white-butterflies or even grey squirrels &mdash; never mind about viruses and bacteria &mdash; but there is enormous support for frogs, toads, dormice, birds, other than sparrows, starlings and pigeons, deer and red squirrels.</P>
    <P>However, simply pointing out how illogical we are does not greatly help. What is needed is a genuine attempt to sort out what it is we really care about and what is really threatened.  Millions of people feel that we should not risk losing a species forever and that a thriving wildlife adds value to our environment.  Most of us probably agree.  What we disagree about is whether what we desire can be achieved consistent with good farm practice, what farm practices are harmful, how much it would cost to do better and who should pay.</P>
    <P>There are two major aspects: the first is the destruction of habitats by removal of hedges and trees, by drainage, ploughing and other cultivations; the second is the use of chemicals, part of the pollution problem.  In the Wildlife Bill, 1975 there was a Third Schedule and I will quote from the Official Report of Dáil at the time, 311, 22 January 1970.  The then Minister, Deputy Fitzpatrick, said:</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule, relating to wild birds, contains what might be called the black-listed categories, that is wellknown and numerous pests species for which the conservation measures of the Bill are not at present deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>I will quote from page 7 of the Joint Committee's report:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas decided in 1976 that the species of wild birds specified in the Third Schedule to the Wildlife Act, 1976 did not need protection in this country though the Minister was empowered to provide by regulations to extend protection to these birds. The Joint Committee has not heard <Col N="2047" /> any evidence that present circumstances in this country require protection to what may be called Third Schedule birds.  On the contrary it has been represented to the Joint Committee that these birds are a positive source of danger to agricultural interests, other wild birds and game stocks and that this danger is aggravated by the density of population of at least some of them in this country. In the case of these birds it would seem to the Committee that Ireland should derogate from the provisions of the Directive to enable their activities to be controlled by killing or capture without a licence or permission in the interests of preventing &ldquo;serious damage to crops, livestocks, forests, fisheries and water&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the protection of flora and fauna&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Page 9 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The damage referred to in section 42 (1) of the Act is that caused to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  livestock, poultry or agricultural crops (including vegetables or fruit) either on pasture or on cultivated land,</P>
    <P>(b)  pen-reared wild birds on any land,</P>
    <P>(c)  other fauna,</P>
    <P>(d)  flora,</P>
    <P>(e)  a woodland or a forest plantation, or</P>
    <P>(f)  a fishery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee has been informed by the Department that no action will be taken against a person who kills a wild bird, including those now specified in the Third Schedule to the Act but excluding the eight species specified in Part 1 of the Fourth Schedule, in order to prevent damage of the kind indicated above.  While this does provide some reassurance for farmers and others, the Joint Committee is not satisfied that it represents an adequate exercise of Ireland's right <Col N="2048" /> to derogate from provisions of the Directive in the case of any of the Third Schedule birds which are deemed likely to cause damage of the type indicated.</P>
    <P>I have a modest bit of land in the disadvantaged area of West Limerick.  Last year I had experience of sowing rape for fodder in the early spring of this year, but my hopes were extinguished because of damage done by pigeons and crows.  They can do immense damage to crops and especially to farming enterprises.  I am glad to note that the joint committee and the sub-committee which was chaired by Maurice Manning, then a TD, recognised that fact and while recognising that the preservation of wildlife is essential, would like farmers to realise that wildlife doing harm to the environment and to crops can be killed without a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because, unfortunately, I did not have sufficient time to study the report.  On the quick read I had of it I want, first of all, to thank the joint committee for the work they put into this report and for the recommendations they made.  They had the benefit of representations from the National Association of Game Councils and also from the Wexford Regional Game Council.  Those people made strong representations to the joint committee and I am sure their advice was well received.  Certainly advice from people with the experience of those two organisations would be very worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wildlife Act, 1976, which was enacted on 22 December 1976, provides for the protection of wild birds and their nests and eggs, other than the wild birds specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.  In 1979, the Council of the European Economic Community adopted council directive 79/409 EC on the conservation of naturally occurring birds in the wild state which the member states were required to implement.  Indeed, it is good that there is such a directive and that member states can be forced to bring in legislation to protect wildlife and to control vermin, etc.  We all know the havoc some wild birds can wreak on <Col N="2049" /> crops.  I have seen acres of corn flattened by flocks of crows who suddenly descend on the cornfields and proceed to trample and eat the corn, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.  It is, of course, necessary that constant control of such winged vermin should be allowed.  Grey crows and magpies have been known to attack young lambs and pluck out their eyes.  Pigeons cause considerable damage to vegetable crops.  We all know the thousands of pounds worth of damage they can cause to vegetables, particularly in the spring time.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the game councils and the gun clubs on the work they have done over the years in protecting wildlife.  They have done a very good job in attracting tourists by organising shoots and, of course, ensuring that protected species were not shot at, and this is very important.</P>
    <P>All of us have witnessed the departure of certain wildlife with which we were familiar over the years.  The old corncrake is sadly missed from the rural scene.  Of course, this has been caused by destruction of the natural habitat of the corncrake with the advent of silage, machines, more intensive fertilising of the land, and so on.  It is a pity to see such birds depart because they were harmless creatures that everybody looked forward to in spring time and it is said that they are no longer with us.  Every effort should be made to try to preserve and protect those kinds of birds.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the badger is also a protected species and those of us from rural areas realise the criticism farmers have of the badger, particularly as far as animal health is concerned, especially bovine TB.  Rightly or wrongly, the badger has been blamed for spreading TB amongst farm animals but it is very difficult to get the Department of Agriculture and Food to accept that or, indeed, to do any great tests or trials on the badger.  It is almost impossible for farmers to get a licence to destroy the badger.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to write to the Department about this problem in my own area where farmers had a bad outbreak <Col N="2050" /> of disease and, rightly or wrongly, they blamed the badger for it because badgers were fairly plentiful in that area. We tried to get a licence.  First you have to write to the Department of Agriculture and Food vet and notify him that you want to apply for a licence to destroy the badger.  The vet then has to come out and make a report on whether the badger is there, or whether he is coming into the farmer's land and, finally, if the licence is issued, it has to be issued by the Office of Public Works.  The Minister's Department apparently have the final say and I did not know that until I had occasion to look into this problem.  I thought the Department of Agriculture and Food would have sole responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>My criticism is that it is so difficult to get any direct information as to whether or not the badger is a carrier of TB.  In this day and age, having spent over the years over £100 million on the eradication of TB, the Department of Agriculture and Food should be able to pinpoint the source of the infection.  If the badger is to blame, as many farmers believe he is, every effort should be made to cull the badger.  Unfortunately, farmers cannot do that because they have to have a licence to do so as it is a protected species. It is difficult to convince farmers who have had the misfortune of a breakdown in their herds that the badger is not responsible and, as I have said, it is almost impossible to get a licence to destroy the badger.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on feathered birds. So I will finish by again complimenting the joint committee on the report they presented to us.  I am sure when we have time to study it, we can all learn something from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although not many Senators are interested in wildlife it is only right that this order should get a reasonable discussion.  I might add that if one were to confine oneself solely to the order, one would have very little to say because it deals with a certain number of birds only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1976 Wildlife Bill was actually launched in this House in early 1975 and <Col N="2051" /> it got a very good hearing and long discussion in this House.  It was towards the end of 1976 that it finally became law after being passed by the Dáil.  I am a little disappointed that we have not heard much about wildlife since then.  At that time the Bill was brought in here by the Minister for Lands.  Before that, it was dealt with by the Minister for Justice. Now we have a Department of Finance input.  It was said then that was the first time in 45 years any legislation had been prepared dealing with wildlife.  It appears that it could be another 45 years before we hear about it again.  That is a pity.</P>
    <P>I understand an advisory council was to be set up at that time.  If that advisory council were set up we have not had any reports from them in this House.  When we were speaking here on the Wildlife Bill in 1975 great concern was expressed by many speakers about the scarcity of ordinary birds like the thrush, the blackbird, the yellow-hammer, the lark, the corncrake, the snipe and the swallow.  All of those were mentioned at that time. Why were they becoming so scarce and what was the reason for it?  Strange as it may seem, the only bird that increased in population since then is the swallow. During the war years swallows became scarce.  They migrate but in the area I come from they are more plentiful now than ever before.  We cannot say that about other birds such as the corncrake. I mentioned at that time that I heard one corncrake in the area I come from.  I venture to say that if children born within the past seven or eight years heard the corncrake in Tipperary, they would wonder what it was.</P>
    <P>Have the advisory council done anything to discover the reason for the scarcity of those birds?  I think the reason is that after the last World War farmers treated the land better than formerly; land was highly manured and perhaps that is one of the reasons.  Silage came in some years ago.  Silage was not known in this country until about 30 years ago.  It is cut early in the year and perhaps it is cut three times a year with the result that it is probably affecting the hatching of <Col N="2052" /> chicks of wild birds.  Drainage however, has done most harm.  We all know that arterial drainage is very necessary but I wonder is it necessary for us when we go in for arterial drainage to drain every little stream miles away from the main river in places where you had bogs or marshy land in rich land areas like Tipperary. I am not aware of what is happening in counties like Mayo, Donegal or places where you have a lot of wet land; I am really speaking about what is happening in the Golden Vale and the scarcity of birds.</P>
    <P>Practically every bit of this wet land was drained in Tipperary and other counties and that meant there was no longer room for birds like snipe in those places. Were we doing the right thing?  I think we were not, because if a lot of the land drained by using Government grants is not maintained within three years it becomes wet again.  Therefore that land was costing a lot of money to maintain. Now we have reached the stage when we have too much land, something we thought would never happen.  Farmers are being offered money by the EC to let their land lie idle.  That is a sad state of affairs, but it is not our doing.  We were asked to produce in this country and we did produce.  It might be a good thing if some of this land in every area was set aside for birds as a place where they could nest and live.</P>
    <P>Others have paid a tribute &mdash; and I want to be associated with it &mdash; to our game councils and our gun clubs for what they have done for the protection of wildlife. I live near the Glen of Aherlow and there is a game council and gun club there.  They have done a lot of work in trying to keep the wildlife in that area and bringing wildlife into it.  They are not getting the support they deserve from the Department, or Bord Fáilte, or anyone else.  I know they had a scheme whereby they grew two areas of grain every year, mostly oats, which were allowed to remain uncut and left there as feeding for the wild birds in the winter time.  They told me recently they were not able to keep that up.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the tourist trade <Col N="2053" /> being a great asset for this country but we are not helping our gun clubs or game councils to do something to entice the tourists here.  In Strasbourg every hotel is booked out for the weekend during the shooting season.  Tourists go there from Paris and other cities for the weekend.  I see no reason why we could not have things like that in this country.  Down through the years this has been a marvellous country for wildlife but in recent times things were not as good as they should be.  While I welcome this report, I think there should be more reports. There should be a report before this House and perhaps the other House also at least once a year on the position of wildlife in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading through the report the council directive from the EC states that the directive imposes a general obligation on member states to conserve all species of naturally occurring birds in the wild state so as to maintain their population at or adapt it to a level which corresponds in particular to ecological scientific and cultural requirements while taking account of economic and recreational requirements.  What I have found throughout the report is that it is quite difficult to achieve a balance to have the protected species protected and have the pest species not creating too much havoc.  That seems to be the difficulty. Anyone coming from a farming community would know that some of these species can cause untold trouble to farmers in killing and trampling crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate the Game Council and the gun clubs for trying to help to protect the endangered species.  The Department should adopt some kind of educational programme informing the farming community as to the type of steps they could take to try not to destroy natural habitats of these protected species. From my point of view there is a form of ignorance.  I do not come from a farming community and I do not have any great interest in hunting or other such pursuits.  From a totally neutral point of view, a farmer may not be aware, if he carries out some form of drainage he may <Col N="2054" /> be destroying a natural habitat of some wildlife species.</P>
    <P>Getting away from birds for a moment, I come from an area which has a large inland fishing area.  We find that many people involved in this are very anxious about the amount of pike being taken out of the country and killed.  If that continues, pike will become an endangered species.  That would be a great loss to the tourism industry.  I would sincerely hope that something like that would not happen.  As Senator Willie Ryan has stated there should also be a good tourism promotion for the pheasant season.  I had not been aware until Senator de Buitleár stated it that there is a season for pigeon shooting.  These things should be emphasised and converted possibly into a tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report but I would ask the Minister to give some thought to my point about an educational committee informing the various communities of unnecessary work which may be the cause of destroying natural habitats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Molaim go mór an obair atá déanta ag an gComhchoiste ins an tuarascáil seo ach ní aontaíom le gach rud atá ann.  While I welcome the report I cannot say that I agree with all of its contents.  As somebody who wholeheartedly supports all the efforts made to protect our wildlife, be it bird or animal, I regard it as part and parcel of this planet and it definitely enhances our environment. I fully support the efforts of conservationists and of anybody connected with conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here in this House Éamon de Buitléar.  He is perhaps the one man in Ireland who has done most over the years, not alone as a conservationist but through his television programmes, to teach us to care for and respect the environment and to protect our wildlife.  Not alone has he taught us but far more important he has given our children a new and special awareness that in today's world much of what we have could be destroyed by just not caring.  We are very deeply grateful to him for all he has done <Col N="2055" /> and hope he will continue with this great work.</P>
    <P>Each day, month or season brings new hazards to our wildlife.  One day everything is rosy and the next day we could have an oil spillage, completely by accident. No matter how small this could do untold damage to the sea birds.  We are lucky so far that we had no major oil spillage as such.  Perhaps those we did have were bad enough but basically we did not really have what one would call a disastrous oil spillage even though the effects of the oil spillages we had, small as they were, practically wiped out the sea bird population in the areas in which they occurred.  Again, we have to be thankful to all those people who took time off when there was an oil spillage to saving the remaining birds, washing the oil off their feathers and releasing them when the mess was cleared up.</P>
    <P>The burning of gorse or furze at particular times is a hazard that can be avoided.  I believe there is a law, not really to prevent it but to prosecute offenders.  From now on it is a common sight to see hundreds of acres of mountain completely black and burned.  The strange thing about this is that it always happens at the wrong time of the year.  It happens when the birds are nesting or hatching.  We are not stringent enough in that area in prosecuting possibly the man who owns the land because the culprit, whoever he may be, just lights a match and disappears.  Perhaps we could do something by following up the owner of the land and prosecuting.  We have taken great steps over the last couple of years particularly in relation to the pollution of rivers.  This year, more than any other, people have been summonsed and fined for pollution of rivers.  The same procedure should be carried out with regard to the burning of gorse.  The farmer will give a reason for the burning of gorse at a particular time of the year &mdash; probably old grass which has overgrown.  I would not be against the idea of burning gorse provided it was done at a time of year when it did not endanger the wildlife.</P>
    <P>Over the years and especially in the <Col N="2056" /> last 15 or 20 years the EC seems to be directing us to do things.  The EC is giving directions and issuing orders to us that we should bring in this regulation and that regulation.  Yet they themselves have nothing left in their own countries, either in wildlife or fishing.  They have not only destroyed their own stocks of fishing but they have destroyed ours also.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan said, where land drainage is to be carried out we know that if big tracts of land were drained they would provide our farmers with more land.  The problem is that some of these places are protected because of the wildlife there.  This directive normally comes from the EC and I remember that about 15,000 acres of land in Kerry was to be reclaimed in respect of which there was an objection from the EC because of the wildlife and so on.  At the time I said: &ldquo;Fair enough, if they do not want this land to be drained and if they want it as a haven for wildlife I will go along with that, but our farmers should be compensated by the EC.  If the land is theirs and if by draining it, it can be good, arable land and if some directive comes that you cannot drain that land and cannot reclaim it, then compensation should be paid.  If the EC wants certain areas of our country as a haven for wildlife, then we should look for and get compensation from the EC.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I was one of those who want our wildlife to survive.  I praised the interest and work by all the conservationists as regards our wildlife. At the same time, when you look at some of the species of birds that are mentioned in this document as species we want to protect, unless I am mistaken we find there was a bounty on one of those species a couple of years ago, and that was the grey crow.  You actually got paid for shooting grey crows.  Now we try to make this bird a protected species.  We have to think of the sheep farmers.  There is another one we call the Caobach which is the greater black gull.  Both the Caobach and the grey crow do an amount of damage to lambs especially because they pick the eyes out of their heads.  As a matter of fact, I have seen &mdash; I know that <Col N="2057" /> rabbits are looked upon as vermin &mdash; the caobach picking up a live rabbit in one swoop, going up about 20 yards into the sky, dropping the rabbit down on a rock, coming back down and repeating the process until the rabbit is dead.  He then has his dinner.</P>
    <P>In my side of the country definitely the caobach and the grey crow are enemies of the farmers because of the damage they are doing to the lamb population.  I am not talking about wiping them out, but the law should allow a farmer to protect his property.  Again, as much as we like the pigeons &mdash; perhaps they are a symbol of love and all the rest of it &mdash; but as somebody said yesterday they can cause a great deal of damage.  There are a few things in this that I do not go along with &mdash; greater black gull, the grey crow and the pigeons.  There should be some loosening up there so that a farmer could be allowed to shoot these.</P>
    <P>People from Wexford are more interested in the gamebirds.  They are not worried about the farmer and his lambs or the farmer and his boats or anything else.  They are worried about what they can shoot and I think this is narrowminded. I was amazed about five years ago when a group of French people came into a particular hotel in our town and they had been out shooting all day. They lined up their bag of birds that evening for the cameras and there were more thrushes and blackbirds in their bag than anything else.  I completely and absolutely condemn this.  I do not know who is the cause of it.  Surely most areas have game clubs and the game clubs that I know, in fairness to them, are people that have done an amount of good work over the years.  We have to call a halt.  It is great to welcome the tourists in but they have to respect our laws.  They should be well monitored because they just go out and shoot anything that flies.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think should have been mentioned in the report is very relevant in my side of the country and that is the issuing of strychnine licences. I know for a fact that in a small area of west Kerry, taking in the two peninsulas &mdash; the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas &mdash;<Col N="2058" /> in excess of 200 licences are issued yearly for strychnine.  There should be a great tightening up of the laws on the issue of these licences because the number being issued in a 30 mile radius of Dingle is excessive.  Not alone is it a large amount of strychnine but it involves actual danger to human beings as well as wildlife.  I would nearly go as far as saying that the sale of it should be banned.  If there is vermin that must be eradicated, there must be a milder type of poison available. In the case of vermin like rats you can get a poison now that the hens can eat and it will not do them any harm but it will kill the rats.  Is there something that the farmers could get, other than strychnine, to kill the vermin that they are trying to kill and enable us to do away with strychnine completely?  When you have up to 200 licences for the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas, the matter has gone too far altogether.</P>
    <P>I have said nearly all I wanted to say but to go back to the caobach, the grey crow and the pigeons, the farmers should be allowed to pick them off now and then when they are doing damage to their crops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This report took a long time to come before us.  I read it with great interest a couple of years ago and I read it again this week, and was every bit as interested, and I was somewhat surprised at some of it.  I want to agree to some extent with Senator Tom Fitzgerald in his case for the control of the grey crow.  In my part of the world both the fox and the grey crow have increased enormously over the last three, four or five years and are giving a considerable amount of annoyance and indeed affecting farmers' incomes.  One can protect oneself from the damage the fox does and to some extent, again in my part of the country, the sheep farmers can protect themselves from damage by the grey crow.  The reason for that is, of course, they now control the yeaning season for sheep and they have them in around the house at the time of yeaning and they take them in batches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the system now being used by farmers so they have reduced somewhat <Col N="2059" /> the damage being done by the grey crow. That does not follow for all parts of the country.  Indeed, in the Minister's part of the country they may not use the same system for lambing and this grey crow can have a very detrimental affect on the farmer's income and on his business. It may, indeed, be a thing of beauty to many people but I would have to say it is a thing of horror because I was reared on a farm where we had sheep and we detested the grey crow at that time.  Some years ago the grey crow almost disappeared from the scene altogether but now is back again in quite considerable numbers.  It is not causing the same concern in my part of the country but I am sure it is doing the same damage down in Senator Tom Fitzgerald's part of the country.  I would have sympathy for him and the farmers in that area if grey crow numbers are allowed to get out of control.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Fitzgeralds' viewpoint on the burning of gorse, but not to the same extent.  We need to prosecute in all cases, of course, where gorse is deliberately set on fire by vandals who do not take into account the nesting season and other aspects.  Of course there should be prosecutions.  It is a matter of educating farmers.  In my experience most farmers have consideration for the nesting season and when they burn gorse they avoid burning it during that season.  I think farmers, to a large extent, act very responsibly in this regard.  There are, of course, some who perhaps through lack of thought or ignorance may burn gorse during the nesting season.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of farmers are getting into the habit now of burning stubble and I believe this has a very detrimental effect on wildlife.  When the harvest is over the easiest way of clearing the land of weeds etc., is to burn the stubble but in burning stubble you are burning and scorching the soil to a depth where the worms and all other insects will leave it for a considerable period. This, no doubt, is destroying the feeding grounds for our wildlife.  I am not so sure the farmer is even doing his own business <Col N="2060" /> any great amount of good by burning stubble because I think the crops may be affected also.  There should be some educational programme for farmers and some indepth study carried out on this habit of burning the stubble.  Certainly it is affecting our wildlife and indeed it may even be affecting future crops.  The farmer does not know the damage he may be doing to himself.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the increasing use of machinery on our bogs. I am not one to advocate that bogs should be left alone and not utilised because there is a tradition of using our boglands for fuel and for purposes such as peat moss.  It is coming back into fashion to cut turf because of the price of coal. Indeed, it is a tremendous help to our balance of payments to use our bogs, but they should be used properly.  I believe the increasing use of machinery is doing immense damage to the wildlife of this country.  It will not be easy for the Minister to agree with me because I am sure there are many in his constituency who use machinery.  I am a turf cutter; we have always cut by hand.  I think that is the way the bogs should be used.  Some would say they should not be touched.</P>
    <P>I think Senator de Buitleár is one of those who may advocate that the bogs should be left alone.  That is fine but we cannot afford to have a mineral there if we do not use it to reduce our balance of payments.  Indeed there is a tradition that many of us and our grandfathers were reared by a turf fireside.  I do not think we should prevent that from happening but we should ensure that it is done in a way that will not affect the wildlife or the bogs.  Five or six thousand years ago there was scarcely a bog in Ireland.  No matter how low we cut our bogs, if we do not drain them they will continue to grow.  In fact, I have cut turf in recent years on bogs that were cut to the rock in the forties during the Emergency.  The bog has grown again to a depth where it can be cut, not to a significant depth, but it certainly can be cut again even though it would not be the best of turf.</P>
    <P>Bogs grow at a rapid rate if they are not drained but to ensure the best return <Col N="2061" /> and the most efficient use of machinery the bog has to be drained.  This is where the damage is done.  I hope the Minister will look at this area and do what he can to control the use of machinery.  They are using different machines.  Indeed, I have seen machines down in the west which span from here nearly to Merrion Square, or certainly half of that distance across the bog.  To use such a heavy machine the bog has to be pretty solid and the only way you can have a solid bog is to drain it.  This is happening less than 12 miles from where we are standing, in the Dublin Mountains.</P>
    <P>In the past three years machinery has come to the Dublin Mountains.  We have been cutting turf in the Dublin Mountains for a considerable time &mdash; certainly all during my lifetime.  It happens in bursts, for a few years you get a great number of people out doing it and then it slackens off.  I suppose the price and availability of coal, or, as in the forties, the nonavailability of coal and other fuels determines this to a great extent.  In the Dublin Mountains it always was cut by hand except, during the past three or four years some very heavy machinery has come to the Dublin Mountains and they are now draining the bogs.  It is a lovely landscape and most people would not expect to find a bog, right on the tip of a mountain.  I am afraid we are seeing the destruction of the bog in parts and it will probably spread all over if the use of machinery is allowed to continue.  In this generation we could see the end of the bogs on the Dublin mountains and that would be a great pity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take heed of what I have said and will investigate what is happening.  I am sure he will see it himself and will do whatever he can to prevent the occurrence of what I am forecasting.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank the many Senators who have made their contributions on this very important wildlife motion.  I also thank the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities for their recent report and for the many excellent reports they have produced.  I have been very impressed by the very practical and reasonable contributions by the various Senators.  Of course the tone was set by a very detailed contribution by my good friend, Senator Éamon de Buitléar.  We are fortunate to have him as a Member of this House. His contribution to, appreciation of and information on wildlife and conservation throughout our country has been invaluable. No man, single handedly, has made a greater contribution to the role and importance of wildlife and to creating scientific data and educational information on wildlife in this country over the years, than Senator Éamon de Buitléar. My Department are very pleased and appreciate the great work he is doing. We have tried, on a number of occasions, to have some of his films made available. We are working towards that and we hope that we can get the co-operation of another semi-State body involved in that area to ensure that the information he has provided through the great films he has made will be available to the specialists and experts in my Department for future perusal and study.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely also made a very good contribution.  He praised the gun clubs for their conservation attitude.  I, too, would like to publicly praise the attitude of our gun clubs throughout the country. They are very honorable and reasonable people.  They have a great commitment to their sport and to conservation.  We are delighted to be able to co-operate with them in these pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments to the Wildlife Act are necessary in order to protect invertebrates &mdash; worms and other such things &mdash; which Senator Kiely referred to.  We are presently considering those amendments. We were pleased some months ago, as part of the wildlife section's contribution <Col N="2063" /> to the European year of the environment, to publish a book on invertebrates. We believe it is a very important detailed and scientific information and educational booklet, particularly for young people, school children and second and third level students.  It is the first time any attempt was made in the country to put such a booklet together.  We hope it will be used as a very important educational reference book in the years ahead, so that young people, in particular, can appreciate the importance of invertebrates and the role they play in our whole environment.</P>
    <P>In enacting the Wildlife Act, 1976, the pest species were not protected, although the Minister could have included them at any time under regulations, only one has already been included, that is the bullfinch. The European Commission studied this situation and reacted to our position. We are obliged to adhere to various directives it issues.  In certain cases we fight for, and have been fortunate to get, a derogation to ensure a balance between our traditions and wildlife in our country. We are fortunate that we have been reasonably successful in maintaining a balance between the needs of the country and international demands.</P>
    <P>There are four international Conventions to which we subscribe; the Berne Convention, which covers wild birds, mammals, invertebrates, fish and habitats, the Bonn Convention which covers migratory species; the Ramsar Convention which protects wetlands, the habitats of many of our wildlife and the International Whaling Convention.  This country has not been traditionally involved &mdash; I do not think it ever has been except perhaps some years back &mdash; in commercially exploiting whales.  There are whales and dolphins in the seas around our country, particularly on the west coast and a distance from the west coast.  We are party to an International Whaling Convention and we take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wildlife Conservancy are presently about to commence a survey on corncrakes.  With the advent of modern <Col N="2064" /> machinery &mdash; Senator McMahon and other speakers referred to this &mdash; and high mechanisation such as forage harvesters, rotary mowers and other highly mechanised machines working on our farms the corncrake is now almost extinct.  This survey is about to start and the Wildlife Service is participating in it with the Irish Wildlife Conservancy.  Our wildlife rangers will be doing detailed work in this survey.  We are pleased to be involved with the Irish Wildlife Conservancy on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Service is quite a young service.  It has made considerable progress in the protection of our own wildlife, mammals, fish, habitats and other areas.  Since the enactment of the 1976 Act, 46 nature reserves have been established in our country.  Recently we created our own refuge for fauna at Lady's Island in County Wexford.  There are 66 wild fowl sanctuaries where shooting is prohibited.  One of the biggest problems facing the Wildlife Service &mdash; and indeed facing wild life &mdash; is the rapid change in farming patterns, intensive agricultural development, silage making, removal of hedgerows and the use of very high powered fertilisers, all of which affect the traditional habitats of the many species that exist and have existed in our country.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission directed some time ago that all arterial drainage schemes must have an environmental impact assessment prepared to establish the effect on wildlife and on their habitats and on fisheries.  Steps must be taken when any such scheme is being considered at present to protect wildlife and fisheries.  The environmental impact must be measured against the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague, Senator Hussey, made a very good contribution. He spoke about the difficulties being encountered by farmers, in the eradication of TB and about the involvement of badgers in spreading the disease.  I share his views and concur readily with him.  The Wildlife Service would welcome any well founded and judicious research on the precise role of the badger in the spread of bovine TB.  At present <Col N="2065" /> there is no doubt that the badger is a carrier of TB but insufficient information is known about its role in transmitting TB to cattle.  It would be easy to say that all herd breakdowns are due to badgers and to try to eliminate badgers as a result. However, the wildlife experts in my Department are adamant that there is no evidence that badgers cause these total herd breakdowns.  We are prepared to issue licences for the trapping of badgers to the Department of Agriculture and Food, provided the Department carry out a complete research on each badger killed and that this data is published.</P>
    <P>We do not want, <i>ad lib</i>, irregular trapping of badgers taking place and a certain amount of badgers being trapped and used as a yardstick to decide that badgers are totally responsible for the spread of TB.  We want total research.  A whole set should be taken out, not just three badgers from any one set and this could be used as a yardstick to say that all the badgers in the set are carrying TB and are a contributory factor to the spread of bovine TB.  There is no hard information on that that can be sustained.  We want the Department of Agriculture and Food to co-operate with us in ensuring that information can be provided, that the scientific data can be made available and that conclusive evidence can be produced, one way or the other, as to what contribution badgers make to carrying and transmitting bovine TB from one area to another.</P>
    <P>Senator W. Ryan spoke about setting aside agricultural land for wildlife purposes. This indeed has been proposed by the European Communities.  However, funding for this must come through the member states and in our case through the Department of Agriculture and Food under the Agriculture Structures Directive.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the Irish Wildlife Advisory Council.  The Wildlife Service is slightly over a decade old.  They joined my Department just over six months ago. We are delighted to have them under the umbrella of the Office of Public Works which, I think they and we agree, is their rightful home.  Consideration is being <Col N="2066" /> given at this time to the setting up of an Irish wildlife advisory council.  Under the recently enacted ACE regulations, that is Action for Community Environment, funds will be made available by the European Communities to protect bird sites in some areas throughout the Community. We hope Ireland can benefit from that and we are in the process of preparing a number of applications.</P>
    <P>My Department are preparing cases for financial aid from Brussels to recoup investment for moneys we have provided for the establishment of areas such as the Wexford Wild Fowl Reserve, where 50 per cent of the world population of the Greenland white fronted goose spent their winter and for Loughbarra bog which was recently purchased by the wildlife service which is also a goose site, and for other sites also.  If funds were made available to purchase a reasonable sample of the various types of peat lands it would be our objective to purchase 10,000 hectares of wetland, raised bogs and 40,000 hectares of blanket bog.  Our modest programme could cost up to £40 million and for a small country this is a massive contribution to conservation.  Therefore we would be only too delighted to avail of whatever funds are available from Brussels in the future for this type of conservation.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds and others, too, spoke on the need to control farm pest species.  Ireland has provided for the control of these pest species where they cause damage to agriculture, forestry, fisheries, flora and fauna.  The Wildlife Service is in constant contact with the Department of Agriculture, with agricultural and ACOT advisers, in order that they can get their views and objectives across to the farming community.  We have also produced a booklet called <i>Farming and Wildlife</i> for general information and distribution throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The taking of pike by foreigners has also been referred to, and there are now by-laws which have recently been made by the Minister for the Marine and which limit the number and size of pike that can be taken out of our rivers and lakes. Senator Tom Fitzgerald covered a very <Col N="2067" /> wide area and I just want to inform the House that almost 2,000 guillemots were killed by oil pollution following the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster.  However, the loss of these guillemots does not appear to have had a major effect on the overall population of the species in our country and my Department, through the Wildlife Service, have been observing and monitoring this situation.  We would hope that further disastrous pollution difficulties like this can be avoided, but being an island country we always run this serious risk.  Senator Fitzgerald also referred to the burning of gorse.  The law maintains that gorse can only be burned between the 31 August and 15 April, that is, under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  We hope that all reasonable and law abiding citizens adhere to these regulations because between the period 15 April and 31 August wildlife and the whole environmental area is at its most vulnerable, so during that time is disastrous.  Only between the 31 August and 15 April of the following year can any burning take place, and not during the good dry spring and summer months when the whole environment is absolutely vulnerable to absolute annihilation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to tourists who come here to shoot.  We, indeed, are concerned with the conservation of wildlife and we must therefore regulate many matters, including hunting.  We recognise the contribution that visitors and tourists coming to our country to hunt can make to our economy. The Wildlife Service of my Department will co-operate with the Department of Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte in any way legally possible to develop this sector of tourism and to protect the wildlife of our country for our people and for the whole world to enjoy.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about strychnine. The use of poison against wildlife is generally forbidden.  There is general debarment of the use of strychnine for the extinction of wildlife.  However, the Protection of Animals Acts allows landowners to poison their lands.  We agree <Col N="2068" /> that the large scale use of poison particularly strychnine can be very dangerous, not only to wildlife but indeed to us all. I understand that there is more strychnine sold in the Dingle area than in the whole of the rest of Ireland.  I am not too sure what economic reason for that is but that seems to be the statistical information available.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon in a very practical contribution spoke about the agricultural situation in this context and about the exploitation of our boglands.  I would have to concur with what he has said. The rational exploitation of our bogland must go hand in hand with the preservation of a reasonable percentage of our boglands for conservation.  We are in constant consultation with Bord na Móna concerning the use of cutaway bogs, many of which would make excellent wetland sites if properly flooded.  This is something that consideration is being given to at this time and I hope we may be able to get support for from Europe, both financial and otherwise.</P>
    <P>The role of the Wildlife Service is very important.  We have to implement the 1976 Wildlife Act, we have to ensure that Ireland honours its commitment to various international Conventions.  If we are in violation of these Conventions we are in difficulty.  If we were in violation of the 1976 Wildlife Act, the wild service would not be fulfilling its proper role.  We have to co-ordinate our programmes and co-operate with voluntary organisations and conservation organisations in the interests of conservation, and of sport and gamesmanship.  We have to take into account the national regional connotations, and local connotations and the economic demands based on people and we have to try to find a balance between the statutory and the legal roles we must play in adhering to international Conventions and the economic and practical demands &mdash; we would hope reasonable demands &mdash; being made by the voluntary organisations in our country.  I hope that with co-operation, with more enlightened debate, with more statistical, scientific and educational data that we can all play our rightful role in preserving the <Col N="2069" /> wildlife heritage of our country for the present and future generations.  I thank the House for this debate this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be using all that time.  First, I want to put on record my thanks that again the Seanad was first into the breach on this most important and controversial issue &mdash; the whole area of AIDS.  Before saying anything else, I want to make it clear that AIDS is 100 per cent fatal and that there are no survivors of the disease.  This needs to be written into the record and needs to be very clearly understood.  It is important that we should have a look at how the disease develops and also the way in which we might do something about it.  It is of absolute critical importance that at least we get rid of some of the mythology and folklore which have developed around the whole area of AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than anything else, we need to understand what the disease is about. The definition of the word &ldquo;AIDS&rdquo; has been put into the record.  It is a disease of the actual body defences and the body mechanisms.  The virus itself has been isolated from almost every one of the <Col N="2070" /> body fluids I know of except, perhaps, perspiration.  I am not sure that it has been identified in perspiration but it has certainly been seen time and time again in all the others.  It has been isolated from the tears, saliva, urine and breast milk. However, the concentration of the virus in these fluids is considered far too low to facilitate the transmission of the disease from person to person.</P>
    <P>Fluids in which the virus is present in sufficient quantities for transferral are the blood, semen and the secretions from the cervix and the vagina.  The semen, blood and the vaginal fluids are the main areas of risk and this has made any activity that involves contact and exchange of these bodily fluids a risk.  The sharing of utensils such as toilets or towels, kissing and that kind of activity, are not efficient transmissions and, therefore, are not the high risk activities they have been presented to us as being &mdash; quite regularly in the media.  It should be seen clearly from what I have just said that the methods of contraction depend on either a blood to blood contact or a semen to blood contact, or a vaginal secretion to blood contact. Therefore, none of the other activities, where this does not happen, creates a danger in terms of AIDS contraction. It means in effect that it is not, for instance, sexual intercourse that causes the transmission of AIDS.  It is sexual intercourse where semen and blood come in contact with each other at some stage.  In other words, there has to be &mdash; in a sense &mdash; broken or bruised skin where the semen and blood can make contact with each other.  To my mind women are more at risk than men in this area.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that at a meeting we had on this issue some weeks ago, there were more women Oireachtas Members in attendance than male Oireachtas Members. I think it is a growing recognition of the fact that there is more danger to women than to men in the long term.  I know that cannot be completely proven by the available data but it certainly has been proven in the case of male homosexuals that the receptive homosexuals have shown a far greater incidence of <Col N="2071" /> contracting AIDS than the penetrative homosexuals.</P>
    <P>What activities cause problems, what are the various risks and how does the disease develop?  The disease itself &mdash; and this is probably the worst part of it &mdash; can spend seven to ten years developing, with no outward symptoms of which people can be aware.  When the infection takes place through whatever activity &mdash; normally it is sexual activity &mdash; it will not be detected in the body for a period of up to 12 weeks.  At the end of that time, if the person has contacted the virus and become affected the body's immune system will develop antibodies to fight against it.  The detection of these antibodies should always be possible within 12 weeks and, as far as I know, if the disease is not diagnosed within 12 weeks, it will not be diagnosed and there is no history of it coming through after that period.  The question is then asked &ldquo;What are the symptoms after 12 weeks&rdquo;?  When somebody is HIV positive, how do we recognise it?  What are the symptoms? The answer is that there really are not any at that point.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the virus is that it can be dormant in the body for from seven to ten years.  Therefore, it is growing and ready to move on.  After seven to ten years it can then develop in a number of different ways.  It is considered that one-third of these people will develop eventually into AIDS victims.  I have no doubt that figure will change over the years because we do not know enough about this disease.  The first indication of this disease was in 1968 when a child died and the doctor kept some skin scrapings. It has been identified that that child did have AIDS.  It was really into the eighties before anybody was looking seriously at this disease and doing any work on it.  We have not had enough experience in terms of years to give a clear, absolute position on this but a third of these people will develop something further within the seven to ten year period.</P>
    <P>The first way in which this can develop is in what is called the PGL where it attacks the lymph glands of the body and <Col N="2072" /> is characterised by a swelling of the glands, that is, under the arms or the neck.  That is not AIDS but the disease called PGL.</P>
    <P>The other manifestation that we can see is what is referred to as ARC, that is the AIDS-related complex.  At that stage it affects the body through general symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, diarrhoea, temperatures, growths in glands, blood abnormalities.  Thrush for example can affect the body in an abnormal way.  I have mentioned things which of themselves are common enough but the way in which they affect the body is completely different than would normally be the case.  The other way is through full blown AIDS which is the most severe form.  Eighty per cent of those people who get PGL or ARCs develop full blown AIDS.</P>
    <P>It is almost inevitable that the person who is diagnosed as having PGL or ARC will develop full blown AIDS eventually. The most severe form of the infection is AIDS and it is characterised by a general poor functioning of the immune system with an absolute decrease in efficiency. When some antibody enters our physical system, whether it be a disease, a virus or whatever else, our defence system sends out, as it were, soldiers to fight against this disease, cells to go out and fight against the disease that has become part of the body.  That is what normally happends and there is a clash.  If our system is strong enough it finally defeats the disease, the illness or the virus.</P>
    <P>What happens with AIDS is that it affects the immune system and not only does it not send out cells to fight against the infection but it actually keeps reproducing infected cells and makes the disease worse.  It then takes over the whole body.  At that stage the whole defence system of the body is gone and some other disease like pneumonia which the person might contact then becomes a killer almost immediately.  That is why it is called the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; it is a deficiency in the system of defending ourselves against foreign bodies in our own body.</P>
    <P>I think 80 per cent of AIDS victims will <Col N="2073" /> die within two years.  I say &ldquo;I think&rdquo;, because that has been the indication from all the available evidence.  A number of Senators gave us the numbers of deaths in Ireland over the last number of years. The significant thing about the people who died in Ireland is that they had been intravenous drug users, or they had been homosexuals in the main but not all of them.  There have been two babies who contacted full blown AIDS in the womb from their mothers, and there has been one heterosexual non-drug using woman who died recently.  She contracted it from a sexual partner.  That is the start of it as a heterosexual disease in Ireland and that is why we need to be worried about it.</P>
    <P>I want to address two matters: the area of the intravenous drug user and the contact through sexual activity.  In terms of the drugs user, the big problem is this, that the people who know most about AIDS and the intravenous drugs user are people who have been working against the misuse of drugs and abuse of drugs for some time.  They have immediately found themselves in a difficulty because their whole <i>raison d'être</i> has been to get rid of the abuse of drugs and to stop people using them.  That is what they are directed towards.  It is the intravenous injection with dirty needles etc. that causes the disease to spread.  I know that if I could get every one of those drug users either to use a clean needle every time or to dip the needle into bleach or to take methadone or something that is ingested orally rather than injected, AIDS would not spread through the drugs community.  However, putting forward that point of view you may seem to be in support of drugs misuse.</P>
    <P>I think you understand the problems that those people have run into.  Drugs abuse kills but it is not a 100 per cent killer like AIDS.  We now have to make adjustments in our lives.  If people are determined to misuse drugs let us try to get them to do it in such a way that it will not kill them.  Let us try to prevent the intravenous drug user from using dirty needles.  Let us try to persuade them to use clean needles, to dip them in bleach or to use methadone.  I can advance arguments <Col N="2074" /> against all of those three proposals. I do not feel wonderful about proposing them.  I am merely advocating that this would be a way of coping with the problems of intravenous drugs-users.</P>
    <P>In terms of sexual relations &mdash; and we went through this the last day &mdash; it is not the act of sex that causes the problem but blood contacting blood, or semen contacting blood, or vaginal fluids contacting blood; it has to get into the blood stream in one way or another.  This is why the saliva is not a problem and on the question, &ldquo;Would you kiss an AIDS victim?&rdquo;, it must be said that you would have to swallow two and a half pints of saliva before being in danger of contacting AIDS, such is the level of disease to be found in saliva.  Not only would you have to ingest the saliva but you would also have to come in contact with some part of the blood circulation system.  In other words it is not taken in orally.  Oral sex in terms of the ingestion of semen or wet kissing through the ingestion of saliva or whatever are not the high risk activities. The high risk activities are penetrative aggressive sex acts, maybe aggressive is the wrong word, but there has to be broken skin.  There has to be a way in which the semen will come into contact with the blood stream.  The risk begins where semen comes into contact with the blood stream.  I want to make that clear.  I am not proposing a policy of abstention.</P>
    <P>Condoms, if properly used, will prevent the spread of the disease.  In my script I had written that I would propose that we advise the use of condoms.  I am not going to do that because when one does that it becomes the interesting part of what somebody has to say.  I think people should know that the disease cannot penetrate through the latex covering of a condom.  People should recognise that.  What does that mean in terms of young people involved in sexual activities or old people involved in sexual activities? It means that they should know the means by which they can protect themselves and not just protect themselves but the population at large.  We need to address it from that point of view and to <Col N="2075" /> say to people, &ldquo;if you are going to have a multiplicity of sexual partners you certainly will need to be very careful and one of the ways you can be fairly sure of not spreading disease or contacting disease is through the use of condoms&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having said that we came across a case only last week of a woman married to a HIV positive patient &mdash; an exprisoner &mdash; and they have used condoms all the time since he was released.  She has now become pregnant.  I make that statement for two reasons, not to say that condoms do not work because that is not the point I am making.  Obviously it was not used properly or else it was faulty or damaged. The sad part of this story is that that woman refuses to be tested for AIDS, she does not want to know at this stage whether herself and her baby might be HIV positive or whether it might develop into a disease.  The reason I make that point is that I know that both in the heterosexual and homosexual community there are many people who refuse to be tested.</P>
    <P>Therefore we must have a huge general education programme which will allow us to identify those in the community who are carrying the virus.  I do not know how we are going to go about that without changing legislation and without changing attitudes.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about attitudes.  There is a lovely book that I read recently on the subject of AIDS, and having read it I thought it was very useful and was well produced.  I turned to the back of it to see whom I would ring to get extra copies and there I saw the logo of the Health Education Bureau.  I said to myself: Is it not typical of the contradiction and the irony in Irish life that, at a time when the rest of the world is developing the whole area of health education &mdash; over the last number of years the US has spent more money on health education than in any other part of education and in doing so managed to raise awarenesses &mdash; we close down our Health Education Bureau.  I know the Minister will have a lot to say about that because I can see him getting upset immediately.  I will read his <Col N="2076" /> response with interest.  I know all the answers already because we have discussed this before.  We are not discussing cuts.  It is significant that this is the way our thinking has moved.  Instead of hyping up this area we have cut back on it.  It is a blunderbuss approach to cuts when we should have a neat little chisel to work out where cuts should take place.</P>
    <P>We need to educate the population and we need to educate the people in the media.  I listened to a heart-rending interview one morning last week when somebody talked about working in the prison service and having a cupful of AIDS infected blood thrown over him or her and also about somebody else being spat upon.  I have had the same problem with my own membership of the INTO.  Those working in secure units have had the experience of being spat upon by young delinquents from AIDS infected families. I want to make it clear that having blood or spittle thrown over somebody is a horrible experience.  In terms of contacting the disease there are two important facts involved.  First, if blood is thrown over a person it has to come in contact with that person's blood.  The disease is not taken in through the skin.  Secondly, within 12 weeks one should be clearly able to establish whether the person was infected.  I am not saying this in any put-down manner.  I am trying to put this forward so that people will understand what is happening and the way it is developing.</P>
    <P>Another area people talk about is accidental needle pricks or pricks given to nurses in hospitals and so on.  There have been only three of four cases of people who have picked up AIDS through an accidental prick from an infected needle. The data in those cases are too small to make judgment on it.  In general, that is not the difficult area.  Also, drugs, sex education, health education and AIDS education are all bound into one. We need to look at what we are doing. We need to talk to our young people and to our old people.</P>
    <P>I want to say what has not worked and what will not work.  The &ldquo;scare the hell out of them&rdquo; technique will not work. Telling people not to have sex because <Col N="2077" /> they could pick up AIDS and die will not work.  If young people or old people were afraid of risk, they would not be climbing mountains, going to the bottom of the sea, driving cars at night, or whatever. Risk is no put-off to anybody.  Therefore, we must put that aside.  We will not scare people into anything.  Neither is it any good putting AIDS victims into something like a zoo.  The zoo effect does not work either.  It is no use showing people the damage it causes and telling them not to do it.  It does not work.  The old fundamentalist preachers long ago brought around alcoholics with them as a sort of a léirú corpartha for particular lectures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they were apparently doing other things.  The third thing that does not work is the pure information idea, the idea of telling everybody everything about AIDS, drugs or sex and hoping that it will come right on the day or on the night.  We must have a properly structured systematic approach in a proper context of letting people understand what it is that they are about, where the risk areas are and creating a sense of responsibility to themselves, to their families and to the community at large. That does not mean we say to people: &ldquo;Do not do that.&rdquo;  It means saying to people: &ldquo;Think before you do that.  Make sure you understand the consequences of what you are about.  Make sure the choice you make at the end of the day is made with all the information at hand and with a sense of responsibility&rdquo;.  That can only be done through a long process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to deal with some of the safe activities.  The safe activities are hugging, holding, cuddling, body rubbing, dry kissing &mdash; that sounds like a horrible concept but apparently it is safe &mdash; and mutual masturbation.  Wet kissing is probably risky in terms of the transmission of saliva.  People are worried about oral sexual intercourse but it is not a direct way of transmitting the disease. Certainly any kind of oral intercourse is, in the main, much safer than any other <Col N="2078" /> kind of intercourse.  I am not making any proposals here or telling people what they should be doing in their private lives but it is important that we get these things right.  Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom is very risky.  This is where the danger in sexual intercourse lies and people should be aware of that.</P>
    <P>Dr. Freedman in his book entitled <i>AIDS &mdash; The Problem in Ireland</i> said that prevention was the only cure, knowledge was the only vaccine, and it was a matter of making the public aware for them to take the available steps necessary to prevent their own contraction of the disease, be it through abstinence or through the use of condoms.  He also said that surely it was not asking too much of people to be somewhat choosy when it came to finding a person with whom to juxtapose their genitals.  That seems to be a safe way of going about things.</P>
    <P>A number of surveys have been done on what has happened.  I will refer to one study of a full year's observation of 2,500 homosexual men.  After the year 3.8 per cent became infected.  One in every ten of those practising receptive anal intercourse with two or more partners became infected.  Five per cent of the non-receptive but insertive became infected.  I make that point because that is the man woman thing.  Because they are the receptive partner in sexual intercourse women are more at risk.  Our figures do not show at present because they are being distorted by the intravenous drug users and the homosexuals.  If it were to become a widespread heterosexual disease this would certainly be the case.</P>
    <P>It is also important to say for the record that flies or mosquitoes do not pass on the disease.  We are quite certain of that now because Africa &mdash; I would recommend people to read this month's Trocaire magazine where there is a full page on the subject of AIDS in Africa &mdash; has proven it to be a heterosexual disease which is not spread through flies or mosquitoes. If that were the case, the children in Africa would be totally wiped out and that has not happened.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to go on and on and put a lot more on the record.  I have <Col N="2079" /> attempted to define the disease.  I have attempted to talk about the methods of contact.  I have attempted to go through the methods of infection and how the disease develops into full-blown AIDS.  I have attempted to put on to the record that 100 per cent &mdash; every single one &mdash; of full-blown AIDS patients will die.  In the first six weeks of this year we had four AIDS patients.  That means that by the end of this year we will have roughly six or seven times that figure of AIDS patients.  If we have, say, six in these two months we are talking about 36 cases in the year 1988.  That is a doubling of last year's figure.  Up to 3 February there were four cases and it looks as if we are heading for the magic number of 36.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on the record that there are no beds or facilities to deal with those patients in Ireland at the moment.  This is a new disease, a new aspect of health life which has to be dealt with and it is unfair that hospital boards and health boards should be asked to deal with the AIDS problem with the same amount of money as they had up to now.  Special provision must be made.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Minister should do three things: first, make more money available specifically for AIDS, and that should be done on a national basis in areas and not just divided up amongst all the health boards; secondly, initiate a major education campaign through the schools in order that young people would understand the difficulties and, thirdly, that you would also put forward a major education campaign of the community on the whole AIDS matter, on sex, drugs and community responsibility.  This should be done as a matter of urgency because while we speak about it and while we procastinate people die.</P>

      <P>The first news of the AIDS plague must have been deeply disconcerting to the sex educators and so-called family planners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have worked so <Col N="2080" /> hard to tell adolescents, children and adults that no sexual activity of any sort can be morally wrong in itself provided a person, however young, freely wishes to do it and given that no unwanted pregnancy results.  It certainly undermines their second message which is virtually that no kind of freely undertaken sexual activity can have adverse physical or psychological consequences if there is no pregnancy.  AIDS has suddenly appeared as a dreadful consequence of particular sexual practices which the sexual libertarians have been determined to establish as just as valid as any other but humanity is ingenious in turning old or bad news to advantage and AIDS has been harnessed to the very cause it first seemed to threaten.</P>
      <P>The permissive sex educators and the so-called family &mdash; not quite the right word when you come to think about it &mdash; planners have done their best through books, youth clubs, clinics and classrooms to place before our young people all the facts, including many which are morally squalid and morally suspect, about every conceivable kind of sex without one word about what might be called moral input.  They take sex education out of the context of traditional values which, in the ideal at least, have related to marriage, fidelity and loyalty but that seems now to have gone by the board.  The only taboo they accept has been against any behavioural taboos in sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the overriding insistence on contraception and abortion, their sex instruction is free of moral values and invites every young person to do what he or she wants or what they think they want.  Children at a highly emotional and suggestible age are to have laid before them new patterns of behaviour which would not otherwise have occurred to them and which suggest that they are out of touch with their peer groups if they do not indulge in them.  Fortunately, many of our young people have natural resources of character and family background which enable them to resist the propaganda emanating from TV programmes, so-called life skills programmes in schools and the irresponsible <Col N="2081" /> ramblings of some of our more deviant Senators.  Some are less fortunate and more impressionable and they are the victims.</P>
    <P>Initially the evidence that AIDS was spread by specific homosexual practices seemed to threaten the campaign by the libertarians, sex educators and the Leftwingers to establish that all kinds of sexual practices are equally valid but once it became clear that it also indirectly threatens homosexuals and people wholly innocent of promiscuity, the disease was quickly seen as providing a new opportunity by a conglomerate of sex educators, libertarians, some vested interests and those who go along unquestioningly and unreflectingly with the fashion of the moment.  Thus, we now have a demand for what is called explicit advice in the schools about AIDS.</P>
    <P>Soon the call will come, as indeed it already has come from some quarters, for explicit advertisements on television about the practices which spread the disease, about how to minimise the risk and, above all, for contraception, the last of which has long been an objective of the so-called family planning lobby.  A recent programme for young people on RTE had the presenter showing how to fit a condom, using crude slang while explaining the process.  The same was evidenced on British channels, particularly on Channel 4, where in a recent programme on AIDS a group of homosexuals explained in four letter words what everyone needs &mdash; that is their word &mdash; to do.  This programme included a Swedish advertisement for condoms which nobody could say was not obscene.</P>
    <P>In a recent issue of the British Medical Journal a Miss K. Wilding of the Family Planning Information Service called for a major information campaign for barrier contraceptives, clear instruction for their use and an attempt to improve the public image of the condom.  I joke not about her words, &ldquo;to improve the image&rdquo;.  She said that there was a case for setting aside the sensitivities of any minority.  In Britain also they had a Mr. David Sharpe, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, advocating free <Col N="2082" /> condoms with the reassurance that this will not promote promiscuity but will prevent the spread of a plague of biblical proportions.</P>
    <P>The idea that the plague will be so prevented must be fantasy.  The danger is rather of encouraging false security. Some of the people now deliberately using AIDS in their campaign for destroying any lingering moral standards for teaching children about sex, are those whose teaching encourage it.  Books are available aimed at teenagers and younger children which describe many perverse sexual practices without any disapproval whatsoever.  Is there to be no campaign? No, there must be a campaign.  Adults and children alike must be informed of the facts but these facts must not ignore morality.</P>
    <P>There are some schools in our community where parents, and indeed teachers, and other classes are being prohibited from knowing what is taught in those schools.  The Congress of Catholic Secondary Schools Parents' Association have said (a) they do not want an explicit campaign and (b) they want to have maximum input into whatever campaign is organised.  After all, it is their children and their organisation represents 53 per cent of the school-going population.</P>
    <P>What are the facts about AIDS?  The facts are clear and many Senators have outlined them.  If has to be said homosexual practices, particularly sodomy, recourse to prostitutes and drug addiction are the basis for the spread of AIDS. That the innocent including the haemophiliacs, spouses of bisexuals and of drug addicts and even the unborn should be at risk is all the more reason to point the finger where the problem lies.  The campaign should be aimed primarily at those at risk.  The whole population is not at risk.  Drug addicts and promiscuous people are at risk.  Sodomites are certainly at risk.  Church leaders are correct in saying that if people are serious in attempting to fight AIDS, a more responsible attitude to sexual morals should be a priority.  It is surely time that society ceased to give free rein to those trendy <Col N="2083" /> proponents of permissiveness, promiscuity and so-called safe sex.</P>
    <P>Whenever we meet a person with AIDS the overriding word must be compassion because if a person is afficted with AIDS, whether it is through irresponsible behaviour or just some curse of fate, that person remains a person who has rights, a bearer of those rights, and as such makes claims on every other person. We must never forget that.  We must look at people with compassion.</P>
    <P>My main reason for talking here today is that I want to see the campaign, particularly for school leavers, contain the facts explicitly stated but there must also be contained in that campaign the moral message that sexual permissiveness only leads to trouble and we must at some stage curb the behaviour that is going on at the moment.  People say that that cannot be done.  It can be done.  It was done in various other ages before, it can be done again.  There is no doubt that this disease would not have had the same frightening effect upon the general population if people's moral standards had not dropped quite so much.  The campaign I would like to see would contain the facts explicitly stated but also one particularly for school children, in which the parents would have a large input into whatever was to be promulgated in the schools.</P>

You can think what you like about it.

I understood him to be describing methods of sexual activity which were risky in the context of the debate we are having on AIDS and methods of sex which were less risky.  I did not in any way hear him advocating any particular form of sexual activity.  Indeed, it is my understanding that he made it absolutely clear that he was speaking in a totally objective fashion.  What Senator Lydon's standards are may be proper for Senator Lydon but I do not think he can use them as a yardstick against which to measure the character of Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions made by the Senators and I would like to reiterate the remarks made earlier by my colleague, the Minister for Health, and congratulate Senators for their initiative in organising the debate.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks for the contributions made by Senators Fennell, Bulbulia, Norris, O'Connell, O'Toole, Lanigan, Ferris, Farrell, Fitzsimons, Lydon, Murphy and Doyle who have contributed to this very worth-while debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before replying to the various points raised during the course of the debate I would like to make the point once again that we are very conscious of the current <Col N="2085" /> and the growing problem which AIDS is presenting.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier in the debate we have had 36 cases of full blown AIDS to date, 22 of which have occurred since January 1987.  There are nearly 700 persons known to be carrying the HIV infection at present and those statistics represent a very worrying picture.  It has been suggested that there is no planning being done by Government.  I reject this.</P>
    <P>The Government established the central strategy committee over a year ago to monitor the spread of the AIDS infection, to review all possible measures for controlling it and to recommend new AIDS strategies to the Government.  It will continue to do this work, taking account of the information available to it from the World Health Organisation, Council of Europe and all international sources as well as the views of our own national experts and the views of this House today.</P>
    <P>Some Senators were critical of the approach adopted in the public information programmes.  I do not accept that criticism that the programme was vague and evasive.  The information is medically and technically accurate.  This is a critically important statement as far as the Government are concerned, relevant to the criticisms voiced by some Senators. We have not been coy, evasive or vague. In the AIDS information booklet, for example, the issues of safer sex and condom use are addressed in an unbiased, unemotive and factual way. This booklet was distributed to members of the public and it could not be said that the references, for instance, on pages 8 and 9, are coy, evasive or vague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us the references on pages 8 and 9, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>On page 8, in relation to safer sex, we state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you have reason to believe that your sexual partner could have been infected with the virus, strong condoms with a water-based lubricant offer you <Col N="2086" /> increased protection.</P>
    <P>Oral and anal sex increase the risk of spreading the AIDS risk virus.  Anal sex is a high risk activity.</P>
    <P>Sex with an infected partner during menstruation is risky as either partner could pass on the AIDS virus more easily at this time.</P>
    <P>Any sexual act which damages the penis, vagina, mouth or anus is dangerous.</P>
    <P>On page 9 a further reference is made to condoms which is:</P>
    <P>For sexually active people who are not in &ldquo;one faithful partner&rdquo; relationships, a strong condom, correctly used, is the single most effective defence against AIDS.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking from some of the contributions that Senators have not grasped the objectives of the public information programme and the manner in which it was structured.  It contained three key elements.  These were:</P>
    <P>TV, radio and newspapers including the students 1988 diary of which 10,000 copies have been circulated; a poster campaign designed to increase the level of awareness among the public about AIDS and to make it clear to the public that it is not a disease confined to at-risk groups but is a disease associated with risky behaviour which makes everyone who is involved in the identified risky behaviours vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The AIDS information booklet from which I have just quoted passages relating to safer sex and the use of condoms was also made available &mdash; and continues to be available &mdash; for those who require detailed explicit information all of which could not be dealt with effectively and comprehensively through mass media advertising.  It addresses a wide range of issues including the risk of spread by equipment used by doctors, dentists, people giving tattoos, ear piercers and others using sharp instruments.  It is obvious that a booklet cannot cover every possible angle and certainly cannot calm <Col N="2087" /> the unrealistic fears and anxieties which are so often associated with AIDS.  For that reason the booklet contains a comprehensive list of places where additional information and help can be got.  In addition a telephone advice service has also been provided throughout the campaign and will continue to be provided as long as there is a demand.  The telephone is manned by doctors.  The evaluation of the programme which was conducted in October 1987 found that the emphasis was broadly acceptable.</P>
    <P>The results of that evaluation also show that the programme was effective.  In addition, the numbers who availed of the telephone service and who presented for the AIDS test also showed that the programme had increased awareness among the public about AIDS.</P>
    <P>In this respect it was interesting to hear Dr. Fiona Mulcahy, who was not exactly a supporter of our public information campaign, state on the RTE programme &ldquo;Cries for Help&rdquo; last night that changes in sexual behaviour were almost impossible to achieve.  I would venture to suggest that the fundamental objective of our programme to increase public awareness about AIDS was achieved.  I should also state at this point that we are expanding the STD services which provide the means of one to one contact with the groups most at risk from sexual contact.</P>
    <P>I will also be referring at a later stage to the information and education programme geared towards secondary school pupils.  It was interesting also to hear Fr. Paul Lavelle, who is contributing greatly to the work of this campaign and who, apparently, briefed Senators last week about AIDS, state on that programme also that the policy which we are following relevant to IV drug abusers is the correct strategy.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris and O'Toole made a number of interesting points, some of which were not entirely accurate.  They suggested that there was a lack of resources for the treatment of AIDS patients.  I reject this.  All of the resources, both human and financial, are available for the treatment of persons <Col N="2088" /> suffering from AIDS.  While dealing with the question of treatment I would like to emphasise that from a medical point of view there is no need whatever to treat patients in special hospitals or isolated units.  People in this very tragic, difficult situation have enough problems without isolating them in this way.  Neither would it be desirable socially, serving only to highlight the suffering of the patient and, arguably, leading to unnecessary and undesirable discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on numerous occasions repeated his policy that every major hospital must play its part in treating and caring for AIDS sufferers. The Department are continually monitoring the situation and at this stage, are satisfied that adequate resources are available for the treatment of AIDS patients.  If the Senator is aware of any cases where treatment was denied I will gladly have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>He also criticised the fact that the Minister in the course of his speech did not deal at length with the treatment question. While I fully appreciate the Senator's concern, he himself will have to accept that the motion before the House relates specifically to public information and education.  Hence, the Minister's contribution was confined largely to these areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also implied that the Department of Health are dealing unfairly with the gay community.  Again, I reject this.  The Department have always acknowledged that organisations such as Gay Health Action and Cairde have made, and continue to make, an enormous contribution in informing and educating about AIDS.  The Senator may not be aware that the Department have had regular contact with Gay Health Action and other frontline groups.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, in devising national programmes that we do not sectionalise our approach unnecessarily which might serve only to discriminate against particular groups.  The Government have to be pragmatic, however, and use the resources available to deal with the problem as it is presenting itself and indeed as far as is practicable to be ahead <Col N="2089" /> of the situation.  The strategy is being devised accordingly.  The public information programme so far has been aimed at the general public be they heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.  I am particularly pleased that the House has debated the particular problem associated with the rapid spread of HIV infection amongst IV drug abusers.  The 13 cases of full blown AIDS among this group have occurred since September 1986.  Sixty per cent of those tested positive of HIV infection are intravenous drug abusers and this group represents &ldquo;The Bridge&rdquo; which will transmit the infection to the community at large.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, and as each Senator who has contributed has said, a special approach has to be adopted in dealing with this group.  Senator Ferris hit it on the head &mdash; these people do not relate to Ministers or to bureaucrats.  It is essential that we get to IV drug abusers on an individual, one-to-one basis and we are, in fact, addressing this problem.  A pilot outreach programme is about to get underway in the Eastern Health Board area which includes the major Dublin area of course.  In general it will involve a street approach to IV drug abusers by outreach workers to educate abusers about AIDS and to encourage them to come for treatment.  A total of £450,000 has been allocated from the national lottery to fund the project and other activities relating to AIDS.  I believe this is a major contribution by the Government on behalf of the public who have contributed to the national lottery to use £450,000 in this manner in this very worth-while outreach programme.  The pilot project will include a methadone maintenance element.  While AIDS represents the major public health problem at present and for the foreseeable future, we cannot lose sight of the overall problem of drug abuse.  For this reason, we are considering the pros and cons of needle and &ldquo;works&rdquo; exchange.</P>
    <P>I believe that the contributions made in this House by the Senators will influence a change of attitudes possibly in this particular area.  There is conflicting data emerging from abroad on needle <Col N="2090" /> exchange and the central strategy committee on AIDS and the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse &mdash; of which I am chairman &mdash; are keeping this data under review with a view to considering whether a needle and &ldquo;works&rdquo; exchange element should be integrated into the pilot outreach programme. This is an area to which we are giving very careful consideration.  A reason for not recommending to the Government would be on the basis that we are not satisfied at this stage from our research abroad particularly that it is effective.  If we were satisfied that this would be of major benefit in preventing the spread of AIDS, certainly the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse would certainly have no hesitation in recommending such action if required to the Government.  As a first option, however, a methadone maintenance element is being included and it is important that this is given particular attention during the project.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Government's fight against drug abuse will continue unabated.  The Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse is continuing with its work and I am currently in touch with the Attorney General about a Bill designed to seize the assets of drug-traffickers. The plight of prisoners affected by HIV infection has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has laid down a strategy for the treatment of HIV infected prisoners and this is forming the basis for a cohesive programme in this area, being developed by the Departments of Health and Justice.</P>
    <P>At present, HIV positive prisoners are catered for in a number of ways &mdash; medically by the Department of Justice's prisons medical services and by the health services and also by the voluntary agencies &mdash; in particular the Ana Liffey project &mdash; who counsel prisoners, both inside the prison and after their release into the community.  I would like to compliment them on the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Senators Fennell and Bulbulia mentioned the condoms issue specifically.  I would have thought that references to the family planning legislation and the <Col N="2091" /> relevance of condoms in the whole AIDS context should be firmly behind us and that we should now be concentrating on future initiatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, however, that condoms are now widely available from a number of different sources.  As I said earlier, the information given in the booklet is accurate and to the point about condoms and safe sex practices.  Senator O'Toole highlighted the dilemma facing policy makers and advisers in the drug abuse and AIDS area in Ireland at central level.  These are the same people who, while their ideal ultimate objective is to curb and eliminate drug abuse, recognise that there is an immediate problem to be addressed in relation to AIDS.  As I have said, the pilot outreach programme for IV drug abusers will include a methadone maintenance element.  We are keeping needles and &ldquo;work&rdquo; exchange under review as I have already stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the bleaching of needles as mentioned by Senator O'Toole, while good on paper, has not been shown to be completely successful. The bleach can mask the infected blood on the tip of the needle and this will indeed lull the addict into a false sense of security.  The difficulty with the intravenous drug abuser is the whole cult of exchanging needles.  Even if you provide an exchange programme you cannot be assured or guaranteed that they will not exchange the so-called clean needles and then again continue the spread of the AIDS virus.  It is, at this stage, a vitally important part of our policy to reach out to those people.  They are as a whole not <Col N="2092" /> a responsible group because by abusing drugs they are at a very high risk level as it is even aside from the question of AIDS.  We will continue our fight against the drug pushers.  We are not going to pull back from that situation but we are conscious of the problem in relation to the exchange of needles and we are giving this priority consideration.  We are looking at other countries in which this policy has been adopted to see how effective this policy is.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the abolition of the Health Education Bureau.  The clear implication was that the very valuable activities carried out by the former bureau were also abolished. This is not so.  The new health promotion unit of the Department will take on board and continue to develop all those activities.  I do not need to dwell on the particular issue but I want to put on the record of this House and to emphasise that health education will continue to be developed by the Department of Health. I am satisfied that under the new arrangement health education will have a greater profile than ever before.  I am accompanied here today in this House by the officials of my Department who are now responsible for health education and health education promotion.  There is now total cohesion between health education and my Department.  This is a very worth-while development and it is something about which I have no apologies to make to any Senators or to this House.  I am satisfied with the work of the new health promotion unit within the Department.</P>
    <P>On the structure of the Government's strategy, this is directly in line with the recommendations of socially respected international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe.  We initiated a provision of information to the public in a general way and, with this, individuals can identify their own particular situation.</P>
    <P>We are not naïve enough, however, to <Col N="2093" /> consider that this is sufficient.  We recognise that it is essential to focus on particular groups within the population and, as I have said, we are concentrating on one to one contact with IV drug abusers and secondary school pupils as our next priority.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that the Government's public information programme is not simply a mass media strategy.  The mass media have an important role to play but to achieve substantial changes in human behaviour, one to one contact is fundamental.  I have spoken at length about our approach to IV drug abusers. As regards school pupils, the pupil/teacher relationship is perhaps the most fundamental way in which we instil the values of our society into our children and prepare them for the challenges ahead.  It is in this context that we can effectively provide information on AIDS to a very important group.  The Minister for Health and the Minister for Education have agreed that we should concentrate upon the educational system this year.</P>
    <P>A further meeting has taken place with the Minister for Education to discuss plans for providing such a longterm AIDS programme in secondary schools.  While that programme is being prepared and to ensure that children leaving school this year have the facts about AIDS, the directors of community care-medical officers of health have been asked to cooperate with local school managements in providing AIDS education to ensure that no child should leave school without being aware of the facts of AIDS.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough the importance which we attach to the provision of information about AIDS to secondary school pupils and this area is a major priority focus.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the prohibition on the advertising of services for sexually transmissible diseases under the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1899, and as amended by the Censhorship of Publications Act, 1929.  The Venereal Diseases Act, 1917, however, permits health agencies to advertise without restriction services for sexually transmissible diseases <Col N="2094" /> and the Department have received legal advice which has confirmed that the 1917 Act may be applied without reference to the other Acts mentioned.  This was communicated to each health board in 1985.</P>
    <P>In conclusion the Government's strategy is to do everything possible to slow down the spread of the AIDS virus.  We are in no doubt about the difficulty of the task facing us, especially when dealing with a difficult group like IV drug abusers where it will take time and effort to achieve anything.  However, our strategy compares well internationally and is likely to be as effective as any other country's strategy.  We will continue to pursue it vigorously.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that there is so much research going on at the moment nationally, even in my own constituency with the Elan Corporation and other organisations, that we can only hope there will be a major breakthrough in relation to the fight against this most serious and killing disease.  I am confident that with world wide concentration, with the most specialised and qualified people who are now considering the AIDS virus and the AIDS problem, a breakthrough will come and, indeed, must come for the sake of mankind.  AIDS is a plague that is racing throughout the world and we are very conscious of that.  We have a responsibility in our country to restrict and limit its incidence and to ensure, if possible, that nobody gets this disease. Unfortunately, it is a difficult fight.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment this House on its initiative in raising this issue over a two day debate which I believe has been very useful.  I believe that through the media relaying the debate in this House nationally we are making people more conscious and more aware of AIDS.  I believe this House deserves our congratulations. Everything said here is being noted very carefully by my Department and, where possible, where ideas have been put forward and can be used they will be acted upon.</P>

The continuance of an information campaign is vital.  I do not think it is something that you can stop off and not have again.  I ask the Minister of State to reassure me that children in primary schools will not leave school without knowing the facts of AIDS.  He referred mostly to secondary school students.

      <P>Just a one sentence question.  The Minister in his concluding remarks spoke about no child leaving secondary school without knowledge of the facts of AIDS.  Could he perhaps indicate to us whether or not life skills programmes will be introduced in primary and secondary schools so that no Irish children educated in our Irish education system will leave school without a knowledge of the facts of life in addition to knowledge about the facts of AIDS?</P>

      <P>Dealing with Senator Fennell's point first, the campaign ongoing and the advertising and the posters and this sort of approach have been earmarked for the high risk areas.  The telephone service for advice on medical contact is available all the time and will continue to be made available.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Fennell's and Senator Bulbulia's comments on the educational area, as I have already stated, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon and the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, are in contact at ministerial level in relation to a programme for secondary schools, as I mentioned specifically.  The primary schools area is a difficult one and I am not in a position at this stage to say what type of campaign will be provided.  The point the Senators are making will be conveyed to the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, for consideration.  I am aware of the Senators' concern in relation to young people who drop out after primary school.  I appreciate their comments.  These are not the highest numbers but there are numbers and they are in high risk areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area that should certainly be considered.  I emphasise that the highest level of drop-outs at primary level would probably be in the areas of high risk.  The difficulty, of course, in an educational programme of any type, as parents are aware, is the age of the children involved. Television is playing a very important role in this whole area.  There was a programme last night &ldquo;Recent Plays, Recent Films&rdquo;.  They helped the advisory section of the Department who are considering <Col N="2097" /> ways of making television producers and writers conscious of this whole area and bringing it in subtly into programmes where possible to make people very much aware of the dangers of AIDS.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the adjournment I have notice from Senator Phil Hogan that he intends to raise the following matter; the need for the Minister for Education to examine the serious consequences that a proposed change in the pupil-teacher ratio will have on the pupils and staff of Tullow Community School, County Carlow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Minister for Education to the House once more.  She is a very regular attender at this House.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that a tremendous deterioration has been taking place in the quality of education for the past while and that the subject options that are available to students, particularly in the vocational and community schools are decreasing.  This is in spite of the fact that the number of pupils in public sector schools has increased by 75 per cent in the last few years, compared with 11.4 per cent in the traditional secondary schools.  The decision by the Government to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in vocational, secondary and community schools from 19:1 to 20:1 will have tremendous repercussions, particularly for a school the size of Tullow Community School, County Carlow.  One of the first effects it will have is that there will be an immediate loss of three teachers from the present staff of the school.</P>
      <P>The school has suffered a tremendous loss of teachers since 1979.  In 1979, the number of pupils attending Tullow Community School was 730, with 51 teachers. Today there are 832 pupils and 47 teachers. The increase in the pupil-teacher ratio would mean a loss of 3.5 teachers in the school.  This will include a loss of subjects to many pupils.  They stand to lose 22 hours of art, 22 hours of geography and religion, 12 hours of science, two hours of music, two hours of Church of Ireland religion and 22 hours of some other subject.  The school will be placed in a position where it will be unable to accept all who wish to enrol in the first year in that school from September 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department will be aware that this school has been looking for an extension for some considerable time.  The school was originally built for a certain number of pupils.  Now it is unable to accept any extra new entrants to the school because it needs about four new rooms in order adequately to cope with the huge catchment area it has to service in east Carlow.  It will not be in a position to take repeat students in spite of the fact that they have to pay for that particular facility.  The school will not be <Col N="2099" /> able to give subject choices as it was in a position to do up to now.  The preemployment course has to be suspended because of the deterioration of the facilities at the school.  This is something I would feel very strongly about.  At a time of very high unemployment it is most regrettable that there will be no preemployment course or alternative leaving certificate course available to Tullow Community School from 1 September next.</P>
    <P>The loss of remedial teaching hours is another source of great disappointment to me.  The Minister will be aware that one-third of the students in vocational education need remedial help of some description.  This compares with 25 per cent of the pupils in the community schools and 8 per cent in the traditional secondary schools.  These figures are a result of a survey that has been carried out by the various teaching unions involved in that sector and which have found a fair level of agreement with the officials of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that the provisions laid down by the Department of Education for remedial teaching of 15 hours per week have to be implemented by the school, the school authorities and the board of management are finding it extremely difficult for the school, from 1 September, 1988, to carry out its obligations in this regard because they must make teachers available to teach the traditional subjects.  A similar situation has arisen in this school in relation to career guidance counsellors.  The Minister will know that the career guidance counsellors that are available in the secondary and community educational sectors are very few and far between.  At a time of high unemployment and difficulty in placing school leavers in jobs it is most regrettable that there should be any reduction in the level of assistance we could give to young people to stay in Ireland and get a job, rather than having to go abroad.</P>
    <P>I am forcibly making the point that there is a tremendous anxiety on the part of students due to the fact that they will <Col N="2100" /> not know where they stand in relation to their educational requirements from 1 September 1988.  Parents and students alike are now planning for their second level education.  The uncertainty that is generated by the fact that many pupils have to be turned away in a catchment area of the size that Tullow Community School serves is certainly giving no confidence to the staff, the board of management and the parents in the area, who are most anxious that the Minister will reconsider her decision in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio, that she will at least seek to set up a review of the situation in Tullow Community School.  I know that in another House the Minister has been encouraged to do this in relation to the vocational community school sector, as she has done in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the flood of teachers to take up the offer of the voluntary redundancy scheme.  Of its nature, the word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; means that there will be no position available. Teacher unions have certainly sold out in relation to the quality of education they are giving to present generations and will give to future generations of pupils.  The increase in the pupil-teacher ratio and the limitation being put on the subject options made available to the community school pupils in Tullow will certainly mean a tremendous deterioration in the quality of education they have been used to in the Tullow area.</P>
    <P>It is also worth nothing that because of the cuts that have taken place in 1987 the school already has had to suspend pass and honours classes.  They have had to go at senior cycle because of the need to rationalise hours and the need to place teachers in a different time-table structure.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to look at this case very sympathetically, to acknowledge the fact that there is a problem in the staffing arrangements being made available by the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio at Tullow Community School, that there is no choice for the pupils of this area other than to go to Tullow Community School.  It serves a catchment area of about 15 miles, even <Col N="2101" /> into counties other than Carlow.  It would be most regrettable that for the sake of fiscal rectitude resources our education system would be restricted in a ham fisted and ill-planned way; that we would not sympathetically consider individual schools where there is obvious genuine hardship being created.  We can seek to redress that by putting a community school like Tullow into a situation where a vocational community school review committee could be established by the Department.  I hope the Minister can assure the school this evening that she will be in a position to redress the likely outcome of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio by some other means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am glad to come here; indeed it was at Senator Phil Hogan's request that I was last in the Seanad.  I think his commitment and indeed his very good knowledge of the course and the causes of education are well documented in the records of the Seanad.  I have found that his submissions and the debates I have had with him in this House have always been well reasoned and indeed, well researched.</P>
      <P>This evening he has brought up the matter of Tullow Community School in his own area and constituency.  I am glad Senator Hogan has raised the matter. Just to clear up any historical developments in the community and comprehensive schools, I will talk about the developments over the past five years. Senator Hogan's contributions are always reasoned and as would befit an education debate, non-political.  I do not mean my remarks to be political.  I am just putting the matter in an historical context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the commencement of the 1983-1984 school year certain changes were introduced by the previous Administration &mdash; that is why I am putting it like that &mdash; in the staffing arrangements for community and comprehensive schools.  The pupil-teacher ratio was changed by the previous two Ministers from a figure of 18:1 to a band of 18 to 20:1, so what is now proposed is in fact what Deputy Hussey introduced but was <Col N="2102" /> not implemented fully.  Posts of vice-principal, which had been ex-quota in all schools would be ex-quota, she said, only in schools of at least 250 pupils; the enrolment threshold for the reckoning of guidance teachers as ex-quota was raised from 250 to 500.  In the context of the 1987 budget proposals, the previous Administration also decided that posts of vice-principal and guidance teacher would be brought within the quota of all post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>I was lucky in that when we came in we still had that budget to move with and some things were increased and some were not.  I decided that the question of the implementation of that latter measure should be revised and that was the one which would have been devastating in a place like Tullow.  That was, that the guidance teacher and vice-principal would be brought within quota in all schools.  The post of vice-principal since 1983-1984 has been reckoned within quota in the smaller post-primary schools.  I felt that on grounds of economy of scale the extension of the arrangement to the larger post-primary schools, that is, those which have enrolments of at least 250, would be justified.  The post of guidance teachers in the larger schools was, however, a different matter and I do agree with the Senator &mdash; the need for the services of a specialist guidance teacher in the larger post-primary schools is self-evident.</P>
    <P>That was not the plan envisaged by Deputy Cooney as Minister for Education and as submitted to me.  Because of this I decided that no change should be made in the status of the post of guidance teacher.  This post will continue to be reckoned as ex-quota in post-primary schools with enrolments of at least 500. When considering the 1988 provision for the pay of teachers in post primary schools it was necessary, as had Deputy Hussey and Deputy Cooney over those four years and had made changes in the pupil-teacher ratio, to look again at the staffing arrangements for those schools.</P>
    <P>In terms of standards and range of ability of pupils catered for, whatever may have been the case before post-primary <Col N="2103" /> education for all, now the average post-primary school, whether it be secondary, vocational, community or comprehensive caters for a wide range of ability levels.  I do think we all recognise that, that the edges have blurred.  Apart from what might be seen as the feepaying selective schools, most ordinary rural-urban type post-primary schools cater for more or less the same type of pupil.  No change is being made with regard to the ex-quota position of principal, guidance and remedial posts &mdash; no change at all in post-primary schools, and with regard to guidance posts in schools with at least 500 recognised pupils I am making no change.</P>
    <P>The Senator had worries about remedial posts and quite rightly so.  In the year 1985 to 1986 and 1986 to 1987 a total of 95 remedial-guidance posts were allocated to post-primary schools catering for disadvantaged pupils, giving a total of 295, practically 300 such posts, and these posts are not affected at all by any decision which will fall to be made by the PTR.  I want to make that very clear because people are concerned about the remedial needs and the guidance needs but within the context of what I have said here, any changes in PTR will not affect those particular positions.</P>
    <P>In Tullow Community School, the 1988-89 teaching staff allocation to be issued within the next month will be determined by reference to the maximum points of the ratio band introduced by Deputy Hussey of 18 to 20, introduced in 1983.  It was always envisaged that the community and comprehensive schools would move upwards, and, of course, in the years to come we are hoping that comparability between the schools would be established and that the ratio would move down when our resources permit. Of course, we could spend more and always could spend more and more on education.  One could never spend enough on it until one would get to a one-to-one pupil teacher ratio if it could be got at that but we are living in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> I am confident that no insuperable difficulties will arise for the managerial authorities of the Tullow school and the school will continue to have the services of an ex-quota guidance teacher.  Had the decision of the previous Administration remained in place that post would be without quota immediately.  The school will continue to be allocated an ex-quota remedial post so the special needs of the disadvantaged pupils can be catered for.</P>
    <P>I very much take Senator Hogan's point about a review of the measures at post-primary level, in particular the review of the measures at vocational, community and comprehensive school level and again with relation to Tullow. I cannot give the Senator the blanket assurance he was looking for nor can I give him the blanket assurance he sought with reference to Tullow, but I can say that I will ask my inspectorate to investigate the case of Tullow community school, to speak to the principal and to relay back to me the worries and concerns of that principal.  We will be looking at all of the post-primary schools in the context of the upcoming pupil-teacher ratio changes.  I can certainly say &mdash; it is not a trite assurance &mdash; it is quite clear that the concerns of Senator Hogan are very strongly addressed in this House and I will undertake to him to have the inspectorate look at the circumstances of Tullow school and talk to me about it. Then, hopefully I will be able to report back to Senator Hogan at that point.</P>

      <P>Just one question for clarification: is the Minister aware of the loss of subject choice?</P>

      <P>Of course I am aware. I used to be a teacher myself at second level.  I realise what can be done within the constraints of a time-table.  The measures introduced by the two previous Ministers were far more devastating than what I have in mind.</P>
