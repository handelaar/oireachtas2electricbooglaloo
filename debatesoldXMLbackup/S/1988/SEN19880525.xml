      <P>I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The bringing into operation of the Cork Free Port regulations by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Cregan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House for the Order of Business I want to make an announcement &mdash; because I am afraid that the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would not get the notice on time &mdash; that a meeting was fixed for this evening for 5.30 p.m. but because there is a Mass for the late Senator Jack Daly I have brought the meeting forward to 5 p.m. to allow Members to attend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that proposal. It is intended to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today and to break from 5.30 p.m. <Col N="1418" /> to 6.30 p.m., the motion to be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether he could give us perhaps tomorrow, some indication of the legislation the Government propose to complete through this House before the summer recess and specifically whether he can give us some indication on the timetable for the Companies (No. 2) Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the item dealing with Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations is slipping badly on the charts, being now at No. 12.  Could the Leader of the House tell us whether there are any signs that the Taoiseach is relenting in his opposition to having this motion discussed in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any opportunity to discuss the matter of last week's agreement between the Archbishop of Tuam and the Government regarding the impasse on the rod fishing licences because it is a very serious matter in the West of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have raised the matter Senator McCormack, and the Leader of the House will reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like if it was settled before the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McCormack, you have raised the question and we will wait for the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like it to be settled before the weekend so that the visitors will not have to cancel their weekend in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could give us some indication when Item No. 44, which deals with the rights of emigration of Soviet Jews, will be taken.  I would like, in particular, an undertaking that we will reach this item before the business of the House concludes for the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> I would like also to ask when it is intended to take Item No. 3, the report of the committee headed by Signor Cecchini.  I ask this because this morning I attempted to get as much information on it as possible &mdash; it is important that Members of the Seanad should be able to prepare themselves &mdash; and I discovered that there was a 6,000 page document about the matter in the Library of the European Community but nothing available to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas except a press statement, 12 pages long.  This seems to me to be inadequate in terms of preparation.  I would like a comment from the Leader of the House on that matter.</P>
    <P>Finally I seek from the Leader of the House permission to move Item No. 17 formally, that is, a Bill entitled an Act to establish in Ireland a nuclear free zone, and so on, so that this Bill may be printed and a possible date for the introduction agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague, Senator McCormack, regarding the agreement between the Archbishop and the Government over the rod fishing licences.  It is very sad when an agreement is reached between the Archbishop of Tuam and the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Reynolds, there is nothing about it here.  I am trying to clear what we are taking today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to try to raise it on the Order of Business because it has to be raised in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised last week and <Col N="1420" /> the week before the question of the Companies (No. 2) Bill and I raise it again today.  I made certain requests of the Leader of the House at that time.  I asked that it be taken in a responsible and progressive manner, that we take it a section at a time or a number of sections at a time, that we take it over a number of weeks.  I said at that stage that I am totally opposed to any attempt to rush this through in a small number of days and equally I am determined that it will be taken in this session.  I do not want the Leader of the House to stand up in three or four weeks' time and say: &ldquo;You asked for this Bill and now you are saying it is coming too quickly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We agreed to the Minister's request to have it deferred on condition, (1) that we would get the Government amendments as they were put together &mdash; we have not had any so far &mdash; and, (2) that it would be taken in sections.  We have heard nothing about when it will be taken so far.  It is grossly irresponsible and it is disrespectful to this House and to the reputation of this House that it has not been taken.  I said last week that I would force a vote each week on this issue and I intend to do that.  I intend to have a vote every week on this issue and I want to see the Government people walking into the lobbies and recording the fact that they are not prepared to take it each week from now until the summer.  The next time the Leader of that party speaks in another place we can refer to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, as a new Senator I am at a loss to understand the procedure under which matters are raised on the Adjournment of this House.  I know you have total discretion as to the selection of matters on the Adjournment of the Seanad but I understood last week in your office that I was well placed to raise a matter of public importance namely, Kilkenny Design Workshops.  I am at a loss to know why I was not allowed to raise the matter.  Perhaps the Leader of the House had a hand, act or part in that &mdash; I cannot say for sure.  I <Col N="1421" /> would certainly like to have clarification&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply Senator Hogan, withdraw that last remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling you.  I do not discuss what I am going to take or not take with the leader of any party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you do not take the advice of the Leader of the House in relation to this matter.  I have no option but to raise this matter, with you, a Chathaoirligh, reluctantly.  As you know I am a very quiet, diligent person who minds my own business and certainly I would not dream of upsetting the Chair about any matter.  I would like a genuine explanation as to why this matter was not allowed to be raised in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear matters for the new Senator who yet has things to learn, as he said &mdash; he is actually a Senator who learns very fast &mdash; it is interesting that you are so concerned about your Motion on the Adjournment because I did not have it before me today to decide whether or not I would take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You had it before you last week and you had ample opportunity to take it and you refused to do so.  It is within your discretion to do so but motions were plucked out of the air last week and you know that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pluck motions out of the air.  Whatever motions are taken I have the right to take them.  I have been fair to everybody.  You should look at the motions I have scrapped. Since you asked the question it had better be put on the record.  Your contribution has been a bit slanted.  It would be interesting if a count was done of how many motions from another party were thrown in my bin and you were allowed to come in on the Adjournment of this House. <Col N="1422" /> We had better get a balance in the contributions made here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Kilkenny is well represented any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>In commenting on the matter raised by Senator Murphy I should like, in one sense, to support the thrust of his statement and, in another sense, to ask the Leader of the House to consider caution in relation to the matter at this time.  It is essential that there is a debate in this House before the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November.  I would like a re-assurance from the Leader of the House that that debate will be held so that all Senators will have an opportunity to make an input into that debate, in anticipation of the sort of changes which are likely to take place at that time, or that we hope will take place at that time.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I urge caution because at the moment there is a very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland. There are signs that people who were not formerly, for one reason or another, prepared to undertake dialogue across various divides are now at last engaging in that sort of dialogue.  We all hope something constructive will come out of it.  Therefore, I suggest that we should treat this matter with great sensitivity and that we should get an assurance from the Leader of the House that we will have an opportunity for a very wide-ranging debate on Northern Ireland before the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Murphy's call for a debate on Item No. 12 on the Order Paper.  I understand what Senator Robb has said but we made a plea long before this session for a debate on Anglo-Irish relations.  Every single time we have been told that it is a particular sensitive time.  I should like the Leader of the House to tell us whether it is the Taoiseach who is opposing us having a debate on this and whether he thinks there is any point in the Seanad debating relevant matters, matters of urgent, topical, public interest.  It seems <Col N="1423" /> to be absurd and a pity for the relevance of this House if we continually shy away&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, you have made your point and we have not decided to take the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>So sit down then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about something else as well.  It is important for the Seanad that we should have debates on matters of public relevance and immediate relevance and that we do not shy away from them.  I should like to support what Senator O'Toole said about the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  What we need is for the confusion about where it is to be taken away.  We do not know whether we are taking it this week, next week or before the summer recess.  It is a very important Bill.  It has been before the House for over one year now and I see no prospect of it getting out of the House before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have Item No. 33 on the Order Paper.  I beg this House to take this motion.  It is the intention of the Land Commission to divide all the land in the midlands in the coming year.  Many people are refusing to take the land, bought at exorbitant prices.  I ask the House to take Item No. 33 on the Order Paper for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Doherty in his plea to the House. I regard this as a matter of urgency to be taken at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very unfair. There is a major problem in our part of the country in dividing land.  Senator Doherty has put down a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan to reply and conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with the last suggestion in connection with Item No. 33.  I will discuss that matter with my colleagues at an early stage.  A number of Senators referred to the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  The Companies (No. 2) Bill will not be taken this week.  There have already been 132 amendments to this Bill circulated and by the time we get through half of those I am sure there will be a number of other amendments.  It is intended to start on the next section of the Companies (No. 2) Bill next week. The business for today is the Insurance Bill and the remainder of the motion.</P>
      <P>We will start the debate tomorrow on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and we will go on to Mr. Paolo Cecchini's report.  I agree with Senator Norris that it is a disgrace if the Library do not have a full copy of that report.  Any Member of the Oireachtas should not have to rely on newspaper reports to find out exactly what is in that report.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will take up that matter this afternoon because it is disgraceful if the Library do not have that report.  We will have to do something about it.  It will be taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Numerous pieces of legislation will be concluded before the summer recess such as the radio and television Bill, 1987, the forestry Bill and an agriculture Bill.  As to the timing of these Bills all I can say is that this week's Order of Business is the Insurance Bill today with the motion. Tomorrow from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. we will start the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  We will then go into the reports, including the report by Mr. Paolo Cecchini.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business a number of points were raised which were totally irrelevant and which I do not intend to deal with.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement motion will remain on the Order Paper &mdash; I have not decided that it will be taken <Col N="1425" /> off the Order of Business &mdash; until it is debated.  In relation to the request for permission to move Item No. 17 there is no permission to raise that or to have that item published.  I think I have dealt with anything that is of relevance to me or of relevance to the House which was raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 44?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss that matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Companies (No. 2) Bill, clearly from what the Leader of the House has said there is no way in which we will have that Bill in the House next week if we spend the entire week on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I fear we are going to have a major clash on the Companies (No. 2) Bill because time is running out.  It will be rushed in at the end of the session and I feel the Whips should get together as a matter of urgency to see if some satisfactory arrangement can be found to deal with the Companies (No. 2) Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Leader of the House considers the fisheries question irrelevant as he stated.  I do not consider it irrelevant <Col N="1426" /> and it is not irrelevant in the part of the country I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a slight correction.  I did not intend any criticism or imputation against the staff of the Library here.  I wished to purchase or to acquire a copy of the shortened version of the Cecchini report.  It is not available for sale here and it is only printed in England.  I have always found the Library staff to be extremely helpful, courteous and efficient.  I feel I should, in deference to them, place that on the record in case it appears as if I was being unfairly critical of them.</P>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1987: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 9, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1)  No insurer shall have a financial interest in an insurance brokerage.</P>
    <P>(2)  No group of companies shall have an interest in an insurer and at the same time have an interest in an insurance brokerage.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Fallon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the question of insurance companies and brokers being involved and having a vested interest and the Minister gave us a very long reply to it.  It was a very useful exercise because there is concern about that matter in the industry.  The fact that it appeared as an amendment to the Bill and that the Minister gave us a very detailed reply was worthwhile because it cleared the air.  He explained the global changes that are taking place in the financial services and went out of his way to explain them to us.  I am pleased that it appeared as an amendment to the Bill and I am thankful to the Minister for the detailed reply he gave us.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fallon that it is no harm to have this matter discussed.  The Minister failed to grasp the fact that insurers might become involved in insurance brokerages, and in reality they do, which is effectively removing competition from the consumer's point of view since there would be a vested interest on the part of the insurers to ensure that their product would be sold to the consumer through the brokerage <Col N="1429" /> they owned.  There has been a very serious development in the past year or two whereby a group of companies have been buying up brokerages and selling one policy to the consumer.  This is unfair competition.  They have many advantages over the normal insurance broker. The normal wide-ranging policies that can and should be offered to the consumer are not being offered by people who have a vested interest in developing their own product.  While I will not cause any problems about the withdrawal of the amendment, I certainly think the Minister should look very carefully at this development which has taken place on a wide scale over the past year or so.  This is a development which I do not like and I would not like to see laws being enacted which would copperfasten it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether in the light of the amendment which has been put forward, which is not acceptable, he intends to examine the possibility of bringing in an appropriate amendment on this point because the issue causes concern to a number of us.  It is a valid matter of concern.  The Minister's reply was a totally negative one on the issue.  I think there was an awareness of why there was concern.  I would like to know whether, for example, since this Bill was introduced in the Seanad, there may be either as a new section on Report Stage or elsewhere some consideration of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no immediate intention of introducing an amendment to this Bill because I think the issue is broader then just the insurance industry.  It really is the issue of the development of the financial services industry and the ownership of it. I would like to say, in response to Senator Hogan, that we are not in any way removing competition.  In fact, we are trying to increase the amount of competition in the marketplace.  If there are any tied agents in this Bill they will be seen as such.  If a brokerage are committed to a <Col N="1430" /> particular company they will be seen for what they are.</P>
      <P>The way around it is to make sure that the consumers know the type of animal they are dealing with, that they know who owns it and that they have full information on the kind of company they are dealing with.  That is a better road to go.  The complexity of the shareholdings today between banks, insurance companies and brokerages is such that you would need an absolute army to police any type of segregation between those areas.  I am not sure whether these famous Chinese walls that the financial service industry in the UK have adopted can work here.  Certainly there is a need for them in many many areas including this area.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the spirit of this amendment which is to ensure that insurance companies do not buy up brokerages and channel all the business back to themselves.  That is a very understandable position.  If we move in that direction it is totally contrary to the tide and the tide is the levelling of playing fields, a deregulation of the financial services industry and an approach that says you inform the consumer that the people they are dealing with may be tied up with somebody else.  Increasingly that is the way the tide is.  It is a market reality and I doubt very much that legislation will turn that tide back since it is so strong today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with the principle here but I think it is against the tide and does not grasp market reality.  In reality at the moment many such companies have investments in brokerages.  It is important that the consumers should know the status and ownership of the people they are dealing with.  Then they can decide whether they are getting a fair deal.  That applies right across the board in banking, building societies and insurance companies. Anybody who attempts to draw a very crisp line between all those financial institutions in such a way that there is no conflict of interest is setting out on a mammoth task because the complexity of the shareholdings between all those companies are so obvious that we would <Col N="1431" /> be wasting our time trying to do it.  It is better to accept market reality here and deregulate in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept in the development of the financial services market that it is in the best interest of the consumer.  I do not accept that banks and building societies who merge, if insurance companies are being bought up by those conglomerates, are in the best interests of the consumer.  That is the direction in which the financial services sector is heading.  You will have interlinking of various aspects of the financial services sector built into banking, building society activity and insurance business.  If the Minister wants to face up to the situation he will have to accept that, if a consumer goes into a building society or a bank for a loan or an overdraft and the question of insurance arises, 99 per cent of the time the consumer will be forced to be satisfied that the bank manager or the building society manager is offering good advice and the best product that is available and the bona fides of that manager will be accepted by the consumer.  That is unfair competition and that is a development which the Minister is supporting and which I do not agree with. He will have to accept that keeping the business of the banks, building societies and insurance companies separate from each other will be more in the interest of the consumer than ending up with a number of large companies owning all building societies, insurance companies and banks.  There will be no competition and the consumer will be the unfortunate person who will not have the discretion, the wherewithal and the knowlege to decide rationally what is the best policy for him or her.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 27 is an alternative to amendment No. 26 and amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are related.  Amendments Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Government amendment No. 26:</P>
    <P>In page 9, lines 31 to 34, to delete subsection (1), and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever the Minister considers it necessary in order to satisfy himself whether an undertaking is complying, or has the ability to continue to comply, with its obligations under the Insurance Acts, the Minister may direct an investigation of the business of the undertaking or of any aspect of such business.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make legally more precise the scope and the thrust of any ministerial investigations of insurance undertakings under this section.  The proposed amendments would make it clear that any investigations may be directed by the Minister where he considers it necessary in order to satisfy himself that an insurance undertaking is complying with its obligations under the Insurance Acts, principally those in relation to its financial position and its solvency.  The wording in the published Bill was considered to be legally imprecise and could have been interpreted as allowing a Minister to interfere in the normal day-to-day commercial operations of insurance companies which, of course, is not the intention.  Because it is not the intention the proposed amendments will make the position much clearer in this respect and confine the Minister to having a financial basis for directing any such investigations which is sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment, because the Bill as it is written, gives powers of investigation to the Minister into the commercial operation of an insurance company which would be far wider than the investigations the Minister could make of any other financial institution such as a bank.  The only reason a Minister would want any investigation into an insurance company would be if he had a doubt about the solvency of that company.  It is important in the light of developments that have taken place in <Col N="1433" /> this country over the past number of years, particularly with the PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacles, that the Minister should have powers of investigation if he doubts the solvency of some company power to investigate those doubts is the only power the Minister should have in this regard. I will not move my amendment No. 27 in view of the fact that the Minister meets my requirements in amendment No. 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment as being a better and tighter formulation of the power which the Minister is taking.  It is a very important power and a far-reaching one to require an investigation to take place and then as a consequence it means that the Minister can direct that the undertaking should furnish returns and other information.  I have concerns about the manner of the investigation but they are probably better made on the section itself.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, perhaps the Minister would indicate if he is in a position to say how it is likely that the process of coming to the initial consideration that is necessary to start an investigation will take place.  Will there be an interaction with the company at that stage?  Will there be an exchange with the company where the Minister will say: &ldquo;Unless you can satisfy me as to point X or Y I may have to start a formal investigation?&rdquo;  Will the Minister be empowered to satisfy himself, as the amendment now says, that he considers it necessary, in order to satisfy himself whether an undertaking is complying, or has the ability to continue to comply, with its obligations under the Insurance Acts to direct an investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will there be an opportunity for a company to comply with what the Minister wants and therefore forestall the necessity for an investigation?  Will there be a natural justice element before the investigation commences?  Will there be an opportunity for the company to know they are at risk, that there may be a formal investigation under this section with all that is empowered and an opportunity to satisfy the Minister, provide the <Col N="1434" /> information and the evidence that are necessary and, therefore, prevent an investigation taking place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  My view on the original Bill was that this section conferred on the Minister what I thought were extremely wide powers of investigation into the normal commercial operations of an insurance company any time that he considered it necessary in the public interest and in the interest of policyholders.  I felt they exceeded the powers normally granted to other commercial groupings and, for that reason, the amendment is better and it is drafted in such a way as to deal with liabilities and comply with solvency requirements of insurance companies. It is preferable to what is already in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to support this amendment.  The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that companies have adequate reserves to meet claims which have occurred because, in cases like this, it may take several years to settle claims.  I am pleased that the Minister has strengthened this section and that his powers are strengthened.  It is vital that this amendment is written in such a way as to allow the Minister to have effective control over the running of insurance companies.  Any strengthening of this section is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Senator Robinson that what we are doing here is putting into statute what is at present administrative practice.  One of the reasons it is necessary to do that is that in the case of one of the famous administration sagas some years ago there was a feeling that there was not sufficient statutory backing for a lot of the information that was being sought at the time.  In one of those cases the Government of the day had to go so far as to actually threaten revocation without having this initial procedure.  It is much more sensible to put it into legislation so that that kind of lack of co-operation <Col N="1435" /> which emerged in one celebrated case in the past does not happen again.</P>
      <P>We are putting in place what is administratively happening.  There will be and there is initial contact with the company. After that initial contact there is full analysis of the information.  If that information is very complex we may decide to call in consultants to look at it.  The company will have a full opportunity to make their case well in advance of a decision being taken to make that investigation. That is the way it works in practice. With the exception of one major case in the past, we never had any difficulty with that.  I would like to assure the Senator that natural justice would pertain in this whole area as it does at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a clarification but, a Chathaoirligh, you said that we are discussing four amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 28, I would like clarification from the Minister as to why subsection (4) is being dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) allows the Minister to direct an insurer to cease any practices detrimental to the interests of the policyholders which the investigation reveals.  This can have wide application and it is not possible to isolate in advance what such prohibitive practices might be.  It is being dropped now because we are directing the reason for the investigation of solvency requirement and financial requirement as opposed to detrimental practices.  In other words, we have narrowed the Minister's power to intervene only in cases where there is a solvency or financial requirement.  &ldquo;Practices detrimental&rdquo; is probably too wide so we have narrowed the Minister's power to intervene.  The phrase &ldquo;practices detrimental&rdquo; is too wide and could <Col N="1436" /> open up all sorts of areas which the Minister would not intend to be involved in at all.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 not moved.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Minister in seeking these powers of investigation is to establish the solvency or otherwise of a company.  I am concerned about the past experience of insurance companies in this country not co-operating with Ministers or Departments in meeting various financial criteria or giving information to Ministers about their solvency or otherwise.  The Minister has rightfully said he hoped this will not happen again and he has extra powers now which he can use to get information.</P>
      <P>A number of developments are taking place at the moment in the insurance business where there is enormous under-provision in relation to claims in insurance companies.  Media reports, annual reports and outturns from various insurance companies would suggest that there is wholesale under-provision in relation to claims taking place in some insurance companies at the moment.  The Minister launched a very attractive insurance product in the motor area some time ago.  I regret to say that the company involved in underwriting that business had serious under-provision of claims during 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> I wonder if it is wise for the State and the Minister of State to get involved in the promotion of a product that might have under-provision of claims experience that might come to light later on. The Minister is aware that there has been a wholesale advertising campaign launched to reduce motor insurance. Certainly his efforts are to be applauded in this case.  I would like to remind him that motor insurance premiums will not be reduced by companies who seek to give attractive quotations to policyholders by using resources that are needed at the end of the day to provide extra finance to the company to meet the claims experience that might accrue from having extra motor insurance on their books.  If an insurance company overload their portfolio in one aspect of insurance, for example, motor insurance, they are exposing themselves financially in that area to an enormous loss if a larger than anticipated claims experience occurs.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the section.  He will now have powers of investigation into companies where he doubts their solvency.  Will he have the same discretion to investigate a company in which there is a doubtful provision of finance made available in the company in order to meet more than expected claims experience, whether it is motor, public liability or employers liability claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally known within the industry that a particular magazine sounded warning bells in regard to one company.  That magazine was published about two months ago.  I would like to ask a question about the Blue Book.  Returns for the Blue Book seem to come out very late indeed and the Minister's Department have received the 1985 returns only this year.  Is that correct?  It seems to me that if the Minister's Department could have the Blue Book available earlier it would obviously be a big help generally to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Hogan and by Senator Fallon is very important because, while we all want to have cheap insurance &mdash; that is what everybody is after at present &mdash; there should be provision made for claims and any company who are under-providing for claims are a risk to the whole industry.  We all know what happened before when certain companies collapsed. It created serious problems in the insurance world.  This is something at which the Minister should have a very close look.  If a company are providing services that are cheaper and appeal to the clients and to the general public to be better value than another company, something must be wrong.  All companies cannot provide the same kind of service. I am sure that all insurance companies involved in the motor insurance business at present are trying to cut their costs and trying to provide insurance as cheaply as they possibly can.  It is very important that they should have sufficient funds to meet any claims made on them and any company who are not doing that are not acting in the best interests of the insuring public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, regarding Senator Hogan's points, I should say formally that all the companies for which we have responsibility are solvent on the basis of their latest accounts.  I should say that clearly.  In an industry in which rumours and loose talk can actually accelerate any company's potential difficulties, I would greatly caution against any suggestions or innuendoes about any particular company.  For that reason I want to again say that all the companies under my jurisdiction are solvent on the <Col N="1439" /> basis of their latest accounts which have been presented to us.  The 1987 accounts of all companies are being analysed fully by my Department and, if any investigations are necessary as a result, they will be carried out.  We are in touch with the companies on a regular basis.  I suppose you can say that, not only the public and the companies, but the Government also learned their lesson from events of years past.</P>
      <P>There is a tight regime now, whereby we send consultants into companies on a regular basis to get advice on their financial standing in the community.  I can reassure Senator Hogan on that point because it is important that no word should leave this House which would in any way suggest that there are companies who are not meeting their solvency requirements.  They most certainly are.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Blue Book has been published. In regard to the 1987 Blue Book, the accounts are due in by 30 June from all the companies.  I would like to receive them sooner but realistically the year ends in December and, if we have them by the end of June, that is probably reasonable.  Between June and October-November perhaps we can try to get the Blue Book published.  I would like to get it out sooner and we will make every effort and keep all the pressure on the companies to ensure that we get the information in time to publish that book a little bit sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Robinson put her finger on it when she said that so far as the Minister is aware the companies are solvent.  Certainly it would not be my intention to have rumours circulating from this House that there are companies that are not solvent.  I did not intend that and would not intend that.  I would be very concerned about insurance company promotions in which there would be an over-reliance on one sector of the market which might put a company's solvency in danger in the future.  In the insurance business, particular insurance companies get into a sector of the market at a particular time and flood the market by <Col N="1440" /> under-cutting in a particular sector.  They gather a significant proportion of new policyholders into the company and then increase the premiums.  The unfortunate consumers are left with the possibility of having to stay with that company because they are not able to get cover elsewhere, or else to go to the bother of moving their business to another company earlier than they anticipated.  The extra benefits promised a year or two earlier would not have materialised.  At the end of the day the insurance company would have the worst of both worlds.  They would have an enormous pull out of policyholders in that particular year, together with a higher than average claims experience due to an over-reliance on liability insurance or motor insurance.</P>
      <P>Those two scissors movements would certainly put any company into a vulnerable situation and create a doubt about its solvency margin.  I am alerting the Minister to the fact that I do not want to see any insurance company promotions taking place in which a quick buck is made for short term gain at the expense of other insurance companies and which may not be in the medium term interest of the consumer and of the policyholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all with those aspirations.  The insurance industry is no different from any other business.  It has to compete.  I lent my own office to supporting a number of promotions recently which I felt were in the consumers' interests because insurance companies, like other companies, have to compete.  They cannot look to the State overly to protect them. What we can do under EC Regulations and other regulatory items is that, if we see insurance companies getting involved in areas which might affect their solvency, we intervene and tell them so.  We always have had the fullest co-operation from the companies when that is brought to their attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be in the business of saying to insurance companies: &ldquo;You must not be innovative; you must not bring forward new products; you must not go for <Col N="1441" /> market share, because to do that would damage your solvency and anyway under-cutting is not a nice thing to be doing because, if you under-cut, you eventually get yourself into trouble.&rdquo;  The difficulty with that approach is: who decides what is under-cutting?  The other side of under-cutting is featherbedding, where rates are much too high.  At what stage is a company accused of under-cutting and at what stage is it accused of being competitive and of bringing forward a product that the market clearly wants?</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in many businesses when somebody cuts out the middle man, or takes a new approach, or brings in technology, people become unemployed.  In the products to which we are referring, for example, I know people may get motor insurance directly by picking up a telephone, whereas perhaps in the past they may have gone to a broker. Again that is just a marketing innovation. It is a developmental stage.  The other point is that, if I was not doing what I am doing with the industry just now, in the debate today people would be shouting that I was supporting a cartel and allowing insurance companies to fix rates and that they would decide that anybody who broke ranks from the club was under-cutting.</P>
    <P>We are not here to protect the club or to protect the cartel.  We are here to find the fine balance between giving the public a good deal on their insurance and making sure that it is competitive and does not get the companies into difficulties. It would be very foolish of the shareholders of any insurance company to take a short route to gain market share and then go bust afterwards.  That is the dilemma every owner of a business faces. Anyone in business could get business if they halved their prices.  They would end up without a business very shortly.  That is an option open to every business including the banks.  They do not do that because there is a natural point at which the shareholders and the management will shout stop.</P>
    <P>I thought about that and decided to support these promotions on the basis that they are stirring the market and <Col N="1442" /> giving options to the consumer.  The industry will have to deal with that turbulence as best they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a different point on this section dealing with investigations.  As I already mentioned, it is an important power to give the Minister. The Minister has referred to the fact that it puts into statutory form or practice an administrative practice that exists at the moment but, once the Minister has directed an investigation under subsection (1), he has power to require undertakings to furnish him with various types of information under subsection (2).  What concerns me is that under subsection (5) as it is now, although it will presumably become subsection (4) because he has knocked out subsection (4), if an undertaking fails to comply, the Minister can either suspend or revoke the authorisation of the business.  That is a very important power and it is obviously a necessary power to give the investigation teeth.  There is no time limit anywhere in the subsection as to when an undertaking must furnish the documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is in relation to the mechanics.  If we look at the next section where the Minister has power to intervene in cases of doubtful solvency, he may require certain things to be done but it is within a specified period, whereas in this section, although there is an important investigation and a very definite power to revoke or suspend the authorisation of the business to carry on, there is no period specified.  I would have worries that the Minister might find it difficult to exercise that power unless there is a specified period, some formulation that the undertaking should furnish the return, or documentation, or information to him within a specified period.  It could be said that it would be implied, but this is what legal arguments are made of.  If it is not written in and the Minister has the power, which he clearly has under the present subsection (5), to determine that there has been a failure to comply, if there is going to be a failure to comply, with a consequence of either suspension or revocation of the authorisation, the <Col N="1443" /> undertaking should have a very clear statutory understanding of what is to be complied with.  It is complying within a specified time and the Minister, therefore, in the subsection should have power to require that it be complied with within a specified time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no obvious major argument against writing something like that in, if it is felt to be necessary. The reason we did not feel it was necessary was that we acted on a presumption that in law Ministers are not permitted to act unreasonably in regard to the period of time required.  I was also conscious of section 50 in the circumstances where a Minister does revoke a licence and where there is an appeal procedure to the courts that these may be heard <i>in camera</i>.  Any unreasonableness would be thrashed out there in that regard.  I do not feel strongly about it.  If the Senator feels it would tidy it up, we will certainly have no difficulty in putting in some reference to &ldquo;within a specified date&rdquo;.  If she feels it is necessary we will certainly look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely the mechanics. There is no doubt that the power to direct an investigation is an important power.  Directing an undertaking to furnish documents, unless there is a statutory requirement that it be done within a specified time, makes it harder for the Minister to say that there has been a failure.  I am using the term &ldquo;within a specified time&rdquo; because that is what is used in the next section in relation to steps to be taken where the Minister is concerned about the solvency of a company. Equally a company should be aware that it is the failure to make the return within the specified time in the subsection that will be the ground on which the Minister will form the statutory opinion that there has been a failure to comply with the section.  I thought it would be useful to write it in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other difficulty may have been the specified date the <Col N="1444" /> Minister may lay down.  That in itself may cause difficulties because that may not be a reasonable date depending on the complexity of the information sought and so on.  It was probably left open for the right reason and not the wrong reason so, depending on case by case, the time would be very obvious.  For example, you might have to wait for the end of annual accounts, or the end of a consultancy assignment, or whatever.  I can see both arguments.  I am prepared to put in the phrase &ldquo;within a specified date&rdquo; if Senator Robinson feels it is necessary and obviously she does.  I think we will do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I envisage it, the specified date would not tie the Minister in any particular case.  It would be the particular date specified for the particular company in the particular circumstances. As I read subsection (2) at the moment, how does the Minister conclude that there is failure?  The Minister in a letter may say: &ldquo;Send me before the X of October&rdquo; but the subsection does not say that the undertaking must do it before a specified date.  It is not actually built into the subsection and so a company could raise the argument that it was not clear that failure to do it before that date was the failure in question.  It simply clarifies an issue where the Minister is taking real statutory power and, therefore, it is a power that may be resisted and it is in ease of ensuring that the power is properly exercised to write it in.</P>

It is much better to put &ldquo;liabilities in respect of business carried on in the State&rdquo; but, on reflection, I think particularly now that we are moving into this very sophisticated area of financial services, it would be no harm to have some kind of a definition, even a reasonable definition, of what the Minister would envisage to be in this context, &ldquo;liabilities in respect of business carried on in the State&rdquo;.

      <P>Section 16 of the Bill deals with the prior notice and display of policy terms and premium rates and is drafted to cover both established insurers operating in the Irish market at present and also services insurers who will be operating here in the future.  The amendments have been drafted with a view to ensuring that the Minister may require similar information from services insurers as from established insurers in the Irish market while, at the same time, having regard to any provisions of future EC Council Directives which may set down specific regimes or limitations applying in such service industries.  The amendments are, therefore, declaratory in their meaning in that they make clear that the provisions of the section will apply subject to the provisions of any Council Directive.</P>

Has the Minister powers under this section to alter those conditions at any time?  Perhaps the Minister could explain to the House what type of information he would want displayed.

It may depend on principles of Community law, without even a Council Directive, depending on how the Court of Justice is ruling and how the insurance case is interpreted.  It is better not to put &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo; because it might be the Treaty as it impinges on the insurance area, as opposed to a Council Directive. I want to be clear that the Minister is simply making it clear that the only basis on which he will authorise is if it is compatible with Community law and if it is not compatible with community law there will not be authorisation.</P>

      <P>First, I will deal with Senator Hogan's point about what type of details we might require.  We would require details to reassure us that the practices the company were carrying on in regard to rates and so on were reasonable. The State has power to direct companies to increase rates, if it feels they are too low or are in any way dangerous. The State can intervene and direct an increase in rates.  We would seek details of policy terms and conditions, perhaps for specified insurance contracts if necessary, before any such contracts are issued.  Pre-notification of premium rates would probably not apply to contracts where no preset or scheduled rates apply. We would seek information which would reassure us that the practices were reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of life today, certainly in the motor insurance field, is that you get quotations.  Some companies rates for normal mature motorists can be as much as £100 or £150 cheaper.  Some companies will charge double the premium of other companies.  How does the Minister decide which of the premiums is the more appropriate?  Are there staff within the Department who are able to say that a certain premium seems very low and must be investigated and, if need be, they will ask for an increased premium or, <i>vice versa,</i> if the premium is too high can they say that it must be reduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our only powers in this regard are where we deem that the rates are too low.  The Senator asked how do we decide that.  There is no simple <Col N="1449" /> answer to that.  Obviously it is a process. It is a free market.  I referred in my earlier comments to encouraging competitive forces up to the line where they do not in any way interfere with solvency.  That is a very complex, difficult and sensitive area.  We have powers to intervene if we feel that rates are loo low, so low that they will affect solvency.</P>
      <P>I have to try to find a very clear balance between that and interfering with the free market and with competitive forces because, if we start to interfere too much with competitive forces, even in a sensitive industry like this, the consumer loses out at the end of the day and the industry becomes very clubbish and becomes a cartel all over again.  We have to make sure that that is not the road we take.  We have to maintain solvency consistent with consumer service.  That is an everyday challenge when you are dealing with insurance companies.</P>

      <P>I put down this amendment for purely technical reasons.  Subsection (3) is similar to the powers which have already been granted under section 15.  The Minister is trying to investigate a company or the people who are promoting the establishment of a company in this State and to ensure that the people who are establishing this insurer are qualified to carry out the task.  There are similar powers in section 15 as are in section 17 (3).  Under section 17 (3) the Minister is individualising it down to a number of key people within the insurance company. Rather than doing that, I would prefer to see the person referred to as &ldquo;the insurer&rdquo; rather than talking about the director, chief executive, or authorised agent on behalf of the insurer.  It should be wider than that.  The insurer should be subject to the scrutiny of the powers that the Minister will confer on himself for the purpose of establishing an insurer in the State or establishing information about insolvency.</P>

      <P>It is a new section.  It empowers the Minister to seek details from insurers of the experience and qualifications of existing directors and senior management and, in the case of branches of foreign insurers, of their authorised agents in this State.  It is not the intention that these powers should be used in any busybody fashion or that details of the incumbents of all managerial positions down to office managers will be canvassed. The powers will be exercised judically where necessary or desirable in order for the Minister to satisfy himself as to the capacity of those directing the insurers' business.</P>
      <P>That is the overall intention of the section.  The various subsections seek to pin that down.  It is a reasonable requirement. If we are to keep a very close eye on the solvency of insurance companies, it is very important.  These are run by people and it is important that the people who are running them have the necessary qualifications and expertise to do so.

      <P>Section 18 sets down procedures for the revocation of authorisation by the Minister where no business is being done by an insurance undertaking in the State.  The intention behind the provision is to limit the scope for the holding of paper or phantom authorisations by insurers.  However, as the ministerial action will revoke or suspend an authorisation to carry on business in Ireland it has been decided, on reflection, having regard to the principles of natural justice which should apply, to provide that where the Minister proposes to suspend or revoke an authorisation where no business is effectively being done, he shall notify the insurance undertaking concerned in writing of his intention.  The proposed amendment, therefore, seeks to meet this requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is heading in this direction with this amendment which is a good one.  To be fair to insurance companies we would have an early warning system built into this.  It would be unfair on insurance companies to indicate to them very quickly in a hamfisted fashion that you are going to suspend their authorisation or revoke it if they are not writing business in a particular sector of the market, at a particular time, because we all know the difficulties insurance companies are facing in relation to claims experienced over the past couple of years.  Many companies are not quoting for liability risks that would put them in the position of meeting large claims in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned, as an <Col N="1453" /> insurance intermediary, that in a number of high risk businesses like engineering and building contracting it is exceedingly difficult to get an adequate number of insurance companies to quote for that type of business with the result that competition is removed.  Only one or two companies in the country are prepared to quote for that type of business.  Perhaps things will be different when we approach 1992, with the opening up of the internal market and we will have more competition from outside insurance companies. Nevertheless, we have to recognise that a risk insurance companies have here is that there is scope for enormous claims if they do not judiciously watch the balance they achieve in relation to the risks they take on in a particular insurance company.  I am glad the Minister is taking powers to ensure that companies quote for insurances with which we have had a difficulty from the consumer point of view up to now, but the Minister would want to use the big stick approach rather leniently because there are difficulties in some insurance companies which might lead to financial problems for the insurance company if the Minister over-extends that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>This amendment proposes to introduce a subsection which requires the Minister to notify the undertaking of a proposed suspension or revocation where it is to be done under section 18, that is, where it is a revocation of authorisation where no business is being done.  I am speaking on the pure mechanics of it.  This is the third section, in fairly close proximity, where the Minister has power to suspend or revoke, and each of them is different in ways that I cannot quite understand.  Perhaps there are good reasons, but I cannot fully understand the reasons.  Under section 14, in relation to an investigation, the Minister may suspend or revoke its authorisation.  There is no provision &mdash; and maybe there should be &mdash; that the Minister may from time to time vary or revoke a direction given under that section.  That is contained in section 15 which also allows the power to <Col N="1454" /> suspend an authorisation.  That would be in relation to doubtful solvency.</P>
      <P>Section 18 (3) links in to section 15 but not to section 14.  Again this may be for valid reasons, but I cannot understand the reason.  It says: &ldquo;Subsection (1) shall not apply to cessation or reduction of business or revocation or suspension of authorisations required by direction of the Minister under section 15.&rdquo;  I cannot quite understand whether the Minister's amendment providing a protection for undertakings &mdash; because it is saying that the Minister where he proposes to suspend or revoke an authorisation shall notify the undertakings &mdash; means but not including those under section 15, or whether it also includes those under section 15.  Does it include those under section 14?  The point I am trying to make in a complicated way is: is there a standard practice for the Minister when it comes to exercising his powers under sections 14, 15 and 18?  If there is not a standard practice, is there a good reason why there would not be a standard procedure both for the Minister in exercising the power and for undertakings in having the power exercised against them?</P>

      <P>The section and the amendment give wide powers to the Minister to revoke an authorisation where no business is being underwritten. The Minister has used the phrase from time to time &ldquo;in making commercial decisions&rdquo; and so on.  In my experience with the insurance industry, from time to time a company reduces its exposure in certain types or classes of insurance business for what they regard as good normal trading practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago when the NEM were very prominent in underwriting the hackney business in Ireland, they must have had 60 per cent to 75 per cent of the business.  Suddenly they stopped doing this business because it was not profitable. I can recall being told by people who went on a deputation to London to meet the administration of the NEM and to ask them to continue to trade that they felt they should have a 75 per cent increase.  Even if they got the 75 per cent <Col N="1455" /> increase, it would still be a very reduced premium compared to the other rates that were available.  Yet they decided not to continue in the hackney business, to pull out of Ireland and that was the end of it.  It was a commercial decision and they stopped trading for that class of business. I know it is a class of business within a class of business, but it is a very important business in the motor field.  The reason given was that it was a good commercial decision.</P>
    <P>I would love to see companies underwrite trade and business as they have been authorised to do but I can understand the attitude of the insurance companies. While I appreciate and accept this amendment I wonder if there could still be a further procedure, perhaps a right of appeal to the courts, if it was found that that was a preferable way of doing it before the revocation would become fully effective.  The companies will say that normal commercial practices should prevail, that they have stopped trading for their own good commercial reasons.  I do not wish that to be the way, but they will make that point clearly and their point of view, in fairness, should be considered.</P>

      <P>On Senator Hogan's point, the wording of amendment No. 36 is reasonably clear.  It says:</P>
      <P>... the Minister shall notify the undertaking concerned in writing of such proposed suspension or revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not spell out that they have to be notified of the Minister's intention.  The wording is strong enough.  It clearly makes it legally necessary for the Minister to write to the company and say he is proposing to suspend or revoke their licence.  Presumably, as is the present practice, they will respond to that and the Minister will then decide whether or not to go ahead.  That would cover it.  It could be laid down in another sentence, if necessary, that the Minister would have to await a response and so on but if we get into that detail, trying to cover unreasonable behaviour, we will have a <Col N="1456" /> massive piece of legislation.  It is not necessary.  I am presuming that both sides will act reasonably once the proposed suspension is notified.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made a good point which I will consider.  Sections 14, 15 and 18 deal with revoking a licence in some way and perhaps there is a standard notification procedure and appeal procedure for all of these conditions.  I will have a closer look at that and see if I can consolidate them or harmonise them in some way.  There are specific reasons for each section.  I have a specific target on this section which is to clean out the phantom companies who are not doing business, to either get them off the list or get them doing business.  That is the target in this amendment.  However, we will have a look at pulling that procedure together.</P>
    <P>There is a procedure at the moment for revoking licences.  Present practice is reasonably well established and the company are fully consulted.  The company are in no doubt as to the Minister's intention and they are given every opportunity to respond to the Minister before any final revocation takes place.  Any Minister who would behave in any other way would leave himself wide open to all sorts of actions.  What we are trying to do is to put present practice into the legislation and not go beyond that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that those three sections will be looked at, sections 14, 15 and 18. I take his point.  They deal with different areas, and different considerations apply, but it is an important power to be able to suspend or revoke an authorisation to do business.  Once we start to introduce such a power into a statute we open ourselves to an application for judicial review if natural and constitutional justice is not complied with.  There seems to be an unevenness at the moment, perhaps because it is a complex area and the Minister is, quite properly, introducing amendments to flesh out certain sections. I can see a reason why the Minister, on this section is proposing that there should be an amendment requiring the Minister <Col N="1457" /> to notify the undertaking concerned of a proposal for suspension or revocation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister then raised the question as to why is there not also that express provision that the company should know in writing the intention of the Minister to possibly exercise that power under section 14 or section 15.  Equally, in relation to section 15 (9), if it is felt necessary by the parliamentary draftsman, as presumably it is, for the Minister to be able to vary or revoke a direction given under this section, surely under section 14, in particular, it would be presumably necessary for the Minister to vary or revoke a direction. If the Minister has, for example, suspended an authorisation for failure to comply with section 14, he must have the power to vary that.  Perhaps he has the implied power, but it appears that the parliamentary draftsman feels it necessary to include an express power under section 9.</P>
      <P>It is probably necessary to look at the fact that under section 15 there is an enabling power to the Minister to apply to the court.  Is the Minister quite satisfied that in exercising the powers under sections 14 and 18 it is not necessary to have the same possibility of applying to the court?  We are talking about the power to suspend or revoke authorisation. To suspend is not too bad, but to revoke an authorisation to do business is to deprive somebody of a property right, a right to do business in something and, therefore, it is a very serious power. Is the Minister satisfied that that power is properly grounded in the present section?</P>
      <P>I simply respond to the Minister's openness to examining it.  It may be, on examination, that the Minister will be satisfied with it.  I fully accept that it is really introducing into statute administrative practice, but once we start introducing it into statute, the trouble starts, because then the small print is the basis on which the exercise by the Minister of the powers will be assessed by the courts. That is exactly the basis on which applications for judicial review will be based. It would be better to be sure than to be sorry later.</P>

I would like to remind the Senator that in Statutory Instrument 115/1976, there is power to revoke licences in cases of unsound trading for example.  What we are now doing is laying down more specific crimes for which the Minister may revoke licences.  It is important when we are doing that to get the procedure which is at present quite satisfactory as nearly as possible into the statute.  I am happy that the policy here is correct and the direction is right.  I will certainly take on board the Senator's suggestions in the sense of pulling the procedures more closely together.</P>

      <P>In the section the Minister has certain powers to revoke an authorisation where no business is being <Col N="1460" /> done.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are quite a lot of businesses which are not quoted in Ireland at the moment by insurance companies.  There are probably many people who could establish small businesses in this country but who are not able to do so because of failure to get insurance cover at a premium that was not prohibitive.  There is difficulty in getting an insurance quotation for certain classes of high risk business.  Most Irish businesses do not expose themselves to any risk if they can get away with it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister's Department should have discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation to devise ways in which various high risk occupations can be catered for.  I am talking about the courier business, the engineering business and so on where there is scope for small employment initiatives.  They are prohibited from doing business because they are not able to get adequate insurance cover and, in some cases, they are not able to get an insurance quotation at all.  Will the Minister under this section exert whatever influence he can on the insurance companies to quote, at least, for all categories of businesses where possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 deals with the acceptance of re-insurance business by insurance companies.  Its primary intention is to ensure that insurers do not accept re-insurance business in classes of business where they do not have a track record of underwriting expertise on a direct basis.  Direct insurance is where insurers are dealing directly with members of the public, whereas re-insurance accepted business involves the laying off of insurance between different insurance companies.  Therefore, it can be a relatively high risk business. However, while we feel that the principle laid down in this section is unobjectionable and prudent from a supervisory point of view, it would, nevertheless, appear to preclude an insurer from accepting ancillary risks of a minor magnitude on certain basket re-insurance treaties, for example.  This could happen in relation to a substantial fire treaty with an insignificant element of liability cover attaching.  The danger with the provision, as drafted in the published Bill, is that it would cut across the existing commercial practice of insurance companies and also would not be consistent with the permission granted to direct insurers to insure ancillary risks.  This was not the intention behind the section.  Accordingly, the Government amendment proposes now to alter the section by working in an ancillary risks type provision for certain basket re-insurance acceptances by insurance companies.  However, life insurers will be prohibited from taking on any non-life re-insurance business and <i>vice versa</i> as these are completely separate disciplines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I raised this matter on Second Stage and I am glad that he has reacted positively in coming in with this amendment.  Re-insurance is a valuable way in which companies can get business into the insurance companies in this State and offset some of the risks they take in <Col N="1462" /> some of the insurance business they take on.  It spreads the risk of the insurer on an international basis and it generates some overseas business as a result.</P>
      <P>In considering the opening up of the insurance market in the light of the internal market in 1992, it would be wrong for the Minister at this point to close the market in this country and to refuse to allow companies in Ireland to re-insure or to deal with other companies and lay off some of the risks abroad.  It would be a positive development to include ancillary business abroad through insurers in this country.  It would be a positive contribution they could make in phasing the way into the internal market in relation to the insurance business in 1992.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are at the moment discussing amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40.  I also welcome the amendment.  It is really amendment No. 40 which is introducing a new element.  I agree with the submission made by Senator Hogan on that.  Now that the Minister is introducing a new subsection it would probably be better if that new subsection became subsection (2), and the present subsection (2) would become subsection (3) so that it covers the proviso, if you like, in the new subsection (3).  Subsection (2) should finally be that re-insurance acceptances by an undertaking shall be subject to the provisions of the Insurance Acts.  It covers all of them.  It is a very small drafting point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As such we do not directly supervise them because they may or may not be dealing directly with the companies here.  Re-insurers are not directly supervised in that way because they are specialist companies but their accounts are submitted to the Companies Registration Office in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>Section 19 deals with specialist re-insurers who are established in the State. They deal only with other insurers or re-insurers and are engaged in accepting or re-insuring part or all of the risks which are undertaken by direct insurers.  If I were to attempt to introduce local supervision of this business it would be beyond our resources and I do not think it would be effective or necessary, given the supervisory controls which are now exercised in large foreign States like the UK and the USA.  However, it is useful to be aware of the specialist re-insurers who are operating here and to require them to publish details of their activities.  That is what section 19 (1) (b) seeks to attain.</P>
      <P>To the best of our knowledge approximately six specialist re-insurers operate in the State at present and most, if indeed not all, are totally foreign owned.  It is not the intention of this section to discourage re-insurers from establishing here.  Reliable and reputable insurers are very welcome.  However, I would be concerned if unsavoury operators were to come here and section 19 (1) (b) should help to keep this situation from developing. Discussions can be held with existing re-insurers on what form disclosure under this section should take in order to secure transparency without damaging the insurance business.  I hope that clarifies the position for the Senator.  This is an interesting area because the average person might assume that we directly supervise re-insurers when we actually do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section and I think it is reasonably clear.  The undertakings required from insurers could refer, for example, to the level and type of business to be written.  That is one response to the Senator's question.  They could also refer to the way the business is to be conducted, for example, whether the intermediaries are specialists of certain sorts; the expertise of the staff to be used in the business; requirements as to participation in certain market bodies such as the third party motor declined cases committee and so on.  That is the type of undertaking we would be seeking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The power which the Minister has under section 21 is comparable to the power under sections 14, 15 and 18 which we discussed earlier.  If the Minister is going to look at those <Col N="1466" /> sections it would be appropriate for him to look at section 21 also.  It seems that section 21 is drafted in very broad terms. Government amendment or any other amendment has been put down to this section which gives the Minister power at the time of issuing the authorisation or at any other time &mdash; and, therefore, I presume this could be when the Minister would be exercising his powers under section 14, 15 or 18 &mdash; to seek undertakings and the holder must furnish information to the Minister so that he can verify it.</P>
      <P>The section says that, if the Minister is not satisfied that the holder is complying with the undertakings given, he may suspend or revoke the authorisation.  That is a very important power and I think it would be better if the section contained a notice of the Minister's intention to exercise the power so that the company would have an opportunity to know they are at risk of being suspended or that their authorisation may be revoked under this subsection.  This is another section that should be looked at in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is not as clear in relation to this section as it was in relation to the previous sections but we will see if there is any conflict between them.  We will apply the same kind of thought to all of them to see if we can standardise the procedure.  The general commitment I can give the Senator in relation to all of these sections is that we will see if we can standardise this revocation procedure generally.</P>
      <P>When a company get an authorisation they give certain undertakings at the time of issue.  They know the undertakings given at that time and know what they are letting themselves in for.  If the holder of an authorisation is unable to verify to the Minister's satisfaction that he is complying with the undertakings, it is pretty reasonable that the Minister should have power to say: &ldquo;You have not lived up to the undertakings which you gave freely at the time you got the licence and, therefore, the original agreement to give the licence no longer exists.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Senator's point that <Col N="1467" /> maybe this is one sided and that the Minister may suddenly decide he is not satisfied with this power, but that runs through all of the legislation on insurance.  At the end of the day the Minister has to be satisfied that the companies are behaving responsibly in maintaining their solvency ratios and he has to have power to act in a wide range of areas.  We will look at it from a general point of view but I think the import of the section is clear and desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the response of the Minister, obviously it is a section that it is going to be looked at.  The Minister's powers are not just powers which require undertakings at the time of issue of the authorisation.  They are powers that can operate at any time.  The section states &ldquo;...at the time of the issue of an authorisation or at any other time&rdquo; so they can operate at any stage.  If anything, it is a less defined section than the other sections.  The other sections address specific issues but this is a more general one and, if anything, it is more necessary that there be precise safeguards written into it because the powers are stated in very broad terms.  The Minister may consider at any stage that it is expedient in the public interest and the interest of policyholders to require the holder to give undertakings.  There is good reason why that might be so, but there is an obligation to furnish to the Minister returns and documentation and such other information as he may require to verify that the undertakings are being complied with.</P>

    <P>Subsection (3) is very difficult to get a precise hold on because it states &ldquo;... the holder of an authorisation is unable to verify to the Minister's satisfaction that he is complying with the undertakings ...&rdquo;  I think the person should be on notice that he may be at risk of suspension; in other words, the same considerations should apply to a power of this kind simply because at the end of the day the Minister is retaining the statutory power to suspend or revoke the authorisation and can trigger off this requirement of an undertaking at any stage.  This seems to <Col N="1468" /> be very close to the powers exercised under sections 14, 15 and 18 but they are more general, less specific and, therefore, more in need of qualification.</P>

      <P>We will have a look at it.  The intention is not to permit a Minister to harass a company in any way. Normally the undertakings would be given at the time of issue of the authorisation. If a Minister was acting unreasonably he could suddenly decide he would attach fresh conditions and if those conditions were not being met he could then proceed to revoke the licence. It would be extremely unreasonable behaviour on the part of any Minister to do it in that kind of precipitate way.  I will see if I can ensure that that element of it is taken into account, without over-diluting the Minister's power to make sure that, if an undertaking is going off the rails in any way, he has power to seek undertakings from it.  Maybe we should say &ldquo;undertakings in specific areas&rdquo; or something like that.  We will take a look at that.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose to increase the limits in section 22 (3) (b) to £1,000.  I am proposing in line 45 to delete &ldquo;£500&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and in line 47 to delete &ldquo;£600&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo;.  The increased amounts are being put forward to maintain parity with the equivalent friendly society regulations which have been drafted and approved by the Oireachtas. It is necessary to maintain limits on the amount of insurance for which children can be covered so as to prevent any abuse <Col N="1469" /> of insurance on children and to minimise the potential risk, however slight, to children from unscrupulous guardians.  Obviously the existing amounts of £20 and £30 are totally out of date in modern times and their practical impact is to make it extremely unattractive for insurers to issue such policies to parents who might genuinely wish to effect full family life cover.  The amendments proposed will remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wanted advice on industrial branch assurance business I know well where he would travel to.  However, having made that point it is right that we should update industrial branch assurance business.  We are living in changed times.  The economic and social life of our country is different from that of 30 to 40 years ago when industrial branch business was booming.  The penny policy was famous for the burials of many Irish people. Many Irish people were buried on the proceeds of the penny policy and we should not forget those days.  I pay tribute to the men who cycled the highways and byways of Ireland collecting the pounds and the pennies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that we should update the legislation in relation to industrial branch assurance.  The changes the Minister referred to are permissive rather than specifically mandatory and the insurers concerned may amalgamate their funds or revise the collection dates as they see fit.  All industrial branch assurances companies will go for what the Minister is suggesting.  I am sure they requested it <Col N="1470" /> because weekly collections are not economic anymore.  I congratulate the Minister for updating industrial branch assurance business and for giving it a new lease of life.  It was the very rock upon which life assurance was built and the Minister is right not to ignore it.  This will mean a new lease of life for industrial assurance business.</P>

      <P>Sections 25 and 26 are technical sections but I hope the intention of what I am doing is clear.  I am trying to close off a possible loophole whereby, under present legislation, a friendly society could be formed to conduct commercial insurance business.  Someone could form a friendly society to do insurance business without being supervised by the Insurance Act and this would mean that the insurance activities permitted to be carried on by friendly societies and, under section 26, by trade unions would be strictly mutual self-help activities, the sort of activities one associates with the reason for the existence for these organisations in any case.  I am trying to make sure that nobody uses this self-help type of legislation, albeit 1896, and thereafter, to get around insurance regulations and supervisory legislation.</P>

      <P>We seem to be discussing sections 25 and 26 and this suits <Col N="1471" /> the point I want to make.  These two sections which the Minister has rightly described as being technical &mdash; and, in fact, they are extremely technical in the way they are drafted &mdash; raise an issue that was raised at the beginning of consideration of this Bill which is that it is not satisfactory that we are dealing with both insurance legislation of the Oireachtas and important statutory instruments implementing Council Directives.  Section 25 amends the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, by reference to the Council Directive and authorisation of the Council Directive. Section 26 interprets European Communities regulations because issues of interpretation have arisen.</P>
      <P>That is a nightmare for anybody who is trying to make sense of the insurance business because you either deal with primary legislation and the interpretation of primary legislation or you deal with regulations made under primary legislation. We have two codes running together and it is extremely difficult to operate them.  I know there are constraints on person power, Departments and priorities but it is extremely important that we should try to have our insurance code in one primary code and that any regulations are made under that primary code so that they sit in well with it.  What the Minister is trying to do in these two technical sections is to redress the problem of running two if not three codes together and this is very difficult.</P>

The most helpful thing I can do arising out of these comments is to bring formally to the attention of the Attorney General the comments that have been made by the Senator and my own comments which indicate that I support the general direction of what she is trying to do in consolidating legislation and tidying it up. There are substantial difficulties in relation to resources but it is something that will have to be undertaken. <Col N="1472" /> Occasionally various Governments get around to consolidating areas of legislation but I cannot wait for that consolidation work to go on and I need this clarification sections put in here.

      <P>Section 28 deals with the insurance compensation fund.  It proposes certain restrictions on who may benefit from the fund.  The amendments proposed to this section cover a number of issues.  Some are designed to simply clarify a number of aspects of the section. For instance, the proposed new subsection (1C) provides that the limitations proposed by this section on payments from the fund shall also apply to payments by the insured to third parties. Amendment No. 48 which proposes the insertion of a new subsection (5) exempts Irish insurers from the payment of the 2 per cent insurance levy on policies issued in respect of risks situated outside the State.  Accordingly, a definition of risks situated in the State to which the 2 per cent levy will continue to apply has been inserted in the proposed new subsection (7).  I can hear Senator Robinson thinking at this stage about the location of risks in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The thought had occurred to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable efforts <Col N="1473" /> are being made at present to attract financial institutions and insurance companies to our International Financial Services Centre at the docklands.  The application of the 2 per cent levy to non-life insurers operating in the dockland centre could act as a disincentive to investment as it would tend to reduce the competitiveness of these operations, that is, non-resident policyholders could probably obtain cheaper cover elsewhere. Thus the operation of the compensation fund levy could be a critical factor in influencing the decision of a non-life insurance company to locate or not to locate in our new financial services centre.  As Shannon can also market the same activities as the International Financial Services Centre, prospective clients could also be put off setting up there.  A certain amount of foreign business, mainly marine, aviation and transit policies, is also written by insurers not resident in the centre or in Shannon and the 2 per cent levy is currently payable on these policies.  In order to be equitable these policies should also be exempt from the 2 per cent levy.  The loss of income to the fund will be marginal arising from the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>Following on the above amendment, it is also proposed to remove the entitlements of policyholders outside the State with policies issued in the State to any benefits from the insurance compensation fund on the grounds that those who do not contribute should not be in a position to benefit from the fund.  The last two lines of subsection (2) which insert a new subsection (1B) are being deleted and replaced by a new subsection (1D).  This will ensure that while corporate or unincorporated bodies are not in themselves eligible for any benefits from the fund, any individual third party having to claim from such a body will be eligible for such benefits.  This is being proposed on the grounds of social equity. Senator Hogan's amendment No. 46 proposes that all policyholders, and not just personal policyholders, be compensated in any winding-up of an insurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the protection afforded by the fund will indeed be somewhat restricted <Col N="1474" /> under this section, the Government's view is that this change is absolutely essential as the present arrangements expose the funds to a potentially unlimited liability.  The existing arrangements are simply too expensive on the community at large.  The proposed new arrangements attempt to strike a fair balance between limiting the burden on the fund which, in turn, enables the Minister to keep a balance between the maximum levy of 2 per cent, which is a consideration, and affording some measure of compensation for those who might lose out most.  I should mention again that all necessary arrangements have been made to meet the known demands of the administrators of ICI and PMPA.  Unfortunately, therefore, I have to say that I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this is a very important section in view of the recent experience we have had in relation to PMPA and ICI.  I notice that in any company law, and in particular in relation to a winding up, a liquidation or a receivership, the trend is that once the Revenue Commissioners and the secured creditors are looked after in terms of the sale, or in terms of the State intervention, the unsecured creditors are often left to find their way in the dark and to get out of their problems in their own imaginative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This philosophy is permeating the Minister's thinking on this matter in that he is prepared to go so far in relation to absolving and qualifying personal policyholders for the insurance compensation fund but he is not prepared to go any further than that for all policyholders. There should not be anything precluding the Minister from doing that because if one applies the same argument in relation to the winding-up of a particular business, the fact is that once the Revenue Commissioners and banks are looked after very little effort is made on the part of the receiver to pursue the market further to get a better price for the business as a going concern in order to assist the unsecured creditors.  That is my line of thinking on this amendment. <Col N="1475" /> I am unhappy that we cannot extend this section to all policyholders and not just personal policyholders.  The Minister will have to convince me further before I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the compensation fund is funded by policyholders. It is a levy on the industry and it is being paid at present by policyholders. First we will have to try to make sure that the 2 per cent stays at 2 per cent and, secondly, at a suitable time to try to remove or phase it out.  That is important.  One might be stuck with the dilemma of having to decide who needs the compensation most and we came to the conclusion that the area of greatest need was more likely to be the personal policyholder.  I am aware that there might be some overlap and possible difficult areas.  For example, a small person might have a company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A small shopkeeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a small shopkeeper could have a company in which case he would not be liable to pay compensation and another person's company might be unincorporated and so on.  So there are marginal problems but, if I am to restrict the fund, I have to draw the line.  The fund can look after ICI and PMPA but I would not like to see unlimited exposure to it.  The UK Policyholders' Protection Act has the same line drawn between the corporate and the personal policyholder.  If there is some other line we can draw I would certainly be prepared to listen to it but, as of now, it seems that the bulk of business is carried on in an incorporated fashion and small businesses, such as shopkeepers, tend to be unincorporated in which case they are protected.  It is not a neat line but there is very little that is neat in this area.  One has to make a judgment about where to put in a line and hold it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is always a difficulty in relation to margins no matter what scheme you draw up. <Col N="1476" /> Nevertheless, these people are paying into the compensation fund through their policies and premiums the same as every other policyholder and on a point of principle they are entitled to be considered favourably for the insurance compensation fund the same as the people who have personal insurance policies and who contribute their 2 per cent.  I was hoping the Minister would take the opportunity today to say that he would be phasing out the 2 per cent very shortly in relation to PMPA but I understand from media reports that Mr. O'Kelly, the administrator of PMPA, needs a further £100 million in order to solve the financial problems of PMPA.  Recent statements from him would indicate that we will have the 2 per cent compensation fund for a good while to come.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to withdraw my amendment on the basis that I believe every policyholder who makes a contribution of 2 per cent to the compensation fund is as entitled to get cover or extension of cover or access to the compensation fund as people under personal insurance policies to whom the Minister refunded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could probably argue this at length.  I know the changes represent a very significant reduction in the level of protection offered from the fund.  I am crystal clear about that.  For that reason we are not entering into it in any way lightly.  They are absolutely necessary because the present arrangements are quite simply too generous and they expose the fund to potentially unlimited liability.  Adequate arrangements have been made to cater for all foreseeable demands rising from the present administration of the two companies. It would be completely untenable to continue to leave the fund exposed to the possibility, however remote, of any further new demands in the future.  The current statutory arrangements under which the Minister strikes the maximum level of 2 per cent on non-life premium income each year is the most that could reasonably be demanded of or borne by <Col N="1477" /> policyholders to provide against insolvencies on the part of insurance companies.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that the fund will not be called into action again but, if it is, it seems reasonable to try to strike a balance between the burden this will place on the policyholder and, at the same time, try to get a balance between that and compensating those genuinely in need.  I would prefer not to have to make a change like this, but it is a sensible one. We have to draw the line somewhere.  If the Senator or any other Senator can suggest some other way of drawing this line I certainly will take it on board.  I must draw a line because we cannot leave the fund exposed indefinitely.  The 2 per cent is the maximum limit which we could attempt to permit on it.  In the event of some difficulty it would not rule out particular legislation for a particular company which, as Senators will recall, we had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point.  Perhaps he will deal with it on Report Stage.  If we can come up with a formula in the meantime I will be glad to do so.  Would the insurance companies themselves have a role to play in the compensation fund we are talking about here?  I do not see why the 2 per cent should be applied to the consumer in relation to the problems of ailing insurance companies and the difficulties that they might have got into through mismanagement in the past.  The insurance companies themselves should have an opportunity and should be asked to make a contribution each year towards an insurance compensation fund.</P>
      <P>Perhaps that would give the Minister wider scope and sufficient finances to extend the scope of this section.  I will withdraw my amendment on the basis that I will consider submitting an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  I would be grateful if the Minister in the meantime would consider a Government amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I understand totally what is behind Senator Hogan's amendment. If the Minister could look at it with a view to improving the situation that would be very welcome.  The whole 2 per cent levy and why it was imposed are still matters of concern for every policyholder.  The fact is that grannies with modest fire premiums are now paying for the ills of two insurance companies.  Obviously that is unfair and the sooner it is changed the better all of us will like it.  Of course it is adding to the cost of insurance.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Hogan's reference to the administrator of the PMPA looking for additional funding, I am not aware of that.  The PMPA were an umbrella body for a whole series of activities right across the country, garages, building societies, the PMPS and other activities.  I recall on the PMPS issue, the late George Colley when he was Minister for Finance at the time of the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank, paying those unfortunate depositors with the Irish Trust Bank every penny of the money they were about to lose.  In the case of the AIB and the ICI affair the State saved the finances of the AIB on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very little word about the unfortunate PMPS depositors and other creditors who were left high and dry when the PMPS went out of business. Whilst there may not be &mdash; and I am not sure if there is &mdash; a legal obligation on the PMPA who are trading at the moment and seem to be looking for business, and are exploring all kinds of new avenues to get in new business, I believe that there is a moral obligation on that company who are now trading and are being propped up by the granny premiums, grannies who are paying modest premiums, fire premiums and so on, who never had a car in their lives, to come to the aid of the PMPS depositors who lost a lot of money in that sad debacle.  While it is not part and parcel of this Bill I feel I should raise it at this level and perhaps the Minister would have power to ask them to redress this problem that exists <Col N="1482" /> for the creditors and the depositors of the PMPS group.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 50:</P>
    <P>In page 16, before section 29 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>.&mdash;(1)  In every winding up, the assets, wherever situated, of an undertaking representing technical reserves required to be established and maintained pursuant to the Regulations of 1976 or the Regulations of 1984, as the case may be, shall, without prejudice to any right of priority under the Companies Acts, be utilised to discharge debts arising under contracts of insurance made pursuant to its authorisation in priority to other debts.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section any amount recovered from a reinsurer under a contract of reinsurance relating to a contract of insurance mentioned in subsection (1) shall form part of the said technical reserves.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide in the event of a winding up of an insurer for the granting of priority to the insurer's policyholders over those assets wherever situated which the insurer is obliged to maintain to cover its liability to policy holders.  In accordance with the relevant EC directives, all authorised insurers are obliged to establish and maintain technical reserves in respect of underwriting liabilities assumed by them.  Assets amounting to 80 per cent of these liabilities relating to Irish business are required to be localised in the State.  In a winding up situation, all assets representing reserves on Irish business should become available in the first instance to meet claims by the relevant policyholders.  The proposed section provides accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) is necessary to ensure that the priority granted to policyholders over the assets representing an insurer's <Col N="1483" /> underwriting liabilities extends to any amounts recovered from re-insurance also.  Re-insurance, as I said before, is the spreading of risks assumed by an insurer with other insurers or specialist re-insurance companies.  Under the relevant EC regulations, an insurer is obliged to maintain assets to cover the amount of the liabilities which it retains on its own net account.  This subsection provides that amounts recovered by an insurer in the course of winding up from re-insurers are also to be treated as assets relating to Irish business over which the relevant policyholders should have first call.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, nearly all existing life assurers already have appointed actuaries so the sanction, by and large, only makes statutory what is existing practice. Nearly all existing life companies have appointed actuaries.  At present the required qualifications to practice as an actuary under insurance law are set out in the Actuary Qualifications Regulations, 1941, Statutory Instrument 75 of 1940 which specify that an actuary should be either a fellow or an associate of the Institute of Actuaries, or the Faculty of Actuaries, or a person approved of by the Minister as having actuarial knowledge. The Institute of Actuaries is the London based UK actuarial body and the faculty is based in Edinburgh.  This subsection will allow the Minister to add to those requirements in the case of the person appointed as actuary to a company and to stipulate certain further requirements in relation to experience, for example, so many years working in the business of insurance and so on.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 30 to insert in Part II a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; .&mdash;(1) If an auditor of an insurer&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has reason to believe that there exist circumstances which are likely to affect materially the insurer's ability to fulfill its obligations to policyholders or meet any of its financial requirements under the Insurance Acts, or</P>
      <P>(b)  has reason to believe that there are material defects in the financial systems and controls or accounting records of the insurer which are likely to have that effect, or</P>
      <P>(c)  proposes to qualify any certificate which he is to provide in relation to financial statements or returns of the insurer under the Companies Acts or the Insurance Acts, or</P>
      <P>(d)  decides to resign or not seek re-election as auditor,</P>
      <P>he shall report the matter to the Minister in writing without delay.</P>
      <P>(2) The auditor shall send to the insurer a copy of any report made by him to the Minister under subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Whenever the Minister is of the opinion that the exercise of his functions under the Insurance Acts or the protection of the interests of policy <Col N="1486" /> holders so requires, he may require an auditor of an insurer to supply him with such information as he may specify in relation to the audit of the business of the insurer and the auditor shall comply with the requirement.  The Minister may require that in supplying such information the auditor shall act independently of the insurer.</P>
    <P>(4) In the case of an insurer having its head office outside the State, the duties imposed on an auditor under this section shall apply in respect of business written by the insurer at its establishment in the State.</P>
    <P>(5) No duty to which an auditor of an insurer may be subject shall be regarded as contravened, and no liability to the insurer, or to its shareholders, creditors or other interested parties, shall attach to the auditor, by reason of his compliance with any obligation imposed on him by or under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this new section is to ensure that auditors notify my Department as soon as they encounter any difficulties or potential difficulties facing a client insurer.  This section will also remove any existing constraints on auditors reporting a problem to the Department or discussing with the Department the affairs of their clients. The Minister is also provided with the power to require an auditor of an insurer to submit specific details about his clients financial position and he may require an auditor of an insurer to supply him with such information as he may specify in relation to the audit of the business of the insurer and the auditor shall comply with the requirements.  The Minister may also require that, in supplying such information, the auditor shall act independently of the insurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligations laid down in this new section are important as they provide for an additional perspective on the financial well-being of insurance companies which will assist the Department in their supervisory duties.  Earlier reporting of difficulties will, I think, give us valuable <Col N="1487" /> time as the supervisory authority to consider remedial measures necessary to safeguard the interests of policyholders. By and large, auditors will have discretion as to whether to report on any matter to the Minister having regard to the materiality of the issue and its impact on the insurer's financial position.  It should also be noted that, as a safeguard to insurers, an auditor is obliged to copy any report of this kind to the insurer also. It should be stressed that this is not a type of &ldquo;cry wolf&rdquo; provision in that only matters which are likely to materially affect an insurer's solvency position will be reported by auditors to the Minister. In practice this will probably mean that the auditors will be reporting in similar vein to an insurance company's shareholders in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about some of the phraseology used in this new section.  Subsection (1) refers to financial requirements and there is no definition of &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo; in this Bill.  I would be concerned that this term could be interpreted as covering every and any financial requirement contained in the Insurance Acts which would place a great burden on the auditors.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to specify what &ldquo;financial circumstances&rdquo; and &ldquo;financial requirements&rdquo; mean.  You can expect auditors to know a lot and they should know most things about the goings on in a company but they cannot be expected to be aware of all the circumstances which, had they been known to them, would have led to a report to the insurance section as set out in the Minister's amendment.  It is putting the auditors in a very invidious position in that every and any financial situation that might arise could be construed as providing a financial requirement under this amendment.  If that information had been sent to the Department we might have averted a very serious financial situation for the insurance company.</P>

    <Title>Food Aid to Ethiopia: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann noting with concern the obstacles facing the transportation and distribution of emergency food aid to the starving people in Ethiopia, appeals to all concerned to take the necessary action in order for food aid to be adequately distributed, and calls on the Government to use its good offices to effect a ceasefire between all the forces involved in the conflict in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Lydon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators this is a motion to which I am very anxious to contribute, but it does not give me any joy to do so.  The fact that hundreds of thousands of unfortunate people are starving to death is a tragedy that is very difficult to comprehend.  When the dreadful scenes reached our television screens a few years ago everyone was appalled and sickened by what they saw and magnificent efforts were made to rectify that situation.  Unfortunately, it still remains. It is estimated that this year six million people will not have enough to eat.  The goodwill of the people of Ireland towards solving the massive problem is unquestioned.  Unfortunately, the disbursement of food in a balanced and proper way is the big problem.  Concern <Col N="1489" /> is continually being expressed at the large proportion of aid sent to Ethiopia which is misappropriated.  This is a major problem which we have to face.</P>
      <P>The lack of human respect and dignity in Ethiopia, as evidenced by the reports of the operations of the regime there, cannot but disgust any decent human being.  The importance placed on military and parliamentary expenditure in Ethiopia to the detriment of all other considerations is the most serious cause of the trouble.  It is totally unjustifiable and inhumane that, when so many millions are starving, the regime in Ethiopia maintain the largest army in the African Continent. What sort of regime can justify not agreeing to a ceasefire between Eritrea and Tigre to ensure the safe passage of food to the starving millions.  In this terrible situation no organisation or group are spared and the food distribution centres and even orphanages appear to be legitimate targets in the interests of maintaining power.  That unfortunate people who have committed no other crime than to be in the wrong place at the wrong time should be dealt with in such a manner surely proves the point that man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn.</P>
      <P>I have to be sceptical of any attempts by gentle persuasion to encourage the Ethiopian Government to change their attitude.  I feel that the full force of the collective membership of the European Community must be brought to bear on the Ethiopian Government and they must demand that priorities are put in order and that adequate supplies are allowed to reach their destination.  The record of the Ethiopian Government is deplorable as regards human rights.  We cannot, as a civilised nation, sit back and let the degredation continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I want to pay tribute to Concern, Gorta, GOAL and all the other voluntary agencies who have tried so hard to solve the massive problem.  The missionaries, both lay and otherwise, who work in that strife-torn region at great personal danger to themselves cannot be praised highly enough.  Their <Col N="1490" /> commitment and self-sacrifice are enormous. The least we can do is to ensure by every means at our disposal that their great work does not go for nought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all point to the historical reasons for the terrible tragedy in Ethiopia and the causes of that problem. The difficulty is that we must now try to solve the problem whatever the causes and the historical reasons for it and we must solve that problem as quickly as possible.  We cannot solve it ourselves but we have a voice in Europe and we must use that voice at every opportunity.  The Government and the Minister of State have a deep personal interest in this area. I know they will do everything in their power to try to bring the Ethiopian Government around to a humane way of thinking in order that the millions of people who are starving to death there will be spared and that the problem will not increase.</P>
      <P>Enormous contributions were made by the Irish public at large when the initial difficulty was brought home to them.  I am concerned that, as a result of the reports of only minute percentages of the aid and the funding getting through to where it was intended to go in the first place, people may become cynical and sceptical and change their attitude.  I sincerely hope that will not happen.</P>
      <P>I believe the general public must see that an effort is being made by the European Economic Community, in particular to ensure that the vast amounts of aid and relief collected on a voluntary basis and contributed by large numbers of people in this country, go to the people for whom they are intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I wish to pay tribute to the schools for the tremendous developments that took place over the past couple of years in that area.  I do not think there is a more educated population in relation to the difficulties in Ethiopia at the moment than our young population because of the Concern debates that took place in every post primary school in the country over the past number of years.  This brought home to the younger people exactly what the difficulties are in Third World countries, in particular in Ethiopia and the surrounding area.  It also educated young people on their responsibilities to people who are less well off than themselves and the responsibilities they have in that area.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to the people who were responsible for that type of development. We know that if young people are on your side and if they feel there is a just cause, the effort they will make on behalf of that cause is absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>At the same time they expect a concrete reaction to the actions they take. Every school in the country raises funds at some time of the year for Third World developments and for Concern, Gorta and all of those other voluntary organisations who do such magnificant work.  I know the Minister and the Government will do everything in their power to ensure that this terrible tragedy is alleviated as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I consider it a privilege to be able to speak today in Seanad Eireann to this motion which has been put down by all the Senators in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, I compliment the prime movers of it for bringing before the Seanad a motion of such significance. It is of significance naturally to the people of Ethiopia and the people of Africa but we live in a global village and what affects one part of the village affects us all because of our common humanity.  It is for that reason that I feel we should speak today and alert the Minister to our concerns about the situation in Ethiopia and look at him and to the Government to <Col N="1492" /> exhibit in a very practical way solutions and helpful interventions which can bring about a solution to the appalling problems being faced by the people of Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>Senator McKenna mentioned the deep personal interest which he felt sure the Minister has.  I have no doubt that that personal interest is a reality.  I want to see that interest translated into concrete steps forward on behalf of all of us in this country who care.  I listened intently to Senator McKenna and he seemed to be referring to the danger that we in this country would suffer in some way from what is known as aid fatigue, in other words, that we might have become weary of the processions of starving people put before us on our television screens and articles in our newspapers and in various magazines.  Recently Concern did some statistical survey which indicates that there is no aid fatigue at all being felt by the Irish population.  I certainly was very consoled to read that because it has been a feature of some other countries.  It appears that we have a folk memory, an ancestral feeling, or a gut instinct about famine, deprivation and poverty which will not allow the Irish community to suffer from aid fatigue.  That is presumably why this motion is before us today and why we are enabled to have over two weeks a three hour discussion on the current situation in Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation, as I understand it, affects currently some three million people in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre and the whole area there is dominated by the military struggle between the central Ethiopian Government forces and the forces of the Tigrean People's Liberation Front and the Ethiopian People's Liberation Front which has intensified since February of 1988.  It is hard for us all to imagine because words like Tigre and Eritrea are relatively new to most of us, but this war in Eritrea is, in fact, in its 27th year and there have recently been major offensives resulting in the EPLF extending their control to 80 per cent of the province. Major towns captured by the EPLF are Afabet, Tessenei, Barentu and Agordat <Col N="1493" /> in western Eritrea.  Similarly the TPLF has taken control of urban areas such as Wukro, Adigrat, Axum and Enda Selassie. The Ethiopian Government now only control Makelle, the capital, and Maichew the extreme south of the province. There has been tremendous unrest and disturbance in recent times as a consequence of these major offences.</P>
    <P>As recently as April of this year the Government launched a major conscription campaign in order to launch a major offensive in the northern territories. On May 15 the Ethiopian Government declared a state of emergency in Eritrea and Tigre and declared prohibited two six mile wide strips of land along Ethiopia's western border with Sudan and in the east along the 600 mile Red Sea coastline.  People are already beginning to be evacuated from these areas.  There will be sweeping powers given to security forces and administrators and western diplomats who are keenly observing the scene who, I have no doubt, are reporting back to our Foreign Affairs Minister, feel that a major counter-offensive to regain control of the provinces is being prepared and may in fact be under way as we speak here this evening.</P>
    <P>All of this has naturally posed a problem for foreign relief workers.  It certainly allows us to focus on the many idealistic well-educated, trained, highly motivated young people, Irish people in particular, who are working in the area and, indeed, from time to time in other offensives some of them have had fairly hair-raising experiences.  Thankfully, to date things have always been resolved and people with intimate knowledge of the situation on the ground have been able to establish contact.  We have to date thankfully not suffered unduly as a consequence of the disturbance and the poor situations foreign relief workers have found themselves in.</P>
    <P>All foreign relief workers were ordered by the Government to leave the northern provinces in April.  The major organisation expelled was the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The Red <Col N="1494" /> Cross locked up their supplies estimated at 53,000 tons of food and equipment and 40 lorries.  They have since been requested by the Ethiopian Red Cross to hand over their supplies.  The international committee have refused to do this unless their personnel are present to monitor the operations.  That seems like an eminently sensible way for the International Red Cross to act.  Oxfam and Save the Children Fund, the British charities, are based in Wollo province.  They are managing to continue assisting 700,000 people in two areas in south-east Tigre.  In both provinces the Government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission have reduced their operations considerably and are now only operating in Government held areas.</P>
    <P>Trocaire, to whom I am indebted for briefing and information, have had an estimate recently indicating that 500,000 people are being fed in Eritrea by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and Christian Relief Agencies.  In Tigre, relief operations by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission are only being carried out in the two towns held by the Government.  Given the vast numbers of people, the intensity of the conflict and the paucity of food and supplies generally, it is a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Relief Society of Tigre, or REST, are the only humanitarian organisation working in the area controlled by the TPLF and they have set up food distribution centres in Western Tigre.  They are able to feed approximately 600,000 people living in the area and the thousands who are migrating from Central and Eastern Tigre to receive food supplies. Six thousand tonnes of food are being trucked in monthly from Sudan. The organisation are stepping up their transportation of food supplies as it is essential that 31,000 additional metric tonnes are transported before the end of June as it is then the main rainy season starts.  Transportation in the rainy season in Africa becomes virtually impossible and a nightmare for everybody concerned, particularly when you know that the people for whom these goods and <Col N="1495" /> supplies are destined are starving and very hard-pressed indeed.</P>
    <P>The Relief Society of Tigre are stepping up their transportation of food supplies because of the necessity to get it all in to the people who require it before the rainy season begins.  It is obvious that the roads will become inaccessible and the kind of cross border co-operation from Sudan into Ethiopia will become very tricky in the rainy season.  The Eritrean Relief Association, an indigenous humanitarian organisation working in the areas controlled by the EPLF, are also trucking in food from Sudan to feed one million people.  They require 192,267 tonnes of food supplies and supplementary food but, to date, only 64,089 metric tonnes have been committed by the international community, so Senators can see that falls far short of the requirement.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna talked about bringing the Ethiopian Government around to a humane way of thinking and I was a little unhappy with that sentiment as expressed by Senator McKenna.  I have no doubt that the Ethiopian Government are deeply concerned about what is happening to their own people despite the conflict and the political tensions in the country.  They need help; they need resources; and they need support from outside.  I would be unhappy to think that we would put forward any view that the Ethiopian Government were anything but concerned and had anything but a humane attitude towards their own people.</P>
    <P>A Government top relief official called Berhanu Jembere said recently that food distribution will resume in contested areas when the area is cleansed from bandit activity.  That gives an indication of the power struggle in the northern territories but, at the same time, you have the indigenous relief agencies acting and moving in the food.  In that northern territory there are at least one million people for whom at the moment there is no actual source of food and that is the enormity of the problem.  If the counteroffensive gets under way, there will be a <Col N="1496" /> very profound possibility of further destruction and suffering associated with that.  The capacity of the indigenous organisations is limited.  This is where we come in and where we are obliged to give succour, aid and relief.  It is again compelling that we should look at what we are giving in development relief assistance to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>I am going to enter a plea now and speak to the Minister about the projected £400 million cuts &mdash; I gather 10 per cent across every Government Department in the autumn.  I want to say hands off the section of the Department of Foreign Affairs which provides funding and support to development work in Third World countries.  I feel that I can speak like this with confidence knowing that there is no aid fatigue in this country and knowing that there is a tremendous, enormous commitment to famine relief, in particular, and to development assistance in Third World countries.  I hope the Minister &mdash; I know he is Minister of State in the Department &mdash; can in some way protect the resources and seek more for famine relief and for the important and significant work he does within the Department.  I would like to feel that he could give some reassurances to Senators when he replies to the debate this evening on the Ethiopian situation.</P>
    <P>Even with increased support the problem of these one million people in the Northern Territories who are not being reached either by the local indigenous humanitarian organisations or by the Government is enormous.  With the next month it seems inevitable that there will be a massive movement of population as the peasants leave their farms in search of food.  It is horrendous to think of these dignfied noble Nilotic people trekking across the country in search of food with the inevitable consequences of malnutrition, disease and death in front of them.  Unless the war is brought to an end, there is little prospect for the people of the region to break out of the cycle of famine and poverty and achieve any lasting improvements in their living conditions, which is something that we all want to see for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> The main point of this motion is to bring about a ceasefire between all the forces involved in the conflict.  That is imperative because, until normalcy and stability are returned to that region, it will be extremely difficult to find a way forward to ease the very real and terrifying hardship which the people of that region are suffering and enduring.  There is a high level of awareness in the country at large.  We are all indebted to the many organisations who have heightened that awareness and in particular to Trocaire, Concern, GOAL and so many others who, in additon to providing relief work on the ground, provided a programme of heightening awareness and of education for all the public in this country.  I hope the Minister can respond in a positive, hopeful fashion as a consequence of this debate in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who have watched and seen the horrifying pictures from Ethiopia brought into our living rooms on TV screens cannot but be deeply concerned.  It is, therefore, timely that we should have an opportunity in the Seanad to debate this motion which I whole-heartedly support.  We feel acutely immediately when we see those pictures for the hopeless plight of so many people, especially children and very young children suffering from advanced malnutrition, pinched faces, skin sores, loss of body fat and muscle bulk, abdomens distended with fluid resulting from the combination of failing flabby hearts, fatty scarred livers and insufficient protein to retain fluid in the bloodstream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plight of this miserable state of ill-health is aggravated by disease and disease-carrying flies thriving on the insanitary conditions of compounds where water is scarce and often dirty. Comfort is practically non-existent and hope, even for the healthy, an unrealistic dream.  At times it seems as though we are watching some surrealistic nightmare: exhausted mothers with no milk to yield to thirsty babies, racked by diarrhoea till death takes over.  Even in a well-organised teaching hospital in a comparatively prosperous country such <Col N="1498" /> as Zimbabwe, where I worked for a while, up to 15 per cent of babies and young children admitted to that hospital died before very long.  Such is the percentage in the well-organised well-to-do hospital of a comparatively prosperous country that the mind boggles at the thought of the mortality rate in the babies and young children affected by the famine, disease and disorganisation in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should ponder for a moment on the effect of all this on the ecology and the part that has been played by a disrupted ecology in what we are witnessing.  The natural relationship between human, animal and plant species has been fundamentally altered at a time of climatic change.  On top of famine and disease they also suffer, as Senator Bulbulia has so graphically depicted, war. Europeans, be they resident in North America or western or eastern Europe, must now ask themselves very seriously some fundamental questions about this. Has our control of the world financial systems not had a significant part to play in what is happening?  Have we not encouraged debit financing so that we may profit today by the sweat of their tomorrow, that is, if they are to have one?  To meet our insatiable demands for growth at any cost &mdash; some might say at all costs &mdash; we have created the conditions where to compete successfully the indigenous people have been obliged to destroy replenishable resources and, at the same time, to use up those which can never be replaced.</P>
    <P>As our markets expand their balance &mdash; and I am not talking about their balance of payments &mdash; their overall balance, the social and ecological balance, the balance with the natural world to which they are so intimately related, is at first disturbed and finally up-ended.  The critical point is reached where those essential built-in self-regulating mechanisms of species variety in plant, animal, insect and community life are destroyed beyond their capacity for spontaneous recovery.  Those who still have health focus more and more on the only thing which makes sense which is survival.  It <Col N="1499" /> does not need much imagination to appreciate that the combination of social disintegration and ecological devastation quickly converts a struggle for survival into a fight for survival.  Eritrea seeks independence.  Tigre looks for autonomy. Ethiopia fights to hold on to both of them. Where do the weapons come from?  I suggest many of them come from sources either directly or indirectly related to the arms industries of the ideologically obsessed, on the one hand, or of profiteering capitalism on the other, also competing ridiculously in their own terms of the territorial imperative in a rapidly shrinking globe.</P>
    <P>Unless we can bring about a transformation in human attitude and expectation it seems that Ethiopa may well in time be just one of an increasing number of sad, tragic manifestations of a world community doomed to experience ecological disaster on a massive scale and within the lifetime of today's youngest citizens.  First, I suggest that the Irish people must continue to do what they have shown they are capable of, that is, to care, and secondly, which is much harder, to indicate urgently that we have the capacity to change our outlooks and our way of living and to produce &mdash; I hope this appeals to you, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; a more female-orientated society, a less male-dominated one, less of the predator and more of the hearth and the home and all that means in terms of vibrations out into the community and the wider society.  The late E. F. Schumacher, the champion of economics as though people mattered, the man who wrote the book <i>Small is Beautiful,</i> stated that we must leave the ford stampede before we are smothered by it.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a duty to the Third World, first, because as Europeans we have helped to create the problem and, secondly, as so many people in Ireland know only too well from their past, or from stories they have been told about the past by their people, what it was like to suffer famine, disease, deprivation and <Col N="1500" /> marginalisation.  We also have obligations under the terms of our yet incoherently articulated policy of positive neutrality to play honest broker as peacemaker, to use our experience at home &mdash; and who will say we have not had experience of conflict &mdash; and to insist fearlessly elsewhere that global survival can only be based on a share today conserve for tommorrow philosophy.</P>
    <P>Within that context we must share our talent and we must learn to learn from others so that we may develop with them together.  To meet the challenge, the Government might consider a strategy based on the urgent, the intermediate and the long term.  Urgently we should establish an embassy in Addis Ababa. Dr. Raymond McClean of Derry, who knows the Ethiopian situation first hand and has been there many times, has nothing but praise for the work of Fr. Jack Finucane, the field director of Concern. Both of these men insist that Ireland's obligations cannot be fulfilled without an official co-ordinating presence in Addis Ababa.  Already we are lucky in that there is a man there who could initiate and develop such an endeavour, Dr. John Walsh, the highly respected officer employed by the Pan-African Agricultural Services.  He has considerable official standing and his appointment might well be effected at a cost commensurate with the Irish purse.</P>
    <P>Were he or someone of his standing to be appointed, Ireland would be able to use the Embassy to channel all strands of our activity via Concern on the one hand and through the umbrella organisation Christian Relief Development Association &mdash; CRDA &mdash; on the other. This association, as I am sure the Minister knows, relates to no fewer than 46 organisations, Oxfam, Save the Children and so on.  It would be churlish in this context not to mention the great work that has already been done by the United Nations organisation, UNICEF, and the World Health Organisation, but all of these things need money.  I support wholeheartedly what Senator Bulbulia said about the need for us to stint ourselves but not to stint others who are starving <Col N="1501" /> especially in a country that has had so much of its own experience of famine.</P>
    <P>I ask the European and the western world community to consider very strongly whether the time has come to wipe out the national debt of Third World countries who have been caught in this international poverty trap which is not of their making.  In the intermediate term there should be a programme to establish the Irish nation in the consciousness of the global community, not just as a nation of carers, but as a nation equipped through education, training and experience, a nation aware of the challenge.</P>
    <P>We need in the short term teams of our young people who are prepared to go out properly equipped and with the right state of mind to share in their experience. We need to reciprocate by inviting those from the countries to which we target our efforts back here so that we can learn from them.  It is not a question of telling others.  It is a question of a learning process in which the people from the West learn from the Third World and the people from the Third World learn from us.  We must not run the risk of being global do-gooders; rather we should be known as a nation committed to learning through sharing, so that we are effective.</P>
    <P>I can speak of my own health profession. I doubt that our present training is even appropriate for the needs of the people of Ireland.  When we consider the enormous amount of medical talent that is hoarded in institutions and which I believe could be decentralised, when we have a less certified concept of progress, we might begin to see what is needed here, let alone what is needed elsewhere. We must consider in our schools and in our third level institutions the need for our students to learn important world languages &mdash; Russian, Chinese, Arabic to mention but three.  This possibility should be at least available in every region of the country.  We need to think of our teaching profession.  Are we turning out educators who are interested in processing or in development?</P>
    <P>We need to think of alternative technology and what this means.  There is no good in us going out as experts; we need <Col N="1502" /> to think of what is appropriate.  In my own profession I said recently that the tragedy was that the latest had been equated with the best, or the best with the latest, which is a fallacy.  We need to think in terms of the most appropriate wherever we operate.</P>
    <P>In talking about the languages of the world we need to know the histories of these countries because you cannot expect not to be seen as patronising when you arrive in a foreign country to instruct them if you are not able to relate to the people.  You can relate most effectively if you speak a language indigenous to the local people, or a language they can understand.  You must understand the context of the problem which you are there to particpate in solving.</P>
    <P>I would also make another appeal for the concept of national social service in Ireland.  We are very privileged people. We may be poor by European standards but we are privileged in global standards. When we leave our second level education, before we enter into the third level experience, whatever that may be, is there not some place even to raise an awareness of where we live as well as an awareness of elsewhere.  We should have a period of time where the options will be completely voluntary but where one of them at least could be an exchange with Third World countries so that we have a cadre of young people who not only see the problem on their television screens and read about it and learn about it in their churches and schools, but have been there and can bring it back home with an impact and can feel they are using the talent that has been developed here fully and for a good purpose.</P>
    <P>In summary we must, therefore, not just become Europe's greatest givers to the Third World but also Europe's most effective doers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I too compliment the Fianna Fáil Senators on bringing this motion before the Seanad.  Quite obviously everybody in this House agrees with the sentiments contained therein.  I recall that, when the first indepth television coverage of Ethiopia hit our screens, I <Col N="1503" /> was teaching in a primary school and I remember that my class discussed it during a religion lesson and they were terribly upset and worried about what they had seen.  Of their own volition they decided to hold a weekly auction every Friday.  They brought in their spare toys, books and comics and also pocket money and the various items were auctioned and the money sent to Trocaire.  There is something of an illustration there.  The sentiment was right and the effort that could be made was made.</P>
      <P>The Ethiopian question is a deeply complex one and, at base, it is a political one.  There are two million to three million people involved.  First, I will deal with Northern Ethiopia.  Senator Bulbulia mentioned that the war in Eritrea has been going on for 26 years.  It is the longest running war in Africa.  The Eritreans want to break completely with Ethiopia and have their own state.  The war in Tigre has been going on for 15 years and the people in the liberation front in Tigre want confederation.  They want to be completely autonomous but remain part of a confederate state.  Whereas the Eritreans and Tigreans do not fight with each other, they certainly do not co-operate. Then we have the effects of guerrilla warfare going on for 26 years in one place and 15 years in another.  The guerrilla warfare is now a very sophisticated type of warfare.  The Government fight a more conventional type of war.  They go out with their Migs and bomb towns and so on at various times.  The difficulty I have always had with the Ethiopian situation is to understand it fully because a great deal of the information coming out is essentially propaganda.  To get to the core of the problem is a great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking to somebody today who was in Ethiopia six weeks ago and they described the situation there.  The crops failed in December in Eastern and Mid-Eritrea. There are some crops in Western Ethiopia.  Again when food is scarce, it is always the poor who suffer.  Whereas the sentiments of the motion here are fine, the solution is a lot more difficult. You have on one hand Eastern support <Col N="1504" /> for the Ethiopian Government and on the other hand you have Western support for the liberation fronts.  We can make our representations through the EC and the United Nations, but we are talking about a very deep problem.</P>
    <P>There are analogies to be made between the situation in Ethiopia and our own situation.  What struck me when reading the motion was the word &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo;. Indeed a ceasefire in our island is to be greatly desired.  Let us be quite frank about it: we have failed to effect one.  When we talk in terms of another country we have to look at ourselves too and look at the places where we failed and see the problems we have got.  We know all about famine in this country. One million people died here and another million people emigrated in the middle part of the last century.  Famine and the havoc and suffering it can wreak are very close to the hearts of Irish people.  When we talk about political solutions, can we talk in pious tones to other nations?  That is just an aside.</P>
    <P>The person I was talking to described the northern part of Ethiopia as a virtual moonscape.  There is no growth there at all; there is no seed there.  The poorer people have sold their tools so the likelihood of another crop in December, when the crop is due for harvesting again, seems to be very unlikely.  In the port of Assab at the moment there is a half million tonnes of food.  The problem on one side is political and, on the other side, because it is political, it is one of distribution. In Western Ethiopia, the road system has been improved and can almost reach into mid-Ethiopia, the liberation fronts will say that, if the trucks bringing the relief aid are marked and distinguishable, they can go ahead without interference, but last October 18 or 20 trucks were hit by missiles.  Something between 50 and 80 trucks have been destroyed with loss of life.</P>
    <P>In its grimmest reality, it seems that the parties on both sides have a vested interest in keeping the war alive.  The liberation fronts see the winning of the war as being more important than relieving the famine.  The Government also <Col N="1505" /> want to maintain control.  It is a very difficult situation and we should not minimise it in any way.  I certainly do not envy the task of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister in trying to find some useful way in which we can contribute, and we must contribute.</P>
    <P>Where there is suffering in any nation we must concern ourselves with it, and we must make whatever contribution we can towards alleviating that suffering.  We are now faced with the likelihood of a harvest failure, in Ethiopia or possibly no harvest at all, next December.  The fact that the relief food cannot be distributed is one problem.  There is no seed, there are no land holdings and tools have been sold, and so on, to get back to a base of self-sufficiency.  If the political problems can be sorted out and consequent on that if the distribution can be sorted out, there is the whole business of building up the nation again and building up the food supplies there.  This is one area where the relief agencies here and the many volunteers who go to Third World countries have a very real role to play.  Whatever involvement there is in Ethiopia, at the end of the day we must aim towards that nation being self-sufficient with the ability to produce sufficient food for its own people and to live in peace and harmony.</P>
    <P>I hope that the motion before us will make us all think again about our country. There have been some indications in recent days that people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland are opening the doors to talk to each other.  This is to be welcomed.  The day we broke for the Christmas recess, I said that the high point for me during the previous Seanad session had been when unequivocally and without any doubt or side-tracking across this House there was outright condemnation of what happened in Enniskillen. When a horrific event like that happens, our hearts are right, our intentions are right and our energies go in the right direction.  All the problems that exist by way of oppression, suffering and famine throughout the world are interrelated. We should move forward on all fronts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> In conclusion, I again compliment the Fianna Fáil Senators on bringing this motion before us.  It is important that this House should discuss it.  Issues such as the Ethiopian problem should not only be covered on television and on radio but should be covered in the Houses of the Oireachtas so that the people who are suffering will know that we care and that we are conscious of their problems.  Issues such as this are very appropriate to the Seanad as there is more time for dealing with them in the Seanad.  It is important too in that there is an inspirational aspect here for our younger people.  We have a very idealistic young community here requiring leadership and that leadership in the first instance should emanate from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In outlining the problem here today, no speaker has come up with tangible solutions that will come into immediate effect but, by discussing this motion, we are showing our concern, mirroring the concern felt throughout the country and underlining the concern of the Irish people for suffering everywhere.  The real achievement at the end of debates such as this is that we look at all suffering.  We look at the suffering close to us just as much as we look at suffering far away.  It is easy to condemn, say, apartheid in South Africa, but to a large extent that is something we do at arms' length.  Our real sincerity and our real conviction come from a situation where we suffer, where we have to give part of ourselves, where we have to look at ideas we have held and examine them and see where a spirit of generosity can be generated to solve the various problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I join with those Senators who congratulated the Fianna Fáil group on placing this motion on the Order Paper thus giving me an opportunity to make some response and help to clarify some of the points raised.  I also thank most sincerely all the Senators for their very valuable and educational contributions.  I regard the considerable number of speakers and the serious and constructive statements <Col N="1507" /> made in the course of the debate as marking fittingly the importance which this House, representing the Irish people, accords to the task of saving the people of Ethiopia from the effects of another famine.</P>
      <P>The Government fully share the concern of Senators and are prepared to support any action or initiative which seems likely to facilitate more efficient and adequate distribution of food aid within Ethiopia.  Certainly, a ceasefire would be beneficial in this regard and the Government for their part will continue to support and participate in calls for the peaceful settlement of all disputes in the Horn of Africa.  However, I must point out that the Government's powers to intervene effectively on a unilateral basis in any of the conflicts of this region so as to bring about a ceasefire are extremely limited.  I shall return to this point later. The plight of the Ethiopian people in recent years has struck a particularly deep chord in the Irish people.  The Irish people were stirred by the terrible spectacle on the TV screens in 1984 of people &mdash; particularly children &mdash; dying from starvation and its consequences.  The magnificent contribution which the Irish people made to Band Aid and the many Irish volunteers and workers who have served and are currently serving in Ethiopia often at considerable hazard to themselves are concrete testimony of the extent to which the Irish people were touched by the fate of the people in Ethiopia. The people of few, if any other countries, have reacted with such spontaneous generosity to the horrifying spectacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, yet again, famine threatens Ethiopia. The motion before the Seanad today appeals to all concerned to do whatever is necessary to ensure that food aid is adequately distributed and calls on the Government to use their good offices to effect a ceasefire between all the forces involved.  In responding to this motion, it might be useful to begin by outlining what we know about the current food situation in Ethiopia and what has been happening <Col N="1508" /> there in recent months.  Secondly, I propose to look at how our Government and the European Community have responded to the famine in Ethiopia.  Finally, I will turn to the question of political demarches to the Ethiopian authorities and to the scope for action by Ireland in this regard.</P>
    <P>It became apparent to the international community from August 1987 that Ethiopia was once again on the brink of a severe food crisis following the almost complete failure of the harvest due to a recurrence of severe drought throughout the country.  The already precarious situation in the northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea was exacerbated by the ravages of long standing conflicts which hampered sowing in these regions.  The stark prognosis facing the country was a food deficit totalling 1.3 million tonnes and a population of up to seven million threatened by starvation.  The need for food was only one aspect of the problem.  To complicate matters the transportation network was in almost complete collapse. The roads were impassable; railway lines were in disrepair; port facilities were inadequate; the truck fleet lacked tyres, essential spare parts, fuel and maintenance and, worst of all, in the northern regions there was regular sabotage of distribution routes and food convoys.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the situation in 1984-85 when the response to famine in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa was so tragically slow, donors on this occasion responded rapidly and decisively.  International donors pledged food aid totalling more than the estimated year's requirement of 1.3 million tonnes.  Substantial quantities of this food were shipped to the country. Port unloading and storage facilities were significantly improved.  Large numbers of trucks were supplied or rehabilitated and railway lines improved.  An effective food-distribution operation involving the provision of food aid and its transportation by air and by road to local distribution centres was instituted around the end of the year and successfully provided food for growing numbers of people who, by the end of March, totalled around 1.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> A massive airlift operation was introduced by the northern region.  Despite the scale of the problem and the obstacles which had to be overcome, the relief effort appears to have succeeded up to now in averting the mass starvation that had been feared for the northern regions from the beginning of the year.  Moreover, by maintaining a regular supply of food the relief effort succeeded in avoiding the formation of camps around the food distribution centres.  However, total numbers seeking relief food supplies are estimated to jump from around 1.5 million in late March to a possible seven million in June &mdash; 3.5 million of these in the northern provinces.</P>
    <P>The anticipated scale of the problem in the northern provinces has led all participating donors to conclude that the airlift operation in respect of the north lacks the capacity to transport all the food necessary to feed these numbers and that the only way to ensure the delivery of sufficient quantities of food to the threatened populations is to secure safe passage by road.  During the first months of the current crisis the relief operation mounted in the northern war-affected regions of Eritrea, Tigre and North Wollo, operated under extremely precarious security conditions on the roads, which have resulted in the destruction of almost 100 food trucks and the death and injury of some of their crews.  Although the Ethiopian Government deployed forces to guard the main supply routes to and within the north, attacks continued and it soon became evident that those areas of the route protected by the Government forces were subject to heaviest attack.</P>
    <P>As a result of the dangerous situation on the roads and their inability to prevent attacks, the Ethiopian Government closed many of the most dangerous roads and only opened them to relief convoys on days when they felt confident that they could guarantee the safety of relief personnel.  Despite this very dangerous situation, many relief agencies, backed by many donors &mdash; including the Red Cross for example &mdash; pressed the authorities to allow them to travel on these <Col N="1510" /> routes at their own risk in order to ensure that people would continue to receive food supplies.</P>
    <P>As a result of serious military setbacks in both Eritrea and Tigre suffered by the Ethiopian Government during the latter half of March, security in these regions deteriorated to a new low.  Apart from the general hazards of being caught in a war-zone, relief personnel became victims of kidnappings and specific attacks on relief operations.  In early April the Ethiopian Government introduced a ban on foreign relief workers remaining in Eritrea and Tigre on grounds that their safety could not be ensured.  Although other motives cannot be discounted, relief workers have confirmed the very real dangers facing them as a result of the security situation and it should be noted that the Ethiopian Government did not insist that foreign development aid workers, such as teachers and water project personnel, or local relief workers, should leave these regions.  Thus the relief effort, though seriously hampered, has not been brought to a standstill and food is still being distributed through local channels such as the Catholic Relief Agency.</P>
    <P>However, the fact remains that continued and, indeed, over the next few months growing levels of food supplies will be required in these areas.  Regardless of the dangers, many relief workers and agencies are prepared to continue to operate the relief effort at their own risk and, if this is the case, it is clear that they should be allowed to do so.  To date, the food stocks delivered before the recent crisis and those continuing to arrive through local organisations appear to have succeeded in delaying the onset of mass starvation.  As these stocks dwindle and the famine-threatened population swells to the anticipated level of 3.5 million in the north over the coming weeks and months, the appalling tragedy that we witnessed in recent years could be repeated in Northern Ethiopia.  Elsewhere in Ethiopia the prospects are better since the relief effort is not being hampered as it is in the north.</P>
    <P>Having looked in some detail at the <Col N="1511" /> recent events taking place in Ethiopia, I would like to turn to the specific question of how both our Government and the European Community of which we are a member have responded to the emerging food crisis in that country.  The Government have monitored carefully the reports of crop failure and imminent famine which were released by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission of the Ethiopian Government and by the various international relief agencies from early September 1987 onwards.  The Government allocated grants totalling £370,000 from their Disaster Relief Fund in support of relief in Ethiopia in the latter part of 1987.  In addition, the Government shipped 3,386 tonnes of wheat to Ethiopia under the Food Aid Convention.  In deciding to make such an early and significant response we were influenced by the experience of 1984-85 when food aid took between five and seven months to reach the people it was intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>In determining where to direct our relief assistance we took full account of the particular situation applying in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre and of the appeal from the International Committee of the Red Cross in October 1987, following the destruction of a relief convoy in Eritrea, for international support for an &ldquo;open roads for survival&rdquo; campaign directed at all the parties to the conflict and aimed at securing free and unrestricted passage of relief supplies to the affected populations.  Accordingly, £45,000 was allocated by the Government from their Disaster Relief Fund in November 1987 to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation (UNDRO) &mdash; in respect of the emergency airlift operation they mounted to overcome the road transport problems which were hindering the distribution of relief supplies.</P>
    <P>This large scale airlift operation, which represents a very expensive means of transporting bulk food supplies, had been decided upon as a last resort when it became clear that the food aid pipeline, by road, from the port of Assab to central Tigre was suspended for security reasons <Col N="1512" /> in late 1987.  At that time road transport was able to move only 2,000 tonnes of supplies per month, at a time when the monthly food requirement of the 500,000 famine-stricken inhabitants of southern Tigre amounted to 8,500 tonnes.  By the end of January 1988 the airlift operation had shown that it was capable of delivering between 13,500 and 15,000 tonnes of food aid per month thus making it possible to build up a small emergency food stock in the area.</P>
    <P>A further grant of £45,000 was allocated to the ICRC who were at the time the only major relief organisation permitted to function in the disaster areas of Tigre and Eritrea, where the famine was expected to be at its most severe.  In a move which has the gravest implications for the inhabitants of those areas, the Government of Ethiopia in early April suspended the ICRC's relief operations in Eritrea and grounded their trucking fleet, indicating that the ICRC's function should be taken over by the Ethiopian Red Cross Society.  I earnestly hope that an appropriate solution can be worked out to ensure that the ICRC food supplies and trucks are rapidly returned to the service of the people of Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate to express my admiration for and thanks to the various Irish relief and developmental agencies which are either involved directly in humanitarian activities in Ethiopia or are providing essential funding for such activities.  I can readily vouch for the fact that they are held in the highest esteem for their professionalism and dedication by their counterparts in the community of International Aid Organisations &mdash; an esteem which, I may say, has been reflected in the contributions of Senators in this debate.  Their contribution to the international relief effort is greatly in excess of what might be expected of a country of Ireland's size and population and serves to enhance greatly Ireland's reputation among both donor and recipient countries.  The NGOs are of course an important source of information on the famine situation in Ethiopia &mdash; a fact <Col N="1513" /> referred to by many Senators, particularly Senator Bulbulia &mdash; and serve to supplement the information which the Government regularly receive from the major international relief organisations. The NGOs also perform a vital educational role with regard to the general public to whom they have imparted a highly-developed awareness of Third World needs and from whose generosity they have in turn benefited.</P>
    <P>The Government have endeavoured to support the NGOs in their humanitarian activities in Ethiopia to the extent that their resources permit.  That is reflected in the fact that over 40 per cent of the moneys allocated from the Disaster Relief Fund in respect of relief activities in Ethiopia in 1987 went to Irish NGOs, notably Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. In addition, grants totalling £147,000 were allocated to Irish NGOs in 1987 under the NGO Co-Financing Scheme in respect of development projects in Ethiopia. The projects were largely in the primary health care and rural development sectors.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse the comments made by several of the Senators who spoke on this motion last week concerning the courage and selfless dedication of volunteer relief workers who are often operating at great risk to their own lives and safety in bringing vitally needed relief assistance to famine victims within those areas of Ethiopia which are experiencing civil conflict.  The vulnerability of relief workers was highlighted by two incidents this year involving the kidnapping of Irish volunteer workers by secessionist groups. The most recent of these incidents occurred on 29 April last and involved the abduction of two Concern volunteer workers from the vicinity of the town of Jarso in south-west Ethiopia.  The Government are deeply concerned about the kidnapping of these young volunteers who were engaged in humanitarian work among the Ethiopian people and we have made known our concern to the Ethiopian authorities.</P>
    <P>Such actions serve to compound further the problems inherently involved in providing humanitarian assistance in <Col N="1514" /> Ethiopia.  I call on all parties to the conflict to respect fully the status of relief and development workers and to allow them to proceed unhindered with their humanitarian activities.  The latest information available concerning the two volunteer workers is that they are unharmed and that they are expected to be handed over safely to Concern representatives in Khartoum either today or tomorrow.  I earnestly hope that this will be the last such incident and that Concern and their fellow relief agencies will be allowed to proceed unhindered with their humanitarian work with the Ethiopian people.</P>
    <P>Turning to the role played by the European Community in the crisis in Ethiopia, I would like to comment briefly on a point raised by Senator Lydon at the opening of the debate relating to the question of Community assistance to Ethiopia under the Third Lomé Convention.  Senator Lydon expressed the hope that the 213 million ecus committed to Ethiopia under the Convention would be spent on famine relief and not on arms.  Although I am pleased to confirm that the Community have indeed mounted a rapid and efffective famine relief campaign, it is useful to clarify that the individual country aid programmes agreed under the Lomé Convention involve the provision of longer-term development assistance and not emergency assistance which is financed from a special common fund under the Convention as well as from the general Food Aid budget.  Focusing on the very grave environmental and food security problems which underlie that country's vulnerability to famine, the indicative programme for Ethiopia agreed under Lomé III provided for Community assistance to be concentrated on food security, rural development and countering environmental degradation.</P>
    <P>However, recognising that the policies of the Ethiopian authorities in the agricultural sector, especially in relation to the low pricing for agricultural products, can act as a major disincentive to food production, the Community made the allocation of funding dependent on a reform of those policies that were impeding local food production and since <Col N="1515" /> the Convention came into force in May 1986 have refused to begin work on the agreed rural programmes in the absence of the required commitment.</P>
    <P>I am happy to state that, recognising the importance of Community aid to its development, the Ethiopian Government have now agreed to reform their agricultural policies in line with Community requirements and, following a comprehensive review by the Commission on the reform programme to ensure that it did indeed meet the Community's requirements, the go-ahead has now been given for funds to be allocated to the agreed programmes.  As to any suggestion that such funds could be used for arms rather than development purposes, Senator Lydon may rest assured that there are a multitude of safeguards to ensure that Lomé funds are used directly on the agreed programmes and their use is controlled by the Community delegations on the ground.</P>
    <P>In addition to concentrating the available Lomé resources to combat the fundamental causes of famine in Ethiopia, the Community have also played a vital role in the international relief effort through its Food Aid and Emergency Assistance programmes.  From the time that the first reports of the failing harvest began to emerge in the autumn of last year, the Commission formulated plans for a rapid and effective response.  I raised the question of a comprehensive Community response to the emerging crisis with my ministerial colleagues in the Development Council in November last and was satisfied to find that the Commission had already been formulating plans to supply both emergency food aid and emergency financial assistance.  At my suggestion, all the Ministers and the Commission agreed to co-ordinate their various relief efforts to ensure that the community response was as rapid, comprehensive and effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Assistance Unit of the Commission, in co-operation with the Commission delegation in Addis Ababa, <Col N="1516" /> undertook the role of Community coordinator, acting as a channel of communication within the Community and between the Community and the other participants in the international relief campaign and holding regular meetings to discuss developments and needs. Apart from the various substantial amounts of assistance provided by the member states bilaterally, the Community to date have provided a total of 268,000 tonnes of food aid in the form of cereals, milk powder, oil and beans.  In addition, emergency cash assistance for the airlift and for storage and distribution operations of 31.55 million ecu's have been provided.  This brings the overall total in aid to date to over £90 million.</P>
    <P>The rate of supply of this assistance was carefully timed to meet the priority needs of the situation and to avoid as far as possible the creation of bottlenecks at the ports.  Fortunately, because it had been decided to channel the Community's relief assistance through the official channel of the Ethiopian RRC as well as through local church agencies, primarily the Catholic Relief and Development Agency, the Community's distribution efforts have not been affected by the recent actions by the Ethiopian authorities as seriously as many others and some Community aid is, therefore, continuing to get through to the North.  Thus, despite my early concerns, I am pleased to be able to express my satisfaction with all aspects of the Community's relief effort and to welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to the central role played by the Commission in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the call in this motion for the Government to use their good offices to effect a ceasefire between all the forces involved in the conflict in Ethiopia.  I agree fully with Senator O'Shea that the task is not an easy one.  Our first priority in all our actions, is, and has been, to ensure that all is done to see that necessary aid gets through to those who need it.  I have spoken of the rapid programme of relief instituted by the international community as a whole with a view to <Col N="1517" /> ensuring that there should be no repetition of the 1984-85 catastrophe. However, as noted, there have been several setbacks in recent months to the flow of aid to certain Northern areas in particular as a consequence of the continued conflicts within Ethiopia, particularly in the provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.  I do not have to remind the House of the enduring nature of these conflicts in Eritrea and Tigre.  Many Senators referred to the length of time the fighting has been going on.</P>
    <P>In Eritrea fighting has gone on for almost a quarter of a century between rebels who want independence and the Ethopian Army and in Tigre the fighting has continued for more than a decade over the issue of autonomy for Tigre. Many lives have been lost over the years both in the fighting and from its effects, such as the damage to infrastructure and the obstacles which the fighting has put in the way of famine relief and humanitarian aid reaching those most in need. Ethiopia has also been involved in conflict with her neighbours, Sudan and Somalia, though thankfully signs are now appearing of a genuine rapprochement between Ethiopia and Somalia, with a recently concluded agreement between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of attempts to mediate in all of these conflicts with little success in the cases of Eritrea and Tigre.  Some talks were held in 1982 regarding the future of Eritrea, but these came to nothing.  The recent agreement concluded between Ethiopia and Somalia came about only after several attempts to mediate, stretching back over a number of years and involving the OAU, Cuba, Italy and Djibouti.  Against this background it would be sanguine to believe that Ireland's good offices could achieve a ceasefire in the conflicts still raging within Ethiopia.  We do not have diplomatic relations with Ethiopia, as was mentioned by Senator Robb, and we do not have long standing ties with that country.</P>
    <P>There is some goodwill within Ethiopia on all sides towards Ireland and Irish aid workers.  One reason for this is that our <Col N="1518" /> relief effort has been seen, rightly, as humanitarian and not compromised by any political involvement.  To seek to intervene on the political level, however well intentioned, courts the risk of destroying that goodwill should one or other of the protagonists come to the conclusion, however erroneously, that Ireland favours one or other side of the conflict.  The net result of this could be actually to inflict harm on the aid effort, the success of which remains the top priority for a country such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the Government advocate doing nothing; far from it.  The Government, together with our partners in the Twelve, who include very large aid donors and also countries which traditionally, have had close links with Ethiopia, will continue to press for the peaceful solution of all conflicts in the Horn of Africa and for the maximum efficacy of the aid effort to relieve those starving or in need in Ethiopia.  Together with our partners in the Twelve we have kept the situation in Ethiopia under close review and we make known our views as appropriate to the parties concerned.  A landmark statement of Twelve policy on Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa was made by Ministers of the Twelve on 21 July 1986.  In it the Twelve urged the Governments of the region to take steps to achieve the peaceful settlement of internal conflicts and to ensure respect for human rights in their countries.  The Twelve also singled out, as of particular importance, measures to help combat further famine and to promote food security.</P>
    <P>Since then the Twelve have issued a number of statements and made demarches with regard to the situation in Ethiopia. Thus declarations were made in November and December last deploring and condemning the attacks on food convoys, calling on all sides to ensure that no obstacle is put in the way of the transportation of food aid and appealing for all those concerned to secure free passage for international relief in the drought-affected areas of Ethiopia.  Ireland has, of course, been fully associated with these <Col N="1519" /> Twelve calls and has participated fully in discussions with partners about Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>The Twelve have reacted swiftly to the decision by the Ethiopian Government in April to request expatriate relief workers to leave the provinces of Eritrea and Tigre temporarily.  The Twelve made an immediate demarche to the Ethiopian authorities in the matter and also issued a statement calling on all parties involved to find ways and means to allow such workers to return to the region if they wished to do so in circumstances of as much safety as possible in order to continue their humanitarian work.  At the same time, and on a happier note, the Twelve made demarches in both Addis Ababa and Mogadishu expressing satisfaction with the recently concluded agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia.</P>
    <P>The European Commission made a separate demarche to the Ethiopian authorities regarding the position of expatriate relief workers.  The United Nations have made approaches also to the Ethiopians and the UN Secretary General is scheduled to visit Ethiopia this week and will visit UN relief operations in the northern provinces.  It is to be anticipated that the international community will continue to press for adequate access for relief to those in need.  The Government will support all such efforts and any other efforts which seem to us likely to achieve results in terms of ensuring that aid reaches all those in need.  This seems to the Government the most appropriate way to proceed having regard to our capacity for influencing events in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer briefly to one or two specific points made by Senators during the course of the debate.  In reply to Senator Bulbulia, I certainly will do all I can to ensure that our aid contribution is as it was last year but, as she knows, that is a budgetary matter and something over which I have very little control.  Senator Robb made a number of suggestions.  Some of the suggestions he made are already in operation. We generally seek that our relief <Col N="1520" /> workers and those who are employed on the bilateral aid scheme have the language of the country they are going to, except where English is widely spoken. We try in the main to support only schemes which have a real relevance to the economy of the small local areas because we feel this is where the best efforts can be made and where the best results can come from.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made clear the commitment of the Government to working to assist and support the relief effort to the best of our abilities.  I hope I have outlined sufficiently the scope of the Twelve's assistance to Ethiopia and their on-going attentiveness on the political front and of the efforts made to get their message across to all those concerned. The situation in Ethiopia is potentially tragic and there is still a long way to go before it is put right, but it is possible to see certain slight grounds for optimism in some recent developments.</P>
    <P>The moves I referred to above to alter agricultural policy so as to increase prices paid to farmers and a liberalisation of the internal grain market which were announced in February could help Ethiopia's food situation in the mid-term and have been welcomed by outside donor agencies such as the Community.  There have been announcements regarding the resumption of the resettlement programme which have stressed that its operation will be strictly on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned by Senator Lydon in his speech, an announcement was made during the past four days that a number of members of the Ethiopian royal family who had been imprisoned for many years have been released under an amnesty. These are signs that the Government of Ethiopia must listen to and absorb constructive comment from outside.  I appeal to the United States and the USSR to use their considerable influence in this area to see that the work which is being carried on to get food aid to those who want it is successful.  It is my earnest hope that all sides to the conflict in Ethiopia will heed those voices from outside, including that of Ireland, and work to ensure that relief gets through and that the threatened <Col N="1521" /> catastrophe does not take place.  I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this motion.  The interest shown by them, by the other Senators who signed the motion and by others, who, because of the time constraints of a three hour debate could not contribute, is a very accurate reflection of the deep concern about this issue which is felt not just in this House but in the country as a whole. It is a concern which I hope will be reflected in other Parliaments.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who commended me for having brought this motion before the House.  I am grateful for their kind comments but I am not really looking for either kind comments or compliments.  What I am looking for is action, because as I said last week, as we talk, human beings starve.  The 25 year-old war in Ethiopia has claimed almost 500,000 lives and, as long as it goes on, the Ethiopian people will starve. They starve not only because of the recurrent drought but also because they are victims of a war between Eritrean and Tigrean separatists and the Marxist Government in Addis Ababa.  Some six million people are at risk at present, but what of the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the World Bank, population growth is outstripping food production at such a rate that by the year 2000 some 14 million people will be at risk.  It is extremely doubtful that the world's relief agencies could cope with a problem of this magnitude.  This need not happen.  We, and the other member states of the EC can, should and must put pressure on all those involved in the conflict to effect a ceasefire.  As Senator Bradford said, the rebel forces have agreed to a ceasefire and let us, therefore, continue to call on the Ethiopian Government to agree likewise.  Let us insist that all aid is carefully monitored.  Concerted pressure and the monitoring of aid by outside impartial agencies may be our two most effective weapons in combating this appalling crisis.  Pressure does seem <Col N="1522" /> to work because, as the Minister said, members of Halie Selassie's family were released last week.  There are still thousands incarcerated and we hope they will be released eventually also.</P>
    <P>In regard to the monitoring process, I particularly welcome the Minister's statement and I accept his assurances.  Last week I challenged him to respond to this debate in a strong manner.  That he has certainly done and the contents of his statement give us grounds for hope.  I did not expect such a lengthy, comprehensive and positive statement and I am deeply grateful to him for it.  Finally, I thank the Leader of the House for having made time available for this important debate.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that he wishes to raise the following Adjournment Matter: the bringing into operation of the Cork free port regulations by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I call Senator Cregan and I remind him that he has 20 minutes and the Minister has ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me an opportunity to bring this matter before the House.  I first brought it before the House last June and at that time the Minister for the Marine informed the House that the regulations which would set up the free port in Cork would be in operation some time between October and November. Since then a lot has been said about the free port and a lot of words have been pushed around in regard to the benefit it would be to the Cork-Kerry region.  This proposal was first mooted in 1983 but we <Col N="1523" /> found it hard to get the previous Government to implement the regulations.</P>
      <P>What would this mean for the Cork-Kerry region and for the designated free zoned area of Cork which has been legislated for?  The impression might be given that the Government are considering the idea of including other areas in the Cork port area as free zoned areas.  The 1986 Bill provides that any area within the port of Cork can be designated a free port area.  This argument is being strongly pushed by the Government and I fail to understand why that argument cannot stand up when the legislation says any part of the port of Cork can be designated as a free port area.</P>
      <P>The impression is being given that a free port may not be as trustworthy or solid as we make it out to be.  Since we proposed the idea of a free port, our neighbours across the water in Britain have implemented free port areas in six different regions and these have been working for the past 18 months.  The port in Liverpool, which is no more than 60 miles from this country, as the crow flies, is proof of what a free port area can do. Over £1 million a week has been turned over in that area during the past 15 months.  Unfortunately we have a despondent attitude towards getting work moving and in believing that we can do it.  We are the first port of call for those people from the western world who export to Europe as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past ten to 12 years, over £120 million has been spent by various Governments on the infrastructure in the Ringaskiddy area.  It has a deep water berth, for which there were strong arguments over the past three or four years, which was built at a cost of £10.5 million. Another £2 million will be spent shortly on the purchase of heavy cranes to assist with unloading.  The water structure in the Ringaskiddy area can supply over 25 million gallons of water every day.  We are constantly arguing and debating as to who should be working the free port area and whether it should exist at all.  In actual fact, we can see that the proof of the pudding is in the eating when we look <Col N="1524" /> at what is happening in Liverpool.  The Government in Britain had no intention of establishing any free zoned areas until the idea was proposed by the Irish Government.  The very same has happened in relation to the national lottery. The previous Government here pushed the idea of the national lottery and now the Government in Britain are looking at it too because they know a good thing when they see it.  The proof that the free port is a good idea can be seen from what is happening in Liverpool where after only 15 months over £1 million per week is being turned over in that area.</P>
    <P>We have had on-going arguments with the previous Government and with this Government as to what kind of facilities and benefits should be allowed in the free zoned area of Cork.  There is a free zoned area in Shannon and the Dublin Port and Docks Bill, which was pushed through at a very fast pace, will allow financial institutions to set up on the Dublin Customs House Docks site.  Benefits, which I do not object to, were given in the Dublin Port and Docks Bill to the financial institutions who will set up in the Dublin region.  The benefit they got in relation to corporation tax for work done on computers or machines means that they will pay 10 per cent only on their corporate gains.</P>
    <P>We sought benefit for the Cork region but in no circumstances would it be considered. Even the former Government would not, in any circumstances, give this 10 per cent benefit in corporation tax to the Cork region which applies to flights into Shannon and to financial institutions in Dublin.  If the benefits are given to an airport structure in the Shannon region and to a financial structure in the Dublin region, there is no reason why the same benefits should not be given to a port and docks structure in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware that the Cork-Kerry region could do with some benefits and motivation.  The argument made by the last Government was that in no circumstances could it be done because EC regulations said it could not be done.  Yet, within the past 12 months a Bill was laid before both Houses which <Col N="1525" /> will give the people in the Dublin port and docks area the 10 per cent corporation tax benefit.  Why can this same benefit not be given to the Cork-Kerry region, and to the Cork region in particular?  We should allow people to set up their businesses in a port area like the one in Liverpool where all gains, whether they be in the service area or in the manufacturing area, would only be liable to 10 per cent tax, which applies in Shannon and Dublin.  I know the Minister does not come from the Dublin region but I am sure he realises the amount of money that will be made by the financial institutions in the Dublin Ports and Docks area and that they will pay only 10 per cent corporation tax on this.  Enormous profits will be made by those institutions.  From a manpower point of view these benefits will not be as great as they would have been if they had been given to the Cork-Kerry region.  I am talking about physical work and what going to work means to people. It would mean a lot to those people if they were told they would have to pay only 10 per cent tax on their corporate gains, whether they be in the services area or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the port of Cork we have built deep water berths at a cost of over £10.5 million which can cater for 70,000 tonne ships. That facility should be available to ships so that their goods can be unloaded in Cork rather than waste time going up the English Channel to try to get into the main ports of Europe.  This can mean long delays for heavy ships and they do not like this.  They like to be on open seas getting work done rather than being delayed in port.  Heavy ships can be unloaded at Cork and the cargo can be transhipped in smaller boats to other ports in Europe.  That means there would be trans-shipment and double work going on and that is what I want to see.  If they were given the 10 per cent benefit on corporation tax this would be an enormous benefit for them.</P>
    <P>Why is this benefit not being given to the Cork area?  Why is it given to Shannon and Dublin but in no circumstances, even with all the arguments I have made, will it be considered for the Cork area?  The <Col N="1526" /> reason I am pushing this so strongly is that after long arguments with the previous Government and this Government, they now admit they are prepared to give this benefit to the Dublin region.  I do not object to this because the amount of money that will be made there will be enormous in comparison to other regions.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the workings of the free port and the delays with the regulations. Discussions are going on between the Cork Harbour Commissioners and Government officials and I think the question must be asked: what motivation do the harbour commissioners have and what ability do they have to work this kind of facility?  I admit that when the Bill was first moved the harbour commissioners were under orders from the Government of the day to advertise for people to get involved with them in the working of the free port facility.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that private and public sector people should be working together to get this free port moving.  In other words, the private sector should get involved.  The private sector within the Cork region who are already involved in customs clearance or in bonded facilities should get involved in the free port area. Certain acreage in the Cork region was designated for the working of the free port but unfortunately I get the impression from central Government and the harbour commissioners that no consideration was given to the idea of involving the private sector in this.  I do not think that is wise.  I do not have capitalist ideas nor do I think that the private sector should get all the money but in areas like this you need motivation and people who will put money up front and say: &ldquo;We are going to run this properly, sell it properly and market it properly so that we can get our money back as fast as possible&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister what consideration is being given to this or is it considered that the harbour commissioners only should work it?  If that is so, I do not think it is wise.  The harbour commissioners have been having discussions with Department officials for the past three years and I am well aware <Col N="1527" /> that up to now nothing constructive has happened.  The main reason for this is that they will still get their cheques at the end of the month so they do not have to rush in coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>We want people who have motivated ideas.  We want people who say: &ldquo;If we put £1 million into this we will make sure we get it back in ten years and we will sell it properly&rdquo;.  I know that submissions were made by the private sector in Cork to central Government.  These submissions contained excellent ideas and the people involved put a lot of consideration and investigation into the workings of free ports in other regions.  I know that the submissions they gave to the harbour commissioners to give to central Government were excellent ones.  I do not wish to knock any person or board but I am afraid the harbour commissioners will steal the thunder or knowledge of the private sector and use it to benefit themselves.  Harbour authorities have a responsibility to say there are some things about which they know nothing.  They may know something about tying up a ship, the tonnage of a ship and how to get the harbour dues from it, but I do not think the harbour commissioners should be working it on their own.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that we have a free zoned area and not a free port in the Cork region.  I ask the Minister to give us a solid and constructive reply and to say whether or not we are going backwards or forwards; whether they are considering it; or whether they are going to throw it out.  Over £1 million a week is being turned over in the free port in Liverpool.  They stole our thunder.  Why were we not to the front in moving on this?  Why is it that in relation to other good ideas the British Government have already moved but we have not yet moved?  This is a disgrace and it is immoral.  We have a responsibility to answer to somebody.  Legislation on this was passed in 1986, two years ago, but still nothing has happened.  I do not wish to get too uptight about this issue but I would appreciate it if the Minister could <Col N="1528" /> give a constructive reply to this issue, one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just short of 12 months since Senator Cregan last raised this matter in the House.  At that time I dealt in detail with the Free Ports Act, 1986, which he referred to, and the orders and regulations to be made thereunder before the free port could become operational.  I believe that some repetition on this matter would be worth while.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Free Ports Act, 1986, which is an enabling Act, was to enable the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.  The principal features required under the Free Ports Act, 1986, to set up a free port at Ringaskiddy are that, first the Minister for the Marine must, with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, by order establish the limits of the free port.  Secondly, the Minister for the Marine, again with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, must by order designate the person or persons to control and manage the free port which is a point I will refer to later.  The Minister for the Marine may, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, grant licences authorising the carrying on of businesses within the free port.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has to make regulations providing for the necessary customs control in relation to the free port.  The Revenue Commissioners must make regualtions under the VAT Acts with the approval of the Minister for Finance to give effect to the concessions as regards value-added tax for the free port. An order bringing the Act into operation on 1 July 1987 was made by the Minister for the Marine in June of last year shortly after the debate here in the House.  I presume it was coincidental but, if Deputy Cregan feels it was as a result of his raising it here, I have no intention of taking that from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations relating to customs control were made by the Minister for <Col N="1529" /> Finance in July 1987.  The regulations relating to VAT concessions were made by the Revenue Commissioners, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, in October 1987.  Before the order to establish the free port at Ringaskiddy can be made, it is necessary to decide the area to be included in the free port.  This matter of deciding on the area to be included in the free port has been the subject of on-going and wide-ranging discussions with the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, Cork Harbour Commissioners and some existing industries in the Ringaskiddy area.  While the Senator referred to the Minister pushing other areas, I would remind him that the Minister is not pushing other areas.  It is the local interests who are proposing other areas.  Being the Government that we are, we are interested in consultation all the time and, rather than taking decisions for the sake of taking decisions, we are prepared to consult at all times.</P>
    <P>One must appreciate and I think nobody more than the Senator will appreciate that with the number of interests involved, it takes some time to get agreement.  I do not believe we should take a decision for the sake of taking a decision without full consultation with the various interests that I have referred to.  An area proposed for inclusion has to be inspected and agreed with the local customs people.  Problems have already arisen particularly in relation to the fact that the Industrial Development Authority &mdash; we are proposing to include all of their lands&mdash;found it necessary to review their proposal and eventually to exclude a number of areas.  Also at a late date existing industries at Ringaskiddy sought inclusion in the free port and this necessitated further consultation.  Furthermore, the Community directive in relation to free zones is also at present under review and, under revised proposals, free zones will require to be fenced.  Ireland is the only member state of the twelve that has maintained a reserve on this requirement. I believe we should maintain this <Col N="1530" /> reserve.  One must appreciate the cost of fencing some 700 acres of free port area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we going to designate the whole area then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of fencing a large area such as that proposed for Ringaskiddy, depending on the type of fencing finally required, could be prohibitive. For this reason we are endeavouring to have fencing restricted to occupied free zone areas.  According as an industry is set up, it should be fenced on that basis, but this is not what the Community directive states.  It states that under the present directive all of it should be fenced at the one time but hopefully there could be a derogation as far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that agreement on the lands to be included is now in sight. I am not talking about June of next year. It is now in sight.  The Minister should be in a position to make the order establishing Ringaskiddy free port in the near future.  It is envisaged that this will encompass an area in excess of 700 acres. The Minister has examined a number of options as regards management of the free port and will be consulting his colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, on this proposal very soon.</P>
      <P>In relation to the management structure which the Senator referred to, several options regarding management are being considered including the involvement of the private sector or, indeed, a combination of public and private interests.  I will give a categorical assurance to the Senator that his views on the private sector will be taken into account fully when a decision is being reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first free sea port in the country.  Many other parts of the country are looking with interest at developments there.  While the Senator referred to Liverpool and while I have no wish to suggest that his information is anything but correct I would have to say that my information generally, not on a specific one, in relation to free ports in the UK is that they have not been the success that <Col N="1531" /> was expected.  Of course, this will not deter this Government from forging ahead with the development of the free port at Ringaskiddy bearing in mind, as the Senator has pointed out, the serious unemployment problem which we have in the Cork-Kerry region.  The Government are fully committed, despite what the Senator may have said, to the free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the 10 per cent in relation to services.  We have had, as had the previous Government and the Minister responsible at that time, the Minister for Communications, discussions with the Department of Finance. Since the debate in this House I have had discussions with the Department of Finance.  The position still stands, as far as they are concerned, that most of these lands at Ringaskiddy are owned by the IDA and should be on the basis that we are trying to attract industry into that region.  I accept the parallels that are being drawn between this and Dublin. Incidentally it is not owned by the Dublin Port and Docks.  It is not part of the Dublin Port and Docks now, it is the Custom House Docks.  That 10 per cent is available there.</P>
    <P>We will be extremely anxious and will be pursuing every avenue to entice industrialists into the Ringaskiddy area, an area where there is a deep water port which is very advantageous for those importing raw materials to process them and re-export them.  In a situation like that, there will be no question of any VAT at all if they are being re-exported. If they are being exported out of there into another part of the State, VAT becomes a problem at that time only. That is information that is well known. Other areas of the country are looking very closely at Ringaskiddy.  We are anxious to get Ringaskiddy operative as quickly as possible.  I am confident that it will assist and reduce the serious unemployment problems in the south and particularly in the Cork-Kerry region.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House that positive steps have been taken. There have been a few hiccups but <Col N="1532" /> Senators can take it that my Minister and I have taken a personal interest in this since taking office in March 1987.  I am looking forward to the setting up of this port in the reasonably near future.  I am confident that Cork will have its free port in the near future.  Once this free port has been established, the Government, through the IDA, will be promoting it very strongly in co-operation with local interests.  It is within the brief of the Minister for the Marine to set this up.</P>
    <P>Of course the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Finance are involved and the IDA will be promoting this, but our Department will certainly be promoting it as well.  Cork would be an ideal location for marine-related activities where people could take their reefer boats, not with raw materials because we have our own indigenous raw materials here.  I foresee, with the development of the fishing industry which we have in mind, that there are general options there.  I can assure the Senator and the House that my Minister and I will be vigorously pursuing this and I hope that we will have progress to report in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister.  He has been very constructive and fair and very much aware of what is happening in the Cork region.  The argument being put to the Department of Finance regarding the 10 per cent is vital.  If we are prepared to have it in Dublin and we have given it to Shannon, to give 10 per cent to the services area in Cork would be enormous.  Imagine the trans-shipment of goods going to the mainland of Europe, coming to Cork at 10 per cent, setting up their warehousing in Cork rather than manufacturing.  For instance, what if we had the distribution of televisions from Japan?  If we could see 10 per cent being given in areas like this, it would be enormous.  This is vital and it is one of the main points in selling Cork as a region.  The Minister has been talking with the Department of Finance but an argument should be made regarding the 10 per cent there.  Dublin is going to be very good.  It will mean a lot to <Col N="1533" /> Dublin, especially when Hong Kong is going the other way.  It would mean a lot to Cork from a shipping point of view. As regards the railing, if the Minister is considering the idea that 700 acres should be designated, it would be enormous. Indeed, the Minister is broadening his mind much more than I am as somebody who pushed it in the first place.  I anticipated smaller regions and adding to them gradually.  If the Minister is saying that the whole area should be designated and railed off that would incur an enormous cost.  The idea of each area railing itself off when it is designated would be better and then you could have one compound gate.</P>

      <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners accepted the package at the time, which included 10 per cent for manufacturing industry and excluded 10 per cent for the services industries.  The <Col N="1534" /> bulk of the land there would be owned by the IDA and they would be looking at it with a view to manufacturing industry. However, I want to be able to come back to this House in six or 12 months' time and debate this again without giving any commitment.  At all times I take into consideration the views of Senators in this House and Deputies in the other House because I feel that locals will have a particular interest in it and they are familiar with the area.  I would not mislead this House or use it as a cosmetic exercise.  I take very seriously into consideration the points raised by the Senator and I will speak further with the Department of Finance.  Again, next time around, I want to be able to look the Senator straight in the face without giving any commitment.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 May 1988.</P>
