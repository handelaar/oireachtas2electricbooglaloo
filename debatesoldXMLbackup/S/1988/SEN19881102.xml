      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion of the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>That funds from the national lottery be made available as a matter of urgency for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin recently destroyed by fire.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Norris as suitable for discussion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>We will take Item Nos. 1, 2 and 51.  Item No. 51 is a Fine Gael motion.  We have agreed to take that motion for not more than half an hour. It will be taken after Item No. 2 and then we will go on to Items Nos. 3 and 4. There may be a problem that Item No. 3 will run until 5.30 p.m. and if that happens we will not take Item No. 4 today. We will take Item No. 5 at 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the order of Business, may I first on behalf of my own party, and I am sure others, wish the Taoiseach a fast and speedy recovery to <Col N="350" /> full health?  I would like to thank the Acting Leader of the House for agreeing to take Item No. 51.  I think it would be appropriate that this matter be discussed briefly today.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have to raise the question of what my party regard as the serious mismanagement of the public business of the House by the Leader of the House.  Today's Order Paper might be acceptable at the end of a hard week's session on legislation.  The motions are important, but not as a first offering after such a very lengthy period of absence of the Seanad.  It is disgraceful that we have no legislation before us today.  The fact that we have no legislation is directly and solely the fault of the Government, but it is also the fault of the Leader of the House.  The Dáil Order Paper at present is weighed down with legislation from this House.  The Companies Bill, the Insurance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you think you have made your point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not because it is an important point.  I will make it briefly and I will stick to the point.  The Dáil Order Paper at the moment is weighed down with legislation from this House, yet in the past couple of weeks the four new Bills which have been published by the Government have all been introduced in the Dáil.  Surely the Leader of the House and the Government Chief Whip must talk to each other.  Surely they could arrange that some of these Bills could have been brought in in this House and we would have legislation before us today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, we got a promise from the Leader of the House many weeks ago that we would have a full list of legislation which this House could expect to have before the autumn session.  The Leader of the House said this not once but a number of occasions.  It has not happened, either because there is no such list or because the Leader of the House has not bothered to get it for us.  The Opposition are entitled to the basic courtesy of knowing what business has been planned <Col N="351" /> and what business it can expect.  In the absence of this basic courtesy we have no alternative but to register the strongest protest possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of Item No. 6 on today's Order Paper, the motion dealing with Anglo-Irish relations.  At the present time the operations of the Anglo-Irish Agreement are being reviewed. Already the Northern Ireland Secretary has seen fit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning, you can raise the point but you cannot make a speech on it.  No one knows better the rules of this House than you, Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at the moment &mdash; I will make it very briefly &mdash; is that widespread consultations are taking place with groups outside Parliament on the future operations of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At the very least it is appropriate that this House be given the opportunity for its Members to voice their views on the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and I would earnestly urge the Acting Leader of the House to make it possible to have a debate on Item No. 6 at the earliest possible moment.  I ask him to give a specific date if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what the Leader of the Opposition has said in relation to the deliberations with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It would be absolutely appalling if conclusions are reached before this House has had an opportunity to debate the issue.  As I understand it, contributions are being collected at present in Northern Ireland and there will be some presentation made early in the New Year.  In the meantime, I hope we are not going to procrastinate to the point where the Members of this House do not have the opportunity to contribute ideas to the debate so that out of it we will get something better than the present stalemate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the good wishes to the <Col N="352" /> Taoiseach for his speedy return.  On Item No. 51 which is being taken today, it seems that this term is beginning like the last term end, while I certainly welcome the fact that this motion is being taken, it would have been nice to know beforehand so that speakers could have prepared themselves for it.</P>
      <P>On the question of mismanagement or otherwise of the House raised by Senator Manning, certainly it is a cause of some concern at this stage that at a time when this House is open to criticism from outside we should be seen, as I see it, to almost abrogate our duty towards legislation. We have asked for and got from the Leader of the House absolute assurances that there would be a programme for legislation available to us which would take us from here until Christmas.  We have now seen over the past number of weeks a number of Bills, five or six in all, between the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, Jurisdiction of Courts (Maritime Conventions) Bill, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill, the Turf Development Bill, the Local Government (Amendment) Bill and the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Bill.  All these have been published in the past number of weeks and all are on their way towards being dealt with in the Dáil, which is already trying to deal with massive volumes of legislation, some of which was initiated here.  There are six more Bills being presented in the next month or so which, it is my understanding, will also be inititated in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We leave ourselves wide open to charges of abrogating our responsibility, to charges of being irrelevant in fact, and I put it very plainly at the door of the Government for not properly organising the legislative programme for this House. I could not put it more strongly and I think it is something that will be raised again and again.  It is very regrettable.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to place on the record of the House our congratulations to a Member of this House, Senator Norris, who has taken a case on behalf of minorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the Order of Business here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the complaints made by my colleagues about the unprofessional way in which business is being ordered here. Why is it necessary, for example, that we should have to extract information from the Leader of the House as to whether we are sitting tomorrow?  Inevitably, that question will be asked later on, but any competent presentation of the Order of Business should include that information.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I recognise Fianna Fáil's right to choose whatever motion they want for discussion.  Indeed, the Irish charities motion is very worthwhile but I must add my voice to that of Senator Manning's in deploring the persistent refusal to discuss Item No. 6, which has slipped again badly in the charts &mdash; I recall it was Item No. 2 some time ago.</P>
      <P>Months and months ago we were told that this item would be discussed shortly. There were always plausible excuses put forward as to why it would not be discussed. There was always some turn in Anglo-Irish relations that did not make it appropriate, we were told.  I went along with some of those excuses.  Now we are told that the review of the workings of the agreement is happening today and that that makes it inexpedient to discuss the proposal.  All of this, I think, brings us to the irresistible conclusion that the reason the Government will not discuss this motion is that they do not want to be embarrassed by the ambivalent opinions, and some not so ambivalent opinions, of the Fianna Fáil Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the criticism of the way the business of this House is being conducted.  It is not justified. I have been a Member of previous Seanads and more legislation has been initiated in this Seanad than in previous Seanads.  I am sure other Members of the House will agree with me.  I think this is the most effective Seanad and instead of criticising him, Members should be congratulating the Leader of the Seanad <Col N="354" /> for the manner in which he is conducting business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to take issue with that.  Anybody who wants to check the records of the two previous Seanads will find that they show the statement by the Senator is not correct.</P>
      <P>For the interest of those Members who are not members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we had the same debate we are having today at last week's meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Each one of us, including in fairness the Government Members, wanted to ensure that this House would deal with legislation.  We are all of the unanimous opinion that the Leader of the House would request the Government that all Bills which were not money Bills would be initiated here simply because the House has the facility to deal with them and is not obsessed with the debate on Estimates and all sorts of other political motions that go on in another place.  We are suggesting to Senator Ryan, acting as Leader of the House, that we would follow through on the case we made last week that all non-money Bills would be taken initially here so that they could be dealt with properly before Christmas.  That will relieve some of the pressure on the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a small and, I hope, positive contribution.  That is to welcome the fact that Item No. 4 on the Order Paper appears to be going to be taken today.  I welcome particularly the positive and constructive approach of the Government in using some of their own time to take this very important motion.  I would, however, like some clarification from the Acting Leader of the House because there appeared to be some doubt as to whether we would actually reach it today.  I would like to know if it thought likely that it will be reached today and, if not, if I can have an assurance that it will be taken as soon as possible, that is, tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome wholeheartedly all those <Col N="355" /> motions which are being taken today by the Government.  I would like to congratulate them on having the initiative to actually find these motions to dicuss, having scrampled around all the way down the Order Paper.  The reason we are discussing them is because there is nothing else to discuss.  Let us be honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not repetition.  I will make a new point.  I am very thankful to the Seanad electoral system, to God, and to anybody else I need to be thankful to, that there is no member of the progressive Democrats in this House at the moment because the Progressive Democrats would be having a field day here today because this House is impotent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the first point. I am coming to the Order of Business.  It is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, that is what you got up to speak about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three more points to make.  There is no legislation on the Order of Business today because of the Government's attitude to this House. The Government are treating this House with contempt because there is no legislation. Secondly, the Government passed in record time at the last meeting, when some of us were absent &mdash; but it reads very badly in the record &mdash; the Report <Col N="356" /> Stage of the Companies Bill in one day. Senator Kiely quite rightly said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That last remark is unfair; withdraw it.  If you were not here to participate in the debate on the Companies Bill you are not in a position to judge what the Government did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Withdraw that last remark, out of respect to the whole Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot withdraw a remark which states that the Government passed it in one day.  It passed it in one day.  That is a fact.  I cannot withdraw that.  The point I want to make is this: that was passed in one day because there were so few Government speakers.  The Government should not come here and say it has been great legislation when they are making no contribution to it when it comes to this House.</P>
      <P>The last point I would like to make is with regard to Northern Ireland.  I am tired of making points about a debate on Northern Ireland but this is an ideal opportunity today, when we have got four or five items on the Order Paper, to take a whole day on Northern Ireland. The fact is we are being backed away from Northern Ireland for some reason and we are not being allowed to discuss it.  That needs to be put on the record. Finally &mdash; I am sure you are going to correct me on this &mdash; I would like to place on the record my congratulations to Senator Norris for his great success in Europe last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, it was not the Government who put through the Companies Bill in one day; it was the Seanad.  If Senator Ross was concerned about it he should have been here to ensure it would go right.</P>

      <P>In connection with Item No. 4, the usual procedure would be that each speaker would have only 15 minutes but I am proposing that, notwithstanding Standing Order 41, Item No. 4 will not be subject to a time limit.  Senator Norris asked if I could see it coming up today.  I cannot because the items ahead of it might continue on until 5.30 p.m.  If that happens, we will not take it today and we are not sitting tomorrow.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reference to the Anglo-Irish Agreement by Senator Manning and others, it was my intention to speak to the Tánaiste this morning about it, but he had gone to Belfast in connection with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I am not saying it would be taken today anyway because I do not think today would be the appropriate day to take it when they are already having talks in other higher places.  The only guarantee I can give is that I will speak to the Tánaiste this evening or tomorrow to see when we will take this debate on the Anglo-Irish Agreement because I am sure we will take it in due course.</P>
      <P>With regard to legislation and promises made here some time ago, we thought we would have legislation for today's sitting. We have not got it, but we will have it for the future.  Next week we will have the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill because I understand it will be passed in the Dáil today or tomorrow. I have been told we will get Bills from the Government in the very near future. The first one will be the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1988.  We may have that next week. Today is the only day we do not have Government business.</P>

      <P>That may happen, too. It would not be of interest to this House; it would be of more interest to the other House.  There may be a few Senators who have ambitions to go the other House.  I am sure we will get that in due course.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy asked why he had to extract information about business by asking questions in this House.  As far as I am concerned the business we have every week is forwarded to the Whip of the Independents Group and it is up to the Independents secretary to tell his members, or should I ask my secretary to give six letters of the Order of Business every week to the Independent Senators? If they want it that way we will try to accommodate them.  I do not think we are expected to give the Order of Business for next week or the week after.  It is only today's business we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>This order complies with the EC Fourth Council Directive on summer time.  This is an instrument which seeks to har-monise the summer time period throughout EC member states.  It is the fourth order of this type.  The previous orders were approved by the House on 11 March 1981, 9 March 1983 and 12 March, 1986.</P>
      <P>The principal effect of the order is that the summer time period will begin one week later in 1989 than is prescribed in the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 (No. 17 of 1971).  That means we will have a similar period of summer time in 1989 as we have had for the past eight years.  A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time to summer time, and <i>vice versa,</i> will be 1 o'clock in the morning Greenwich Mean Time rather than 2 o'clock as provided for in the 1971 Act. The actual summer time period in 1989 will be from 26 March to 29 October.</P>
      <P>The reasoning behind this order and the three previous similar orders, is that the Commission considers that the harmonisation of the summer time period in the member states would help the efficiency of transport, communications, commerce and contacts generally throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions with a view to standardising the summer time provisions in EC member states have been in train for several years.  There are various problems including, of course, the fact that natural time in this country and in the United Kingdom is substantially different from that in many of the continental member states.  While the Commission would prefer a common date for beginning and <Col N="360" /> ending summer time in all member states, it acknowledges that all the elements necessary for determining the date for the end of summer time are not available at present.  The Commission, therefore, are prepared to continue the current arrangement in 1989.  This, in effect, means that the summer time period in 1989 in the continental member states will end one month earlier than in Ireland and United Kingdom, that is, on the last Sunday of September instead of the last Sunday in October.</P>
    <P>This is a most favourable arrangement from this country's point of view as we have always favoured as long a summer time period as possible and the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act 1971, were in favour of having our summer time period synchronised with that of the United Kingdom.  Continental member states have always favoured a shorter summer time period.</P>
    <P>So far there is no directive in force for the period after 1989 but, in accordance with the terms of the Fourth Directive, the Council must adopt such a directive by 1 January 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in their right mind would oppose this order, but I would like to put one question to the Minister.  Why is it that the 1971 Act cannot be amended in such a way as to provide for this annual change which takes place?  This is the fourth year in a row where we have had to go through this.  It is an unnecessary waste of time. It appears to me that the 1971 Act should be amended in order to encompass this change on an annual basis in order to bring us in to line with what is happening in Europe.  Apart from that, it is obviously something which is highly commendable from the point of view of energy saving, even from the point of view of the tourist industry, where the longer days are important, and for a variety of other reasons, bringing us into line with continental Europe.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Toole on the question of <Col N="361" /> amending the Principal Act.  I would also like to ask the Minister the basis for his statement in the penultimate paragraph of his speech where he said that the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, gave a certain view.  I am curious to know when that consultation took place and what was the result.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Toole has said, one would not wish to give the impression that one was opposing this motion, but I, too, am a little perplexed about some areas of the Minister's speech; for example, statements that all the elements for determining the date for the end of summer time are not available at present.  I have been following the debate on this issue within the European Community over the past 18 months to two years in a rather peripheral way. Perhaps the Minister could clarify exactly what this Government's position is in the context of these ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>Also if my information is correct, it seems that we in the western part of the European Community may be forced ultimately to harmonise with the continental time systems, which might cause enormous difficulties, for example, for the farming community in this country.  I know that there are plans afoot in the United Kingdom for concessions to be made in this area.  I am anxious for the Minister to clarify the Government's position in relation to the ongoing discussions at European Commission level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 1971 Act, in view of the fact that the discussions on harmonisation are ongoing and have been so for some time and a decision has not yet been reached, we consider it an unnecessary and a highly inappropriate procedure to adopt, to change an Act to take account of the current situation before the harmonisation discussions are completed <Col N="362" /> and then have to introduce further legislation to take account of the directives or decisions arising from those discussions.</P>
      <P>On the second question, the basis of the statement of consultation, I understand that public notices appeared asking people to give their views and views were expressed in that manner in response to these requests.</P>
      <P>The third question was from Senator Mooney in relation to the Government's position on harmonisation.  I would refer to that part of my opening remarks where I said that we here in Ireland &mdash; and that means the Government &mdash; are maintaining the same stance, that we would prefer and we will insist in so far as we can, on maintaining the longest possible Summer Time.  That is in the opening statement and that is our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult about this but I do think it an undesirable practice that a Minister should come in and make a statement about widespread consultation without indicating the nature of the consultation, the result of the consultation and when it took place, especially when it appears that some sort of public notices were posted and people were asked to reply.  I am not asking for the information now but I do think it is undesirable that a general statement like this be made when the evidence for it is not put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that this seems to me to be a small technical adjustment and I do not think it is a matter on which there need be a very wide-ranging debate.  However, I think I am right in saying that Members of this House did not receive any substantial briefing material in advance of this notice appearing in the Order Paper and that makes it difficult for us to appreciate precisely any hidden implications there may be and makes it quite difficult to talk with any seriousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am correct in this &mdash; perhaps such an item was missed by me in the internal post simply through the fact that there is such a large volume of correspondence &mdash; I would like, in future, if for example, <Col N="363" /> even a brief statement such as the Minister has provided the House with today, could be made available to Members in advance of such discussion as we are having.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then from the response of the Minister &mdash; he did not say this &mdash; that it would be the intention of the Department to introduce amending legislation after the harmonisation talks have been completed?  That was really the point of my question, that we would not have to look forward to doing this on an annual basis.  Do the Department intend bringing in amending legislation following on an agreement on the harmonisation of a standard time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Manning, the script says that the public were consulted about the provisions.  I did not give all the details of the methods used but in deference to the subsequent question, I will endeavour to get all the details as to how that information was compiled, from whom it came and so forth, and we will let the Senator have it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the further point made by Senator O'Toole, when a directive finally emanates from the discussions going on on harmonisation, I feel that will be the time for us to introduce whatever legislation may be required.  If and when the harmonisation discussions are finalised and if it is necessary to introduce legislation, as I indicated earlier, then we will do that.  We see it as unnecessary to introduce legislation now and then have to do something similar in a short time again.  I am sure that is the point the Senator is making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann extends its congratulations to the Irish Paralympic <Col N="364" /> team on its outstanding performance in the recent Seoul Olympics.</P>
    <P>We were more than uplifted by the tremendous performance of our Paralympic team in the special Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, in the month of October.  Out of a team of 60 athletes, the Irish team brought back 45 medals, namely 13 gold medals, 13 silver medals and 19 bronze medals, making them the 18th best team to compete in the games. This fact, allied to the four world records which were broken by members of the Irish squad, certainly set us apart as a very exceptional nation at the games.</P>
    <P>The competitors, their families and their coaches can feel very proud indeed of the performance they put up on behalf of the Irish nation.  All of us praise the dedication shown by athletes who have to undergo difficulties such as the athletes in the special Olympic teams have had to undergo but when a performance like this is seen, it certainly indicated that all the hard work, all the dedication and all the training was well worthwhile.  The example shown by the special Olympics team shows that while they may in some sense be suffering from minor disabilities of one form or another, they are more than adequate when it comes to dedication and when it comes to the human spirit.  Their performance indicates that the lesson for all of us who would claim to be the able-bodied is that if we could put the same effort and dedication into our lives as those athletes put into their lives and training, then all of us and this nation would be far the better for it.</P>
    <P>If there is one note of disappointment I have to sound it is that the coverage of the Paralympic games by our national television station was far from adequate. We are all joining in the praises now when we see the results but I think it would have been very beneficial, not just for the athletes, their families and their friends, but for everybody in this country to see some of the events that took place and to see what the athletes could do and could win.  It would have helped to remove another layer of the doubt and <Col N="365" /> misgivings we sometimes have about disabled athletes and their abilities.  The point was made by one sports commentator at the events that the standard reached such great heights in one or two of the competitions there that it will not be long until some of the disabled athletes will be able to take on and beat able-bodied athletes in their own sports.  This in a sense indicated the training and dedication which has been undertaken by the special Olympic team.</P>
    <P>I will leave my comments at that. Again, on behalf of my party I extend our sincere congratulations to the team. They were a credit to themselves, their families, their coaches and friends and to the Irish nation.  We can all be very proud of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Bradford in congratulating the team on this magnificent result.  It speaks volumes not only for the team of people who went out to Seoul but also for the back-up they had from their families.  It seems appropriate for me to hand a bouquet to the rehabilitation facilities that exist in Ireland and the support which must have been available at community level to enable the members of the team to develop to the level they attained.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if there has been any breakdown of the members of the team by area throughout the country. What one usually finds in many western countries is that close to the large cities there are excellent rehabilitation facilities but in the more remote areas it may be very difficult for a handicapped person to obtain the type of support, training, interest and commitment required initially to get over the shock of the handicap because it is a traumatic experience &mdash; one moment one is quite well and the next moment one is quite paralysed and then to develop talents and abilities and to find some new direction in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have to congratulate the people who run the Dún Laoghaire Rehabilitation Centre.  I have had experience of sending people from the North to that centre and they have had very <Col N="366" /> gratifying results.  One has to ask what other facilities there are throughout the country.  For me, one of the great byproducts of what has happened is that it has indicated to us that people who 30 or 40 years ago would have been marginalised in our society are being increasingly integrated into it.  This possibly applies to many of the social, physical, psychological, sexual and other groups who, because they did not fit in with the norm, the healthy and the strong in days gone by, were isolated and often live out lonely and quite futile lives.  Now it is possible to anticipate, while not a normal life in the sense of those who have not been incapacitated, nevertheless a fulfilled life because we recognise that people have different talents.  It is a question of how to find these talents, develop them and have a responsive to society in which they can be used.</P>
    <P>Winning these medals is one aspect of what these athletes have done, but another very important aspect is the symbolic effect on society as a whole to show what is possible in spite of disablement, and sometimes very severe disablement indeed.  It is a tribute to the athletes themselves. It is an inspiration to the human being and also a reflection of the great possibilities that exist in the human spirit to overcome misfortune.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I want to support the motion and I am sure I speak for my Independent colleagues in doing so.  I was particularly glad that the occasion in Seoul was attended by all the full-scale glamour of the previous Olympics. That was a tribute to the competitors and must have greatly heartened them.  The important point has been made by previous speakers that this kind of occasion and the welcome home the competitors were given does indicate a welcome advance in our human relationships and the acceptance and integration of the erstwhile deprived into our community. Not everything is regression in history and in these areas there is a great deal of welcome humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who enjoy normal physical good health &mdash; except when we impair it <Col N="367" /> by self-indulgence &mdash; can only marvel at the dedication and discipline of these athletes.  All I can do is join my congratulations to the indomitability of spirit of man, of the human species, even when it is housed in a less than perfect body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want also to join with the other speakers in offering our congratulations from this side of the House on this major achievement by this team.  We are a very small nation and we have not got the many modern facilities in gymnasia and so on.  Nevertheless, our achievements in Seoul have been very good this year and great credit must go to the advancement of rehabilitation in this small country.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that in the rehabilitation of any individual it is only when all other requirements of the patient have been met that the patient reaches the frame of mind to branch into the athletic field on this level.  That is a tribute in its own way to the training, facilities and achievements of the rehabilitation workers in this country.  It is great to see that people, despite disability can achieve world fame in athletics.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that we had such an achievement for this country.  I am here today to pay my tribute to the many rehabilitation organisations we have in the country.  In our motion this evening we may be dealing with the many charitable organisations which are now overlapping in pursuing the same aims but for, maybe, the wrong reasons.  That is something we may deal with this evening. I am glad to be associated with this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second the motion as proposed by Senator Bradford.  I am delighted to get this opportunity to offer my congratulations to the entire team of 60 Irish athletes who went to the Paralympics. By any standard their achievement was tremendous and outstanding.  I would like to congratulate the contenders, all associated with the team, their trainers, mentors, parents and supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I personally know one of the athletes. It is coincidental &mdash; that is why I am very glad to get this opportunity to speak &mdash; that exactly at this time, 3.15 p.m. in Galway Borough Council the Mayor and other members of the council &mdash; I apologise for my own absence there today &mdash; are holding a civic reception for one of those athletes from Galway, Darren Jordan of Cruchan Park, Rahoon, Galway, who achieved the outstanding feat of winning two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal.  He won his gold medal in the obstacle event; he broke the world record in that event and that is an achievement in itself; he won a gold medal in the 400×100 metres relay and his team broke the world record in that event also.  So, far from being a Dublin event it is a west of Ireland event. He broke two world records as well as winning two gold medals; he won a silver in the 200 metres; he won a bronze in the 100 metres and he won a bronze in the 400 metres and at this very moment the Mayor of Galway and the borough council are according him a civic reception which I would be attending if my duty did not demand that I should be here.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford referred to the poor coverage by RTE.  It is something we must refer to.  Not alone was it poor coverage, it was non-existent coverage. In fact, only a snippet was shown on one programme and that was not covered by RTE &mdash; it was obviously a piece of film got from somewhere else.  After the first Olympics in Seoul the camera crews, reporters and everybody else apparently packed their bags and went home oblivious of the fact that we had 60 people who had put the same effort &mdash; or even a lot more effort &mdash; into their preparations because the record of the competitors speaks for itself in this regard.</P>
    <P>It was a tremendous achievement. Great credit is due, as I say, to those athletes who have done the country proud and, in our case, have done Galway proud in the case of Darren Jordan.  I would like to put on record the appreciation of the people of Galway.  It has lifted their spirits and that feeling would be general in view of the results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> I compliment the people involved with those athletes in their training and those who supported them in their communities and their families.  Particularly, I would like to take this opportunity as I cannot be at the civic reception in Galway to congratulate Darren's parents, Marie and Padraic Jordan, for the dedication with which they have supported him in the furtherance of his obvious and now nationally and internationally recognised ability.  I am glad to have this opportunity of doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, at a time when congratulations are being extended I am the one who is going to introduce a fairly negative note to the debate.  It would certainly be my wish to associate with the congratulations which are being offered to the Irish team in the Paralympics and I would certainly also commend the manner in which the congratulations are being presented in a very straightforward, non-patronising way, but it is not just possible to look purely at these without looking at the background from which they have come.  I have been speaking to the people who have been in charge of the team in Seoul and to the people who represent the Irish Wheelchair Association and they say that the true facts of the matter are that the Irish team need an incredible amount of support for pre-Olympic training which they have not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator McCormack put his finger on it when he says thanks to the communities and families who supported them.  The communities and the families supported these people very much.  Very often in such cases they did not have the money.  For example, in the area of Finglas in North Dublin, families in such areas frequently did not have enough money to put bread on the table but they were prepared to put their hands in their pockets to support some local competitors. That such a thing should be required, is a shame and a scandal.  It is something which reflects very badly on our society: this is the cutback mentality and these are the people who are first to be hurt.  We need to make a very honest <Col N="370" /> effort in terms of the rights of those people with problems of mobility and it is certainly the position of the Irish Wheelchair Association and the people involved in Paralympics or in the whole movement of sport for those people with mobility problems that they need firm State support.</P>
    <P>It should be placed on the record of the House very clearly that it is not good enough and it is not just to allow this responsibility to fall on families and friends.  This happens right through their lives.  People with mobility problems are always dependent on family and friends. I know this from my own involvement in education because there is not a special education school in this country that does not have a community and friends support group without which they would not be able to survive.  The fact is that these people have come through without any support really and in reaching the pinnacle of international achievement they have done so with less than the support they deserve from this community.</P>
    <P>I want to give two examples of that. We are very well aware of the problems of access to buildings for people with mobility problems.  Why is it that our planning laws do not facilitate the involvement of these people in just moving in?  I have noticed an employee of this House who has difficulties in mobility around the House.  It is fine for us to stand up now and talk and congratulate &mdash; indeed, we all agreed with this and are of one mind in this issue &mdash; but let us not forget that next week these people will be back in their communities, or seeking work, or on unemployment assistance and so on and they still need to survive. We can forget about them very easily. That is the first point I make about support for international competition and for pre-Olympic training.</P>
    <P>The second point I make is that access to buildings for people with mobility problems should be enshrined in our legislation.  Any of us who has travelled to other countries would feel ashamed at the lack of facilities here.  I accept it would be very expensive to change existing buildings but certainly in all public <Col N="371" /> buildings in future it should now be a requirement for building by-law approval that such access should be available.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to make is with regard to access to jobs.  The Government have a policy &mdash; successive Governments have had policies &mdash; that there should be jobs available for people with mobility problems at a level of 3 per cent.  This was agreed about seven years ago in national understandings, national agreements, etc.  I would like to place on record that successive Governments have been remiss and have abrogated their responsibility in this area.  There is not a 3 per cent allocation of employment for these people.  Looking straight back at the motion, these people cannot any further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>These people are amateurs; they are not professional sportspeople, and in order to compete at the level they aim at, they need some form of support: State support to allow them to continue in what they were doing and to do more of it in the future, but in normal times to have a job and employment so that they can live and work like other people and also pursue their sport. That is why access to employment is important.  As bad as it is in the public service let me put on the record very definitely and starkly that there is no policy at all in the private sector of giving employment to people with mobility problems.  That really is the country we live in.  This is the ambience from which these people have come, from which they have gone and represented us at the highest levels of international endeavour and of whom we are justly proud, but we should also put things in order in our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> I regret I did not have notice of this motion as I could have done some research on it.  The points I make are somewhat haphazard and perhaps I would have been more careful to relate to the motion had I more time to prepare for it but I will reiterate the three points I have made.  These athletes need State support for pre-Olympic and international training in order to retain and develop the standards which they have achieved already.  The matter of supporting them in their lives between Olympics is also important; and this raises the issue of access to buildings, public places, places of employment, etc.  Finally in order for these people to continue to be part of the community they should have the same right to employment as other people and, therefore, we should see to it that the 3 per cent commitment of successive Governments is implemented and also that the private sector play their part in giving employment to people with mobility problems.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Minister &mdash; it is a little unusual &mdash; I certainly would like, as Cathaoirleach and as Tras Honan, to add my voice to congratulate those who took part in the Olympic Games.  I would also like to pay tribute to the athletes who did not make it and who had to stay at home.  They may have been pipped at the last post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have 25 years experience, not in the field we are talking about, but in dealing with the mentally handicapped.  I do not agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, who said the State should do all of this.  In the past 25 years we have been able to open up a tremendous new world to the children and later adults, the world of sport which has always been available to those of us who can walk and run.  I see what is being achieved at first hand every week, by people.  I see voluntary bodies including the Clare Federation of the Mentally Handicapped, of which I am chairperson, working with the State providing people with this service.  I am convinced it is working because people stay with us and help us.  Let the Department of Education and the Department <Col N="373" /> of Health come in with us.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that there are tremendous gaps, but it would be wrong, and I can speak from experience, if we were to ask any Government Department to totally take over the service being provided to these people.  It is successful as it is.  I thank Senator Bradford for putting down this motion on the Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a somewhat unusual position in that I came to the House to participate in another debate.  However, I am extremely glad and privileged to be afforded the opportunity to associate myself with the motion put down in the name of Senator Bradford, and the names of the other Fine Gael Members. I also would like to congratulate most sincerely, and this is important as the Cathaoirleach has already said, not only those who travelled to Seoul and won medals, but those who, by their contributions throughout the year, made it possible for all of the others to go to Seoul.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to note, as Senator Murphy indicated, that this was not just a side event, as was the case in years past, and that it was given the full prominence that the Olympic Games themselves received.  I recall hearing one of the athletes being interviewed when he came back and he said that one of the things that struck him most of all was the tremendous ceremonial involved, the opening and closing ceremonies.  I am glad to see that these Olympics have now taken their own rightful place.  They are probably the only true Olympians left and they should be congratulated for that. By competing even at local level, at the smallest regional level, they have proved that they are the true Olympians and have the true Olympic spirit.  They are probably the only people who still hold the true Olympic spirit, upon which the Olympic games were founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in a confrontation with my friend, Senator J. O'Toole, not Senator O'Toole from County Mayo &mdash; in case my friends in <Col N="374" /> County Mayo wonder whether there are problems between east and west.  I can assure them there are none.  I accept the point he made.  When I was in the Department of the Public Service I had the privilege of instituting, with the then Minister, the 3 per cent quota the Senator spoke about.  As he said, if he had had a little more time he would probably have found out that in accordance with the planning laws access for the disabled must be provided. I accept some of the other points he made, but it is very important also to recall what the Cathaoirleach has said.  I do not think the organisations who cater for the disabled or the disabled themselves would want to feel that they are receiving Government charity.  However, I accept that in many cases they need much better back-up.  Again, I thank the Senators for their remarks.  As the Minister with responsibility for sport has already stated when he met the team, not only have they done Ireland proud but, above all, as I said earlier, they are the only true Olympians left.</P>

      <P>The period under review by the Seanad today &mdash; from January 1988 to the present &mdash; has been a particularly significant and important time in the history of the European Economic Community, and for Ireland as a member of 15 years standing of that Community.  We have, in recent years, seen the Community adopting clear and attainable objectives, most notably the achievement of economic and social cohesion and the creation of a large internal market, free of all barriers to trade by 1992.  These objectives were given effect in the Single European Act <Col N="375" /> which will provide the scope, impetus and momentum necessary for their achievement.</P>
      <P>At the Brussels European Council in February there was agreement on Commission proposals &mdash; known as the Delors Plan &mdash; which identify, particularise and prioritise the objectives and set tangible goals for implementing the Single European Act in time for the completion of the internal market.  These proposals aptly entitled <i>Making a success of the Single European Act</i> include: the strengthening of economic and social cohesion, an obvious priority area for Ireland; the resolution of past budget difficulties by the increase in the level of resources available to the Community; and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In the course of my remarks I will be dealing in detail with some of these issues and with other aspects of the Community's activities especially in the areas of development co-operation and European Political Co-operation.</P>
      <P>I would like at the outset to refer to the extremely important visit to Ireland by the President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, on Friday and Saturday of last week.  I will be referring in due course to some specific issues arising from President Delors' visit but I would like to state our satisfaction with the visit and to indicate that it heralds the cementing of a closer relationship, indeed, a partnership, between Ireland and the Commission which will be of immense benefit to this country.</P>
      <P>During his visit President Delors met with the Taoiseach, the members of the Government most directly concerned with the Community and the representatives of the social partners.  This range of contacts underlines the partnership theme of the visit which is emphasised in the joint declaration made by the Taoiseach and President Delors after their meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will open my detailed description of developments since January with a few remarks on the internal market.  The implications of the completion of the internal market have already been the <Col N="376" /> subject of a previous debate and I do not propose to go into any great detail except to say that the Government are making every effort to ensure that the Irish economy is fully prepared to meet the challenge of 1992.  This includes the development of appropriate negotiating positions in Brussels and an intensive information campaign mounted by Ministers throughout the country in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable progress in the period under review on the programme to complete the internal market by the 31 December 1992.  Over 200 of the 300 odd proposals in the internal market White Paper have now been tabled by the Commission and about 100 have been agreed.</P>
    <P>During the year so far agreement has been reached on an important Directive on the Mutual Recognition of Higher Educational Diplomas which will permit greater job mobility for the professions. Significant steps have also been taken to further open up the Community-wide market in the area of public works and public supplies.  I expect the present impetus to be maintained with a view to meeting the December 1992 deadline for the completion of the single market.</P>
    <P>We would reject the accusation sometimes levelled at the Community that the creation of the single market will result in increased protection of the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> third countries.  The Community has said repeatedly that this will not happen and that, in fact, the single market will benefit both Community and non-Community companies alike, although, as with any competitive economic activity, there will be winners and losers.</P>
    <P>However, the overall result of 1992 will be the greater liberalisation of a sizeable part of world trade, and we will all benefit from that.  As the world's biggest exporter, accounting as it does for 20 per cent of world trade, it is in the Community's interest to maintain the open multilateral trading system and the Community has said that it will fulfil its international obligations.  In this regard, there is a link between what happens in the <Col N="377" /> single market context and what happens in the current round of negotiations at GATT which are scheduled to finish in 1990.  Any new obligations for the Community arising from that can be incorporated into the single market proposals in plenty of time for the 1992 deadline.</P>
    <P>I would now like to inform the House of progress to date in the crucial negotiations regarding the reform of the Structural Funds.  The Community's commitment to assisting its less developed regions is not something new. The preamble to the original Treaty mentions this aspiration.  What is new, however, is the seriousness and energy with which Community policies to tackle regional disparities are being developed. This process is given full expression in the Single European Act which identifies economic and social cohesion as a key objective of the Community.  The Single European Act also lays down how this task of reducing regional disparities is to be achieved.  In this regard it lays particular emphasis on reform of the three Structural Funds &mdash; the Regional Fund, Social Fund and EAGGF Guidance Fund.</P>
    <P>A great deal has already been achieved towards that reform.  I am happy to be able to report to this House that the progress to date has been positive and reassuring from the Irish perspective.</P>
    <P>The first major step was the adoption by Community Ministers last June of the new framework regulation for the Structural Funds.  This establishes the general principles which will govern the operation of the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Guidance Fund.  Let me briefly remind the House of the main points of the new regime. First, a doubling of the resources of the funds between now and 1993.  Second, a concentration of these increased resources on the less developed regions, including a doubling of the sums available for these regions by 1992.  This concentration involves an increase in the rate of Community contributions to a possible maximum of 75 per cent of total cost of projects.  Third, a commitment to a special effort for the least developed regions within that group.  Ireland falls <Col N="378" /> into that category.  As I said, the framework regulation lays down the general guidelines.</P>
    <P>Detailed implementing regulations are now under negotiation.  These will lay down specific and precise rules for the operation of the funds.  In those negotiations Ireland is working to communicate and win acceptance for our concerns.  So far we have been successful. For example, it has been agreed that certain infrastructural projects with private sector funding will be eligible for Community assistance.  Given domestic budgetary restraints this provision is of crucial importance for us.  It means Ireland will be able to maximize the benefits derived from the increased funds.</P>
    <P>The reform of the funds is not just about increased budgetary resources for the Community's regions.  It is also about making better use of those resources.  A key aspect in this regard is the move to a programme approach.  The programme approach involves placing the emphasis less on Community assistance for individual projects undertaken in isolation and more on a planned coherent programme of inter-linking and complementary measures.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports this rationalisation of the operation of the funds.  In that spirit we are drawing up a national development plan which will set out our national priorities for Community assistance.  The plan is very important because it will cover a five year period and it will provide the basis for our negotiation with Brussels concerning Community assistance for Ireland over that period.  We have already had a very useful exchange of views on our overall approach to the plan with President Delors during his visit here last week and with a high level group of Commission officials led by the Secretary General, Mr. Williamson, a few days previously.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements envisaged by the Government will mean that the national plan will be complemented by a major input at local level.  To facilitate this local input the Government have divided the country into seven sub-regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> Each sub-region will have its own programme or package of development measures.  Each sub-region will have a crucial role in the formulation of its own programme.  The arrangements for this local input involves the establishment of working groups.  These have been set up and comprise representatives of Government Departments, appropriate State bodies, management of county councils and county boroughs as well as the European Commission.  Each working group will work closely with an advisory group consisting of all the main representative bodies with an interest in development.</P>
    <P>To give the House an indication of the timetable we are working to, I should add that the national development plan and associated sub-national programmes are to be finalised by the first quarter of next year.  Negotiations with the Commission will then take place and the new regime should be fully operational by the last quarter of next year.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely confident that the programme approach &mdash; with its emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Structural Funds &mdash; combined with the doubling of resources for the less developed regions will have a major, beneficial impact in Ireland and that, as a result, we will be all the better placed to compete and participate effectively in post-1992 Europe.</P>
    <P>The agreement on agriculture stabilisers reached at the European Council in Brussels in February represents the culmination of the process of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy for all of the major products.  Essentially the agreement involved confirming and extending the application of measures to curb the growth of agricultural output which has been leading to enormous surpluses and a huge drain on the Community budget to maintain prices and fund storage.  While the process of reform has entailed painful decisions for most member states, including Ireland, it was necessary in order to ensure that the long term viability of the Common Agricultural Policy was secured.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken at the Brussels <Col N="380" /> European Council provide a stable and adequately financed basis for the effective future of the CAP and for the Community's activities as a whole.  The Government are determined that the CAP should continue to serve its fundamental objectives, in particular the safeguarding of family farm incomes. This Government actively seek to ensure that the CAP and the reformed Structural Funds provide a suitable framework for the further development of the rural economy and of the food industry in this country.  President Delors' remarks during his visit indicate that he shares our overall concept.</P>
    <P>The importance of the social aspects of progress towards the 1992 objective was formally recognised by the Hanover European Council which stressed that the internal market was to be conceived so as to benefit all of the people of the Community.  Specific measures envisaged under what has come to be known as the &ldquo;social dimension&rdquo; of the internal market include the promotion of employment through improved access to vocational training, improved occupational safety and health and enhanced dialogue with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the social dimension forms an integral part of the move to complete the internal market.  A Europe which is not integrated in the social area will fail to create the solidarity and engage the active support that is necessary for future advance. Ensuring through Community solidarity that certain minimum rights and standards are achieved throughout the Community is an objective that Ireland fully supports.</P>
    <P>The effort at Community level to develop a constructive social dialogue reflects and reinforces the process of co-operation with the social partners already functioning in Ireland in the relation to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> This process has been carried forward in the national campaign to prepare for 1992.  It is by means of such consultation and dialogue that the consensus and co-operation necessary to sustain a uniform <Col N="381" /> approach to the challenge of the single market can be developed.</P>
    <P>The Government attach particular priority to addressing the unemployment problem, which is rightly recognised as the major social policy issue confronting the Community.  To this end, we will continue to press for the implementation of a co-operation strategy for growth and employment throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The Community &mdash; like its member states &mdash; is aware of the importance of science and technology to economic wellbeing. Since the Council of Ministers, in late 1987, approved the Second Framework Programme for Science and Technology covering the years 1987 to 1991, many initiatives and programmes have been agreed and are now under way.  The total funding for this five year framework programme is equivalent to IR£5,023 million.  The annual flow of payments to Ireland is now some IR£10 million per annum but, we have to work continuously to optimise particular decisions to Irish circumstances and, indeed, to better match our circumstances to decisions taken.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the complete removal of exchange controls in accordance with our European Community obligations by the end of 1992.  We began this process at the beginning of 1988 and in a further step it was announced, during the visit of President Delors, that we now intend to remove all restrictions on the purchase of medium and long-term foreign securities by Irish residents from the end of this year.  We will not, therefore, be seeking any further derogations from EC rules in this area.  We are able to take this big step forward because of the growth of confidence in the Irish economy as reflected in the substantial inward flow of capital.</P>
    <P>There is a growing concern in the member states about the environment and this is gradually being reflected in Community policy.  A major recent advance in the area of the environment has been the ratification by the Community member states of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the <Col N="382" /> Ozone Layer.  A phased reduction of the use of such substances is envisaged, which should considerable reduce the damage to the ozone layer caused by certain chemical agents.  We are in favour of a directive on anti-pollution regulations for small vehicles, and hope recent obstacles to its adoption will be overcome.  We have recently implemented the terms of the directive on the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste.  We are satisfied with the provisions of the directive on large combustion plants to be agreed shortly.</P>
    <P>In the area of the Community's development co-operation policies and activities, the most important development in the course of the year was the opening last month of negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries &mdash; or ACP as they are known &mdash; on a new Lomé Convention and, in preparation for this, the formulation of a common Community negotiating position or mandate.  I am pleased to have the opportunity presented by this debate to inform the House about this important issue.  The current Lomé Convention &mdash; the third &mdash; was signed in December 1984 and will expire on 29 February 1990.  The Convention is the most important instrument of Community development co-operation. Under it, development assistance totalling 8.5 billion ECU, over £6.5 billion, will have been provided to 66 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries &mdash; many of the world's poorest countries &mdash; and the ACP granted duty-free access to the Community market for nearly all their products.</P>
    <P>The inter-Community discussions on the new Convention commenced in March and were successfully concluded at the October Council.  The Community's ideas for the new Convention were presented to the ACP countries at a special Joint Council to open the negotiations in Luxembourg between 11-13 October and joint detailed consideration of the proposals will commence in February 1989 in Brazzaville.  Agreement is expected by December 1989.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been actively involved in all these discussions to date and will be <Col N="383" /> playing its part in the forthcoming year of negotiations.  Should agreement be delayed it may fall to us during our Presidency in the first half of 1990 to conclude negotiations on behalf of the Community.</P>
    <P>Before moving on from the subject of Community development co-operation activities, I feel it useful to take this opportunity to report briefly on another important aspect of the Community's activities in the development context in the course of the year.  That is the significant contribution the Community has made in cases of food shortages and natural disasters throughout the developing world.  I am sure that the House will be pleased to learn that, in contrast to the situation which prevailed in the recent past where the Community was &mdash; quite justifiably, I believe &mdash; condemned for repeated failure to respond promptly and effectively to major food crises, such as that which struck Africa in 1984-85, major improvements have been made in the Community's food aid and emergency assistance programmes.  As a result the Community, through the Commission's Emergency Assistance and Food Aid Units, now play a central and effective role in international relief efforts.</P>
    <P>In the course of this year, for example, the Community promptly provided substantial quantities of food aid and emergency financial aid to the hungry and displaced people of Ethiopia, Sudan, Bangladesh, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Afghanistan &mdash; to name but a few of the areas recently affected.  I am sure that the House will agree that these positive developments are most welcome and represent a considerable and necessary advance in Community activity.</P>
    <P>The developments which have taken place in the sphere of European Political Co-operation this year should also be mentioned.  It is within European Political Co-operation that Ireland tries, along with our partners in the Twelve, in fulfilment of our commitments in the Single European Act, to reach agreement <Col N="384" /> on common positions and actions on a wide variety of foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>East-West relations have been a leading issue in recent months.  Expectations have been greatly heightened by the Soviet Union's agreement to withdraw from Afghanistan and the conclusion of the treaty between the superpowers eliminating intermediate nuclear weapons from Europe.  They have been further raised by the superpowers undertaking to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half as well as by developments in the Soviet Union itself.  It is obvious why this issue should be of such interest.  First, the superpowers hold by far the greatest numbers of nuclear weapons and can, accordingly, make the greatest contribution to their reduction and eventual elimination.  Secondly, the Twelve are painfully aware of the existence of the &ldquo;other lung of Europe&rdquo;, to use the striking metaphor from the Pope's address to the European Parliament.  Through our participation in the Conference on Security and Co-operation, which is at present meeting in Vienna, Ireland is actively participating in promoting the most reliable framework within which relations between the countries and peoples of Europe, in association with the US and Canada, can be managed. We hope that the Vienna meeting can conclude shortly with a satisfactory and balanced concluding document.  We would wish to see this reflecting the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the 40th Anniversary of which we celebrate next month.  In that Declaration it is stated that &ldquo;recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Single European Act partners undertook to make their &ldquo;contribution to the preservation of international peace and security in accordance with the undertaking entered into by them within the framework of the UN Charter&rdquo;.  They have, therefore, given their full support to the efforts of the Secretary General to build on the ceasefire reached in June <Col N="385" /> between Iran and Iraq and to find a lasting settlement to the conflict.  The use of chemical weapons in that area has aroused the conscience of mankind; it has galvanised the international community into seeking to give a fresh impetus to the long-running negotiations aimed at banning the production of chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>New peace-keeping forces in which Ireland is proud to participate have been established this year to monitor this ceasefire between Iran and Iraq and the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan.  It is, therefore, highly appropriate that the Nobel Peace Prize should have been awarded to the UN peace-keeping forces in which Irish troops have played such a long and honourable role.</P>
    <P>The Twelve have watched with deepening concern the deteriorating situation in the territories occupied by Israel.  We hope that the government which will emerge from yesterday's election will feel encouraged to open a dialogue with Palestinian representatives and with Israel's Arab neighbours within the context of an international conference under UN auspices as proposed by the Twelve.  The violence &mdash; which has continued in recent days &mdash; should have made it clear to all that the present situation cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>There have been indications that South Africa might finally heed the call of the UN Security Council in Resolution 435 on withdrawal from Namibia within the context of an agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. It needs, however, to be said that the international community has unreservedly condemned South Africa's occupation of Namibia and that the demand for withdrawal is unqualified.  No excuse can be accepted for further procrastination.</P>
    <P>The repression within South Africa itself shows few signs of easing.  The recent local government elections were not in themselves an earnest of any intention on the part of the South African Government to put an end to the Apartheid system.  It remains nonetheless clear <Col N="386" /> that it is urgently necessary that a beginning be made towards dismantling the apparatus of Apartheid and opening a genuine political dialogue with the legitimate representatives of the non-white community.  Ireland will, therefore, continue to seek a consensus within EPC for the maintainance of effective pressure on South Africa to take the necessary steps to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I have in my remarks covered some of the most significant areas of Community policy and developments in those areas during 1988.  I think Senators will agree that 1988 has been a good year involving major achievement for the Community as a whole and for Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I come back to a theme which I explored at the outset.  Partnership will be a keynote in Ireland's relations with the Commission which is in the crucial position of being the powerhouse of ideas for the future of the Community. That partnership was given a major boost during President Delors' visit here last week.  It will be fruitful in the years to come and greatly to Ireland's benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome every opportunity to speak on the development and improvement in the EC over any period, and this is no exception. However, I was under the misconception that we were dealing with the statutory half-yearly report from 1 January 1988 to June 1988.  However, I understand that is not the case since the report is not out.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister of State on a very full and frank speech which gives quite an impressive account, almost on a blow-by-blow basis, of progress.  In this period there is a lot at stake for this country.  I hope that our new Commissioner will measure up to the high standards set by his predecessors, from President Hillery, the first Commissioner, to the present distinguished and eminently successful holder of that office, Mr. Sutherland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very crucial period for the development of this country.  Again, I must compliment the Minister of State at <Col N="387" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, for the programme they have embarked on over a number of weeks in bringing to notice, through a series of seminars, discussions and meetings, the importance of our preparedness for 1992.  This cannot be over-stressed. While I am complimenting my friends in Government, I would not like anyone to think it was my opinion that they were doing all that can or should be done. They have made a good start and I hope they will keep it up.  That is important.</P>
    <P>It is consoling to note that practically all the economic forces in this country &mdash; the captains of industry, the leaders of the farming community and the business fraternity &mdash; have to one degree or another, accepted that things will not be the same after 1992.  Therefore, it is most important for many reasons that in the meantime we should have created an atmosphere and an economy whereby each of our producers, whether industrial, agricultural, in the public sector or private sector, will be able to compete in the open market, the very enticing market, of 360 million people.  What is not emphasised here is that unless we are prepared to compete, we will be flooded with the extra production of huge European companies because the relatively small amounts of merchandise that are sufficient to supply our rather small market can be brought in quickly through the new Channel Tunnel, which is expected to be open by then.  I hope we will be ready to meet that challenge and every effort must be made to ensure that we are ready.</P>
    <P>The integrated rural development programme is something which, by designation, is perhaps misunderstood. Some people seem to think that that kind of integration deals only with agriculture, the IFA, Macra na Feirme and rural areas.  As far back as 1976 the former Commissioner, Lord Thompson of Dundee, who was then in charge of regional policy, recognised that in many instances there was a negative reaction of one fund on another.  The regional <Col N="388" /> development grants in some areas were expended before the funds from the Social Fund or some other fund had an opportunity of working, or <i>vice versa</i>, and infrastructures were not provided. Yet there were significant grants expended on industries which did not have the means to compete at a top level because they were hindered by bad telecommunications or crucial infrastructures not being available.</P>
    <P>When we talk about an integrated rural development programme across the country, I hold the view, that what we want is co-ordination of all the funds, that they will complement each other, that they will be supportive of one another and that we will have an order of priorities coming from the regions themselves, whether industrial or agricultural.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say with some justification that the experience here is that the Department of Finance have organised, drawn up and submitted all the applications for all the funds for the past 15 years, and that is probably the case, but it does not get away from the fact that there is no co-ordination.  I am looking at huge signposts in every county which proclaim that the particular work is funded by the Regional Development Fund.  The signs are up for several years and still the work has not started.  In some areas people think the European Community is a joke.  I would like to know whether the Government have drawn the money for these projects that are costing a substantial amount; maybe the cheque was waylaid or the funds were diverted.  There is a point here.</P>
    <P>As far as the European Community and the credibility of the benefits to our citizens are concerned, we cannot afford to have ambiguity.  Unless people hold the Community in some esteem, we will never make progress.  I am not saying people should be looking to it always for grant-aid or for hand-outs, but we must believe within ourselves that it is worth while to be part of a community of nations, or a community of people which, if it conforms to the aspirations of the <Col N="389" /> Treaty of Rome, can only be of tremendous benefit to the person in the street.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single European market by 1992, I believe, is a realistic target.  Companies should recognise that the internal market process, which began almost three years ago, is now an irreversible process.  People read that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, or the Prime Minister of France, is having second thoughts about a central European bank or a federation in Europe, but the fact remains that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom signed the Single European Act.  Saying what the public want to hear is always very popular at an Ard-Fheis or a party conference but it is completely different when you put pen to paper and say you agree with the other 11 Heads of State that we are going towards a European united market.</P>
    <P>I do not think people should be complacent because of the headlines they read in the papers.  We should look at the facts.  Many managements here are only beginning to consider the detailed implications for their businesses when the fiscal or technical barriers to trade, which hinder inter-community trade, are abolished and reduced.  This is of tremendous significance in every part of this country. I hope the awareness level here will increase.  What is involved for us in the completion of the internal market is not too different from the perception of the populations of the other 11 member states.  The time has come for Irish companies, business people, the private sector and farming communities, to make up their minds that they are going to achieve a significant improvement in their strategic planning in the context of 1992 and the years after that.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister set out the objectives of the Single European Act. He said the proposals involved in making a success of the Single European Act include the strengthening of economic and social cohesion, the resolution of past budget difficulties by the increase in the level of resources available to the Community and the reform of agricultural policy.  I do not know whether the European budget difficulties, year in, year out, <Col N="390" /> have any great impact on the public because at the end of the day they receive whatever is going.  What is of tremendous importance to this country is that the public should be aware of the consequences if they do not do enough in the next four years.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a very special appeal to organisations such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Congress of Trade Unions, the farming organisations, the business and professional bodies, to give very considerable thought to their input and get their programmes under way immediately.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the new regions the Minister of State has set up to deal with integrated developments.  When they were announced first, the composition of the new bodies did not particularly endear themselves to me.  I was a Member of the House when the late Mr. Seán Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce just before a Kildare by-election, introduced the very first development programme.  That was a long time ago.  All these programmes are introduced either before elections or in the run-up to elections.  They raise people's hopes and people vote for whatever package is put before them.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the composition of the present boards which are mainly controlled by county managers.  There is hardly a county in this country that is not bankrupt at the moment.  County managers do an excellent job when they have the necessary finance, but so far I have not seen emanating from any one of them any great headline on how economies can be made.  There has been no great change in public administration at local government level for the past 30 years.  They have been very slow to make changes, although I suppose one could say they have always been restricted financially.</P>
    <P>I have some ideas on an integrated development programme.  Let us apply that programme to the midlands.  No matter what the criteria of judgment are, the counties I know best have suffered greatly from a lack of investment down the years despite the fact that <Col N="391" /> Ireland's main arterial road system connecting Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo, runs through them.  I am talking about Counties Laois, Kildare, Carlow, Westmeath and Kilkenny.  The general public use the roads to pass through the midland counties, yet this area's potential for growth has been strangely neglected.  Over the years if you crossed over the Shannon into the west you got a grant which was 20 per cent higher than that given elsewhere.  Industrialists who want to be nearer the ports stay closer in the Pale and, as a result there is a sort of green desert.  In my own county, Laois, it is unfortunate that, after the great efforts which have been made over the past 60 years, we now have fewer people in industrial employment than we had in 1924.  I do not know how one handles a statistic like that.</P>
    <P>Counties Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath are suffering under the present five-year programme.  Five ESB power stations have closed down and Bord na Móna, which had been a tremendous source of employment in the midland counties since 1934-1935 are being wound down, because the board say they are approximately £75 million in debt.  They have failed to diversify or to even come up with a programme for the utilisation of the cutover bogs.  Their 250,000 acres hopefully, will not be turned into a brown desert.  Those two semi-State organisations, which employed between 5,000 and 6,000 people in those counties, are in the process of reorganisation and there is nothing proposed to take their place.</P>
    <P>I would expect a rural development or an integrated programme to look closely at the infrastructures that are fading, and to come up with a new programme that would deal not just with agriculture but would be designed to maintain job opportunities right across the region.  The Minister is proposing ten regions &mdash; we have eight regions for tourism.  In every organisation our county is in a different region, so one is dealing with different people all the time.  We should have a system of greater councils.  I am not suggesting we <Col N="392" /> should adopt a similar system to that operated in the United Kingdom, which is a combination of county councils but we should have a definite region.  When we talk about the western region, we know exactly the counties involved, and when we talk of the midlands, everybody knows which counties we mean, but in our county we are in a different group in every regional organisation.  I do not say it is a great hinderance to development, but why do we not have a body that would be able to co-ordinate the efforts of all these people &mdash; many people, working in these organisations are criticised but I believe people do their best.</P>
    <P>I accept that every person's input is freely given, but in this new integrated development programme, which is so important and &mdash; which was recognised 15 years ago as being wasteful of public funds &mdash; the Government have come up with a new set of structures.  They ignore the 1,200 or 1,500 local authority public representatives.  Out of these 1,500 people they cannot find one local authority representative who can make an input although these people have been serving local government for years and have acquired great expertise in this area. I am not talking about party affiliations, but about people who have freely given of their time, who have acquired expertise in this area, who would have a contribution to make and who are answerable for their actions to the public.</P>
    <P>I fear the present combination.  I cannot see any one of the 27 county managers standing up and saying he does not like the proposal from the Department because as soon as he does that, that will be the last penny he will get from any source.  We have the same problem with our health boards.  Half the members of a health board would be employed by the CEO, and very seldom will those professional people stand up and be counted when it comes to their own profession, or when they have to vote against a proposal coming from management. From that point, the Department of Finance will be told exactly what they want to hear.  They will get the support they <Col N="393" /> seek.  I fear that in this great new opportunity the people will not get value for money and we will not be able to achieve what is so desirable.</P>
    <P>The concept of the integrated rural programme is not exactly new.  Such programmes have been the subject of discussions and have been in place in various parts of the developed world since the end of the last war when in the early fifties the new wave of politicians decided there was a need for redevelopment. There has not been a great deal of thought about these grandiose development proposals since then, but we have a great opportunity to do something positive now.  The characteristics of individual areas, regions and occupations are very important and there should be interaction between them.</P>
    <P>A point I should like to underline is that the integrated programme is more of a process than a deadline to be feared or welcomed.  We should not think of a date but rather of the opportunities and changes that are going to take place after that.  The last time the Minister was in the House he stressed that approximately 300 proposals were listed for enactment by the period up to January 1993.  What is more important is that the markets are beginning to adjust to the changes that will take place over those four years.  It would be wrong if we were to sit back and wait for this magical day thinking everything was going to happen on that one date.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the decisions that were taken last week.  The Taoiseach &mdash; and I hope he is on the mend &mdash; announced some fiscal changes which got an open welcome.  That is an indication of what is to come.  Ninety three major decisions have been made by the Council of Ministers, including the introduction of the single administrative document which will facilitate customs clearance and procedures &mdash; this was long overdue &mdash; the reduction of certain border and fiscal formalities, a new approach to technical harmonisations and standards, improvement in the award of public procurement contracts and the provision of services in respect of non-life insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> May I ask the Minister a question on that?  In the Single European Act there is a derogation on the question of insurance.  Will we need that derogation, or will the Irish citizen be given the benefit of the better value in insurance premiums that our fellow Europeans in other countries seem to enjoy?</P>
    <P>On the question of liberalisation of capital movements, I welcome the announcement made last Friday here of a new regime involving the mutual recognition of diplomas and other professional qualifications.  I thought we had had agreement on that towards the end of the seventies, that with the directives which set up the Fourth Level Institution in Florence around that time there was agreement, with the Nine anyway, of the mutual recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications and that there was free movement of people in those areas. We have also had the first phase of air transport liberalisation, from which we have benefited and for which we thank Commissioner Sutherland for promoting over the last couple of years, and also the opening up of the telecommunications market.</P>
    <P>I understand that 129 proposals are being negotiated within the Community's institutions at present and a further 91 proposals have yet to be approved by the Commission, so that the bulk of the internal market programme remains to be agreed.  This means that industry can influence the future shape of pending legislation.  It also means that industry has some time to plan and prepare for the changes after 1992.</P>
    <P>Again, a factor which is completely underplayed is that we do not seem to see the operation and the opening of the Channel Tunnel between France and the UK as being of any great danger to us.  It is my view that a lot of consumer products will flow through that particular road faster than we have ever thought and it will mean that consumer goods can come in here very easily and cheaply; and unless we have some going out on the other track we are certainly going to lose out.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of areas I <Col N="395" /> would like to deal with, but what I hope we can get across in the next number of months is a very positive approach to the unified market and to the opportunities our people will have in operating in a situation where there is free movement of goods and people.  It is still a pity that we find ourselves not really doing anything spectacular about preparing ourselves.  There has been no great push, for example, on European languages in the schools and I do not perceive any difference this year over any other year.</P>
    <P>We have problems of emigration, of job opportunities, of unemployment.  If there is an American living on the east coast and if he moves across to the west coast, is he considered at home to be emigrating?  Similarly, if we have a complete market here and a young Irish technician, graduate or business person is qualified and able to command a position perhaps in one of the sister European countries, will we still look on that internal migration as emigration?  I would like to see a Government policy on that.  We should be clear in our minds whether we are going to look on the Community as home.  It would be a nice political way out of our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us have a close examination of that. If we believe that that is a desirable, natural progression, then why do we not put the funds into ensuring that the people going out there would have the benefit of being fluent in one or more of the mainland European languages? There is no use of waiting for a situation where English is going to take over in the Community, because I cannot see that happening except that it will probably get more common.</P>
    <P>What I would say to people in this country is to look at the written word and see what the heads of State have signed, what they are committed legally to do.  I do not think we should be overconcerned with the invective that it is popular for politicians of whatever state or whatever party to indulge in at any one time.  I do not think we can have ourselves misled in that context.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the opportunity of <Col N="396" /> speaking on this topic.  It is very important. I would hope that before Christmas the Minister might come in with a report on the success of the Government's programme to date, because it should be monitored on an ongoing basis.  I would like to emphasise that I am not looking for an opportunity of being critical or advocating what is not possible, but this is the most crucial economic date that this country has faced and I am not satisfied that we are doing enough or that the message is coming across.</P>
    <P>I would like to have the opportunity of knowing exactly what these new integrated committees are doing, why it should be such a closed secret that we do not know what our own counties are proposing or what priorities they are taking and why it should be taken completely out of the hands of members of local authorities.  I do not think it is appropriate that that should be the situation. People who are engaged in and members of local authorities must have some input and at least they should be <i>au fait</i> with the proposals the county managers will be making on their behalf.  That is very important.  Perhaps we could have a rethink on that on the part of the Minister before our next opportunity of discussing this topic here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister of State on a very comprehensive report here today.  I would like to join with Senator McDonald in paying tribute to the Ministers who toured the country to help to make us aware of what we are going into in 1992. They have done a very good job and have awakened the people to the realities of the situation.  That is very important because many people think that 1992 will just be cheaper cars and televisions but we all know it will be far more than that.  It will have great advantages for this country and I am fully convinced that we here will be well able to take our place in the European mainstream.  We see many of our athletes, both handicapped and physically fit, taking the world stage at present and there is no reason why our industries and workers cannot do the <Col N="397" /> same thing.  I have no doubt they will and will be eager and willing to take part in that great big market that exists out there.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to many matters. I would like to talk about Structural Funds.  I am very pleased that the Structural Funds are going to continue, particularly the Regional Fund and the Social Fund.  They are not only going to be continued but they are going to be improved.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that there is to be a doubling of resources of the funds between now and 1992 and a concentration of these increased resources on the less developed regions, including a doubling of the sums available for these regions by 1992.  This concentration involves an increase in the rate of Community contributions to a possible maximum of 75 per cent of total cost of projects.  Thirdly, he said there is a commitment to a special effort for the least developed regions within the group and that Ireland falls into this category. I sincerely hope that the disadvantaged areas of this country will be regarded as a priority region because those regions need more to bring them up to EC standards than do the more well off areas of our country.</P>
      <P>I realise that EC funds are contributing greatly to our infrastructure, by and large.  We are very pleased about that and pleased that more will be done in the future with our arterial roads, etc.  But it is a pity that we cannot build into those funds some subvention for county roads. After all, 80 per cent of our people have to travel on county roads to reach our national primary routes.  Perhaps the Minister might look into this, so that in some way we could get a subvention for our county roads.  We get nothing for our county roads from EC funds.  That is a pity because our county roads are an important part of our network.  We are told that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  That being so, our county roads certainly need attention and I hope something can be done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that we have a national five year plan to cater for the needs of our country.  I am pleased also <Col N="398" /> that a working party has been set up and that seven sub-regions have been designated. But I am a little critical of the composition of the working party.  They are comprised of representatives of Government Departments, of appropriate State bodies, of management of county councils and county boroughs as well as of the European Commission.  I am surprised that there are no elected representatives on those bodies.  I am very hurt about that and I hope that as a result of our deliberations and debate here today this will change.</P>
    <P>Much of the emphasis is on county managers.  When a new group water scheme or new bridge is opened, when there is a new road or some other develoment, everybody gets up and praises the county manager.  But when those things are not done the county councillors are at fault and the Minister is at fault. However, there is no word about the county councillor or the poor old Minister the day the cameras are there and the praise is flowing lavishly.  Our county managers are good officials and I am not critical of them.  But we, the councillors, provide the estimates.  We have to pass the estimates.  They are only spending what we agreed to allow them to spend and particularly the way we allowed them to spend.  While county managers have a contribution to make, some members of the county councils should be on that working party.</P>
    <P>I feel another group should also be on that working party.  They are catering for a very big section of our community. We have nobody from the VECs on that working party.  Our vocational schools were the first to bring secondary education to the underprivileged and the disadvantaged of this country when they opened rural schools in our local villages. They gave the sons and daughters of the working people an opportunity to attend a secondary school.  Regional colleges and vocational schools in general are dealing with a large section of the youth of our country and I think their representatives should have been invited in some way onto this working party.  Even at this late stage we might consult them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> Finally, the most important group of all is not mentioned on this working party. There is nobody from the health boards. The health boards cater not only for the health of the people but also cater for the physically handicapped, the mentally handicapped and the socially handicapped &mdash; the weakest sections of our community.  While no doubt there may be some voice within the working party who will think of all of that, I feel that those who are working with those problems every day should be in some way part of that working group.  We may at some stage place them on the advisory group but I would like to see them part of the working group where they could make a positive contribution towards the weaker section of our community and the general section of our community, because they are not catered for.  To use an old, hackneyed phrase of mine, the bureaucrats are taking over and there is no word about the poor local county councillors and workers who are out there all of the time dealing with the people.  I feel that those groups of people should be part of that working party.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased that such a group has been set up and I am delighted that the sub-regions have been established. It would be an advantage if we could have one region covering everything. My own region is part of several counties, the tourist board is in one region and transport covers another region and transport covers anther region.  If everything could be consolidated within one region I think it would work much better.  However, it has not been a big handicap.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the Social Fund will operate under the new structures.  As one who has been deeply involved in the services for the handicapped over the years I know that only for the Structural Funds the present high quality of service for the physically, mentally and socially handicapped people in our society would not be there.  We built units to cater for them and to provide a service for them largely from the Social Fund.  We still have much work to do in that regard and I would <Col N="400" /> like to think that those funds will continue to be made available to help us to finish the job we have started, particularly in the health board areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that small developments and rural industries will be catered for.  Fifteen years ago, when I started encouraging rural development and small industries in rural Ireland, it was unheard of, it was not talked about.  I am pleased to say that in my own little village we have a network of small industries and that one of those is exporting to the USA. I believe that small industries can be further developed and that they could be the answer to our unemployment problem. If we can provide jobs at home people will work at home and we can get into bigger markets.  One thing that damaged Ireland down through the years was not the fact that we could not get work but that we could not get enough markets for what we produced.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we see that problem in our agricultural sector today.  We are back to quotas.  I am delighted to see that the CAP is still being maintained.  I believe that if we could get back to the type of farming we did in years gone by, get back to what is now termed organic farming, we would not have the mountains of food we have on the market today, we would have more employment and we would have no need for quotas because we would be producing the real thing in the home environment rather than producing it as we are at present in factory farms which are a great cause of pollution and other problems.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see from this report that we are thinking of the environment because of late our environment has become in some ways polluted.  We are coming to grips with that and, again it is local authorities who are playing the leading role in trying to elminate pollution in our counties.  When we clean up our counties we clean up our country. That is another reason why local authorities should be involved in this working party.</P>
    <P>All in all I am very pleased with the report.  I am pleased that we are moving in the right direction.  I believe that 1992 <Col N="401" /> will bring great prosperity to Ireland, as will the era leading up to 1992.  Already we can see that there is a move on; the economy is brightening up and many people see a future ahead for them.  I am very pleased with that because so many preached for so long that there would never be anything in this country but desertion and all the rest.  We have a country which is starting to mature now and I believe it will continue.  I believe that we will have a very full role to play in 1992 in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the working party expanded to cater for those people I have mentioned because they have a great role to play.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their action is preparing us for 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of the debate on the six monthly report on developments in the European Communities to comment on our general preparedness for the internal market in 1992.  It is my impression that we are not well prepared and that we are running out of time for adequate preparation. I do not share what appears to be a rather sanguine mood and a rather general welcome for what is happening. I do not think we are preparing well; I do not think that there is evidence that we are and that is deeply worrying.</P>
      <P>The Government have certainly been urging various sectors and individual industries to prepare for 1992.  There has been considerable attention in the media and an advertising programme, but half page advertisements with almost no content are not the right way to prepare for 1992.  They can in a very general way create a certain awareness but I would hope that we are well past that stage; if we are not, we have reason for serious worry.  We seem to be concerned to talk about 1992 without, in fact, addressing what exactly is involved in the internal market programme.  That is very worrying because it is all in the small print.  The small print, as the Minister well knows, is very technical.  It is all in a very significant legislative programme of technical measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> As a country, before we joined the European Communities, we were bad at implementing complex technical measures. We have never really been particularly good as an Oireachtas at grappling with technical measures.  This is why Companies Bills, Bankruptcy Bills and Insurance Bills fall into delay, go from one parliamentary session to another and do not get political or parliamentary time.  What 1992 is all about is the most complex technical programme of legislation that this country has ever faced and I do not think we are alert to it.  I do not think we are targeting and facing it properly and this is a matter of considerable concern because the economic forces of the internal market are already at play.  It is going to provide a frontier-free market, whether by the deadline of 31 December 1992 as Article 8 (a) of the Single European Act predicts or a little later, but there will be this frontier-free internal market.  The dynamics of that will move to where the opportunities are being taken up, be it by business or professional sectors or simply the logistics of decisions being based on economic factors.  Unless, therefore, we have shown ourselves as a country to be very well prepared, clued up and taking these advantages as they come along, we are in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The current record does not look too good.  For example, and it is only an example, there is a very important directive that became fully operative at Community level on 30 June this year, the Product Liability Directive.  We have had lots of time to consider how we might implement the Product Liability Directive. We are bound to do it as of last June but so far it is not even clearly on the legislative programme of the Government for this side of Christmas.  It certainly has not been mentioned in any legislative programme that I have seen reported in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>It is very important because the Product Liability Directive changed the legal basis of liability of manufacturers and importers into this country and throughout the Community.  It is fair to say we are not the only member state that has <Col N="403" /> not implemented it.  A number of other member states have not implemented it either.  The United Kingdom and Italy have and other member states are processing legislation, but manufacturers are asking questions about the Product Liability Directive and are told that there is not even draft Irish legislation.</P>
    <P>If we look at the internal market programme there is a whole range of measures in the area of financial services, for example, a second banking directive, an investment services directive &mdash; all either at an advanced stage of discussion at Community level or at an advanced draft stage.  They will require implementation here.  There is a number of proposals in the area of company law and there appears to be considerable movement on these proposals at this stage, including the proposal for a European company itself.  If we are already seeing certain difficulties, particularly at the level of the Oireachtas and at departmental level, in ensuring that we bring forward technically competent and appropriate measures to incorporate complex Community provisions, that problem is going to worsen dramatically as the pace of the European market accelerates.  The pace of that market will accelerate over the next few years.  At the moment, as I understand it, there are some 285 legislative proposals of the internal market programme 90 of which are already passed and the vast majority of the rest will be published and under discussion by the end of this year.  That means they will be going through the pipeline fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>What is the Oireachtas manner of scrutinising European Community legislation? It is, as we know, through the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Indeed, I have missed a sub-committee of the joint committee in order to participate in this debate.  The joint committee has had its resources halved; it has half the staff it had two years ago.  It is producing fewer reports than it had been producing during stable periods of Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> Like most of the other committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the joint committee only works well when there are two or three years of any parliamentary term and then its gets into its mid-stream. The joint committee has four sub-committees. Normally it should be producing a regular series of reports to the Oireachtas.  It is doing its best with limited resources, but it has not been producing well.  Therefore, the joint comittee which was established in 1973 at a much more leisurely time in the legislative programme for the Communities is itself coping less well than it was a couple of years ago.  I am very concerned because it seems because the joint committee exists it is an excuse for the Oireachtas by and large to ignore the detail of the internal market programme. All we have are general debates or flash-points of a political sort or heads of Government meetings and statements in the House afterwards but the Oireachtas is not addressing the internal market programme properly.</P>
    <P>We need to be concerned about this. We need to look again at the scrutiny function.  We need to improve the resources immediately to the joint committee, but we need to do more than that because there are political issues involved in the legislative programme of the internal market.  One of those political issues is the manner of incorporation of some of the more important measures.  This is an issue which the joint committee has considered from time to time and it is a very important issue.  When a directive is passed in Brussels at Community level how is it to be incorporated in Ireland? It seems that at the moment that decision is taken by departmental officials in the Department concerned.  They seem to be the ones who decide that it will be either by an Act of the Oireachtas if it appears to be something that requires an Act of the Oireachtas or, a very common form, by statutory instrument under the European Communities Act or &mdash; and this is the one that really worries me &mdash; by a departmental circular or a non-statutory scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> In the area of environmental law, we have had implementation by departmental circulars which are not accessible to people, and this is not an adequate manner of implementing law.  It is not a democratic process to have internal departmental circulars as a manner of implementing important issues of law. We need to look at these matters.  We need to have answers to a number of important questions about existing measures. For example, what is Ireland doing about the Community patent convention? We have not implemented that convention.  Is it the view of the current Government, as it has been of previous Governments and of previous Attorneys General, that we require a constitutional amendment?  If we require a constitutional amendment, let us please get on with it.  It seems to be very bad for our image in projecting ourselves as the young, technical technological Ireland if we cannot ratify the Community patent convention.</P>
    <P>When I talked about incorporation by circular, the joint committee recently examined two important directives in the area of public procurement.  One of them had already been passed and the other was about to be passed &mdash; I think it has now been passed at European level &mdash; the public supply and public works directives opening up public contracts and requiring in certain circumstances that they be open to competition from construction businesses in other countries and so on.</P>
    <P>The 1971 basic directives in this area on public procurement were implemented by departmental circular and the joint committee was informed that the intention was that the present directives would also be implemented by departmental circular.  The joint committee in its report criticised this because the changed rules in relation to public procurement is legislating; it is a function of the Oireachtas and I do not think that the Oireachtas is vigilant enough at the moment.  We are not looking at the small print of a vastly important legislative programme while we have a separate Oireachtas programme for our own internal reasons, and then we think it is all <Col N="406" /> going to happen quite comfortably and without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Government have established a working group to monitor developments leading up to 1992.  I doubt if the composition of that working group is addressing some of the issues I have been raising.  It is not affecting the manner in which the Oireachtas is perceiving the importance of the legislative programme, taking it on board politically, adjusting to it and ensuring that we are properly incorporating the various provisions.  It would be helpful if the Minister in his contribution to this debate would set out what are the detailed proposals for implementing the legislative programme which we will be required to put in place by 1992.</P>
    <P>There is another area of a different kind that I would like to mention and I have raised this before.  The Single European Act placed in a treaty framework European Political Co-operation which until then had operated outside the framework of the European Communities. The process of European Political Co-operation is necessarily perhaps a somewhat secretive and unaccountable process but it is worrying that notwithstanding the very widespread debate here on the Single European Act there has not been any process of accountability to the Oireachtas for the matters discussed, for the consensus that may emerge from European Political Co-operation. It is important that we devise structures for reporting back and taking on board what happens in European Political Co-operation because there is a concern in the country and that concern can become a great worry particularly if there is no proper system of accountability. That warrants attention.</P>
    <P>I was listening carefully to the two contributions which preceded my contribution on this debate and I was very interested that the Minister was receiving criticism from both sides of the House of the new tier of regions, for the new approach to the Regional Development Fund.  It is always important for a Minister to be alert to criticism from both sides of the House &mdash; from his own side <Col N="407" /> as well &mdash; when on-the-ground working politicians are saying: &ldquo;Why do we have one region for tourism, one region for transport and now a new region for EC purposes?&rdquo;  It is a very important issue because regions work well when they are cohesive.  They take their strength from a very clear idea of local identity and reference points.  If the boundaries of the region are dictated by the subject matter, whether it is health or transport or tourism or now the new set of regions for EC purposes, a lot of the potential advantage of decentralisation is lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister, like myself, is from Ballina. My impression of Ballina has always been that it is the people of Ballina who know best how to develop whatever it may be.  They cannot take total power into their hands and they work within structures.  That is where the energy, dynamism and real knowledge comes from, at a regional level in the context of the Community's approach to the integrated funding and support in that manner.  It is important to have cohesive clear regions with good structures and good accountability within those regions, and the identity within those regions of all the local authorities and sub-groupings in each of them.  We will not take full advantage of what is a very welcome development at Community level unless we have a proper response here.</P>
    <P>I am going to end with that because I do not want to speak too long on this subject.  I felt it necessary to emphasise the importance of creating a competent structure within the Oireachtas to examine the legislative programme of the Communities in the preparation for 1992. I have become very familiar with the details of that programme in my involvement with the Irish Centre for European Law which Members of the House have been circulised earlier.  That is a charitable company which is preparing the legal profession and allied professions for the challenge of preparing for 1992.  It is spelling out to lawyers, accountants and the corporate sector in the trade union movement what the implications are of particular measures.  It is only because <Col N="408" /> we have concentrated on certain measures that the implications of the programme as a whole have really been borne in on us.</P>
    <P>In my view the legislative programme for 1992 is of much more significance for its impact on Ireland than was our initial joining of the EC.  We absorbed our first adhesion to the EC as a new member state in 1973 much more easily than we are likely to take on board the full thrust of the programme of 1992 and it is extremely important that we realise this and take stock of what the implications are, particularly for the Oireachtas, for the administration and for Government services as a whole.  I hope we will see very constructive proposals in this area and I hope that the Minister in his reply will make it clear that the Government are aware of the need for a very significant response of an institutional nature to the challenge of the internal market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  I propose to deal with the implications for Irish industry on the completion of the Single European Act in 1992.  One of the aims of the Single European Act which was strongly endorsed by the Irish people in the referendum is the establishment of a internal market within the European Community for 1992.  What this essentially means is the removal of all barriers between member states to the free movement of goods, services and people.  I believe that this aim to create an internal market is the most important component of the Single European Act which in hindsight probably did not receive the attention it deserved during the course of the referendum debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The internal market will have major implications for the Irish economy and for employment prospects in this country over the coming years.  It involves the passing of over 300 separate pieces of legislation, practically all of which will have a direct influence in one way or another on this country.  These proposals will include such things as the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties <Col N="409" /> across the Community, the creation of a new European code of company law, the recognition in all other EC countries of degrees and diplomas recorded in one country and the harmonisation of technical standards for products throughout the Community, the abolition of border controls and full and free access in all the 12 member European states.  In other words, after 1992 the Irish commercial sector will have to survive and hopefully prosper in a more competitive environment.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with this, a Chathaoirligh, because, as Senator Robinson said earlier, I believe we have not fully comprehended the implications of the completion of the internal market and it is worthy of further discussion, given this opportunity today.</P>
    <P>The completion of the market is very good news for the Irish consumer.  He or she will be able to pick and choose the best and the cheapest products or services available anywhere within the Community. The wide range of goods and services which will be covered is something which, I think, is not fully understood by many Irish people.  It will apply to such things as buying a new car, getting a loan from a bank, taking out an insurance policy, or buying a new television set.  Not alone will Irish consumers be free to travel to other countries to purchase these goods and services but the manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services in other European countries will be free to come to this country and offer their wares directly to the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>All of this presents a huge challenge to the Irish commercial and industrial sectors.  In the first instance, if they are to hold on to their share of the Irish market then our industrial and commercial sectors will have to be able to compete directly with their counterparts from other members states in the Irish marketplace.  Secondly, and in my view this is more important, we will have opportunities which have been denied to us up to now because of technical barriers, border controls and bureaucratic controls, amongst other things.</P>
    <P>In European terms, Ireland is a small <Col N="410" /> country with a small domestic market, situated on the periphery of the European market of 320 million people.  Our economic policy planners have long recognised this fact and have for many years concentrated on developing an industrial sector which is export-orientated. Our industry is much more dependent on export markets than is the case in the average member state.  For this reason we should welcome the opportunities which the removal of artificial barriers to trade will give to our exporters but we must ask ourselves if we are fully prepared to exploit these opportunities.</P>
    <P>In my view our commercial and industrial sectors have not as yet fully understood what is on the horizon.  There have been precious few indications that Irish companies have been preparing themselves for the new conditions under which they will be trading in the nineties and after the turn of the century.  The lack of activity in this country can be contrasted sharply with events in other countries.  In France, for instance, planning for the advent of the internal market is at the forefront in commerce and industry. Companies there and in many other European countries are taking strategic planning decisions to position themselves properly for these new trading conditions. Small companies are being amalgamated and are entering into co-operation agreements with each other in order to be ready for the onslaught of competition which they are expecting from the big multinationals.</P>
    <P>They are streamlining their production divisions, developing internationally-orientated marketing strategies and joint reseach programmes to prepare new products.  It is time we began to do the same.  Our marketing people, for example, will have to be able to move freely and efficiently throughout a community of 320 million people which uses nine major working languages.  To do this properly and successfully they will have to develop linguistic skills.  Indeed, anybody thinking of a career in marketing in the future would be well advised to give priority to developing a working knowledge of as many European languages as <Col N="411" /> possible.  Production departments in our industries are going to have to streamline and modernise their operations.  I very much doubt if there will be any future for companies which have rigid demarcation lines and restrictive work practices in a fiercely competitive environment which will be the internal market.  Workers will have to be prepared to adopt flexible work practices if their companies and their jobs are to survive.</P>
    <P>These are some of the challenges confronting us in the future.  If we are to meet these challenges successfully and, indeed, to prosper under these new conditions, then it largely depends on the efforts of managements and workers in the industrial and commercial sectors. Our politicians have thrown down a challenge to the leaders of the private sector effectively saying: &ldquo;Prove to us that you can do what you have been long saying; that you can be the powerhouse of the economy; that you can generate employment which we so badly need in this country&rdquo;. I very much hope that the private sector can respond to this challenge.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, now is the time to prepare.  It will be too late in ten years' time.  In the overall context of ensuring that this country has a successful economic role within an internal European market, our national and European politicians have essentially a secondary role to play.  It is their function to ensure that the legislative framework is a fair and just system from a purely Irish point of view and that the conditions under which the internal market is established as well as the structural adjustments which are made are pitched as far as possible in favour of the Irish industrial and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>A I mentioned earlier, Ireland is a peripheral region and in common with most other peripheral regions we have an underdeveloped economy which is too heavily dependent on agriculture, which requires considerable investment to bring our infrastructural and industrial facilities up to the level of the European average and which is also relatively remote from <Col N="412" /> central European markets.  Some measures agreed in the European institutions and others under discussion are intended to help economies like ours to overcome these disadvantages.  The decision to double the size of the Structural Funds is a good example of this type of measure. This will ensure that there are considerably more funds available from Brussels to improve our basic infrastructural systems such as our roads, our communication systems, as well as making a lot more money available for industrial and technical training.</P>
    <P>Another positive example of political decisions made in Brussels concerns the transport sector.  Because of our remoteness from major population centres, reduced transport costs are vital for this country.  The recent agreement to liberalise air transport has caused substantial reductions in the cost of getting to and from Europe.  This has very obvious benefits for our tourism industry but it is also very important for small and medium-size industries trying to establish contacts and trying to generate exports to Europe on very limited budgets.  Practically all our industry is in the small and medium size sector, which means companies with fewer than 500 employees.  It is this type of company which is most handicapped by border controls, bureaucratic, administrative and technical obstacles which the internal market is intended to eliminate.</P>
    <P>The European Community is at present putting together a whole range of legislative and practical proposals designed to assist these companies to take full advantage of the new trading conditions. This is being done because it is generally recognised that the big multinational companies have the resources available to take full advantage of a single unified market, whereas the smaller companies often do not.  The type of measures being discussed at present includes such things as encouraging co-operation among these companies in the areas of marketing and research into new products, the establishment of European data <Col N="413" /> bases on research and market opportunities, the development of new company legal structures, and the development of opportunities to raise venture capital as well as a wide range of other measures.  Irish companies will have to acquaint themselves fully with these proposals and will have to involve themselves fully in these programmes as they have been established.  Otherwise, they will be left behind.  This is particularly so in three areas, research, market access and investment.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems which Irish industry will have to overcome is in attracting investment into the country. Foreign investors, naturally enough, will ask why they should invest in this country, located on the periphery of the Community, relatively remote from the main population centres.  We will only be able to overcome this natural disadvantage if we can show that our industry is at the forefront of research into new products, is as innovative in its approach to new products as anywhere else in the Community, that we are as fully aware of market opportunities as the new information technologies will allow and that our workforce is as highly motivated and adaptable as anywhere else in the Community.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should be clear in our minds about one thing and that is that we are very welcome members of the Community.  We joined primarily because we needed the Community, not because they needed us.  Europe has been very good to us, particularly as far as our agricultural industry is concerned.  We have received substantial assistance to modernise and develop our economy and we can look forward to increased assistance in the coming years.  As far as the internal market is concerned, we will be given the same opportunities as anybody else.  We are being invited into a market of 320 million of the most affluent consumers in the world.  In return, we must give European industry and commerce the same access to our market.  Our response to this challenge and more particularly the response of our private <Col N="414" /> sector, both the management and workforce will, I believe, largely determine the pace of our economic development and the employment prospects of our citizens over the coming decades.</P>

      <P>If anybody is sufficiently interested in future years &mdash; perhaps a student in UCC doing a minor dissertation on Independent Senators in the 1970s and 1980s &mdash; and is disposed to look up my name under the index in the bound debates of Seanad Éireann, he or she will find relatively little on what I had to say in debates on these periodic reports that have been coming before us now for a long time.  In fact, I must admit that the general tenor of my contributions was negative in that I was never enthusiastic about membership of the Community and I must confess to a fault there.  I was what I would describe as &ldquo;a little Irelander&rdquo;.  In recent weeks I felt a great affinity for the kind of things that Mrs. Thatcher was saying in Bruges and indeed I felt that it is one of the paradoxes of the Anglo-Irish relationship that it needs a Tory and, one might almost say, an anti-Irish British Prime Minister to remind us of our nationalist commitments and of the danger of becoming super-Europeans and being over-optimistic about what can be achieved.</P>
      <P>But, I have changed.  I accept the Community is inevitable, there can be no going back now and to that extent I am a belated participant in these debates.  I would like to think I occupy a middle ground now or I am moving towards it, between the purely negative anti-Europeans and those who are too starry-eyed in their optimism, in my view, and who are, perhaps, far too deferential in their attitudes towards what I call without any apology our paymasters and our superior partners in the Community.  I would like to move towards a middle ground there, to explore the possibilities arising out of the last year and at the same time to warn against tendencies which, as an Irish person, I would find difficult to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to move on, when I resume the debate, to the wider ground.  Other people have dealt very competently with <Col N="415" /> the commercial implications.  Senator Robinson has given us proper warning about our lack of legal commercial preparations. I would like to speculate about where we go from here in the larger philosophy of the Community, and this is my final part, because even though the Senator is right in saying that it is only now we begin to realise how unprepared we are compared with the rather facile decision in 1973 to become a member, at the same time it is also true that it is only now that we begin to discern the possible scenarios opening up in Europe and the possible shape of the future Community which we were not able to see until now. The events of the past year helped us very much to make an effective contribution to that kind of debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the growing public concern at the lack of full accountability by registered Irish charities urges the Government to take <Col N="416" /> the necessary steps to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>This motion was promoted by the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme some months ago.  It highlighted the dubious activities of some of our most respected charities and exposed some of the fraudulent activities of others.  The RTE programme and its revelations caused considerable public disquiet and concern, so much so that confidence and trust in very many of our established charities has been seriously undermined.  This is a matter of great regret as the numerous legitimate charities operating in Ireland play a very important and, might I say, a vital role in relieving distress, aiding the sick and indigent, financing research, working for the handicapped, among other great projects.  Were their future to be jeopardised, the Government could well be faced with a serious drain on their own resources to fill the gap.  Recognising this fact and ever conscious of the need for charitable organisations, all of us in this House must adopt a very responsible attitude in everything we say on this motion.  With that in mind I shall try to be responsible in my analysis of the present position.</P>
    <P>In researching this subject I must say I was appalled at the paucity of information available about charities.  As far as I could ascertain, anyone can set up a charity and gain charitable status.  I learned that charities are governed by the following Acts: the Charities Act, 1961; the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962; the Income Tax Act, 1967, sections 333 and 334; the Charities Act, 1973 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, sections 27 and 28.</P>
    <P>The Charities Act, 1961, merely deals with any charitable bequest or devise and does not provide for the supervision or monitoring of the activities of charities. The Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962, merely deals with collection permits and is mainly concerned with illegal organisations.  A permit is only refused if the collection is for unlawful purposes or purposes contrary to public morality.  The Charities Act, 1973, <Col N="417" /> is merely concerned with extending the powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and amending the 1961 Charities Act.  The Income Tax Act, 1967, in sections 333 and 334, provides for exemption from tax for a body of persons established for charitable purposes in respect of income applied to those charitable purposes.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, concerns itself with the issuing of Garda permits and court licences to hold lotteries. In fact, those are the main controls we have over charities, the only forms of control I could find that we have over charities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The RTE programme highlighted the many undesirable aspects of charitable collections of which the public had up to then been unaware.  I do not know, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, if you saw the programme but it certainly exposed some, shall we say, flaws in the system that allowed charities of dubious origin and questionable objectives to operate without let or hindrance and, more importantly, it showed how unscrupulous people can exploit the generosity of an unsuspecting public.  We would all agree that the Irish as a people are the most generous in the world, responding magnificently whenever the need arises and the greatest tribute to their generosity was when Ireland contributed more to Band Aid in proportion to its population than any other country in the world, including the most affluent states like Britain, the United States, France, Germany or Japan.  We were in the forefront, ahead of all those nations.  It is a great tribute to the generosity of the Irish.  The generosity of the Irish is also seen in the support for such organisations as GOAL, Trócaire, Concern, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the ISPCC, to name just a few.  Many others like them could not function without such great public generosity.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, we must ensure that this great generosity is not unscrupulously exploited.  Charities are now big business with little or no control or public accountability.  The whole area is so lax that it is astonishing that there is not <Col N="418" /> widespread abuse, human nature being what it is, but perhaps there is widespread abuse and it has not yet come to light. The RTE programme could do no more than touch the tip of the iceberg, working as it had to within so many constraints.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the charity business may be as high as £100 million each year, but we do not know exactly how much is involved, we are merely hazarding a guess as there are no public accounts, no proper disclosures of moneys collected and, indeed, it may be twice that amount.</P>
    <P>In Britain the charity commissioners investigate and check abuses and maintain a register of charities.  Local authorities in Britain co-operate with this central register in keeping a register of charities within their own jurisdiction. They are constantly informed, from the central register, of changes that may take place.  We do not have such controls on charities in this country.</P>
    <P>Concern over the laxity of approach to charity was voiced by a number of Members of the Dáil in recent times. Deputy Michael O'Kennedy tabled a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, on 17 April 1986.  He asked the Minister if he would indicate the number of charities already exempt from liability to income tax under sections 333 and 334 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, replied, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 365, column 1206.</P>
    <P>A body of persons established for charitable purposes only may claim exemption from tax under the provisions of sections 333 and 334 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in respect of income applied to those charitable purposes. Charity exemption has been available in this country since the extension of income tax to Ireland in 1853 and the latest available information from the papers still extant and retained in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is that charitable status for tax purposes was granted in 4,432 cases and refused in 495 cases.  The <Col N="419" /> Revenue Commissioners have not compiled a record of approved cases which are still in existence and for which tax which would otherwise be directly assessed has been foregone and do not have a record of charities which have ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is not possible to determine the number of approved cases in existence and benefiting from the exemption provided for under section 333 (1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>That is an admission from a Minister for Finance, that we know nothing about these charities.  All we know is that they are granted tax exemptions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tabled a Parliamentary Question on 19 April 1988 to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins. He asked the Minister his views on whether it is necessary to review and amend the law in relation to charities in Ireland; and if he would indicate his proposals in this regard.  The Minister said in reply, and I quote from the Official Report, volume 379, column 1177:</P>
    <P>My responsibility in relation to charities is confined to three areas: (a) the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973 which provide for the jurisdiction and powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in relation to charitable trusts; (b) the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962 provide for the issue of Garda permits to take up collections in specified areas and, (c) the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, sections 27 and 28 of which provide for the issue of Garda permits and court licences, respectively, to hold lotteries.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, I could not undertake, in response to a Parliamentary Questions, to indicate what my views were in relation to the amendment of the law in particular areas.  Proposals in this regard are <Col N="420" /> announced in the ordinary way following Government approval only. However, I can say that I have no proposals at present in relation to the areas of law covering charities for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe then said to the Minister, to put his mind at rest, that he should point out he was directing his question to him on the basis that when it was originally addressed to the Taoiseach he referred it to him.  He asked the Minister if he would accept that the charity business was very large indeed and if he would accept that because of the problems obtaining in that area, with no statutory definition of what constitutes a charity or any system of registration such as obtains in other countries, there was cause for concern, in particular about the activities of professional fundraisers and, in those circumstances, was action not necessary. He also asked the Minister if he would accept that this was particularly worrying for the genuine people involved in the charity area who rely on public trust and confidence, who had raised these various concerns and that action was necessary in response to those concerns.  The Minister in reply said, and this is most important, and I quote from the Official Report, volume 379, column 1178:</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I outlined in my reply my responsibility in this area.  The Deputy is also aware of the fact that there are a number of other Government Departments with a significant involvement in the area of charities.  For example, some health related charities are grant-aided by the Department of Health.  The Department of Finance are responsible for taxes and legislation in respect of charities. The Department of Foreign Affairs would have to be consulted in relation to charities providing aid to the Third World.  The Department of Social Welfare are responsible for inter-action with St. Vincent de Paul type groups.  I mention that for the information of the Deputy and in order to allow him to appreciate my responsibility in this area.  Of course I am aware <Col N="421" /> of the position obtaining.  I am aware there was a television programme presented recently that caused certain disquiet in this area.</P>
    <P>&mdash; there is the Minister for Justice admitting there was disquiet about the problem &mdash;</P>
    <P>I am also aware of proposals that were submitted by Gorta in April 1987 with regard to specific changes they have been asked be considered.  I am aware also of the Deputy's efforts, when in Government, to give the matter attention.  I am aware, for example, of his proposals for an interdepartmental committee &mdash; I think it was back in 1986 &mdash; which he tried to get underway.  I readily understand the reasons such committee did not get off the ground.  Because I am concerned I am examining a number of areas at present.  When I am in a position to bring proposals to Government I will do so and shall make an announcement in due course.</P>
    <P>We got that far.  On the advice of the Minister for Labour, he suggested that the Revenue Commissioners have full responsibility for this whole area.  I submitted a list of questions to the Revenue Commissioners early this year.  I asked them quite a number of questions: what procedure must be followed by an applicant wishing to apply for the status of charity?  Are there any guidelines laid down by which applications for such status are assessed?  If there are no guidelines laid down, on what basis is a decision reached on whether to grant this status? Once status has been granted, is it for the life of the charity or is it reassessed and renewed and, if so, at what time intervals? If the accounts of charities are not published, do the Revenue Commissioners inspect such accounts and if so, how often?  Do the Revenue Commissioners regularly assess that charities which have been granted status are still operating and functioning as stated on the original application?  In other words, have the objectives of any of these charities been changed without the knowledge <Col N="422" /> or the consent of the Revenue Commissioners? Is the status of charity ever withdrawn and, if so, under what conditions? How many, if any, charities have had their status withdrawn in the last ten years?  How many charities have been granted the status of charity and also what number were granted this status in each of the last ten years?  Are charities who have been granted status obliged to account for all moneys received and state in what manner they were received, for example, through donations, street and house collections, etc?  Are charities which have been granted such status obliged to account to the Revenue Commissioners for all moneys spent and in what manner this money was spent?  Do the Revenue Commissioners examine such spending to ensure that it was spent in accordance with the objectives of the charity?  If such spending is examined and found not to be in accordance with the charitable aims of the organisation will the status of charity be withdrawn?  Are all moneys and property owned by the charity exempt from tax and, if this is not the case, under what circumstances would moneys or property be liable for tax?</P>
    <P>To give the Revenue Commissioners their due, they went to considerable trouble to get the information I required. I received a letter from them within a few days saying:</P>
    <P>Charity in its legal sense means, broadly, a body established for charitable purposes only.  Under a leading Irish case, charities have been classified, in line with the decision in an earlier British case, as being for the relief of poverty, for the advancement of education, for the advancement of religion, and for other purposes beneficial to the community not falling under any of the preceding heads.</P>
    <P>That would appear to me to cover every eventuality.  The reply went on:</P>
    <P>Non-trading income arising to and chargeable capital gains accruing to, (e.g. an estate, interest or right) taken by, a body approved as a charity by <Col N="423" /> the Revenue Commissioners under the relevant statutory provisions are exempted from Irish tax where such income or gains or benefits are applied to or taken for charitable purposes only.</P>
    <P>Again, that is a very broad definition, entitling the charity to do as it likes with the money.  It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Charitable bodies do not enjoy exemptions from tax on trading profits except in a limited number of cases where, for example, the trade is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the charity. Persons engaged in the performance of the activities of a charitable body are entitled to benefit by way of remuneration or compensation for services performed or for reimbursement of expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>Again there is no indication of what these costs should amount to, what the remuneration should be and what proportion of the income should be applied for administrative purposes.  It said they are specifically debarred from otherwise sharing in the profits or property of the charitable body.</P>
    <P>It stated that the application should be made in writing to the claims branch, along with a governing deed of establishment, that is, a charitable deed of trust, constitution, rule, articles and memoranda of association, etc., depending on the nature of the body established. In addition, a copy of the most recently audited accounts should be applied.  In the case of a new charity this would not exist.  Applications would be examined to ensure their objects are in accordance with one or more, usually one of the four, of the categories laid down by the courts. These objects must be for charitable purposes only or else the body concerned would not be regarded as coming within the scope of the Act.  The body itself must therefore say that it is being established for charitable purposes only and that would entitle them to benefit.  Thus <Col N="424" /> entitlement to exemption for tax purposes would be granted where the objects are for charitable purposes only and this would be dependent on the income arising being applied solely to the charitable purposes expressed.  In other words, though a body may be granted charitable exemption, unless it applied its income to the pursuit of its charitable objective the income would not be regarded as exempt.  Furthermore, only such income as is applied to these purposes would be exempt.</P>
    <P>It went on to state that status for tax purposes of a trust established for charitable purposes only would be determined by its governing objects and if these change a review of the position may be required.  Otherwise the charitable status would continue for the life of the charity.</P>
    <P>The next point raised is a very salient one.  It states that this position is not monitored.  However, charitable bodies are required to keep accounts and these are requested in some cases to verify the application of the income to charitable purposes only.  That is the sum total of the monitoring that takes place.  It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>As the establishment of a body of trust for charitable purposes only is mainly designed to avoid tax on income or capital gains the question of withdrawing relief for tax purposes only arises in exceptional circumstances unless, as previously indicated, the objects are amended.</P>
    <P>As charitable exemption has been available in Ireland since 1853 it is difficult to ascertain precisely how many charities exist.  Of some 6,800 applications by 1986 papers available for research indicated 4,432 exemptions allowed and 495 cases refused (about 10 per cent).</P>
    <P>It points out that the assumption is that the balance of the remainder were also rejected.  The papers have not been retained, therefore, they cannot be sure. Many of the bodies granted exemption would have long ceased to exist so they do not know the true picture.  It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> However, from 1976 to 1986, a period of ten years, there has been a total of 737 applications processed. Since then in 1986-87 and 1987-88 some 1,231 and 658 applications were processed &mdash; a considerable increase. Most of these cases emerged by virtue of the imposition of the DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax).</P>
    <P>It further goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Staffing arrangements do not permit the monitoring of day-to-day financial transactions of all charitable bodies. Specific cases are, of course, examined where information is available which suggests that the conditions of approval for tax exemption purposes are not being or are not likely to be met.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from this there is great laxity in dealing with this area, which has become quite a big business in this country.  It has become patently obvious to me that we must restore public confidence without delay.  To do this we need action at legislative level to ensure that there be compulsory registration subject to certain exceptions, and that a register of charities would be open to the public at all reasonable hours.  There must be full public accountability.  There must be proper supervision.  We must have new rules and regulations governing their establishment and operation and we must have annual audited accounts detailing income receipts, administrative costs and disbursements.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing could not possibly be objected to by any legitimate, properly motivated, properly run, genuine charitable organisation.  What I am proposing will merely eliminate those fraudulent organisations who are seeking to exploit public generosity.  What I am proposing will ensure that laxity in the running of charitable organisations, even well established ones, will cease.  It is mandatory on us as legislators to bring a sense of order and control into this whole area because as charities have extensive fiscal privileges granted by the Oireachtas the onus is on the Oireachtas to ensure <Col N="426" /> that they comply strictly with the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are small bodies operating with limited income and receipts and we must not do anything to make life difficult for these small bodies who are trying to help in their local areas. We must, above all, protect them.  It should be possible without altering the basic concept of what I would like done to provide exemptions for these small bodies who do great work on a small scale.  I would like to see, where permits are issued, that they confine their activities to the particular area.  For months and months I had someone coming to my area to sell tickets for some place in Portarlington.  I often wondered what was built because this went on for almost a year.  They were selling tickets for some place for the mentally handicapped in Portarlington and nobody ever knew what happened to the money.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see some kind of limit put on administrative costs.  When the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes were established a limit was set on administrative costs and this ensured that a considerable proportion of the funds were given over to the hospitals.  I feel we should apply the same kind of rule to charities.  This would be doing a great service.  I was displeased with one organisation as shown on a television programme who had told its collectors to lie to the RTE people and not to tell them how much commission they were getting. They pretended they were going it all on a voluntary basis and this was found to be incorrect.  Some of the collectors finally agreed to tell the reporters what happened. That kind of activity should be disapproved of.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party members in the Seanad I am suggesting five guidelines that could be introduced.  One Department of Government must accept responsibility for this area because we cannot have the responsibility for charities spread over so many Departments. One person must accept responsibility for them.  It should not be beyond the Government's ability to come up with some simple guidelines in regard to the <Col N="427" /> operation of charities.  If this is done it will allay public disquiet and bring back again the confidence and trust that people had in charities in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to formally second the motion.  In doing so, I wish to say that I am in somewhat of a dilemma because what exactly constitutes a charity is extremely difficult to define.  The nearest thing to the definition of a &ldquo;charity&rdquo; is contained in a definition going back as far as 1601, a very loose definition.  As Senator O'Connell has said, anything could constitute authority.  I will quote from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8 December 1982.  It stated:</P>
      <P>Anyone in Ireland can start a charity. All you need is a collection box, a cause and a generous public.  If your cause is a Third World dilemma all the better.  You will not be hampered by official inquisitiveness.  There is no official watchdog in Ireland to keep check on charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>I am saddened that that article included the Third World as a specific charitable development because a lot of organisations do fantastic work for the Third World. As Senator O'Connell said, Ireland showed exactly what it is made of by the contributions to the Band Aid collections and the other organisations specifically geared towards Third World fund raising. The charities I have in mind would not, effectively, have anything to do with Third World fund raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise that the Irish public are renowned for their generosity in respect of charities.  Not a day goes by without the public being asked to subscribe to some charity.  At all the churches on Sundays there are all kinds of fund raising efforts on behalf of different charities.  If on Sunday you were to ask for what charity the collection had been made the previous week, very few people would be able to tell you.  One sees a <Col N="428" /> collection box and subscribes to it.  One buys tickets in the same way, one does not question.  In that area, we are a generous nation and for that reason there is great difficulty in defining fund raising for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>In theory, charities are subject to law like any other organisation but the implementation of the law is extremely difficult.  Since we do not know how many charitable organisations there are in Ireland, it would be very difficult to quantify exactly the number of charitable organisations because it is difficult to define what is a charitable organisation. It would appear that charities are a law unto themselves.  There is no official register of charities in Ireland.  In other countries the situation is different.  A registered charity is a definable entity with a recognised status which is subject to definite checks.  A number of charities in this category define themselves as &ldquo;registered charities&rdquo;.  Most of those are genuine, but there is the problem that some, through deliberate misrepresentation with a view to establishing themselves as respectable, would have motives that would be very questionable.</P>
    <P>There can also be confusion where an Irish organisation is a branch of a British-based registered charity.  It has been argued that some system of charity registration should be established in Ireland &mdash; this is the area Senator O'Connell is referring to and is advocating.  I sympathise and go a long way with him, but there are problems in relation to registration of charities.  The argument for the registration of charities would be that, initially, it would protect the public, that there would be accountability, that there would be eligibility for fiscal reliefs and that they would have recognised status.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in Britain the registration system in operation is far from being an unqualified success; yet we must have some type of mechanism to ensure our people are protected. Whether registration is the answer is a matter for debate but the idea that with a registered charity the public knows where it stands is not true.  A registration system can only be effective where the <Col N="429" /> registration authority have resources to properly monitor the activities of the registered charities.  There are disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell referred to one in particular, that is, the formalised structure where small local groups would be overawed by the amount of work involved in establishing themselves as a charity.  For a register of charities there would have to be certain minimum structures set up.  A vast number of small local charities set up for a number of different activities would not qualify under this type of minimum structure.  In any registration, small local groups would have to be protected.</P>
    <P>I have to disagree with the Senator in relation to these local groups going far afield to get revenue for their activities. In rural Ireland the community spirit has to be appreciated and the people have to be congratulated on their efforts.  We are talking about very small local communities who take pride in their own place and decide to do something to develop facilities in the area.  If they were to rely on the finances available to them through fund raising in their local area, they would fall far short of the finance needed to fulfil their ideas and aspirations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell need not be too worried about the small rural organisations because they are genuine.  If there is any place where a tight rein is kept on funds, it is in those groups.  I would be far more concerned with the larger charitable institutions which have more room for manoeuvre.  That is one of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Then there is the rigid definition of a &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  What is a charity?  If you register one, how do you define exactly what a charity is because in doing so you might exclude legitimate charities if they do not fulfil the obligations laid down in the description of a charity.  Another disadvantage would be the expense of registration and staffing.  In Great Britain there is a registration monitoring committee with a staff of 300, and they are said to be under-staffed.  We are talking about a huge staffing problem if we are to regulate this properly.  In the Irish context the establishment of a registration <Col N="430" /> system is not sufficient unless the registration authority is properly funded and the law on charities is clarified and modernised. The real crunch is not really the registration of charities but to try to regulate the fund raising activities of the different charities.  That is where the difficulty lies.  The most pressing issue is the control of the fund raising activities of specific charities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Senator O'Connell said in relation to registered charities and relief for tax purposes.  Some charities get relief for tax purposes but they do not get relief for rates.  There seems to be a conflict in that area.  Only in that context would I see the registration being of importance.  What I would be concerned with is fund raising activities, because if you can control the fund raising activities of the different charities then you need not worry because you will know what exactly is happening to these funds.  If there is a specific mechanism to monitor that, registration will follow without any problem.</P>
    <P>It is not so much a question of regulating genuine charitable fund raising as it is of ensuring that funds raised for allegedly charitable purposes are used for such purposes.  It has been suggested in a number of cases that little or none of the money raised ended up in the charity for which it was raised.  We all know of instances where that can happen.  On that line, I have to disagree totally with the professional ticket sellers, where most of the money collected end up in the sellers pockets.  It is interesting that in law a person who gets a permit or licence is not supposed to derive any personal profit from that fund raising, but in practice very little checking is done.  At the very least these ticket sellers should carry identification cards.  In a sense the public are a little at fault because very few of us ask for identification when people come selling different things.  Maybe people are coming round to this system of checking now in order to make sure that they are bona fide sellers.</P>
    <P>It would also seem that once a permit or licence is granted there is no facility to revoke that licence.  The only remedy is that the courts or a superintendent can refuse if that charity apply for a licence <Col N="431" /> to do something else.  The consequences of the activities of these professional ticket sellers is that the public will be increasingly wary of all ticket sellers. That would be a very unfortunate development because there are quite a number of organisations which do absolutely fantastic work and it would be a very unfair and very unfortunate development if they were coupled with these professional ticket sellers.</P>
    <P>The amount of effort, enthusiasm and dedication by local volunteers that goes into the development of facilities, whether they be for St. Vincent de Paul or whatever is enormous and must be appreciated.  It would be very unfortunate if they were to be coupled with professional ticket sellers, because the losers would be the genuine charities.  A proper balance must be struck between protecting the public and restricting the fund raising capacity of charities.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the solution to this problem is or whether legislation and registration of charities is the answer, but it is time something was done.  Initially, what I would like to see is a working group set up to investigate the system as to what constitutes a charity, how registration would be implemented, how to protect bona fide local communities in their fund raising efforts, and so on. However, before that would happen one would have to give careful thought to exactly what is the best method of protecting the general public.  The time has come to set about remedying the situation that exists at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this motion has been placed on the agenda for this evening.  Senator O'Connell has examined in great detail the question of public charities and their present lack of accountability.  I would agree with his definition of charity that it covers every eventuality that can be perceived in all walks of life.  All of us are aware of the enormous voluntary and community effort that takes place in each parish in rural Ireland in particular.  It would be fair to say that the country is being run on lotteries of all descriptions at the moment.  The fact that this is such big <Col N="432" /> business today means that proper controls and proper accountability were never more important or more essential in the discharge and the expenditure of these funds and the nature of the projects involved.</P>
      <P>On a motion like this, it is only right that we should pay tribute to the enormous voluntary effort which is commonplace in many parts of the country, in organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Concern, the Simon Community and Gorta.  These organisations have collected enormous amounts of money through their voluntary efforts.  The consciousness of the Irish people being what it is, they have responded generously to the many national and international crises for which fund raising was so essential.  The need to scrutinise how this money is spent is certainly important now when one considers the huge amount of money and the huge growth industry that has developed in this area over the years.</P>
      <P>In my own area, the development of charitable work is very well and long established &mdash; the Ossory Social Services and the SOS Workshops have been doing tremendous work for the physically and mentally handicapped.  That is an example of local communities coming together where they see a particular need and devising fund raising activities with State support, to provide the necessary and proper facilities for the unfortunate in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting also that the extension of many of our public charity works has led to employment creation, especially in the area of community enterprise.  In many communities there are people coming together voluntarily lending their expertise and support to those who are trying to establish community enterprise businesses for the first time.  The fund raising activities we normally associate with charitable work, such as famine relief and poverty, has now extended to the area of employment and job creation.  It is not surprising that this has happened in view of the enormous level of unemployment in many communities at the moment and the huge level of emigration, particularly in rural Ireland.  People with expertise are <Col N="433" /> coming together to draw up programmes of employment creation to keep people at home and to stop the emigration flood of our young people in particular to the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia.  The public have a right to know whether this money will be given to the enterprise it is supposed to support or whether the finance raised locally will be used for the purpose originally intended.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell, quite rightly, raised these important questions.  It is very difficult to find a solution because no matter where or how you try to draw up regulations to ensure accountability there are loopholes and people will be very fast to spot them and get round the regulations.  Even though the Revenue Commissioners have a role in relation to the definition of charitable status for taxation purposes, nevertheless they are a bit far removed from the smaller public charities we are trying to cover in this debate this evening.  Perhaps they would be in a better position to scrutinise the records and the accounts of larger charitable organisations, such as those I mentioned earlier, but the role of the Revenue Commissioners in community-based public charity programmes is certainly a non-starter.  One is dependent on the goodwill and bona fides of the local people who are actively involved in the organisation.  If there are trustworthy persons at the helm in a community that is as much as the public can expect.  To put our trust in a fellow human being at the head of any organisation is as far as we can go.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna laid the blame fairly and squarely on our own shoulders when he said we do not query the charity or seek identification when people ask for contributions at the door.  The public must be awakened to the fact that abuses are taking place, and that they will take place if they continue to adopt a very laid back approach.  On a Saturday morning it is not unusual in any urban area to have a number of callers asking for subscriptions or contributions to various projects.</P>
    <P>I was awakened on a Saturday morning by a knock on the door and when I opened the door an individual asked for a <Col N="434" /> subscription to support a very noteworthy and important community enterprise scheme in Dublin.  I live 75 miles from Dublin.  People are so taken up with trying to raise funds that they must go further afield to tap another source of finance.  That is why people from as far away as Dublin travel to places like Kilkenny to try to get contributions.</P>
    <P>The national lottery is a very important and topical issue as regards the disbursement and accountability of funds. The revenue to be raised through the national lottery was estimated at £10 million when the Bill was enacted in 1986.  It has surpassed all expectations and £70 million is the amount at the disposal of the Government.  What I hate most about politics is hypocrisy.  As regards public accountability, we as politicians must get our act in order and give a lead to charity organisations.  I would like to see more public accountability in relation to the disbursement of national lottery funds built into the legislation.  The danger is that these lotteries will lose their attractiveness and this will mean a reduction in the amount of money available for the objectives originally intended as well as the amount going into the coffers of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to interrupt the Senator, but we had a protracted debate on the narrow question of the lottery.  While a passing reference is in order, the Chair hopes you will not dwell on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking accountability for the disbursement of funds to public charities.  I think Senator O'Connell would agree that the money being given through the national lottery to the various organisations, is doing tremendous work in the community, but the accountability, assessment and criteria by which those disbursements are made leave a lot to be desired.  I am merely taking this opportunity to point out to the State that if we want to get accountability from charitable organisations and institutions, the least we can expect is that the State, and the Government, would put their own house in order by ensuring greater accountability to the general <Col N="435" /> public in relation to moneys being disbursed through the national lottery.  We have to forget that we are disbursing what could be called confetti money.  The number of communities and charities looking for help from any type of lottery, national or local, is so enormous that I have no hesitation in saying the country is being run on lotteries.  This is probably due to cutbacks in expenditure which are essential from the economic point of view, but the cutbacks themselves leave gaps that must be filled by other means. Lotteries are the way in which people normally go about filling that vacuum.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware there were sufficient funds from the Department of Social Welfare for disbursement to various charities and communities and that was a means of accounting for the way that money was disbursed.  Everybody knew, through the Oireachtas, where moneys were going, and public attention was drawn to the fact that moneys were being spent in a certain area through a particular Department.  For example, if money is being given by the Department of the Environment, the local authorities should administer it; if the money is given by the Department of Health, then the health boards should have a role to play. In that way, we would have greater accountability at local level because it would be clearly seen where the money was being spent.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, our people have a tremendous awareness of the need to assist others in need.  Probably the best examples were Band Aid and Self Aid. Even today, there is the enormous effort being organised by Concern and GOAL for Sudan relief.  This has brought Ireland's reputation in relation to public charity work an international dimension that could not have been foreseen when we were introducing legislation to control the operations of charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as Senator O'Connell said, we have to go back many centuries to find the loose definition of charity, then it is about time we reviewed the legislation to tidy up and tighten the definition of public charity.  In this connection I think it is important that this debate has taken place.  The lack of supervision in respect <Col N="436" /> of moneys donated to charities is disturbing and there is a public unease as to where this money could finally end up. There is a danger that if money gets into the wrong account public confidence could be seriously curtailed.</P>
    <P>The registration and record of charities is one way of knowing exactly which charities are on the record books.  It will not stop people from devising ways to subvert the legislation, but at least it would be a step in the right direction. The procedure by which charitable status can be gained could be examined in the context of a review of legislation.  The monitoring role that was mentioned by Senator McKenna could be concentrated on, but the most telling point he made was when he said that the regulation of the fundraisers and the fund raising activities that are being carried out by the individual communities and individual organisations, are matters that we must home in on.  We have a habit of putting the cart before the horse in imposing legislation at national level which will have little or no bearing at the end of the day on small rural organisations or communities who are trying to assist a charitable event.  If we have control over the activities in which the individuals are involved then we will go a long way towards regulating this disturbing development and continue to ensure that the public will have confidence in charitable organisations and public charities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator O'Connell on bringing this motion before the House.  There is a great deal of public concern about the lack of accountability of charities.  The Irish public has a noble record regarding the support of a diverse range of worthy causes.  The Christian tradition of the country and the basic decency of the people have gained us the respect of people across the globe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background it is deeply worrying that grave questions of accountability in relation to charitable organisations have arisen.  The many genuine and committed individuals involved in such concerns rely on public trust and esteem.  Recent revelations dealing with activities of some charities have led to a shadow of suspicion being cast over many <Col N="437" /> organisations regardless of whether it is deserved or not.</P>
    <P>Of primary importance is the issue of control of charitable endeavours.  Following the publication of the results of investigative journalism suggesting that all of the funds donated in good faith do not find their way to their intended destination, public confidence has been undermined.  Charges that payments are made from funds to collectors lower the esteem in which registered charities are held.  It is lamentable that well-known bodies with excellent track records should find themselves tarnished by general accusations and face a situation of guilt by association.  Even more insidious is the charge that laudable causes are used to attract contributions while the total amount does not go to the cause used to publicise the event.  This results in reduced public satisfaction with the existing system of permits and licences as a means of controlling the activities of charities.  Senators leaving this House and walking down any street in the main shopping areas of this city will see unsealed and often insubstantial collection receptacles in use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose that funds from the national lottery be made available as a matter of urgency for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin recently destroyed by fire.  I hope to be uncharacteristically brief, because I have been asked by a number of Senators from all sides of the House if they may <Col N="438" /> have some time.  So, I wish to speak for eight minutes and yield two minutes to Senator Jack Fitzsimons, Fianna Fáil Senator Shane Ross, Independent, Senator Catherine Bulbulia, Fine Gael, Senator Brian O'Shea, the Labour Party, Senator John Robb, the Taoiseach's nominee, and Senator Joe O'Toole, Independent.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, first of all, that I approach this important matter in a non-triumphalist fashion.  The fact that there has recently been a European court judgment in my favour is a coincidence. I do not wish this to be seen in any sense as a particularly controversial or sensational request for lottery funding.  I also think it appropriate that it should come to this House because although I have kept aside from the recent political controversy about the dispersal of lottery funds I believe that all parties agree that the Oireachtas has an advisory role in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Hirschfeld Centre was founded in 1979.  It was opened on St. Patrick's Day, the official opening being performed by Dr. Noel Browne, former Minister for Health.  Dr. Browne has a celebrated memory in this country because of his campaign against TB.  We are now fighting a comparable battle against a disease called AIDS and one of the important elements of the work of the Hirschfeld Centre was spearheading the fight against AIDS.  Responsible people, including prominent politicians, have paid tribute to the vital role played by the Hirschfeld Centre in forming a focus from which the gay community could fight back against this infection. The centre is called after a very celebrated German doctor who formed an institute for the study of sexual science and was persecuted by Adolf Hitler.  It was the first such centre in the world to be established but there are now two in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was financed originally by money provided by myself.  It was inevitably under-capitalised and the income required to keep the place going was generated by running discotheques.  Upon this revenue we paid VAT and other taxes and I have before me details of the tax paid by the Hirschfeld Centre <Col N="439" /> amounting currently to £107,300.89p.  I make the point that we are not looking for anything extraordinary; we are heavy taxpayers, our operation has always been above-board.</P>
    <P>The kind of services we provide are a telephone counselling service which operates in consultation with the Samaritans. The statistics on calls are revealing. From 1974 to 1979 there were 3,992; from 1979 to 1980 there were 1,556; from 1980 to 1981 there were 1,716; in 1981-82, 1,953; 1982-83, 1,426; 1983-84, 2,293; 1984-85, 3,088; 1985-86, 3,703; 1986-87, 4,427; 1987-88, 3,733 &mdash; the first year in which there was a decline as a result of a disastrous fire that occurred almost a year ago to this day.  This has deprived the gay community of an extremely important asset, something that provides a positive environment in which people can come to terms with themselves.</P>
    <P>We also provide a service known as parents' inquiry in which the parents of young people who are discovered to be gay can deal with the trauma they face as parents.  Again, this has been welcomed by social workers, by religious leaders of all denominations and by a number of politicians.</P>
    <P>The centre was open to gay and non-gay people and we had distinguished visitors from all sections of the community and from all religious persuasions.  I think it important also to point out that last week the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights passed unanimously a motion recommending that the Minister should spend lottery money in this way. I make the point that lottery money has been made available to community groups.  We are a real such community in the country.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Hirschfeld Centre operates as a national focus, not just for people in Dublin but for people throughout the entire country.  When I place on record that an application of the Kinsey statistics, the survey conducted in America in the forties which has since been justified in every other country in which such survey was done, indicates that 10 per cent of the adult male population and between 4 per cent and 6 per cent of the adult female population are homosexual, <Col N="440" /> I think the Minister will have to agree with me that we are talking about a very sizeable group of people.  Nevertheless the result of the discrimination that has traditionally existed, not just in this country &mdash; and I do think the Irish are a fair-minded, decent and tolerant people &mdash; has led to a situation where I am one of the very few people who are publicly visible in this role.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this request in the most positive light.  I do so not speaking merely as a representative of gay people, because I am not merely such: they represent 10 per cent of my electorate, only 10 per cent.  I am sure the House will accept that I have spoken on a wide number of issues and have treated this House with seriousness and with dignity but I also feel I must speak out on behalf of my own people who have had, up to this, no other voice but mine. I ask not for positive discrimination but only for the kind of support that every other community in this country gets and, particularly, I place it in context when I point out that an application of the most modest understanding of Kinsey's statistics indicates that there are three times the number of gay people in this country as there are members of the various Protestant churches combined.  It would be unacceptable to discriminate against, indeed not to foster, this minority.  I believe it would be unacceptable not to receive into the full fold of the community this community, the gay community, who also have had some severe problems in the past.</P>
    <P>I say this in full confidence that this is a mature Government who have taken some very wise decisions in this most sensitive area.  I remind the House that the Minister for Finance, for example, has issued directives to the entire Civil Service that they shall not discriminate against people in the Civil Service who are found to be HIV positive, that they shall not discriminate against people who even have full-blown AIDS as long as they are medically fit to continue their work.  The circular also states people shall not be discriminated against in their employment on the basis of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>It seems that the rebuilding of this very <Col N="441" /> valuable community resource which has saved the country money by inhibiting the spread of disease and has saved people from despair, from suicide, from loneliness, and not just gay people but also their parents, should be supported by this method of funding.  I have detailed figures.  I made an application to the lottery on 17 October 1986.  I have further detailed costings which I can supply to the Minister.  The cost of rebuilding the centre, at the lowest possible cost, is £118,336.</P>
    <P>I said I would be brief.  I am very honoured that so many of my colleagues wish to speak this evening but there is not time for all of them.  I have asked a representative selection to join with me in urging this motion on the Minister and I have allotted them two minutes each.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much I can say in two minutes but I support this motion mainly for two reasons.  First, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  This committee is concerned with discriminatory attitudes against minority groups and has agreed to consider the position of the gay community in this country.  Secondly, in my own makeshift way and whenever the occasion arose I hope I have made it clear that I am totally committed to a pluralist society.  Therefore, I welcomed warmly Senator Norris' success at the European Court of Human Rights.  I admire his courage and dedication.  I feel in a sense that perhaps I have greater feeling for the many people who do not have the courage or the intellectual capacity of Senator Norris and who find themselves in this minority position.  I am sure his achievement has given them courage and hope.</P>
      <P>Apart from the problem of AIDS, in the context of this motion alone we should do everything possible to make a positive contribution.  I ask the Minister to be as generous as possible.  While this may not be the opportune time, that the money may not be available in the immediate future, I ask the Minister to do whatever is possible.  If the amount sought is not available, perhaps the Minister would make some gesture and be as generous as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Norris' moton and to ask the Minister to consider it.  I do not think it would be fair to anticipate the Minister's reply at this stage, but I think I should say that Senator Norris' motion gives the Government a great opportunity today to respond to the result of the court case in Europe last week.  The Government have the chance here to give the imprimatur to an organisation, to an institution like the Hirschfeld Centre, to fight prejudice.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons why this centre should get support.  The first is, like it or not, there is still prejudice of this sort, there is still discrimination against the homosexual community in this country. This is the Government's great chance to fight that prejudice and to say that they disapprove officially of this prejudice by making a donation, not just a nominal one but a real donation, to this centre.</P>
      <P>The second reason is the one which Senator Norris touched on himself very briefly, and that is that this centre undoubtedly provides a community service and is offering a community service like many other community services which have received Government funding. The Hirschfeld Centre and the gay community gave a lead in the fight against AIDS.  This particular organisation did the Government's work in the fight against AIDS and it is still doing the Government's work in the fight against AIDS.  For that reason it should be given some money for the rebuilding of the centre.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to remember &mdash; I did not know about this and I may be one of the few Members of the Oireachtas who has been in the Hirschfeld Centre; I admire their work and the atmosphere there &mdash; that they run a parents inquiry service.  That is something I did not know about &mdash; and I suspect most Members of the Oireachtas did not know about it &mdash; but Senator Norris has proved and indicated to us that that centre is providing a community service. The Government could do the nation a service by actually giving it the imprimatur and the money and by fighting the prejudice which undoubtedly exists.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this motion because I think the Hirschfeld Centre is worthy of Government support. Most mainstream politicians shy away from having to speak about the subject of homosexuality because they find it disturbing. I think that that is probably an attitude that is held by most people in the country.  Therefore, the politicians in some way reflect that attitude of unease, uncertainty, ignorance and doubt which is held by so many.  Prejudice can be dealt with in many ways, mostly by informing people and giving them knowledge, the sort of knowledge that will dispel ignorance and prejudice and bring about tolerance, understanding and insight.  I also feel that the tabling of this motion gives to the Government and to many of us an opportunity to begin to open up on this subject.  I know at least one parent of a homosexual and I know of the despair, anguish, bewilderment and the anger that was caused to that family when they discovered that the son was homosexual. I also know of the strength, comfort and support which they derived from the Hirschfeld Centre.  It is for that reason that I support this motion and also because I recognise the contribution the homosexual community in this country have made in the area of health prevention, which has been considerable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health in his contribution to the historic debate on AIDS in this Chamber acknowledged that help. Therefore, a motion calling for this minority group of people to have a centre and a community in our country so that they can continue that particular work is worth supporting.  I hope the Government will find it possible to put some funds in the way of that minority group to enable them to come together in a spirit of compassion, solidarity and friendship and to continue to provide the badly needed preventive service which they have already exhibited themselves capable of providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope at some future stage we will have an opportunity to have a more comprehensive debate on this topic.  The motion tonight is a very narrow one and is confined to seeking funds to support this institution.  I have pleasure in adding <Col N="444" /> my voice in seeking the kind of monetary support required.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party Senators, I would like to state our full support for this motion which has been most ably moved by Senator Norris. It relates to a minority group in our community, the position of whom has been given a new dignity following the long legal battle which Senator Norris brought to a successful conclusion in recent times. The Hirschfeld Centre serviced a real need in our national life.  It provided a dignified and sympathetic atmosphere for a minority group.  It took on board the pain not alone of the homosexual community but also provided a caring service for the traumas suffered by the families of homosexual people.  Its role in facing up to the AIDS problem has been publicly acknowledged.  We in the Labour Party see this project as being one most worthy of funds from the national lottery. We believe that as a nation we must face up to the reality of our homosexual community and in a true republican spirit not deny civil rights nor the means to promote dignity as full and accepted citizens. We, therefore earnestly request the Minister to respond positively to this motion as a matter of the greatest urgency.</P>

      <P>In order to make the case we wish to make in supporting Senator Norris it is important that we do not lose sight of the difficulty that many people in the community have with regard to the whole subject of homosexuality.  It would be quite ludicrous to overlook that and, in particular, in our enthusiasm to support the extremely eloquent spokesman of the gay community we must not give the impression that we are wishing to place our support for his effort on some specially elevated plateau.  For that reason I was delighted to hear Senator Norris emphasise that he would be the very last to wish this for the enterprise, the Hirschfeld Centre, and for the community. He does not want to be part of anything which would involve positive discrimination; he wants the community to be treated like anyone else, to be <Col N="445" /> treated fairly and given the support which is its due.</P>
      <P>Shortly, with good fortune, we may have legislation on the Statute Book which can help to rid the gay community of all those feelings they have had for so long, feelings of ostracisations, fear and, worst of all, by a long way the fear of blackmail.  It is only right that Senators should pay tribute to the great and courageous work of Senator David Norris who has done so much, so eloquently and thoroughly and preserving for such a long time, to try to render a sense of normality as citizens to the people for whom he has fought.</P>
      <P>There was a time in Ireland when suicidal tendency may have been an indication for compulsory committal.  There was a time when disease was believed to be evidence of the wrath of God.  There was a time when we were silent about tuberculosis, silent about cancer.  We are just about overcoming our tendency to be silent about AIDS when it comes close to people we know and members of families we know.</P>
      <P>It is an indication that Ireland is changing for the better that we are able in this House today to deal with two subjects, the first, how the disabled were able to do so well at Seoul and, now, the possibility which is raised by this motion, of giving the opportunity to the homosexual gay community to come together in an atmosphere of friendship and support and in a place where they can be integrated into society, as is their right as equals and as fellow-citizens of the rest of us.  For that reason I feel very privileged to be able to support Senator Norris' motion.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a chur leis an méid atá ráite go dtí seo.  To start with, the commitment to democracy can be gauged or measured by the way in which minorities are dealt with and allowed to participate in the democratic structure and feel part of the community.  The minute somebody portrays themselves as being different, whether it be skin colour, eye colour, or sexual orientation, it immediately creates some sort of a difficulty for the majority of people.  We have seen this over the years in many different ways.  Tonight <Col N="446" /> we discuss the Hirschfeld Centre.  It is important to place on the record that the way many people feel threatened by gay rights, by gay action and by the gay community, is really a reflection on ourselves, in a way we cannot put up with or in a way we cannot countenance.</P>
      <P>It should be put on the record of the House that the Hirschfeld Centre was subject to a bomb attack some years back and, indeed, there is a lot of evidence to support the view that the recent fire which razed it to the ground was also started maliciously.  If it was started maliciously, then it was a manifestation of the prejudice which exists in our society at the moment.</P>
      <P>Although comparisons are always odious in these kind of circumstances, I believe that when groups are seen to be in a minority they become marginalised, isolated and suffer for that reason.  There is then a duty and responsibility on legislators in particular to see to it that those who are in a minority in society are properly treated and that our responsibility towards them is manifested in a positive and very definite way.  Therefore, I put the case in favour and in support of the motion which calls for funds from the national lottery to be made available as a matter of urgency for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre.</P>

      <P>The position as far as the amenity grant scheme is concerned is quite clear.  Last November the Minister for Finance announced that £6 million was being made available from the national lottery proceeds for allocation to amenity projects proposed by local authorities and voluntary organisations.  The types of projects to be assisted under the scheme included the provision and development of open spaces, an amenity in landscaping works designed to enhance the local environment, the provision of recreational facilities such as parks, outdoor playing areas, community centres and youth clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the November 1987 announcement by the Minister for Finance, my Department wrote to the local authorities asking them to nominate suitable <Col N="447" /> projects for consideration for allocations from this amount.  In the event hundreds of projects were so nominated. In addition, many more requests for grants were brought to my Department's notice in written representations from Members of the Oireachtas on behalf of the promoters of particular projects.  In applications made by the promoters of projects themselves, including residents' associations, community councils, local environmental groups, etc., all applications so received were taken into account in the determination of individual allocations under the scheme.  By the time decisions were made on the vast majority of the allocations and the announcement of grants made in April, over 2,000 requests for grants to the value of £60 million was received in my Department.</P>
    <P>Applications, however, continue to flow in.  At a recent date over 2,500 applications had been received. We had requests for grants amounting to £82 million. In these circumstances and taking into account the fact that the total sum placed at the Minister's disposal was only £6 million, it was obvious that many applications would have to be disappointed. Nevertheless, it was possible to approve some 590 projects for grants.  The full amount of £6 milion has been allocated.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Hirschfeld Centre project, an application for an amenity grant of £100,000 to assist in the reconstruction of the centre was received in my Department on 21 October 1988.  By that time all available funds has been fully allocated.  In the circumstances the project, together with all other projects brought to the attention of my Department, can be considered for grant assistance only in the event of additional funds being made available.  I regret to say that <Col N="448" /> I am not able to give any commitment on this project or any other project at this time because all the money has been allocated throughout the country on the 590 projects.  Senators will agree that the application was only received lately and we must await to see if further moneys are allocated by the Government.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot give the Senator a more favourable reply.  That is the position in regard to all the applications which await funding now.  I must point out that the total amount I would need to fund these projects is £18 million.  They are all very good projects we would certainly like to help, but, as you can see, the problem is the size of the purse.  I regret that I cannot give you a more favourable reply.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Of course I accept it.  Perhaps, however, he will agree with me that this is highly unusual in the sense that the Oireachtas, which I think has some role in the matter, has spoken clearly through the Upper House.  It is most unusual in my experience that there should be such a high degree of consensus backing this request.  I have attended many debates, but I have never attended one in which representatives of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, the Independent Senators and the Taoiseach's nominees have all spoken.</P>
      <P>I accept, of course, the Minister's difficulties with regard to the sums.  Of course, the application for funding was made very recently.  I hope, however, that in the light of these very unusual circumstances the Minister will find that when money becomes available it may be considered positively.  I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 9 November 1988.</P>
