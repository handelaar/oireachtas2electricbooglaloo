      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to resolve the anomaly whereby a visually handicapped student (name supplied) in receipt of a blind pension has had that pension reduced substantially as a result of the success in obtaining a higher education grant, thereby effectively preventing him from completing his education.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a pilot scheme for Teilifís na Gaeltachta because £0.5 million has been set aside from the national lottery by the Government since November last for this scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the Government's attitude to the Mawhinney proposals on integrated education in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, O'Toole and Murphy as suitable <Col N="2006" /> for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Norris's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators O'Toole and Murphy may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

I ask the House to note that the objections raised by An Taisce are realistic and I ask the Minister to extend the time available for the making of objections.  Also on the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House the status of Item No. 8 on today's Order Paper.  Since we will be sitting next week I ask the Leader of the House to honour the commitment he made on a number of occasions that there will be a debate on this item before the end of this session and to fix a date for this item next week.</P>

      <P>I must refer once again to Item No. 7 on the Order Paper, the Companies (No. 2) Bill, and I want to put clearly on the record of the House <Col N="2007" /> that I believe it should be taken as a matter of priority.  We discussed this matter at some length yesterday but because the Government Whip told me that he intends to take this item next week I do not intend to push an amendment on the Order of Business on that issue today.  I would also like to put on record the fact that the points I made yesterday arose from different advice I got from the Leader of the House last week but, now that I have got a commitment from the Government Whip, I am prepared to accept that it will be dealt with some day next week.  I ask the Leader of the House to confirm this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that Item No. 8 be taken today.  I will withdraw this amendment if the Leader of the House gives us an assurance that a debate will take place on Anglo-Irish relations before the end of this session.  I am doing it this way simply because of the chronological order of things.  I would like to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader of the House for allowing us to have debates on matters of urgent and topical public interest yesterday.  It did the Seanad good and was a credit to us that we could debate those matters.  It is a pity that the Leader of the House has broken solemn assurances made to this House about debating Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious point on the Order of Business and it relates to Item No. 8 on the Order Paper.  On 3 March the Leader of the House said &mdash; and this is on the record &mdash; that we would discuss Anglo-Irish affairs on the Thursday of the following week.  It was a solid assurance given to the House and accepted in good faith by the House.  That assurance has been broken.  It is very important both for the Opposition and the Government that we should have such a debate.  In the light of what we did <Col N="2008" /> yesterday and the responsible and topical debates that took place, I ask the Leader of the House to assure us that such a debate will be given adequate time before the end of this session.  If that is the case I will withdraw my amendment; otherwise I shall press it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if it is correct, as now seems to be the case, that no Private Member's motion from the Fianna Fáil side will be taken today and, if this is the case, whether the Government will consider replacing it with some of the business on the Order Paper.  Specifically I would ask the Leader of the House to consider replacing this, if they do not intend to use their time, with the motion about planning legislation which I had down and which in the words of the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Government, Deputy Haughey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was simply trying to elucidate whether what has become a statutory item of the week's business is being taken, as it appears, by default of the Leader of the House, that Fianna Fáil are not going to use their time this is an adequate opportunity to take some of the other business that has not been fulfilled by the House.  My item, which was regarded as important by the Taoiseach, has been so long on the Order Paper that it has actually fallen off.  It has been there for over a year and I intend to put it back on.</P>

It is very urgent that we should discuss this matter before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>When we debated the events in the Persian Gulf last night there was a widespread view held by many Members of this House that the conditions in Iran were a fit topic for discussion. May I then request any of the groups who felt obliged to say all the things they said about conditions in Iran to facilitate the House by allowing Item No. 27 &mdash; which is actually a motion which includes my name about conditions in Iran &mdash; to be discussed.  If people feel as strongly as they did last night about the regime in Iran, this House ought to have the right to discuss it as a separate item entirely from the unfortunate incident in the Gulf.  Either this week or next week, perhaps one or other of the Members of the House representing the various groups in this House would get together and agree that that motion should be discussed if people feel as strongly as they indicated last night as they do about conditions in Iran.</P>

      <P>A number of questions have been asked about items which are not of a legislative content.  The onus is on this House to ensure that legislation is got through and that there is adequate time devoted to it.  I accept remarks that have been passed about the need to have various items, other than legislative ones, taken.  May I say that, at this stage, it is <Col N="2010" /> my intention that legislation be given top priority in this House.  There is an enormous amount of legislation on the Order Paper which has to be got through in this session.  For that reason no other items will be taken until that legislation has been dealt with.  I can give no other commitment. Everybody in this House is seeking a debate on the Data Protection Bill, the Bankruptcy Bill, the Forestry Bill, the Housing Bill and the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill.  It does not matter in which order they are taken; they are all very urgent in their own right.  When we get that legislation cleared, we can discuss any other matter remaining on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Title>Data Protection Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data.  For convenience of reference, the text of the Convention is set out in the First Schedule.</P>
      <P>The Convention has three main features. It sets out a number of basic principles for the protection of individual privacy in the handling of automated personal data.  It has special rules on transborder flows of personal data and, finally, it provides machinery for mutual assistance and consultation between the contracting parties.  As the provisions of the Convention are being given effect to by the Bill, it may be convenient to deal with the Bill under those three headings.</P>
      <P>First of all, the basic principles of data protection are set out in sections 2 (1), 4 and 6 and require any person who controls the contents and the use of automated personal data &mdash; what the Bill calls a &ldquo;data controller&rdquo;&mdash; to observe proper standards in the collection and processing of the data.  In general, they require that the information consisting the data must have been collected fairly; must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; must not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with the purposes for which they are kept; must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to those purposes; and must not be kept for longer than is necessary for those purposes.  Appropriate security measures must also be taken against unauthorised access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of the data and against their accidental loss or destruction. Finally, a person who is the subject of the data &mdash; the &ldquo;data subject&rdquo;&mdash; must be given a right of access to the data, and any data that are incorrect or misleading must be corrected or erased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards transborder flows of personal data, the Bill implements article 12 of the Convention.  That article is aimed at reconciling, as between the contracting states, the simultaneous and sometimes competing requirements of data protection and the free flow of information. Its main provision is that transborder data flows between contracting states should not be subject to any special controls. That provision is a corollary of the requirement earlier in the Convention that all contracting states should incorporate in their law common principles of <Col N="2013" /> data protection, guaranteeing a certain minimum protection to data subjects in all countries where the Convention is in force.  The adoption of such a common set of legislative principles by contracting states has the additional advantage of leading to a general harmonising of laws and a resultant decrease in the possibility of conflicts of law or jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>However, article 12 also provides that a party to the Convention can prohibit or restrict the export of personal data in two cases.  It can do so, first, if its legislation has specific regulations governing certain categories of personal data because of the nature of those data &mdash; what is in mind here is sensitive personal data such as health data &mdash; unless the regulations of the other contracting party give equivalent protection.  It can also prohibit or restrict a transfer abroad of data to another contracting state if there is an intention to transfer the data subsequently to a non-contracting state and the object is to circumvent the data protection legislation of the exporting state. The provisions of article 12 are implemented in section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there are the provisions of the Convention for mutual assistance and consultation between the contracting parties.  Chapter IV deals with mutual cooperation between data protection authorities and assistance to data subjects abroad.  Section 15 of the Bill designates the Data Commissioner to be appointed under the Bill as an authority for the purposes of that chapter.  Chapter V deals with the machinery for regular consultation between the contracting parties to facilitate the smooth running of the Convention and, where necessary, to deal with any problems that may arise with regard to both its interpretation and its practical application.  The Consultative Committee established for this purpose are authorised to propose amendments to the Convention to help to solve any difficulties that may arise between the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>While the Convention obliges contracting parties to incorporate data protection provisions into their domestic legislation, the particular measures may <Col N="2014" /> take different forms, depending on the legal and constitutional system of the State concerned.  Apart from laws, there may be regulations, administrative guidelines and so on and these legally binding measures may be reinforced by measures of voluntary regulation such as codes of practice.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is a fair measure of variation in the methods used to give effect to the Convention by the member states of the Council of Europe that have passed legislation in this field.  Of our EC partners, five &mdash; Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK &mdash; have legislation already in force.  Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain all introduced legislation some time ago but it has not yet been enacted.  There is also data protection legislation in force in five other European jurisdictions &mdash; Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill we have had the advantage of examining the various systems of data protection in operation in European countries and also the proposals for legislation in the other countries I have mentioned.  What we have tried to do is to build on the experience of those countries and produce a measure that will be appropriate to our conditions. provide an adequate measure of data protection without imposing an undue burden on industry or unnecessary bureaucracy and facilitate the transfer to this country of personal data for processing.</P>
    <P>One important aspect in which the Bill differs from the legislation in force in most European countries is that we do not propose to adopt a system of universal registration or licensing of data controllers.  Such a universal system was adopted by Sweden in 1973 in the first data protection legislation ever enacted and their lead was followed by many other countries subsequently, including the UK in its Act of 1984 which came into operation last November.  More recently, there has been a trend towards introducing an element of self-regulation.  The <Col N="2015" /> Finnish legislation, dating from last January, is an example of this.  Their system requires registration only of certain sensitive categories of data and a system of self-regulation of the remainder.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the proposals in the Bill for regulating the processing of personal data and ensuring that data is dealt with in accordance with its provisions. First of all, the Bill proposes a system of selective registration for those areas of activity which it is particularly desirable for the data commissioner to monitor, such as the public sector, financial institutions, companies in relation to which individuals are likely to avail themselves of the right of access such as credit reference agencies and, finally, persons or firms who keep sensitive data, such as data relating to health, political beliefs and so on.  Persons who are in the business of processing data on behalf of others are also required to register.  These categories may be added to by regulations made by the data commissioner with the consent of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>All other controllers of personal data are under no obligation to register.  That is the only obligation they are relieved of.  They are still equally bound by the obligation imposed on all data controllers by the Bill to comply fully with the data protection provisions and, if they do not, the data commissioner has been given adequate powers to compel them to do so.  In particular, every data controller, whether registered or not, is obliged by section 3 to tell an inquirer whether he keeps personal data and, if so, the purposes for which the data are kept and a description of the data.</P>
    <P>Another distinctive feature of this legislation is the provision for codes of practice in section 13.  Codes of practice have an important role in any scheme of data protection that aims at achieving a proper balance between the interests of all those concerned &mdash; that is to say, the interests of data subjects, the legitimate interests of data controllers and their particular circumstances, including the cost to them and the community at large of <Col N="2016" /> providing adequate safeguards, and the benefits to the public from automation.</P>
    <P>The fact is that any law, such as this Bill will become on enactment, can do no more than set out general principles of data protection.  These cannot reflect adequately the difference in sensitivity there can be between various forms of personal data and, consequently, between the levels of security and safeguards that are appropriate in each case. Personal data can range from a person's address, which can be ascertained from the telephone directory in most cases and is normally not of any great significance to anyone, to highly sensitive information about, say, his or her sexual life.</P>
    <P>That is why section 13 requires the data commissioner to encourage bodies representing data controllers or data processors to prepare codes of practice that will guide them in complying with the Bill and provides for his approving of codes where he is satisfied that he should do so. The codes will fill in the detail required for achieving the level of data protection that is desirable in the particular circumstances of the data controllers concerned. In so far as the codes do so, they will improve the level of data protection in those sectors.</P>
    <P>As the codes are voluntary, they would, in practice if not in law, be binding on members of the body that had drawn them up.  That would not apply, or apply to the same extent, to non-members.  For that reason, and because I believe the bodies concerned would wish to have the possibility of their codes of practice having statutory effect, the section enables both Houses of the Oireachtas to give the force of law to a code of practice provided that it has been approved of by the commissioner and that it is in accordance with the principles of data protection as set out in the Bill.  The code will then become enforceable in the same way as those principles are.  Of course, I would expect that codes would have to be in operation for some time before the Houses would be asked to approve of them, so that by then any difficulties in their practical operation would have been <Col N="2017" /> remedied.  This provision further emphasises the self-regulatory content of the Bill and keeps it fully in line with developments in modern data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Bill is the imposition on data controllers and data processors &mdash; these are people who are in the business of processing data on behalf of data controllers &mdash; of a duty of care towards data subjects in their handling of personal data relating to them &mdash; that is in so far as the existing law or torts does not do so.  To establish liability for damage caused by negligence, the person causing the damage must have been under a duty of care towards the injured party.  Obviously that duty applies in some circumstances at present as between data controllers or processors and data subjects but there are cases where it does not exist or its existence is doubtful.  For example, a data processor will frequently not have any reason to be aware of the nature of the data he is processing or to whom the data refers so that it would be difficult to contend that he owes any duty of care to the data subjects covered by the data.  Nevertheless, harm could be caused to those data subjects if, say, the data became public knowledge through some failure or inadequacy in the data processor's security arrangements.  Section 7 makes it clear that in such circumstances a duty of care will exist.</P>
    <P>I should also perhaps mention section 22, which makes it an offence for anyone to obtain access to personal data, or information constituting the data, without the authority of the data controller and then to disclose it.  It will cover acccess to data either by way of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo;&mdash; by which I mean obtaining access at a distance from the firm's computer by using the telecommunications system &mdash; or merely by direct access to a computer printout or to the information in the computer memory, as displayed on the screen.  The Bill, being a purely data protection measure, does not make &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; itself an offence.  That would be appropriate to legislation amending the general criminal law.  So, under section 22, the offence will <Col N="2018" /> arise only if there is both unauthorised access and disclosure.</P>
    <P>The convention does not specifically require a contracting party to establish a data protection authority but it is difficult to see how any system can be effectively monitored or policed without having some authority with power to enforce compliance with its provisions.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the appointment by the Government of a data protection commissioner who will be independent in the exercise of his functions.  He will have power to investigate whether data controllers are complying with the requirements of the Bill, either on his own initiative or following a complaint from a data subject.  Where he is satisfied that a data controller is not complying with the data protection provisions he can serve an enforcement notice on him requiring him to take whatever steps are necessary and it will be an offence to refuse to comply with such a notice.  However, the controller will have a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against the notice and, apart from special circumstances of urgency, he need not comply with the notice until the appeal has been finally determined.</P>
    <P>The commissioner has also power to prohibit the transfer abroad of personal data and also to require information to be given to him where this is necessary for the exercise of his functions under the Bill.  While it is essential that the commissioner should have power to issue these notices and to invoke the criminal law if they are not complied with, I envisage that the commissioner would seldom, if ever, have to invoke these powers but rather that his functions would be advisory and aimed at achieving an ever higher standard of compliance with the data protection principles.  In particular, there would be no question of an enforcement notice being issued as a result of a complaint without the commissioner asking for and considering the data controller's side of the story.</P>
    <P>Senators will observe that the Bill does not apply to information contained in manual files but only to information that is in automated form.  The Convention <Col N="2019" /> allows its provisions to be extended to manual files and some of the countries who have ratified it have done so.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that there is a clear case for extending the principles of data protection to manual files.  There is an equal need for these files to be accurate, relevant and kept up-to-date and the information in them to be collected fairly and not used for purposes incompatible with those for which they were collected. There should be rights or access to them and rights to have inaccurate information corrected or erased.  Everything that a computer can do with information can be done with the same information kept in manual form, though of course far less readily.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that such an extension would place a severe administrative burden on the public and private sectors.  To take one example, it is a simple matter to retrieve all the information kept about an individual from an automated data base, possibly in a matter of seconds, whereas it could take days to do so from manual records.  Second, there is not the same possibility of manipulating information stored manually as there is with automated data.  A computer can manipulate data at prodigious speed and the fact that it can do so much more quickly and easily makes it more likely that it will be used to do so.</P>
    <P>For that reason we are proceeding first with the protection of automated data. The protection of manually held data is another day's work.  I am sure it will come in time but I have no evidence of public concern in this regard and consequently it would have to get a lower priority than other legislative projects being dealt with in my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, in conclusion, that this Bill has been well received and that the principles underlying it have secured wide acceptance.  I understand also that it is well regarded in international data protection circles.  It is in the nature of this kind of legislation that advances in technology may require it to be reviewed in a comparatively short period of time &mdash; though every effort has been made in <Col N="2020" /> the drafting, particularly of the definitions, to ensure that its provisions will still be applicable in spite of technological developments.  Also, the ground covered is so new that it would be surprising if experience did not demonstrate the need for some changes here or there in it.  For that reason it is my intention to monitor carefully the operation of the legislation and in addition, through our representation on the consultative committee established under the Convention, to keep in touch with any developments that my require amending legislation.</P>
    <P>This is, I believe, a non-controversial Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Data Protection Bill, 1987, a Bill which the Minister has indicated is designed to protect the privacy of individuals with regard to automated personal data and to give effect in this State to the 1981 Data Protection Convention of the Council of Europe.  Indeed, the objectives of the Convention are briefly set out in the preamble to the Convention. They commit the member states of the Council of Europe to (1) achieving greater unity between the member states based, in particular, on respect for the rule of law as well as human rights and fundamental freedom; (2) extending the safeguards for everyone's rights and fundamental freedoms and, in particular, the right to the respect of privacy, taking into account the increasing flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing automated processing; (3) reaffirming at the same time the commitment of member states to freedom of information regardless of frontiers and (4) reconciling the fundamental values of the respect for privacy and the free flow of information between peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because I believe there is general agreement on the twin objects of the Bill, firstly, to protect the privacy of individuals in relation to personal data kept about them on computers and, secondly, to facilitate trans-border flows of data to the greatest possible extent consistent with the protection of <Col N="2021" /> individual privacy.  I hope this Bill is successful in its basic objective of striking a reasonable balance between the requirements of privacy and maintaining the freeflow of data internationally, with due regard as the Minister has indicated, to the need to avoid over-regulation and to minimise the burden on industry.  This Bill deals with a difficult subject and is further complicated by a number of technical matters.  However, the aims of the Bill are clear and straightforward and indeed common ground to Members on all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>We do not have to be experts in computer technology or fluent in the jargon of mainframes, minis, micros and optical character readers to understand the implications of the Bill for the protection of the individual and the enhancement of his or her personal rights.  The introduction of this Bill must be seen in context. Within the past decade or so, technology has advanced in ways which are truly bewildering and this technology is increasingly coming to have a direct effect and impact on all of us.</P>
    <P>Developments which until recently were in the realms of remote scientific theory are now of clear practical application. More and more office workers operate what is known as the electronic office.  Commerce, industry and government are performing an ever increasing number of tasks with the use of information technology of some kind or other. Wherever we look, the impact of technology can be seen and it is clearly here to stay.  This country, like all other modern progressive countries, must be in the vanguard of technology developments and application because there are great opportunities and benefits in this area.</P>
    <P>However, with the opportunities and benefits come also disadvantages and possible dangers.  Above all, developments in information technology have revealed how easily and rapidly information can be manipulated and collated, transferred and retrieved.  That information, as the Minister has indicated, may include sensitive personal information. It is entirely understandable, therefore, that this proliferation of the <Col N="2022" /> technology has led to certain unease and anxiety, and that there is some anxiety that personal information is collected about us all from unknown sources, is stored in data banks and used for all sorts of purposes, of which we are unaware.</P>
    <P>Concern about the potential threat from computers is real but it must be stressed at this stage that the threat is still primarily a potential one.  Actual instances of abuse, though not unknown, are still few and far between.  The most important thing, therefore, is to guard against abuse in the future and to eliminate the concern that might other wise grow into a real impediment to the use of the technology.  It was 20 years ago, 1968, that the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe made a recommendation to the Committee of Ministers expressing their concern about whether in the context of automated data banks, the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and the domestic legislation of members states provided adequate protection for personal privacy.  That recommendation of 20 years ago led to other recommendation and ultimately to the European convention on data protection which was open for signature in 1981. The Convention was signed on behalf of Ireland in December 1986 but we cannot ratify this Convention unless the legislation which we are discussing today is in place.</P>
    <P>The OECD have also been active in this area, producing an important set of guidelines governing the protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data which Ireland also endorsed in December 1986.  This international concern adds a new dimension.  Business depends more and more on the free flow of data, often personal data, between countries.  This free flow of information must continue if business is to flourish.  At the same time, however, the threat to the individual becomes potentially greater when data are used not only here at home but in other countries and in circumstances over which the subject and often the person passing on the information has little control.  In recognition <Col N="2023" /> of this Convention and the guidelines both confirm the right of countries which have introduced data protection safeguards to restrict the flow of personal data to other countries which do not offer comparable protection.</P>
    <P>Ratification of this Convention of the Council of Europe is therefore of prime importance on two grounds.  First, it will reassure people in this country that when computers are used for the storage and use of personal data there are special safeguards for individual privacy which are well up to the international standard. Secondly, ratification of the Convention will gain us membership of what one might call the European data protection club, thus ensuring a very important commercial interest, that Irish firms are not placed at a disadvantage in relation to firms in other European countries.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, therefore, aimed at furthering the interests of two groups &mdash; on the one hand the individual about whom data are held, the data subject in the jargon, and on the other hand the holder of information, the data user in the jargon.  Clearly the interests of these two groups will not always coincide.  Every safeguard for the subject is a potential burden to the user.  Throughout our consideration of this Bill it is vital to remember the need to achieve a reasonable balance ensuring that the rights of individuals as data subjects are properly protected without imposing unreasonable burdens on data users who collect and process personal data.</P>
    <P>This Bill entitles individuals to establish the existence of automated personal data in relation to them, to have access to that personal data &mdash; although the Minister has indicated there are some important exceptions &mdash; and to have inaccurate data rectified and erased.  The Bill imposes various obligations on people who keep automated personal data.  For example, the data must be accurate, kept for lawful purposes, not disclosed in any manner incompatible with these purposes and protected by adequate security measures.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the scheme established <Col N="2024" /> by the Bill lie the office of the data protection commissioner and the public register of certain data users.  Thus sections 9 to 12 of the Bill provide for the appointment by the Government of a data protection commissioner who will be independent in the exercise of his functions and who will have power to investigate complaints, supervise the operation of this legislation and, where necessary, require compliance with its provisions.  However, to avoid undue bureaucracy and expense, the Bill adopts what I believe is a sensible approach, a two-tier system in respect of registration rather than opting for universal registration. This system is characterised on the one hand by a requirement of registration for large scale controllers and processers, that is those whose activities are more likely to give rise to concern, and a simpler system of self regulation for those whose keeping and use of personal data is limited in scope and poses no real threat.</P>
    <P>Initially, this Bill proposes that only certain categories of data controllers would be required to register.  These will include persons and organisations keeping specially sensitive data about racial origin, political opinions, health and sexual life, organisations operating in the public sector, financial institutions and agencies concerned with such matters as credit references, debt collecting, direct mailing and marketing, and all data processers, that is those who provide computer bureau services.  The requirement to register will therefore cover a very wide and extensive area of activity, an area in relation to which the public may be expected to have a concern as regards the protection of their privacy.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to personal data which is kept for State security purposes or kept by an individual for recreational purposes, etc.  The Bill does not apply to personal data kept on manual files or to non-personal data, for example, data concerning companies and partnerships.  However, these areas &mdash; as the Minister has quite clearly indicated in his speech &mdash; may well have to be reviewed in the light of experience, and <Col N="2025" /> the Convention leaves open the possibility of extending its provisions to data processed manually if any State such as Ireland so wishes.  It may be the case that certain information on individuals which is currently held on computer form may be transferred to manual records simply to avoid having to give out that information.</P>
    <P>As of now, however, it is the ability of computers to handle vast quantities of information to build up a picture of an individual, to search for individuals with particular characteristics and to do that and much else with amazing speed, which gives rise to the most concern and anxiety. Information held on manual files is simply not capable of such manipulation and does not, I believe, give rise at this moment to the same level of anxiety and concern.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are other positive benefits to this Bill.  It will encourage Government Departments and agencies and the private sector in general to adopt better practices in the handling of personal data.  For these reasons, therefore, I welcome this Bill.  I note the Minister for Justice, a Limerick man, has been very busy in both Houses in recent times. We are always very pleased to have him back.  We welcome the main provisions of this Bill and assure him of our help in giving it a speedy passage here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to give effect to the 1981 Council of Europe Data Protection Convention. This is the Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data.  The Bill entitles individuals to establish the existence of automated personal data kept in relation to them.  It enables them to have access to the data and to have inaccurate data rectified or erased.  The data collected could up to now be used for all kinds of purposes.  It could be very sensitive information and could be used without the knowledge of the person to whom it related.  Such information could be stolen, copied or obtained improperly by people who should not get it; hence this Bill will impose various obligations on <Col N="2026" /> people who keep automated personal data.</P>
      <P>The data must be accurate, kept for lawful purposes, not disclosed to anyone and protected by adequate security measures. Under this Bill the Government will have to appoint a data protection commissioner who will have power to investigate complaints and to ensure that the operation of the legislation is carried out properly.  Anyone who compiles personal data will be obliged to register with the commissioner.  The Bill does not apply to personal data kept for State security purposes or kept by individuals for recreational purposes, and to personal data kept on manual files or the non-personal data concerning companies and partnerships.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister may designate a civil servant in his Department to be a data controller or data processor.  Sections 2 to 8 deal with the protection of the privacy of individuals with regard to personal data. They include provisions relating to collecting, processing, storage, access and dissemination of personal data.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of unrestricted data flow is particularly important for our economy, especially in view of the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Docks site.  This is because several European centres have legislation restricting the export of data for processing to countries which have less strict data protection laws, or perhaps none at all.  The absence of data protection legislation here could thus be a factor which international companies would take into account when deciding whether to establish a business here, particularly in the area of data processing. For this reason it is desirable that the Bill be enacted and the Convention ratified as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that initially only certain categories of data controllers will be required to register.  These will be persons and organisations keeping special sensitive data about racial origin, political opinion, health, sexual life and other organisations operating in the public sector and financial institutions <Col N="2027" /> and agencies concerned with credit references, debt collection, direct mailing and direct marketing.  All data processors who provide a computer bureau service must be registered.  The requirement to register will cover a wide area of activity and will protect the privacy of the public. All persons and bodies who keep automated personal data will not be required to register, but will be equally bound by the general provision of the Bill.  Complaints about these bodies can be investigated by the commissioner in the same way as he investigates complaints about those who are registered.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that section 14 provides for the commissioner to prepare an annual report on his activities and to cause it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is designed to provide adequate safeguards to individuals against any abuse of their privacy arising from automatic processing of personal data concerning them.  It will encourage Government Departments and agencies and private sector companies to adopt better practices in the handling of personal data and not to keep data longer than necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is very important for our country, especially for our people, and it will provide a safeguard for them against the nuisance of personal data compiled against them.  I hope the Bill will get as speedy a passage through this House as it did through the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House with this legislation. Minister Collins has always treated this House with the respect it deserves and has always co-operated with Senators in trying to improve legislation.  The Minister will find today that we will co-operate on this legislation which I think will get a speedy passage through the House. Possibly there will be all party agreement that we take all Stages of the Bill today. Considering the way in which the Bill has been dealt with in the Dáil, it will not be necessary to have detailed amendments on Committee Stage.  I think that is the <Col N="2028" /> view of the other Members of this House too.</P>
      <P>This is a highly technical Bill ranging over 35 sections, seven chapters and three Schedules.  It is probably the advances of technology, to which Senator Kennedy has referred, that have necessitated the Government to legislate to protect the right of the individual in this area of data collection, the way this data will be used, while at all times maintaining balance between the individual's right to privacy and the purpose for which the data will be used in the future.</P>
      <P>People in public life have very little difficulty dealing with the fact that the public know everything about us.  Everybody is aware of our political affiliations and our ideological view on most economic subjects with which we deal every day, but all of us, as public representatives, would like to believe we are entitled to a certain amount of privacy, like everybody else.  This Bill addresses itself to that area of specific privacy, that is, the privacy one one's health, and the health of members of one's family, and we feel that if this information is documented for any reason by hospitals, institutions, the VHI board, an insurance company, or anybody else, that it should be private and used only by the institution in the carrying out of their functions.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with people who want their religious beliefs to be confidential. Generally speaking, in Ireland in particular, people's religious beliefs are commonly known and are often a source of pride.  People publicly state their religious beliefs.  They also state their views in a whole range of areas, such as in social legislation.  Privacy in the areas of politics and religion does not concern me, but the ordinary citizen likes to feel their political beliefs are confidential, although generally speaking good, gut politicians would have a fair idea of the political affiliations of their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that this data protection legislation will indemnify our constituents in respect of the knowledge that we already have.  It is reassuring to know that information of a political nature <Col N="2029" /> obtained by illicit means has, in other countries, resulted in the resignation of Presidents when it became public knowledge and was generally considered unacceptable behaviour.  From that point of view the Bill has the right kind of balance with fines of up to £50,000 if people go beyond their remit in this area and are found guilty in a court; they are liable to fairly extensive fines if they misuse the information.</P>
    <P>We are conscious all the time that information sought and gathered particularly by financial institutions in the course of their business should be and must be confidential, and should never be released by them to anybody else for any purpose.  It would be contravening the spirit of this legislation if financial institutions felt free to disclose that kind of confidential information to anybody else.  In this day and age of credit cards and documentation of all sorts, financial institutions have access to information about people's financial affairs and their credit worthiness and other people should not be able to get that information except from the individual.  I am pleased to see that, in the area of the public sector, whether it is in social welfare, health or in the financial area by way of banking institutions, credit finance companies, hire purchase companies and others, there will be regard to the privacy of the individual in respect of the information that is already processed.</P>
    <P>This is highly technological.  We have the idea that people with a computer can with the press of a button, have the information they require about most people in any country.  It is a frightening thought.  So it is appropriate that there should be in this area legislation common to other countries in Europe.  Since other countries have introduced this legislation already the Minister has the knowledge that they have used in bringing forward this legislation.  Other countries have made complete registration obligatory. The Minister has opted for optional registration for some types of data collectors. Why did the Minister leave that option? If we are not aware of why they have the option to register or not, how do we <Col N="2030" /> know who is collecting data?  If there is a registration process for everybody at least we will know who is registered and who has the right to obtain information, to check its authenticity or to have it erased or changed if necessary.  If there are some people who do not necessarily have to register, the information they may have may not necessarily be available to those who show concern in this area.  I am quite sure that there is a valid reason.  It may be peculiar to our own situation in Ireland as a small nation, an island nation with our own computer processing equipment and our own data banks.  Possibly it may be necessary for everybody to register because the Minister has made reference to this and the Bill makes a reference to it also.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that any regulations arising from this legislation will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas which will give us an opportunity to discuss them.  The fact that there is a reporting procedure will give us an opportunity to review the operation of this legislation 12 months down the road.  The report from the commissioner will help in doing that in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcome the concept of protecting individuals' right to privacy so that any information that might be gathered about them will not be made widely available without the approval of otherwise, or the knowledge at least, of the person who has been documented. We want to facilitate the Minister in regard to all Stages if the Government side of the House consider it is advisable to have this legislation on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  I would see it as part of a wider process leading to much greater freedom of information.  On the other front, I am totally bewildered by the enormous advances in technology which have taken place within recent years, advances not only in techniques but in terminologies. I honestly do not know at the moment whether I am an individual or a data subject.  Then we have to move into other terminologies such as hacking and so on. <Col N="2031" /> Sometimes I feel almost nostalgic for the good, simple old days of the card index. However, we are now coming towards the end of the century and everything is evolving and moving and we have got to move with it.</P>
      <P>It is, indeed, true to say that computers are a very powerful tool in the service of all of us, but we also have to take into account, and this is a good thing, that there is also a human background. Indeed, computers may on occasion be fed wrong information and this can adversely affect the lives of people.</P>
      <P>In looking at the Bill on its face value, the whole problem of data protection looks simple but, in fact, it is much more involved as I am sure the Minister and all of us will agree.  This Bill will place restrictions on some individuals or corporations. On the other hand, it does provide access to information, not only to check on information about an individual but also to correct information.  To achieve all of this a correct balance is of course crucial.  In looking through the Bill we must say that a free flow of data is essential, especially to business.  It is also clear that abuses can arise.  I am sure all of us in our daily lives here stories about people having difficulties with financial institutions and so on.  However, taking into account the complicated nature of this proposed legislation, I would like to congratulate the Minister and all concerned on bringing before us this Bill.  It is very timely; it is essential.  It is by no means a simple and straightforward issue and that is clear from the various sections before us.</P>
      <P>I am trying to clarify some points in my own mind rather than make a major contribution for the very good reason that there are so many complicated issues and sections within the Bill itself.  It is quite clear to me that the Data Protection Bill has major implications for those involved with computer data on individuals. It is, therefore, important to understand exactly who this Bill will affect and what type of data it refers to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the Bill deals with the right of <Col N="2032" /> data subjects to gain access to information about themselves.  In this connection one may say that, if there is a name and address on a computer file, this file, with out doubt, contains personal data, but if the data subject is identifiable through an identity number or other unique code on the data the position is not so clear.  Furthermore, in reading through the Bill it appears that data are personal data if the individual may be identified using other data in the possession of a data controller, but a data controller is himself defined as somebody involved with personal data.  It thus seems that the definition of personal data involves, in some instances at least, determining who or what is a data controller.</P>
    <P>That brings me on to the role of this very important post of data controller. Perhaps I have misinterpreted the Bill in some way but it is somewhat unclear to me whether the data controller must always be an individual.  The Bill uses the phrase &ldquo;person, alone or with others&rdquo;. That is the definition outlined in the Bill but one may ask if a group can be a data controller or can individual members of a group all be data controllers for the same data.  This has a major implications with regard to liability under the Bill and other aspects of it.  For instance, if the data controller must be an individual, one might ask: is he or she a data controller by virtue of what he or she does, or can a person be designated a data controller, thus taking on the necessary responsibilities?</P>
    <P>Further aspects with regard to data controllers come in under the Bill.  It is true that a number of duties will be imposed on data controllers as a result of the Bill.  These are often referred to as the data protection principles and they are laid out clearly in the Bill.  For instance, we are told that data can be kept only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, that the data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to that purpose or those purposes and that the data shall not be kept for longer than is neccessary for the purpose or those purposes.  All these duties and <Col N="2033" /> obligations of data controllers are, therefore, quite reasonable.  It should be noted that an offence is not committed under the Bill by disregarding these principles in general.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the commissioner or another individual may serve an enforcement notice requiring compliance with the data protection principles.  Disregarding such notice will be an offence. That leads me on to another aspect of the Bill, the question of registration, which is a vital aspect.  As the Minister has said data controllers who are involved with certain aspects of sensitive information must register.  Furthermore, there are related, quite stringent requirements, which could constitute an offence if they are not adhered to.  Essentially, a data controller who is registered may not keep personal data of any description unless it is described in the register.  He may only use it and obtain it from sources as specified in the register.  He may only disclose it to those specified at registration and may not send it to a country not described in the entry for that data.  An employee of the data controller is subject to the same restrictions.  This highlights the need for a very thorough and complete registration of a set of data, or a data controller may find himself limited as to what he may or may not do with the data.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that there is a section in the Bill dealing with research.  This could be a tricky aspect and naturally may involve some subjects more than others. I can see certain problems with regard to medical research, for instance, unless one adheres very strictly to the code.  There is no point in passing Bills unless they are implemented and adhered to.  With regard to some of the medical problems &mdash; and I refer to that as one of the sensitive areas mentioned &mdash; one might ask: does every consultant have to be a data collector and, as such, does he have to pay registration fees?  With regard to certain aspects of research &mdash; again it is really within these sensitive areas &mdash; if a medical consultant has to register he will then have to pay fees.  Some of his work may be solely for research purposes and therefore, I wonder would it be possible <Col N="2034" /> to consider a sliding scale of fees for registration.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about other aspects of the contents of the Bill.  I agree not only to the right of access to information but also to modification.  It is true to say that, if incorrect information is stored, no matter where it is stored, facilities must be given to ensure that the data are made accurate by supplementing them with a covering statement or actually altering them.  Notification of modification must be facilitated and I am glad that the Bill has the facilities to do so.  I am also interested in the general structure of the Bill, the role of the commissioner, for instance, and the general control that will be exercised in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already stated the obvious, that is, technology is moving very fast.  Day to day we see vital and fundamental changes taking place.  In that connection I was particularly gratified to hear the Minister state this morning that he will be quite prepared to review, even within a comparatively short period, and to monitor the effect this Bill is having.  With those possibilities about further change, should they be necessary, I think the Minister is doing an exceedingly important job.  I wish this Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is most welcome and I compliment the Minister.  Not just in this country but collectively, we have, been a bit slow to respond to the extraordinary changes that have taken place, to which Senator Eogan has referred.  I am always reminded of the scale models that are produced of what computers can do now by comparison even with 20 years ago.  I know that the average desktop micro-computer that many members of the Orieachtas now have at their disposal, which may do no more than word processing but which is essentially a computer is such that what 25 years ago would have occupied an average size room now occupies the same space on a desk as an ordinary typewriter.  Associated with that is the capacity to store and even to move manually large volumes of data on a <Col N="2035" /> floppy disc so that the equivalent of one, two or three full size books can be carried on one disc and thus the volume that would be occupied by the equivalent of 20 or 30 books can easily be carried by somebody in his or her pocket.</P>
      <P>Apart from the extraordinary capacity to transfer data electronically, the capacity of agencies to store data has been transformed to an extent that I think 20 or 25 years ago was unimaginable.  The likelihood is that the transformation that will take place in the next 25 years is, even by those who know most about this subject, unimaginable.  In the consumer computer magazines the speculation is that the sort of computer scale that was only available to major multinational corporations or to large State agencies could well be accessible to the average individual, or even at least to the very small businesses, within another ten years.  The idea that there will be things called large computers is almost a thing of the past. At the same time the quality of electronic data transmission facilities that are available through telecommunications has been transformed as well.  There is the capacity to move large quantities of data and also the capacity to gain access to it.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent, however well we may think we have adjusted, we all share the memory of the day of the old card index.  The one great thing about massive amount of paper information was that it took an enormous amount of work to dig out information about either one individual or a group of individuals.  It does not take a lot of computer expertise to know that the most elementary data bases of the kind that are available for £20 or £30 for the average micro-computer can do a search through perhaps 2,000 records inside five seconds and generate in five seconds the sort of records about an individual that if they are kept on paper could well take somebody the best part of a day, if not a week, to assemble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the question of the quantity of information that is being kept, because perhaps that will not run too fast ahead for us; it is the accessibility and the <Col N="2036" /> ease of access to that information that represents the possible invasion of privacy, which is one of the objectives of this Bill and also the possibility of the abuse of that information for a variety of commercial and other reasons.  Therefore, it is welcome that we are introducing legislation like this and it is also welcome that most of the western democracies have developed a similar position.</P>
    <P>May I say, too, that having had a particular interest in it I welcome Senator Eogan's references to the need for a gradually expanding commitment to freedom of information.  I look forward to the pursuance of the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; commitment that was given by the Minister here during our debate on freedom of information by the Government to pursue the matter of freedom of information generally as distinct from this very necessary and very welcome legislation.  I do not think anybody has a monopoly of wisdom on how to deal with freedom of information. Anything I contributed was an attempt to move a debate along rather than to help to produce a formula which is an absolute solution.</P>
    <P>The concept of freedom of information and access to records is one of the best guarantees of ensuring that whatever is recorded or stored, whether it be electronically or manually, is necessary and is not an abuse of position by anybody. There have been quite disturbing stories of perfectly respectable citizens being told by financial institutions that they could not be loaned money and they met a stone wall of resistance when endeavouring to find out why.  These are people who never in their lives dreamed that there was any problem, who had never had problems with financial institutions and suddenly are told that they would not be loaned money.  There is almost an echo of Big Brother about it.  My own suspicion is that that probably is a product of mistaken use of information and confusion of identity.  The best person to correct such confusion is the person who is the victim of the mistake.  This Bill will go a long way towards ensuring just that.</P>
    <P>We need to keep ourselves very clearly informed about the possibilities that arise <Col N="2037" /> from the enormously accessible data that is now available, the speed of transmission and also the fact that, to a certain extent, large bodies will tend to accumulate and retain more information because of the ease with which that information can be accumulated and retained.  It is not as much of a chore anymore.  Even though it is a little intimidating we would want to understand &mdash; particularly those of us in political life &mdash; what is happening, so that we retain control of what is happening, so that the political system is firmly in control of how these potentially great benefits to our society are dealt with and to ensure that the potential misuse is regulated and controlled.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that electronic data processing has also been a considerable asset to law enforcement, to international co-operation in law enforcement, to the capacity of security forces to have access to good, solid information on individuals who are the subject of criminal investigations without the enormous painful paperwork that used to have to be gone through.  One can only think of an unfortunate British television series of recent years who chose to give an impression that the Irish security forces had never heard of computers until this British genius came along to explain it all to them whereas I am aware that the Garda have been using &mdash; and by and large one could not argue with the way it is being used &mdash; computer data banks to facilitate and expedite their own activities.  That is a correct use of modern facilities to protect all of us from those who make our lives difficult if not impossible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome what is in the Bill.  I do not intend to go into it in detail but there are a number of questions I would like to ask.  It is a welcome fact that we are going to develop a system of control of data storage.  We all have our opinions about the structures of that system but it is not necessarily an argument. As the Minister has said, we are all to a certain extent involved in the learning process and, therefore, there are no absolutes or rigid definitions at this stage.  We will learn and assess from the <Col N="2038" /> experience of other people.  I am very glad to see that he has identified this.</P>
    <P>He has chosen not to do a number of things that other countries have done.  In the UK there is a comprehensive requirement on all people who keep electronic data to register and this is a major cause of concern to small scale, almost hobby, micro-computer users, according to some magazines.  We are not going to do this here because it is probably unnecessary and is definitely an extra burden on ordinary people.  My understanding is that under the United Kingdom-type legislation, Members of either House of the Oireachtas, for instance, who chose to keep their information on their constituency work on computer would have to register with the Data Commissioner. I do not think that is a necessary requirement. The general requirement of self-assessment and self-enforcement is a better and more acceptable option.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister about the Bill.  I am a little disappointed that the definition of &ldquo;inaccuracy in data&rdquo; is confined to lack of correctness or being misleading as to any matter of fact.  From my limited experience working with voluntary organisations I am aware that opinions can be almost as damning as factual information. People can have opinions about a variety of matters dealing with individuals such as their mental condition, their suitability for lending and so on which may not be factual but may be quite misleading and wrong.  I would hate if there was a loophole in the legislation under which information on an individual which was not of a factual nature but amounted to an opinion or the personal judgment of the individual who compiled the data was not at least open to argument, if not to correction.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister referred to the need to strike a balance. There is an important balance involved here.  It is possible that we could overload people with too many regulations in regard to this matter to a degree that would be disproportionate to the benefits being conferred on the individual or society.  I am not sure the Minister is right <Col N="2039" /> in exempting the whole area of manual data or data recorded on paper.  I fully accept that given the volume of material that is kept on paper it would be an unfair burden on the State and private organisations to impose excessive controls but it is possible that many people will try to avoid or evade the responsibilities the legislation imposes on them by deliberately keeping some data in the future off a computer and in manual form.  Is it not worth considering, at least in the immediate future, making future records kept on paper subject to controls contained in the Bill for electronically maintained records?</P>
    <P>In the long term I would prefer that all data should be kept in this way but since nobody is quite sure of the extent of the information kept on paper in public and private offices due to the volume of paperwork and the difficulty of access to it the Minister is correct in not introducing a control on that immediately. However, I am worried about the possibility of evasion of responsibilities under this legislation in the future by those who may choose to keep records on paper.  I have no objection in principle to the range of exemptions contained in the Bill and I do not think anybody could argue with them but the wording causes me concern.  Section 1 (4) states:</P>
    <P>This Act does not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  personal data that in the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Defence are, or at any time were, kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State,</P>
    <P>Nobody would argue that information kept for the purposes of safeguarding the security of the State should be exempt from legislation like this.  That is quite legitimate but I wonder if it is a proper balance between the rights of the individual and the security of the State to leave this simply up to the opinion of the Minister.  It appears to me that there is a case for an element of independent judgment on issues like this.  I understand <Col N="2040" /> that an amendment to this effect was discussed in the other House.</P>
    <P>It is my view that there is a good case for this although I appreciate the argument put forward by the Minister in the other House, that for much of this information the fewer people who have access to it the more secure it is.  However, we are talking about delicate balances and my preference has always been for a degree of independence in this area, even if it was to be a designated member of the High Court who would have the final say.  There is an important need for a balance in this regard.  The provision is loaded in favour of the Minister and unnecessarily so.  The objectives being set out could easily be met without that excessively generalised provision.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the restriction of the right of access.  I must confess that having read subsection (1) (a) and (b) three or four times the precise meaning of paragraph (b) has evaded me.  It is not the Minister's obligation to explain it to me but I appeal to him to do so.  I cannot understand that provision and I would be interested in hearing an explanation of it, I do not think anybody could argue with most of the exemptions.  It is correct that any information which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and discipline in a prison should be exempt.  However, it is not clear who makes the decision in regard to that.  At least in regard to section 1 it is clearly the Minister who will take the decision and in other section the decision is left to a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána or an officer of equivalent status in the Defence Forces.  However, in other paragraphs it is not clear at what level of an agency the decision must be taken. That is the major quibble I have with section 5.  It is not clear in regard to the security of prisons who will be the person to decise on this issue.  Will it be the Minister, a designated officer of the Department or some other official?</P>
    <P>In section 8, which deals with the disclosure of information in certain cases, it is clear that in paragraph (a) the information can be disclosed if in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána not <Col N="2041" /> below the rank of chief superintendent or an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces who holds an Army rank not below that of colonel the information is required for the purposes of safeguarding the security of the State.  Nobody can argue with that and that appears to be a reasonable provision.  I could argue about how I, and other people, would judge what is necessary for the security of the State but the security of the State must have the right to have access to information. Again, I would prefer if there was an element of independent assessment in regard to this, particularly in regard to the way search warrants, and other warrants, must be supported by an independent agent.  That would be more acceptable and would guarantee a measure of accountability.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) states that if the disclosure is required for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating offences, apprehending or prosecuting offenders or assessing or collecting any tax the restrictions in the Bill do not apply.  Paragraph (c) states that the restrictions do not apply if the disclosure is required in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State. What struck me about those provisions &mdash; it may be covered in a section that I may have missed or misread &mdash; is who will decide that the information is required for the purposes listed or is required in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State.</P>
    <P>There is a slight element of a catchall phrase about some of those phrases. There is a &ldquo;just in case it might be needed&rdquo; feeling about them.  It seems that it is not at all clear that the decisions to demand access to information for those reasons would be taken by somebody at a level of competence or of authority which would be appropriate to the breach of privacy that is involved.  I am not arguing with any other issues raised in section 8.  I am simply saying that it ought to be made clear that the access to data required under paragraph (b) and (c) ought to be given only on foot of serious need and on the authority of <Col N="2042" /> somebody of an appropriate degree of seniority.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan, I have just come in.  Are we on Second Stage or on Committee Stage?  What you are saying sounds a little like a Committee Stage contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have thought so but that is a matter for you rather than for me to decide.  In conclusion, I regret that, even though the Minister mentioned this in his speech, there is not an actual prohibition on hacking as a criminal offence.  Hacking is another form of burglary.  It is electronic burglary. It is as improper as breaking into somebody's house, breaking open their filing cabinets and stealing their records.  It is glamourised to some extent by people who are in the computer hobby business. The fact that it is carried out by people who do not perhaps act or look like criminals does not take away from the fact that it is an appalling breach of people's privacy.  It is a breach of proper practice in terms of trade secrets and so on.  It should be made a criminal offence and I would like the Minister to assure us that it will be made so quickly.</P>
      <P>With those reservations I welcome the Bill and look forward to its operation.  I suspect that, as happened in Britain where it was anticipated that there would be a flood of people wishing to find out personal data but where from recent reports the number was fewer than 100, if not fewer than 50, the same will happen in this country until perhaps there is some upsurge and somebody will be swamped with information.  It is important that in the whole area of the assessment of the credit worthiness of individuals, people should have the right of access to such information.  Whatever about the security of the State in cases involving major issues, many private agencies make decisions about ordinary citizens on the basis of what is often less than reliable information so people ought to have the right of access to the correct information. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Senators, I extend a very warm welcome to this Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  It is very appropriate at this time.  As Senator Ryan has said, it is absolutely mind-boggling to think of the developments that have taken place in recent times in relation to the whole computer business.  One wonders what further developments will be made in the next 20 years.  This Data Protection Bill is very appropriate at present.  I have always been a strong advocate of the protection of individuals rights relative to the automatic processing of personal data.  Like Senator Ryan, I think that experience will show that eventually we will be obliged to enact legislation to cover personal data which is held in all media as well as that which is proposed for electronic media.</P>
      <P>I have had the experience of a family in my constituency &mdash; this relates to credit worthiness which was referred to by Senator Ryan &mdash; who were very hard working and had never been in trouble or difficulties.  When the time came for their eldest son to attend third level education they applied to a financial institution for funding for that purpose but were turned down.  They could not understand the reason for this and when they inquired from the financial institution they were told that their personal history was not satisfactory.  They were amazed at this answer and asked for details of the information on the file.  They were told that there was no legislation to force that institution to give that type of information. The family were absolutely shattered. They felt that their good name had been taken away and, as far as they were concerned, for no good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I witnessed another example of an oil company which funds the installation of central heating.  The family in question filled a form giving details of their commitments and so on but the oil company refused the funding for the work.  A week later the same family were given a proposal form by another oil company stating that they were prepared to fund the installation.  In this case individuals were collecting data on families, giving it to <Col N="2044" /> one oil company and recommending that these people should not get the funding while at the same time recommending to another oil company that they should get it.  These individuals were gaining on both sides.  They could not lose.  They were knocking the person to one oil company and recommending him to another.  That practice is absolutely deplorable but this legislation will rectify it.  The legislation probably should have been in place many years ago.</P>
    <P>An individual has a right to the information that is stored about him or her. He has a right to get a copy of the data to ensure that it is accurate and he has a right to compensation if inaccurate data has damaged him in any way.  If the information is not accurate the person has a right to have it rectified or erased.  I welcome this legislation from the point of view of strengthening individuals' rights. The Bill proposes to give to individuals rights of access to personal data which is held by others and I hope that individuals will make use of those rights.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications for businesses in the implementation of the legislation. I say serious implications from the point of view that if they do not comply with the legislation they will have to endure fairly severe sanctions.  No serious problems will arise for businesses if they adopt a positive approach and carry on their businesses with the normal good practices that most companies uphold. In other words, if the operation of the companies complies with the generally accepted standards already in practice there will not be a great impact on companies' operations other than in a few areas.  The companies, as the Bill outlines, will have to make sure that information is obtained and processed lawfully, that the data will be accurate and kept up to date, that it must be held for legitimate and specified purposes, that the data will only be used or disclosed in a way which is compatible with these purposes and that it will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to specified purposes.  Individuals would expect that companies would, in the normal course of their business, carry out <Col N="2045" /> these practices in a fair and reasonable manner.  It is not expecting too much from them to comply with those regulations as it is the practice of good standards.</P>
    <P>The individual, or as described in the Bill, the data subject, will have the right to access to information held about him or her on payment of a specified fee.  The data subject is entitled under the Bill to have the data held about him corrected or erased where the legal provisions safeguarding personal data have not been complied with.  If correction or erasure is required the data subject is entitled to a refund of the fee paid for the disclosure of the information.  Again, this gives the individual a right which is long overdue. I hope that the fee which will be set will be reasonable and will not prevent any individual from gaining access to the information held about him or her.  The provision in this Bill will involve the owner of the data or the company in additional costs but I believe these costs will not be over-excessive.  The costs will arise in two areas: (1) the provision of programmes to access and correct or erase the data; and (2) the overhead in providing a further service which up to now was not required.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 6 (2) (b) of the Bill requires the owner of the data, where an irregularity has been discovered in personal data, to notify &ldquo;...any person to whom the data were disclosed during the period of 12 months immediately before the giving or sending of the request, of the rectification, erasure or statement concerned&rdquo;.  Does the Minister think this section may cause difficulties or that it would be impractical?  It is interesting to note that a similar provision was included in the draft legislation in the UK but was not included in the final legislation.  That is not to say that we should follow to the letter of the law exactly as happens in Great Britain. Does the Minister think that the procedures in relation to following through on that section will be workable?  The legislation could add some high additional costs and, as I said earlier, <Col N="2046" /> those may be impracticable or unworkable. If these are found to be impracticable or unworkable this might cause damage to an absolutely tremendous Bill. This would be a tragedy because the Bill provides essential and fundamental rights for individuals.  Companies will also be required to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to disclosure, alteration or disruption of data and against additional loss or destruction.  While these provisions may appear to be serious at first glance, they are essential practices for any computer based system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is vital also in the context of the Custom House Docks Financial Services Centre which will be of tremendous benefit to this country.  As the Minister stated the object of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data.  Its relevance to the Financial Services Centre lies in the fact that when the Council of Europe Convention is fully operational it will permit satisfying countries to refuse personal information to be transferred to other countries which do not have comparable data protection laws.  It is imperative, therefore, that we enact this legislation from a Council of Europe point of view as well as from the point of view of the individual's rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of a Data Protection Commissioner for a term of not less than five years.  I understand the urgency for enacting this legislation but I believe this is only the beginning of the freedom of information. I ask the Minister to note that in the French system a Data Protection Commission were set up to help the commissioner. The Minister has agreed to review the legislation on an ongoing basis and perhaps he might consider at some time in the future the appointment of a commission because the amount of data that will be forthcoming in terms of the media, as against data processing, will be absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>I note that Senator Ferris asked a number of questions about registration. <Col N="2047" /> I hope that the experience in the UK will not be repeated here.  Registration in the UK has not worked too smoothly.  All data users are required to register and I think that caused the problem there.  This Bill requires that only certain categories of people have to register.  This is the way to start and eventually this requirement can be extended to other data users down the line.  This legislation will immediately benefit the major areas of operation and it will then filter down to other areas of operation.  This should prevent the repetition here of what happened in England. The UK Act has been in operation for four years but registration has not been running smoothly there.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this very positive and essential legislation.  I look forward to its successful implementation and its eventual extension to cover full data protection and freedom of information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Senators who have spoken I also welcome this Bill. Its genesis is fairly ancient in European political terms.  The Bill is not just one of domestic generation: there is a requirement under Article 4 of the Convention that, before a State can become party to this Convention, it must have taken the necessary measures in its domestic law to give effect to the basic principles for data protection set out in it.  The genesis of this legislation in Europe goes back to the seventies and I have before me an OECD document dated Paris, 1 October 1980, with a lengthy preamble which recognises the necessity for this legislation and the benefits that flow from it. While I agree with most of the benefits that are stated in this preamble to flow from such legislation, I have one query with regard to the preamble which says very positively that trans-border flows of personal data contribute to economic and social development.  That is one way of looking at it, but there are very clear dangers in the unrestricted trans-border flow of computerised data and information. I will return to this because I want to seek an undertaking from the <Col N="2048" /> Minister that he has utilised to the maximum the capacity within the Convention for the derogation of sovereign states from certain of its provisions.</P>
      <P>The principles which were laid down in the 1980 document are interesting and most of them have been fulfilled.  Paragraph 7 of the document states that there should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.  This addresses a point made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, when he asked the Minister &mdash; and I shall also add my voice to this request &mdash; to make hacking into information banks a criminal offence.  I am very pleased to see the Minister nodding because this is most important.  The Minister specified certain areas in which information relating to the financial status of individuals or the very personal, intimate, private, sexual conduct of individuals may or may not be legitimately held by organs of this State. It would be quite outrageous for there to be no penalty if this information could be invaded and exploited by computer amateurs.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 8 of this document states that personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used and, to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.  This is a very important principle and I would like an assurance from the Minister that he will go a little bit further in this legislation &mdash; and I have not noticed that he has &mdash; so that not only will this principle be implemented but also that information gathered, for example, by the security forces of the State, the Garda, the Army, the secret service or financial institutions information gathered, garnered in for one purpose shall not be reusable subsequently for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this because of what happened in the course of investigating the murders of nurse Helen Gargan and of Charles Self.  In particular with regard to the murder of Charles Self, there was a very extensive investigation during which a <Col N="2049" /> wholesale fishing expedition was conducted by the Garda which had absolutely no relevance whatever to what ended up as a completely unsuccessful murder investigation.  If this information was kept on computerised files and if this information was subject to free transborder flow, it could have very serious consequences for Irish citizens who subsequently sought employment under the free movement of labour in the European Community.  For example, in Germany there have been considerable protests recently about the so-called <i>Berufsverbot</i>, whereby people who engaged in protests in certain areas of social reform and so on were placed on a categorised list and thereby excluded from employment by central state agencies. I would seek a clear and explicit understanding from the Minister that, under the terms of this Bill, information collected for one specific purpose shall not be used against the interests of the citizen for other purposes.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 of this OECD document dated, 1 October, 1980 states under the heading &ldquo;Openness Principle&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data.  Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller.</P>
    <P>There is then a section on the &ldquo;Individual Participation Principle&rdquo; most of which has been satisfactorily met by the provisions of a Bill which, in general principle, I am very glad to welcome.  The Minister may be interested to learn what was being thought in 1980.  I should not say to learn, that is very presumptuous of me; I assume that he probably knows already.  However paragraph 13 reads:</P>
    <P>An individual should have the right:</P>
    <P>(a)  To obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data controller has data relating to him;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> (b)  To have communicated to him, data relating to him</P>
    <P>(i)  Within a reasonable time;</P>
    <P>(ii)  At a charge, if any, that is not excessive;</P>
    <P>(iii)  In a reasonable manner; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  In a form that is readily intelligible to him;</P>
    <P>(c)  To be given reasons if a request made under sub-paragrpahs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and</P>
    <P>(d)  To challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data erased, rectified, completed or amended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a document entitled Recommendation of the Council of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data.</P>
      <P>I would like to move on now because what is being spoken about here is data protection.  I am very glad that the Minister has not followed the early draft of the convention which spoke of files, because that was unnecessarily restrictive. However I do have to say that, when the Minister in his introductory remarks, referred to a lack of; public concern with regard to what I might call manually stored data, he is being just a little bit disingenuous because the Minisiter knows that there has been concern in this area for quite a considerable time.  I recognise the difficulties but I do not think they are incapable of being overcome. I would remind the Minister that, as early as 1983, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties made this clear.  I have before me a letter from a researcher who was commissioned to undertake research work on this matter on behalf of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point the researcher makes <Col N="2051" /> in her letter is that the provision of safeguards in respect of non-automated as well as in respect of automated personal data must be undertaken.  Therefore, it will be seen that there was concern five years ago, concern that I believe was expressed perhaps not to the present Minister but to his predecessors.  I know also, because this was an unusual area by virtue of the fact that, I will not say rival but two analogous Irish organisations, for once, were not at each other's throats and were able to co-operate in a joint committee.  I speak of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and of the Irish Association for Civil Liberties.  I understand that both of those organisations made representations with regard to the protection of non-automated storage of personal data.  I hope that perhaps the Minister's advisers will seek some further clarification and consultation with both these worthy organisations with regard to their feelings on this matter.  It will be clear from any contact with them that there has indeed been considerable concern in this area.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says that the protection of manually-held data is another day's work and that he is sure it will come in time but that he has no evidence of public concern in this regard and consequently it will have to get a lower priority, I hope that if nothing else, my speech here this morning will be evidence of public concren in this area.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to move it up his scale of priorities and that his advisers will refresh their memories with regard to the publicly-expressed concern.  I believe there has been concern because, of course, the computerisation of this kind of information is relatively recent phenomenon and merely exacerbates what has been an existing problem of a very sensitive nature.  People are concerned that information should be stored, very often without their knowledge, about their personal lives in a way which may multiply and may have a damging effect on them.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote very briefly the four principles that have been isolated by <Col N="2052" /> the Council of Europe in their explanatory report on the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data. They are quite short and say that safeguards include four main elements: knowledge about the existence of an automated data file; knowledge about the contents of the information, if any, stored about data subject in a file; rectification of erroneous or inappropriate information, and a remedy if any of the previous elements are not respected.  The report was issued in Strasbourg on 28 January 1981 by the Council of Europe. These principles have been clearly outlined in a White Paper on data protection emanating from the British Home Office in April 1982 entitled <i>Data Protection</i>&mdash;<i>The Government's Proposals for Legislation.</i> I should like to deal with its substance which is very relevant to this Bill. It says, regarding general principles:</P>
    <P>The general principles set out in the Younger Report ... were broadly endorsed by the LINDOP Commitee and have been embodied in the Data Protection Convention.  The principles (following Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Convention) are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  The information shall be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully...</P>
    <P>Again, right at the top of the menu, comes this idea of access to information lawfully.  I might draw the Minister's attention to this again.  I am very glad that he nodded.  I take it that means that there will be a Government amendment making hacking into this information a criminal offence.  I certainly hope so.  If not the Minister can rest assured that such an amendment will be put from these benches and I am sorry to have to say a vote called for.  This is part of the duties of legislators.  If I did not do it I am perfectly certain my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, would do it, because it is very important.  Perhaps the Government will be prepared to graciously accept an amendment in this area.  Obviously the Minister agrees in principle that this is an <Col N="2053" /> important area in which people should be protected.  There is no reason some bright student in one of our colleges of technology should be entitled to free access to the most intimate, embarrassing and perhaps potentialy damaging information about us as individuals.  The citizens of this State have every right to be protected in this area.  Subparagraph (ii) says: &ldquo;It shall be held for a specified and legitimate purpose or purposes&rdquo;.  Again my previous comments apply; subparagraph (iii) says: it shall not be used or disclosed in a way incompatible with those purposes&rdquo;; subparagraph (iv) says: &ldquo;It shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the specified purpose.&rdquo;; and subparagraph (v) says: &ldquo;It shall be accurate and, where necessary kept up to date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (vi) states that it shall be kept in name, length, form, no longer than is necessary for the specified purposes. Again, there are certain areas which it may very well be important for co-operation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice.  As the situation with regard to AIDS, for example, worsens, the gathering and storage of information about the spread of HIV infection may well be something necessary in preparation for certain prophylactic measures on behalf of the State, but this must not be name-linked. It is important with regard to this sensitive information, where people's employment may be threatened, that these kinds of protections should be entered.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (vii) states that the data subject shall have access to information held about him or her and entitled to its correction or erasure where the legal provision safeguarding personal data have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (viii) specifies that appropriate security measures must be taken against unauthorised access, alteration or dissemination, accidental loss and accidental or unauthorised destruction of data.  There is quite an amount of emphasis here on areas that I believe are not directly covered as yet by the Bill although, as I say, it is a Bill to which I <Col N="2054" /> have no difficulty whatever in giving a general welcome.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; and I am glad to see that the Minister appears to agree with this in the legislation &mdash; that the legislation needs to apply to both the private and public sectors.  I believe also it is important that we should have the maximum benefit of the derogations that I spoke of earlier on and perhaps it would be possible for the Minister to give some reassurance on that.  I believe also that the public interest in the non-disclosure of sensitive information, such as that held by the Secret Service on individuals or details of a criminal investigation, can be realised by expressly dealing in the legislation with the extent of permissible limitations, as the Convention attempts to do Article 9.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely seeking some information from the Minister with regard to the operations of the Bill.  I note that in his speech he mentioned that section 11 deals, as I understand, with certain derogations from this chapter dealing with transborder data flows but I wonder if it goes as far as we are allowed, because article 12 (2) states that a Party shall not, for the sole purpose of the protection of privacy, prohibit or subject to special authoritisation transborder flows of personal data going to the territory of another party.  In paragraph (3) it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, each Party shall be entitled to derogate how the provisions of paragraph 2: (a) in so far as its legislation includes specific regulations for certain categories of personal data or automated personal data files, because the nature of those data or those files, except where the regulations of the other party provided equivalent protection and (b) when the transfer is made from its territory to the territory of a non-contracting State through the intermediary of the territory of another party in order to avoid such transfers resulting in circumvention of the legislation of the party referred to at the beginning of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> Reading that &mdash; and I may be reading it inaccurately &mdash; it seems that in this legislation we have not gone to the full limits of our capacity for derogation. Again, I may be reading it inaccurately, but section 11 seems to leave a very wide margin for discretion in the hands of the commissioner and this derogation is by no means automatic, as perhaps it should be.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to give a number of instances, because they put it into a kind of human framework, of the kinds of ways in which, not in this jurisdiction but in Great Britain, it has been found by the National Council for Civil Liberties that the holding of data files can operate to the disadvantage very clearly of the individual.  I would like to instance just three brief cases from a book called <i>Privacy: The Information Gatherers</i> by Patricia Hewitt of the National Council for Civil Liberties, published first in 1977. The first instance is:</P>
    <P>Mr. C, attempting to expand a small, but profitable business, suddenly found himself unable to get credit.  He went to the offices of a local trade association specialising in credit reports and asked for a reference on his own firm.</P>
    <P>This is clearly the area in which this legislation is dealing.</P>
    <P>The manager pulled out a record card and said: &ldquo;Don't deal with that bastard; he's a bad risk.  People like him should be locked up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I apologise, a Cathaoirligh, for the unparliamentary language.</P>

      <P>Then it can be withdrawn and covered by a discreet ellipsis which, no doubt, will be of such a nature that it will perhaps suggest an even more colourful epithet to those who read the Official Report.  Unlike a late Member of the Seanad, Professor Maguinis, who believed that the people of Ireland were queuing up at the Stationery Office to buy the Official Report of the Seanad in order to read about <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> and inflame themselves erotically with reports of cows being led to the bull and so on, I doubt very much if the plain people of Ireland are going to queue up to see what kind of unparliamentary language is being used, but I accept fully the Cathaoirleach's ruling.</P>

      <P>I shall be very glad to do so.  In any case, the person involved here ended up with the phrase &ldquo;people like him should be locked up.&rdquo; He was obviously unaware that he was addressing the subject of that report.  Although the record stated that Mr. C. had been served with county court bad debt judgments over a period of three years, these judgments had been made against Mr. C's father, who had incurred them when he was ill and dying.</P>
      <P>I may say, in an aside, that I had occasion to meet a distinguished member of the Irish peerage at a reception in the American Embassy on Saturday and he informed me that when he went to acquire his late father's death certificate he was actually presented with his own death certificate, which he unwisely corrected because, if he had not corrected it, he would have been exempt from income tax.  If anybody is kind enough to present me with my death certificate you may take it for certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will accept it and I am sure there are other Members of this House who would also accept it only too gladly.  Mr. C's father had incurred these debts when he was ill, dying and incapable of handling his affairs.  That is the most extraordinary situation.  It is precisely what this Bill needs to deal with. It would be an abuse of the hospitality of the Chamber and the Minister's patience to read any further examples, so I will not do so.</P>
      <P>However, with regard to the storage of this information, it can be equally damaging for the individual if it is held in manually operated systems, although I would have to accept that the damage is multiplied if this is fed into an automated system and it is infinitely more difficult to correct.  Once it gets into the system it can circulate in a matter of seconds all over the world and can be notoriously difficult to correct.  I would like to quote from an article in a report called <i>Privacy and Social Control</i> by John Shattuck in the <i>Privacy Report</i> Volume 3, Number 8, of March 1976, published by the American Civil Liberties Union.  There are some really remarkable and appropriate phrases in it.  I am glad to be able to say that it is quite short.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power may come out of the barrel of a gun but far more power comes out of a computer or data bank, particularly if the information in it relates to people who do not know that it has been collected or cannot challenge its accuracy or use.  The definition of privacy as a right to control information about oneself is, therefore, a good one. Widespread collection and use of personal information is, of course, an inevitable feature of our society.  The social services we regard as essential, medical, legal, social welfare, educational, credit insurance, could only be performed when there is a full and honest disclosure by the person served <Col N="2058" /> to those performing the service.  Unfortunately the service providers often fail to consider the larger forces of social control whose unwitting instruments they become when they collect data from their clients.  We must, therefore, constantly guard against the use of personal information as a means of exercising social control by establishing procedures to ensure that, to the maximum possible extent, people can disclose what they want about themselves only to those whom they want to tell.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the possibility for inquiry into the personal files kept on people although only about 100 people used the facility in England when it was brought in.  I would like the Minister to know that I would be one who would be seeking information.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister will be perfectly well aware that a number of years ago my telephone was tapped and it was quite impossible for me to get a statement on this matter.  I consulted my legal adviser. Senator Mary Robinson, and she said there was no point in pursuing it because I would be met with this idea of the security of the State.  I would not wish to be contentious or difficult but I may remark to the House that during a court case which I took, a very unpleasant line of inquiry was embarked upon.  I knew my telephone was tapped and I telephoned the head of the Dutch Liberal Party and asked them to please send an observer over.  They did so and that line of inquiry was dropped.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the logical fallacy <i>post hocergo propter hoc</i> and I would not dream of suggesting that because I made a little ministerial broadcast on my leaky telephone that this occurred but one is entitled in the privacy of one's mind to certain suspicions, however unworthy they are.  As a person who has always led the most upright, morally blameless, reproachless life that would not bring a blush to the face of an Anglican nun, I will be fascinated to discover what can possibly be recorded in files, computerised, manual or any other <Col N="2059" /> kind, that may be held on me because of course I have, as the Minister will be aware, a very considerable interest in fiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Members of the Seanad for their generous and warm welcome to this legislation and I very much appreciate the positive contributions made by the Members who spoke, perhaps some contributions were not as colourful as others but then that would be difficult to expect.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Pat Kennedy who was the first contributor for his thoughtful and comprehensive contribution.  He rightly stressed the importance of ratifying the Convention and ensuring that this country is not placed at a disadvantage in the international competition for data processing. We propose to ratify the Convention at the earliest possible date and, as the Convention comes into force three months after the deposit of the instruments of ratification, the intention is to deposit these instruments three months before the Act is brought into full operation. It will take six to nine months to bring that about to give time for data controllers to adapt their systems to the requirements of the Act and to appoint the commissioner to make the regulations governing the requirements of registration of those controllers who have to register.</P>
      <P>I thank the spokesman for the Government party group in the House, Senator McEllistrim, for his very thoughtful and helpful speech.  I note he also stressed the need for early ratification of the Bill so that its benefits, the protection and privacy of individuals and improving the competitive position of this country in securing data processing contracts can be availed of.  I assure Senator McEllistrim we will get our data protection system off the ground as soon as we possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris also welcomed the Bill and I thank him for this welcome.  I note <Col N="2060" /> that in his speech he emphasised the wide support the Bill has in the House, as it had indeed in the Dáil.  Senator Ferris asked how a person could establish the existence of personal data when everyone with such data is not required to register. It is true that this Bill is based on partial registrations so as to avoid having a bureaucratic and onerous system.  Under section 3, any individual who believes that a person keeps personal data has the right to ask that person whether he keeps such data and, if he does, the purposes for which they are kept.</P>
    <P>There is also a right to be supplied with a description of the data because, under section 4, an individual has a right (a) to be informed by the data controller whether the data kept include personal data relating to him and (b) the right to be supplied with a copy.  These two rights enable an individual to establish the existence of personal data relating to him or her and to have access to the data.  I expect that every data controller will set out in a brief document the purposes for which he holds the data and also a description of the data.  If he gets an inquiry under section 3, all he has to do is to put a copy of the document into the envelope and send it to the inquirer.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan asked about the definition of data controller.  He asked if it applied to individuals as distinct from companies.  It applies to individuals and companies because &ldquo;person&rdquo; in statutes includes companies by reason of the general provision in the Interpretation Act, 1937.  I am glad the Senator gave me the opportunity of explaining this.  He also asked if every medical consultant who has computerised health data is a data controller and if so, whether he has to register.  The answer to that is he will be a data controller if he controls the contents and use of the data as, presumably, most private consultants would. All data controllers with health data have to register.  The fee to be charged for registration will be fixed by regulation and we have not yet come to any decision on the basis to be used for the charging of fees.  We will bear in mind what Senator Eogan said on behalf of consultants and <Col N="2061" /> others in a similar position when the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan suggested that opinions can be misleading or incorrect as factual matters and that, therefore, incorrect or misleading opinions should equally be liable to be corrected or erased.  There are two arguments against this.  First &mdash; a technical reason perhaps &mdash; opinions are regarded as being personal data relating to the persons who express them rather than to the subject of the opinion.  Secondly, apart from that, it would be impossible to say in most cases whether an opinion is correct.  We all have our opinions.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also asked about section 8 (a) which allows a data controller to disclose personal data if he is asked to do so in the interests of safeguarding the security of the State.  The personal data concerned might have nothing to do with security matters but, nevertheless, could have implications for national security.  An example of this would be where an employee of a firm engaged on a Government defence contract was suspected of leaking sensitive information to subversive groups or perhaps he was employed by a firm making or using explosives and was suspected of transferring them to these groups.  The Garda would go to that firm and seek information about him.  In so far as the information sought was held on the firms's computer it could not ordinarily be disclosed to the Garda because disclosures to them would not be compatible with the purposes for which the information was kept, personal or payroll information and so on.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) overrides these restrictions on disclosure and enables the controller to co-operate with the Garda if he wishes to do so but he is not compelled to do so.  How would a firm be satisfied that they could safely disclose personal data under this provision?  I believe that if they had any doubt about whether the information was required for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State they would ask the chief superintendent or Army officer, as the case might be, personally to state his opinion that the <Col N="2062" /> information was required for that purpose. If the matter was urgent &mdash; possibly involving a risk to life or property &mdash; and the chief superintendent was not present to make a request for information the firm could contact the chief superintendent by telephone for reassurance. If time allowed the chief superintendent could give a certificate about the purpose fo which the information was required.</P>
    <P>In any subsequent proceedings that might be taken against the data controller for having disclosed the data that certificate, or a similar certificate prepared subsequently, would be evidence of the chief superintendent's or the Army officer's opinion.  This is the effect of section 26 (1) (b).  That certificate would be enough to absolve the data controller from any civil liability even if it were possible for any aggrieved party to prove that the chief superintendent could not reasonably have been or was not of that opinion, unless it is clear that the data controller knew all along that that was the case.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (b) sets out the case in which a data controller is permitted to disclose personal data even though the disclosure is not named as such in the registered entry where the controller is registered or where the data controller is not required to register.  The disclosure would not be compatible with the purposes for which the data are kept.  It allows personal data to be disclosed where the disclosure is required for purposes of crime prevention, revenue assessment or collection and so on.  However, such a disclosure is permitted only where non-disclosure would be likely to prejudice any of those purposes.  An example would be where the Garda get a tip-off that a man's life has been threatened and that an attack against him is being planned. They might approach the individual's employer to ascertain his address for the purposes of alerting him.  If that information is held on a computer it would be difficult to justify withholding it either because the data controller has not registered the Garda's disclosures or where the employer is not required to register because such disclosure would not be <Col N="2063" /> compatible with the purposes for which the data is kept.  Here again it is up to the data controller to disclose the information or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about section 5 (1) (b).  Paragraph (b) extends the exemption from the right of access where the personal data referred to in subsection (1) (a), that is, crime or revenue data, are passed to a third party who needs them for the discharge for a statutory function. For example, the Revenue Commissioners may pass such data to the Ombudsman to enable him to investigate a complaint.  The Ombudsman has power to compel the production of documents so departments would have no option but to disclose the data.  Once the data are in his possession, strictly speaking, they would not so far as the Ombudsman is concerned, be held for the purpose of assessing or collecting tax so that without the extension of the exemption the subject could gain access to the data.  The same would apply to data held by the police and passed on to the Garda Complaints Board in the course of investigating a complaint about Garda conduct.</P>
    <P>As regards, the maintenance of good order and discipline in prisons, section 5 (1) (c) restricts the subject access provisions in any case to which the application of those provisions would be likely to prejudice the security of or the maintenance of good order and discipline in prisons or other places of detention such as military barracks.  The decision on this would be taken by the Governor of the prison subject to review by the data commissioner and of course by an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also asked about section 8 (c).  Section 8 lists those cases where the restrictions in the Bill on data controllers disclosing personal data to third parties will not apply, for example where the garda need information for security purposes for the prevention of crime or where disclosure is urgently needed to prevent injury to someone and so on. Because the protection of the international relations of the State is equally <Col N="2064" /> important as State security it is right and logical that a data controller should also be free, if he so wishes, to disclose information to the proper authority.  This is the effect of section 8 (c).</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna referred to the question of credit worthiness.  I endorse what has been said by him and also by Senator Ryan.  It is because of the concern expressed by them that credit reference agencies and financial institutions are required to register.  It will be for the commissioner to decide what information will be required to be included in the register entry but he has power to require that persons who have to register must also disclose the sources of the information they have on their computers.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna expressed the hope that the fee to be prescribed for access would be reasonable.  The Bill does not require any fee to be charged and I hope that many data controllers will not charge a fee especially where the information can be provided quickly.  In fact data controllers may find it an advantage to send date to data subjects periodically in so far as it would help to keep the data accurate and up to date.  In any case, if the cost of supplying the information is less than the prescribed fee the lower figure will apply.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I agree with Senator McKenna that the fee should be reasonable and I will undertake to prescribe a reasonable sum.  Senator McKenna asked if section 6 (2) was essential, if it would prove to be impractical or impose an undue burden on data controllers. Section 6 (2) requires a data controller who has made a correction or an erasure, at the request of the data subject, to notify everyone to whom he has disclosed the data during the preceding 12 months. This provision cannot be brought into operation until data controllers have adjusted their system so that a record is made of each disclosure.  This is called logging.  Subject to that I do not think it unreasonable that controllers should notify these corrections or erasures to people who have been given incorrect information and who may be making decisions, say, on credit worthiness on <Col N="2065" /> them.  Several continental legislations have such a provision.  However, there will be consultations with the public and the private sector before this provision is brought into force.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris advocates making hacking <i>per se</i> an offence under the Bill. I have to repeat that this would not be appropriate in this Bill which deals only with data protection &mdash; the protection of privacy of individuals &mdash; whereas hacking can affect a far wider area, fraud, larceny and so on and reaches into the general area of criminal law.  Making hacking an offence under the general law has been the subject of detailed consideration in a number of countries but no country has made it the subject of a provision of data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Bill as regards unauthorised accessing of computer data goes further than any other European legislation or proposed legislation on data protection.  It is generally accepted that this type of legislation is not the appropriate vehicle for legislating on hacking. Even in those jurisdictions where hacking has been legislated for, there is a divergence of opinion as to whether hacking <i>per se</i> should be an offence or whether it should have to be accompanied by a subsequent disclosure to constitute an offence.</P>
    <P>There are several problems about making hacking <i>per se</i> an offence.  Hacking is not a legal term but rather a colourful Americanism.  There are great difficulties in establishing exactly when hacking takes place.  Hacking in one view might actually be advantageous since it encourages improvements in data and computer security to be made.  I have answered as best I could the points raised by the Members of the Seanad, points which I very much appreciate because they contribute to a thorough processing of the legislative measures which are before us for consideration.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's amendment, formally moved by Senator Fennell, I understand Senator Manning is anxious that the requirement in section 3 that a data controller should give an inquirer a description of the data would not involve him in giving a very detailed account.  I know the Senator is particularly concerned with health data.  I can give Senaror Manning the definite assurance he requires.  Any holder of health data must register, and the registration regulations will prescribe the way in which the data are to be described in the registered entry.  It is envisaged that only a general description will be required for the register and the same will apply to the information given under section 3.

      <P>The Minister replied at considerable length on Second Stage to some questions I had about section 8.  I would not claim to have read this Bill in great detail but he did refer to the data which are required in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State.  I do not have any disagreement about that, but the Minister suggested that it would be the Garda who would do such things and section 8 states quite clearly that the Garda or an authorised officer of the Defence Forces will be <Col N="2068" /> involved.  Why is this necessarily restricted to the Garda?  Is there any restriction on the sort of people who can go looking for the data?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction at all.  It is not being confined to the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Garda as an example, and one can appreciate that, but maybe he can explain why it is so broadly drafted that virtually any agent of a State agency, could ask for this information.  For example, the whole of the Department of Foreign Affairs could be looking for information on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill prevents any disclosure whatsoever unless the person registered is a disclosee.  That is why it is as broad as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily on what is noncontroversial legislation, but is the Minister satisfied it is a good idea that virtually anybody who is connected in any way with the international relations of the State can go looking for what is otherwise protected data?  This puts the onus of the decision on the person who is responsible for the custody of that data and seems to dilute quite substantially the important protections contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Certain foreign companies, especially American companies, have set up companies in Ireland processing data for their customers and their clients who live abroad.  Will they have to register here?  What will be the position of their customers, who will be mainly citizens of another country?  Can American citizens get that data under this Bill or will the companies have to register here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senator McEllistrim will not mind if I begin by saying that I cannot, as Minister, give an authoritative opinion on the application of this Bill in a particular case.  The Senator will appreciate that much will <Col N="2069" /> depend on the facts, the relationship between the American company and the Irish company and so on.  However, the following principles would need to be taken into consideration in reaching a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>First, anyone who processes personal data in the State for another individual or firm, whether resident here or outside the State, is subject to the Bill and must register as a data processor in accordance with section 16.  Second, if the Irish company control the contents and the use of the data, they are a data controller and will have to register as such if they come within one of the categories mentioned in section 16.  In fact the data commissioner will advise, in due course, any firms who may be doubtful about their position. That is as far as I can go at this stage.  If, on reflection, I can get further information on the matter I will communicate with the Deputy on this case but I do not want to give an authoritative opinion on an individual case as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is satisfied about the drafting of the legislation. Otherwise he would not have brought it here.  I would like to understand the reasoning behind it because it seems to me to be extraordinarily broad. Virtually anybody involved in preventing, detecting, and investigating offences, apprehending or prosecuting offenders or assessing or collecting any tax due to anyone or any other moneys, whatever their degree of seniority, or the opposite, if I can coin an awful word &ldquo;juniority&rdquo; can actually contact somebody who has responsibility under this Act to protect personal privacy and transfer the onus for disclosure onto that person if they can simply say, &ldquo;We are trying to collect tax, we are trying to collect duty&rdquo;.  I would have thought that it would be reasonable to say that that had to be authorised by a person of some degree of seniority in any investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me a recipe for quite chaotic attempts to seek personal data by anybody who is involved.  It could be very junior officials of the tax office, of the Garda Síochána, of a local authority or a <Col N="2070" /> health board who could actually contact people who have a duty under the law to protect personal privacy.  What I do not understand is that why there is not a reference in paragraphs (b) and (c) to an authorised officer of a designated status to authorise such inquiries.  Presumably there is a reason, and I would like to know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to this particular section, there is a slight difference between Senator Ryan's interpretation of it and mine.  I do not accept that this is as widely drawn as Senator Ryan suggests and I am advised that this is so.  It is there primarily for the purpose of protecting the data controller who elects to give information in certain essential cases from breaching the restrictions in the Bill on disclosing information to people who are not registered as disclosees. The exceptions are very tightly drawn and are done so in the interests of the public.  Of course, the data controller need not give the information.  He does not have to give it.  He can do so if he wishes and if he thinks it is in the interests of the State to so do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said does not really answer my question. Maybe I am wrong about the extent or the generality or the sort of generalisations that are contained in it, but in the case of paragraph (a) the basic condition for seeking disclosure is the authorisation or the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank <Col N="2071" /> of chief superintendent or a member of the Defence Forces not below the rank of colonel, which seems to me to be not unreasonable.  On another occasion I might argue about that but that is not the issue.  That is a reasonable qualification but is it not likely there will be a fairly widescale breach of the protections that are contained in this Bill by people who are of a relatively junior nature and who believe that the information would be useful.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;required&rdquo; is an interesting word.  It is not necessary: it means required.  If it makes my job easier I might think that something is required. It does not mean that it is necessary to do my job but it might make my job easier if instead of having to go and search for data through public sources.  I could contact somebody who is responsible for this data and simply say I want it because I want it for any of the conditions listed. Similarly in the case of paragraph (c) &ldquo;required in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State&rdquo; one could not argue that where information is required for that reason it should be made available but what one could argue is whether it should be available to anybody who can wave the flag of the international relations of the State.  I do not think that the Minister has given me a particularly convincing reason it should be so.  I would like to know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to make a huge issue out of it but it seems to me that we have so much detail, and justifiable details gone into about personal privacy and the control of access yet section 8 gives what seems to me to be close to being the potential for untrammelled access to people at all sorts of levels of responsibility. We have an extraordinary concern for privacy on the one hand while facilitating breaches of privacy on a grand scale on the other hand where, as the Minister says, the person responsible chooses to make the information available. Is it not a little bit unfair to those who have an obligation under the law to protect personal privacy to place the <Col N="2072" /> burden of judgment on them entirely?  I think that is a bit unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point being made by Senator Ryan.  Mainly this provision is to provide for the non-application of the restrictions in the Bill on the question of the disclosure of information except in certain cases.  Here, it is spelled out in section 8 (a) which states &ldquo;in the opinion of the member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent or a member of the Defence Forces, not below the rank of colonel ...&rdquo; they may seek particular information.  The reasons that information is then sought are spelled out in the other subsections there.  The data controller has to be satisfied that the information is required for specific purposes and that is set out in section 8 (b).  That is acceptable, but Senator Ryan must recognise that the data controller does not necessarily have to give the information that is required.  It is not as widely drawn as Senator Ryan thinks it is.  You have to give a certain element of protection to the data controller.  He is seeking to breach the restrictions in the Bill to people who are not registered as disclosees.  It is fairly tightly drawn.  It can only be done in certain circumstances and at a certain level and for very good reasons.  We are satisfied that it is as tightly drawn as we could have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), etc. were clearly an expansion of paragraph (a), there would be no problem.  In other words, if it was either a garda superintendent or a colonel in the Defence Forces or somebody of an equivalent status in whichever agency was seeking the information, one would have no problems at all with it.  I am not disputing the principle.  I have no argument with the principle that people who are attempting to enforce the law or protect the security of the State or the international interests of the State can seek information.  That is not the issue. The issue is that it is not clear to me from the legislation that anybody who has an interest in any of the things related in <Col N="2073" /> paragraph (b) or who can talk about the interests of protecting the international interests of the State could ring up any data controller and ask for information. What is to prevent a junior official in Foreign Affairs who is interested in a particular issue in which the country is involved, ringing up a data controller and asking for information about a, b and c because he believes it is required in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State?  Is there any restriction at all on the request being made?</P>
      <P>I appreciate, as the Minister has said, that the data controller does not have to respond to the request if he or she feels that it is trite or not justified, but that is perhaps a little bit unfair in terms of the balances that are necessary in legislation between the data controller and those seeking information.  My own feeling would be that if a garda superintendent wants the information, the data controller should not be allowed to refuse it. Civil Libertarian and all as I am, if the Garda or the defence forces want that sort of personal data they should be entitled to set it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that every official of a health board, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Foreign Affairs or any other Government Department concerned with international relations should be able to simply ring up and say: &ldquo;I want that information&rdquo; and leave it to some other person, who is, perhaps, conscious of his position or his future career prospects to decide to say no.  We ought to have restricted it to competent people and say that because these people believe it is important and they are informed and have knowledge of the position, they are the ones who can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite rightly, in paragraph (a) reference is made to senior officers in the Garda and Defence Forces but for other areas, which are equally important, there is no such qualification.  Why not make reference in paragraph (a) to any member of the Garda Síochána or any member of the Defence Forces?  One could turn this on its head and say that we <Col N="2074" /> are imposing an inhibition on the security forces which is not placed on any other area of State activity.  A garda superintendent or a colonel in the Army must authorise a request for information from those security forces but in other areas there is no such restriction.  I keep saying that I do not understand why there is no similar qualification in terms of seniority in paragraph (b) or in the later paragraphs as their is in paragraph (a).  I do not want to keep us here all day but if the Minister explained the thinking behind the inclusion of that distinction to me I would not say I would be happy but I would shut up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on the data controller to satisfy himself that the conditions in section 8 apply.  In all cases where the public interest requires it the data controller should be able to give the information sought without incurring a breach of the provisions in the Bill.  If he has any doubts as to whether the information sought is required for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State he should ask the chief superintendent or the Army officer, as the case may be, personally to state that the information is required for that purpose. As I mentioned in the course of my reply to Senator Ryan on Second Stage, if it referred to a case possibly involving risk to life or property where the chief superintendent was not present to make the request for information, the firm could contact the chief superintendent by telephone for reassurance.  If time allowed the chief superintendent could give a certificate about the purpose for which information was required.  In my reply on Second Stage to comments made by Senator Ryan I suggested that, in the event of a garda feeling that there was an actual threat to somebody's life, he could ask a particular question to get information from a data controller.  If the data controller felt it was necessary for his own protection he could ask for that assurance which would enable him to comply with the obligations on him as regards the disclosure of personal data in certain <Col N="2075" /> cases without incurring the risk of being prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise not to keep us one second longer than is necessary.  I can understand what the Minister is saying. That is covered by paragraph (d) which reads: &ldquo;required urgently to prevent injury or other damage to the health of a person or serious loss of or damage to property&rdquo;.  If it was specified in paragraph (d) that it was required by the Garda, the security forces or any other agent of the State involved in these sort of activities, that would be fine and one would have no problem with it but paragraph (d) does not just apply to the Garda.  Virtually any citizen could say that they desperately need to gain access to the information on a, b or c.  For instance, in the regional college where I work my home phone number will never be disclosed to anybody in any circumstances.  People can use all the plausible arguments they want but it is hard to convince oneself, particularly if an inquiry is made by phone, that there is any validity to it.</P>
      <P>Paragraphs (b) and (c) bother me.  Is there any restriction at the point of the making of the inquiry, as distinct from the right of the data controller to refuse, on who can make such inquiries?  The Minister has come some way in saying that the data controller must satisfy himself that the inquiry is valid.  That is fair enough.  That, to a considerable extent, meets my complaint but it appears that any officer of a health board, down to the level of a junior clerk, in assembling information on a debt to or the funding of a health board, can ring up any data controller and say that under the Data Protection Act they can, if they wish, give them information which they require.  That seems to be a fairly large breach in the dyke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Senator, I can see the point he is making and I would not say there is any disagreement between us on it.  In relation to section 8 (c), in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State, it <Col N="2076" /> is not envisaged that junior clerks could ring a data controller to say that they felt they could be relieved of their obligations under the Bill and give them information on a, b and c because the matter has to do with protecting the international relations of the State.  A junior clerk can do that but if the Senator or I were data controllers I am sure we would need far more assurance before we would feel that we could be relieved of our obligations under the Bill.  We would have to satisfy ourselves that this information was being sought in the interests of protecting the international relations of the State.  Not just because it was a request from a junior clerk, the data controller would have to assure himself that the information being sought was being sought for that specific purpose.  Otherwise, he could not even consider giving it and even at that stage he would not have to give it.  We cannot stop people asking for information.  Anybody can ask for information but that does not necessarily mean that they are entitled to be given it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has explained it to a considerable extent but what about the legal responsibility on the data controller?  Would a data controller be liable to prosecution if he simply took an application for information on a, b or c at face value?  Would there be a legal obligation on a data controller to satisfy himself, as distinct from the fact that he can, if he wishes, satisfy himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  The data controller must satisfy himself that the information being sought will be used for the specific purpose for which it is being sought.  Only then can he consider giving the information, but even then he does not have to do so.  He has to be satisfied and clear in his own mind that he would be free of any obligations under the Bill, as regards the restrictions in the Bill.</P>

The data controller might operate on one basis, but he might end up in court and discover that his interpretation was unfair.

I was proposing to amend the Bill to read: &ldquo;the main purposes for which the data are upheld&rdquo; and to delete the description.  The reason for this is that I had been approached by a number of people involved in medical research who were afraid that, if the title as it now stands were allowed to remain, it would mean that every piece of data would have to be described by them which would be laborious and extensive.  I gather that under the regulations this problem will be addressed and the fears of these people are not as they perceive them to be.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position.</P>

      <P>I readily understand that Senator Manning is anxious about the requirement in section 3 that the data controller should give an inquirer a description of the data that would not involve him in giving a very detailed account.  Obviously, he is particularly concerned about health data. I can give that assurance categorically to Senator Manning.  Any holder of health <Col N="2079" /> data must register and the registration regulations will prescribe the way in which the data are to be described in the registered entry.  It is envisaged that only a general description &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;&mdash; will be required for the register and the same will apply to information given under section 3.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nuala Fennell mentioned the experience of her son in Australia recently.  This underlines the point that where no smoking restrictions are applied such as on the DART train service, the desired results are achieved.  I appreciate her support for the Bill.  However, I would like to take issue with her in relation to her remarks about the work of the health promotion unit in the Department of Health.  The Senator <Col N="2080" /> referred to the unit's lack of visibility.  In fact, the unit has been very active since its establishment.  In the short period since it was set up, it has been responsible for a number of major initiatives in the areas of cigarettes, AIDS, cancer, drugs and food hygiene.  All of these campaigns received extensive coverage in the press and on television.  I am surprised that the Senator was not aware of these initiatives. Besides the high profile activities, the unit has put in place much of the foundation work for the effective long term health promotion strategy acting in concert with the various health agencies and professional associations, the educational authorities, industry and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>The need for a new and more effective inter-sectional approach to the promotion of health has long been accepted. The new structure which has been in place since January and is now fully operational comprises, in addition to the health promotion unit in the Department of Health, an advisory council on health promotion and a committee of Ministers. The health promotion unit, in addition to taking on all of those activities formerly conducted by the Health Education Bureau, is also responsible for developing a wider policy on health promotion.</P>
    <P>The advisory council is a broadly based group representing some of the main economic and social interests whose activities impact on health.  It is chaired by Professor Ivor Drury, president of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland. The council's remit is to recommend to the Minister for Health changes in public policy which it considers would impact positively on the health of the community. The council has been meeting on a regular basis and among its current concerns are the policy issues associated with tobacco, alcohol, nutrition, accident prevention and exercise.</P>
    <P>The committee of Ministers forms the third level in the structure and ensures that there is a forum at the highest level at which the inter-sectional issues and, indeed, conflicts can be discussed and resolved.  The committee is chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Health, <Col N="2081" /> Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, and includes the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Education, Energy, the Environment and Labour, reflecting the collective commitment of the Government to progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, smoking will continue to be a major focus of the unit's work.  The House will be interested to know that the unit is working at present on the development of a major new campaign directed at specific target groups.  I am sure that Senators Bulbulia, Fennell, Murphy and Manning who highlighted the importance of educating and informing the public about the dangers of tobacco consumption will be pleased to hear this.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell also mentioned in relation to section 6 of the Bill that I will be cutting off an important source of therapy for persons who wish to give up smoking by banning chewing tobacco.  I think she may be referring here to a medical product, nicotine chewing gum, sold on prescription through pharmacies.  If so, I wish to confirm that this product will not be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the use of role models such as sports persons in the fight against tobacco consumption, the current tobacco legislation is such that it prevents the use of role models in the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products.  The use of role models has been successful in previous campaigns and the health promotion unit will be considering all possible approaches such as the use of role models in the forthcoming anti-smoking campaign.</P>
    <P>With regard to smoking in schools, under section 2 (2) (c) the Minister may make regulations to ban or restrict smoking in any part of a school.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Murphy and Fennell that teachers should give good example and encourage pupils not to smoke.  Every effort will be made in the regulations to achieve the objective of section 2 (2) (c).  From my experience at school, which goes back some time, I know that teachers regarded smoking as an objectionable habit.  To the best of my <Col N="2082" /> recollection teachers always smoked in private.  In my view a ban on smoking should be introduced in schools as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senators Cullimore, Brendan Ryan, Doyle and Ross mentioned the difficulties of enforcing section 3 which relates to vending machines.  As the Minister said in the course of his opening address, the section is drafted to ensure that vending machines are properly supervised in relation to the sale of cigarettes to young persons.  When drafting the Bill there were three options open to the Minister.  The first option was not to do anything and the second was to ban the use of vending machines altogether. The third option was to provide for the proper supervision of the machines. Having weighed up all the options, we felt it appropriate to go for the supervision of the machines by the owner or the person in charge and place this responsibility firmly with the owner or person in charge.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy made a number of interesting points and I should like to reply to some of them.  He said that section 2 was vague.  As I said at the outset, the discretionary powers in section 2 will enable the Minister to either restrict or prohibit smoking, depending on the nature of the areas concerned and the length of time people spend in those areas.  The Bill enables a Minister to do certain things and, when enacted, will provide a comprehensive and appropriate framework to take the action necessary based on public health considerations. I can assure the House that the regulations will be based on those considerations.  The Bill, as drafted, gives the Minister of the day the power to take whatever action is appropriate in line with the medical evidence pertaining at the time, evidence which is evolving all the time and is pointing to the increasing and serious consequences of passive smoking.</P>
    <P>The other major point made by Senator Murphy related to enforcement. The Bill contains adequate enforcement provisions but, perhaps, we should look at the thrust of the Bill from another <Col N="2083" /> perspective.  By prohibiting or restricting smoking in public places, as appropriate, an environment will be created which will be hostile to smoking and conducive to the health of the non-smoker and smoker alike.  There is evidence that this type of approach works.  I have quoted the example of the DART and Dublin Bus, and Senator Fennell mentioned the position in Australia.  However, the Bill firmly places a responsibility on the owner of the premises or facility in question to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the law is complied with. I will be discussing this matter with the interested parties when preparing the regulations, but I will be imposing those responsibilities on those who own facilities. This can be done by whatever means are considered appropriate in the facility in question.  In this context the simple &ldquo;no-smoking&rdquo; signs work in those facilities in which smoking is currently banned or restricted.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna referred to the problem of children who were sent to buy groceries and cigarettes.  Many Senators referred to the need for role models and I put it to the House that parents should act as role models for their children and not ask them to buy cigarettes for them. That might be the simplistic approach to adopt but there is a limit to which the State can intervene in what goes on between parents and children.  The Bill sets the right balance in this area.  In section 3 any person who as a shopkeeper sells cigarettes to a person under 16 years of age under any premise will be subject to a fine of up to £500.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia mentioned the desirability of a collaborative approach between the statutory and non-statutory agencies in the fight against cancer and tobacco consumption.  There is, in fact, continuous contact between the Department and the relevant agencies in this area.  For instance, in the recent past this collaborative approach was evidenced on Ash Wednesday when a National No Smoking Day was held.  On advertising and sponsorship, the Department's legislation is amongst the most restrictive in <Col N="2084" /> Europe.  Since 1986 expenditure on tobacco sponsorship has been frozen at its 1985 level and cannot be increased. Sporting events which were not previously sponsored by tobacco companies cannot now be sponsored.  However, as Senator Bulbulia said, I recognise that there is a problem with over-spill tobacco advertising and sponsorship from other countries.  I am glad to say that that is being addressed on an international basis through the EC's &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer Programme&rdquo;.  This is the only way to bring appropriate control over the over-spill of tobacco advertising and sponsorship from countries abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris's essential point related to the individual's right to choose where to smoke.  The Senator did not balance that right with the right of the majority non-smoking adult population to clear air.  I do not accept the Senator's view that the Irish people ignore guidance and facilities which are designed to safeguard their health and safety.  Indeed, those who had an opportunity of watching the recent UTV programme, &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; will be concerned about the effects of cigarette smoking which were clearly demonstrated.  Let us take the case of wearing seat belts as an example.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take an abstract or philosophical approach to this but the facts are that Irish smokers and nonsmokers alike support a ban on smoking in public places.  I set out the level of this support in detail in my opening address but I should like to quote once again the success of DART and Dublin bus in creating and maintaining a smoke-free environment.  In this regard we all have a responsibility to consider our private bans in our cars.  In America many people are imposing a smoking ban in their homes, even for visitors.  That may sound restrictive in the Irish sense &mdash; it is one I could not adhere to at this stage &mdash; but it is an indication of the deep concern people have about the ill-effects of direct smoking and passive smoking.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work being done by the management of the DART and Dublin Bus in promoting and maintaining a smoke-free environment.  I should like <Col N="2085" /> to confirm to Senator Ferris that all forms of chewing tobacco will be prohibited under section 6.  I have given the reasons for that.  Piped tobacco will not be affected by the Bill.  Senator Norris referred colourfully to the tradition of chewing tobacco in Ireland.  The chewing of tobacco is regrettably not as harmless as Senator Norris makes out.  There is now available a wide range of chewing tobacco aimed at young people as a safe alternative to cigarettes.  The use of chewing tobacco has become increasingly popular with young people internationally and it is now estimated by the World Health Organisation that almost 10 million people, mostly young people, are chewing tobacco products in the USA.  If I were to exclude chewing tobacco from the scope of the Bill there is no doubt that the international manufacturers would exploit the loophole in the legislation.  It is incumbent, therefore, on the Minister, and legislators, to achieve the objectives set out in the Bill. To put legislation on the Statute Book which is defective would be wrong.</P>
    <P>Despite what James Joyce described as being a common practice in Dublin many years ago the chewing of tobacco in Ireland is now very much a declining practice among older people.  There is now only one brand of domestically produced chewing tobacco and consumption of that product has decreased by 30 per cent in the last six years.  It represents only 3 per cent of all hard-pressed tobacco manufactured by the company in question.  Nevertheless, the issue here is that internationally chewing tobaccos are being developed once again to replace a decline in cigarette consumption.  Those products are being formulated, packaged and marketed in such a way as to appeal to young people.  It is this development which the Government aim to counter and the balance, in my consideration of the provisions of section 6, therefore was to ensure that young people are protected from those products.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned, amongst other things, the desirability of a ban on smoking in restaurants and pubs.  Section <Col N="2086" /> 2 gives the Minister power to ban smoking in any designated facility which could be a restaurant or a pub.  Section 2 (2) specifies the place where research has shown that there is a widespread public support for a ban on smoking.  I propose to commence with those areas and progressively build up to the stage where there will be a general restriction on the majority of public places.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the important role of education in encouraging people not to start smoking or to cease the practive.  Education and information programmes on the dangers of tobacco consumption are a central part of my policy on health promotion and will continue to be so.  I agree fully that education is crucial in developing a smoke-free environment.  The Department have successfully run health education programmes during the past ten years which have resulted in a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in the population by about 10 per cent.  Education, however, has to be supplemented by environmental controls.  As I have said already, the health promotion units campaign will take account of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Senator said that prohibition or restriction is wrong and that it contravenes the rights of smokers.  I would like to point out once again that this Bill reflects wide support from smokers and non-smokers alike for legislation of this type.  I accept that there is a balance to be achieved and great care should be taken to ensure that the legislation is not draconian.  Responsibility for enforcing the legislation will essentially rest with the owner or person in charge and the regulations will be devised to take account of what is required to protect the public health.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross pointed out that the provisions of section 2 appear to be too flexible and leave the Minister and Members of the House open to pressure and lobbying. The provisions of section 2 are key elements in the development of a framework appropriate to a healthy and smoke-free environment.  Section 2 was drawn up with great care and with a view <Col N="2087" /> to giving the Minister the flexibility and discretion which he needs now and will need in the future to take whatever action is needed to protect public health in the light of the medical evidence pertaining at that time.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross and other Senators questioned whether or not the Act and the regulations can be enforced.  It is our intention to authorise officers of the health boards to enforce the regulations. I am confident that the enforcement of the regulations will be as successful as the 1986 regulations relating to the removal of external tobacco advertising.  Some Senators mentioned the possible economic consequences of tobacco legislation. The Government have considered all aspects of this issue and have decided that the public health considerations are of such magnitude that they far outweigh the marginal economic impact which a gradual reduction in tobacco consumption over a number of years will effect.  I want to make it quite clear that the health of the people of Ireland is of paramount importance.  We cannot sacrifice people's health because of the tax limits on the consumption of tobacco.</P>
    <P>By and large the tobacco industry is becoming increasingly more automated and the labour force within this industry is ageing.  As a result the industry is not a significant provider of new jobs.  The gradual reduction in tobacco consumption could be arguably coped with through the natural wastage which is occurring in the labour force of the industry. The other side of the economic equation, however, is the stark fact that 5,000 persons die each year as a direct result of tobacco consumption.  It would be remiss of the Minister for Health to delay a protective and preventative health measure which is widely demanded and favoured by smokers and non-smokers alike.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to thank all those concerned with the drafting of this Bill, the officials in the Department and previous Ministers who were involved in its preparation. I thank Senators for their constructive contributions to the Second Stage debate.  I hope that Committee <Col N="2088" /> Stage will be dispensed with as quickly as possible so that we can draft the regulations and bring this Bill into force.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 23, to delete &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;smoking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to hone in specifically on one aspect of the Bill.  It seeks to delete the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;smoking&rdquo;. The reason for this is very straightforward. It is to exclude from the Bill the whole question of chewing tobacco.  The Minister mentioned this in his Second Stage speech today.  If the Bill goes through as it stands at present it will mean that the small, dwindling section of the population, mainly elderly, will be deprived of the right to chew tobacco which, as they have seen it, has been their right over a very long period of time.  The Minister said that the consumption of traditional chewing tobacco is declining. He also mentioned that there are new derivatives of this practice which are a health hazard and which need to be legislated against.  I would be quite happy to see that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about a habit which most of us would regard as a rather filthy habit &mdash; the chewing of tobacco.  It certainly is not fashionable.  I do not know why <Col N="2089" /> anybody would start the practice.  There are a number of people, generally not well off, who regard this practice as a right and who will find, if this legislation becomes law, that they will not be able to buy such tobacco.  I do not think it is our job to try to change the law in a way which will deprive these people of what they have always regarded as a right.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.  We are talking about smoking, the health consequences of smoking and the discomfort visited upon other people by those who smoke.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the chewing of tobacco can damage the health of others.  It does not damage the atmosphere. It is not pleasant to look at a person chewing tobacco but, nonetheless, I think we are going too far in having this blanket denial of what has been a traditional right of people to exercise their choice in consuming tobacco in this way.  Heaven and earth will not fall down if the Minister accepts this amendment. If there are specific named chewing substances which are coming on the market and which are being geared at young people, the Minister will have our full support in naming these and having them outlawed.  I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in proposing this amendment.  I consider it a reasonable amendment on the basis that it differentiates between consumption and smoking.  Of course this relates to the production in this country of a chewing tobacco.  I concur with Senator Manning in his final remarks that there are certain chewing products which are imported into this country.  The Minister has the full support of all Members of this House in restricting their importation. They are undesirable and they have been proven to be damaging and addictive.  We are concerned about the limited number of people who chew tobacco.  Generally speaking, it is limited to very old people and people in geriatric hospitals in particular. It is so limited that not all <Col N="2090" /> Members of the House would have knowledge of the practice, in spite of the eloquent quotations by Senator Norris on the previous occasion, which referred to another period.</P>
      <P>There is a dwindling demand in this country for this product and there is still a demand internationally.  It is manufactured in this country and if we banish its use totally it will have employment consequences.  I do not condone this practice but I have to recognise that it happens. It does not create any problem except for the consumer.  There is no smoke emitted from it.  Originally the spittoon was provided in the old pubs and shops and indeed at a wake.  It is a practice to which we should not close our eyes.  Years ago many Irish people practised this habit with much pleasure. I think it is an awful habit.  I will not describe it because another description this morning by Senator Norris was referred to as being unparliamentary and rightly so.  We must realise that old people in particular, with very little pleasure left in life, not alone practise this habit but use snuff which can also be considered to be an unpleasant habit. Some people in geriatric hospitals have no other pleasures left in life.  Many of these people are left to pine away and die in hospital without even a relative to visit them.  Senator Manning is trying to achieve a balance here so that the Minister, in addressing this problem, will have regard to practices which are not a health hazard to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Second Stage reply the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, was specific about the inclusion of chewing tobacco in the products to be prohibited under this Bill.  I do not share his view that this practice should be totally prohibited. Some people have consumed tobacco in this way for 50, 60 or 70 years without anybody reprimanding them and if we pass legislation and make them outlaws, which they will be, I do not believe we will achieve anything.  That is not the way to legislate in a progressive society who tolerate minority groups, minority interests and minority tastes.  I do not believe there is any problem with the <Col N="2091" /> amendment, as proposed by Senator Manning, and I believe it would meet my concerns in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add the precaution that if those who now smoke should suddenly take to chewing we may very well see smoke eliminated from our hospitals and spittoons used for more than the post-operative care of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris has touched briefly on the matters I want to raise.  I want to ask the Minister whether including the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; would affect the habit of taking snuff, which was not extensively referred to on Second Stage. It represents a situation that has been covered, and there are consequences if the taking of snuff is prohibited.  It would certainly come within the margin of appreciation indicated by Senator Manning, particularly with regard to the fact that it does not really cause a danger to health to persons other than those taking the material.  This is an important consideration with regard to the personal individual liberties of people.  The Minister has introduced no medical evidence regarding the adverse consequences of taking snuff.  I wonder if it is the intention that this legislation should cover the taking of snuff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the points made by Senator Manning and Senator Ferris.  The purpose of this Bill is not only to protect the environment, the atmosphere and the consequential effects of people smoking, it also has a public health objective to discourage unhealthy practices relating to tobacco. It is not enough to say that people who chew tobacco are no danger to anybody else.  With reference to what Senator Manning said the last day, it is true we cannot legislate for virtue but we certainly have an obligation to legislate for health.  I am not convinced about this compassionate argument that old people have very few pleasures left.  Life is solitary, nasty, brutish and short, as was <Col N="2092" /> observed a long time ago, and they will after all, we are constantly assured, get their reward in the next life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the compassionate argument extends.  One might as well say that old people should be allowed to smoke in hospital &mdash; a case which has frequently been put forward &mdash; because it gives them some residual comfort.  I do not think that is acceptable either.</P>
      <P>We should be very careful about raising the employment spectre in all this because without any doubt a consequence of this legislation, if it is implemented, is that it will affect adversely employment in the tobacco industry.  We have to face up to that.  It is to be hoped that in a proper economy and a proper society people will find compensatory employment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced by this amendment. If, as a result of this legislation, tobacco smoking diminishes and the opportunities that young people have for access to tobacco consumption are limited, if this legislation is effective, then chewing tobacco may be no longer a minority taste.  There is that consideration also: there is no guarantee it will remain a minority taste.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate on this amendment and I wish to say I have a certain knowledge of chewing tobacco.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;chewing tobacco is a hill-billy practice.  It is an absolutely obnoxious exercise and many country music entertainers for whom I had a wonderful grá before I met them put me right off when in the middle of conversations they kicked out the old spittoons from under the table and interspersed their interviews with an odd spit here and there.  I am sorry for bringing this to the attention of the House in such an unhealthy way but I do not have much sympathy with people who chew tobacco. If the Bill prohibits tobacco chewing in public places I welcome it in this regard.</P>
      <P>I defer to my illustrious, intellectual colleague, Senator Murphy, in relation to his belief that there will be a decline in the tobacco industry as a result of legislation of this nature.  The Minister also referred to this in his reply on Second Stage.  Strangely enough, the tobacco industry are not crying over legislation of this nature because, surprisingly, over the last 12 months, or the period for which figures are available, the smoking of tobacco products worldwide has only decreased by 1 per cent.  The reason the tobacco industry are not wringing their hands in dismay &mdash; and I was most surprised to learn this &mdash; is that while there has been a decrease in the consumption of tobacco products in the more affluent western societies, this is now being balanced by a major marketing hype in the Third World and, consequently, overall the international figures for tobacco consumption are set to increase rather than decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on developed countries such as Ireland to introduce this type of legislation.  Smokers are being run out of our society and, despite the very serious employment implications for those who are involved in the tobacco industry, I am not sorry.  However, as Professor Murphy said, I hope they will get alternative employment.  Many of these cigarette and <Col N="2094" /> tobacco companies, for example Carrolls, are already diversifying into other areas.  One hopes that in the long term, with the shedding and natural wastage, there will not be any wholesale redundancies and that people will not lose their jobs as a result.</P>
    <P>Legislation of this nature is welcome if only that having got the tobacco companies on the run we can eliminate what is an obnoxious habit.  While I will not use the word Senator Norris used earlier and for which he was admonished by the Chair, there is an old saying that there is no worse individual of the type the Senator referred to than a reformed one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to change the tenor of the debate and to leave aside the point which was so eloquently made by Senator Murphy &mdash; and which I illustrated in my picture of the hospital bed &mdash; there is a more serious point here.  I do not know whether the Minister can answer it or whether he can compete with Senator Norris as an expert in philology.  But is he absolutely certain that the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; does include, in the legal mind, smoking?  I am sure lawyers might try to draw a distinction between the ingestion &mdash; which would be my idea of consumption &mdash; and the practice of smoking. One could argue that it would be possible to smoke without inhaling; it might be impossible without absorbing.  I question whether the point of the amendment should not be that &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; is a preferable word to &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; in that <Col N="2095" /> it does cover the most important aspect of the whole exercise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my colleagues mentioned the question of employment; I think it was Senator Murphy.  This is the greatest red herring of all.  If the western world were to succeed in abolishing the consumption of cocaine large numbers of people in Columbia and South America would suffer considerable impoverishment, but that is no argument for being soft on cocaine.  The truth is that tobacco will do far more damage to people in our society, indeed in western society generally, that cocaine is likely to do in the immediate future.  We are concerned that people should have jobs but it is a matter of providing alternative jobs, not in any way sustaining existing jobs.  As far as I am concerned it would be quite acceptable if we succeeded in closing down immediately every tobacco factory in the entire world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the issue of employment.  If one takes the Minister's own statistics seriously &mdash; and I take them very seriously indeed &mdash; one sees that the principal impact on employment will be in the undertaking rather than in the tobacco industry because the rate of deaths caused directly and clearly attributable to the ingestion, to use a neutral term, of tobacco is increasing constantly.  The figures are very clear and precise on this.  I suggest its impact will be on the undertaking industry, one which very few citizens would be sorry to see in some decline.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, we are discussing amendments Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 31 together.  I do not propose to accept any of these amendments. Section 2 of the Bill is designed to protect public health and to create an overall environment which is conducive to reducing the consumption of tobacco products.  The effect of the provision is to encourage exemplary behaviour on the part of our young people and to reflect <Col N="2096" /> the majority social behaviour of the adult population while simultaneously protecting their health.  A few of these objectives and provisions have been drafted to prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in all of its forms.  The provisions of this section will restrict the consumption of cigarettes, cigars, cigarellas, pipes and even nasal snuff.  In this regard I must say that snuff, as such will not be banned but will be banned in areas where smoking is restricted.  The sale of snuff will not be restricted.  Because of the difficulty of enforcement which would arise and the need to ensure that tobacco is not consumed in any form in a designated area or facility, I cannot accept this amendment.  While I can see the purpose of Senator Manning's amendment in terms of simply controlling tobacco I contend that the term &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; will lead to greater ease of enforcement of the provisions.  I should like to have heard Senator Robb expound somewhat on what are the medical findings.  I will be dealing in greater detail with the medical aspects on amendments Nos. 28 and 29. The chewing of tobacco is dangerous to health and leads to cancer of the mouth, dental problems and a number of other symptoms.</P>

    <P>I sympathise with the minority who may chew tobacco but, unfortunately, we have to protect young people.  In the United States there is a growth in the practice of chewing tobacco.  Senator Mooney mentioned his experiences there, where companies are now diversifying their production from smoking to chewing tobacco.  We want to ensure that we will not be flooded with chewing tobaccos, that young people will not get hooked on to this type of practice, while sympathising with those tobacco chewers who will be affected.  My experience has been that very few people nowadays chew tobacco.  I have visited quite a number of institutions, homes for the elderly and so on.  Yet I cannot recall one person who actually chews tobacco. Certainly that would be very unacceptable behaviour in a welfare home, hospital or any other institution.  What <Col N="2097" /> Senator Robb said about that is also important.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned the question of jobs.  We cannot sustain jobs producing a product that is damaging the health of our people; that is unacceptable economics.  The provisions of this Bill will have an effect.  However, only 3 per cent of the tobacco factories involved produce this type of product.  I will have to check but I doubt if we are banning the production of this product.  There is a question mark over that.  At this stage we are banning its use and will not accept amendments because we feel strongly about this and are adhering to the provision as drafted.</P>
    <P>I might refer to other points made by Senator Manning.  The sale of nasal snuff will not be prohibited under the provisions of section 6.  However, the &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; of snuff, chewing tobacco and all smoking will be controlled in public places in which tobacco consumption is controlled under the provisions of the Bill.  I share the distaste of Senators Murphy and Mooney at the consumption of tobacco in enclosed public areas.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, the need for exemplary behaviour is an important objective of the Bill.  We want to set our young people a good example and work toward a tobacco-free society.  In those circumstances I must adhere to the terms of the Bill.  I will be dealing in more detail with the health aspects on amendments Nos. 28 and 29.</P>

      <P>I am very surprised that snuff comes within the ambit of this legislation, because, as far as I was aware, that was not the case.  I suggest that it is making an ass of the law if you are going to prohibit in public places a habit that is (a) enjoyable, (b) harmless to the person that indulges in it and (c) harmless to those around them.  I have to make a strong plea for snuff because my husband uses snuff, my children use snuff and, as far as I know, it is absolutely harmless. It is ridiculous to restrict or prohibit a harmless habit like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney suggested that chewing tobacco and spitting was an obnoxious <Col N="2098" /> habit that should be prohibited under the provisions of this Bill.  I know of a lot of obnoxious habits in which people engage but I would not suggest that they should be included in legislation as a handy way to eliminate them.  Before this debate I would have said: yes, let us ban everything that could be harmful to people, but the case, as made by Senator Manning, is persuasive.  Why are we banning a practice that does not present a problem?  I suggest that we should not ban the chewing of tobacco at this point because that will only divert it into the blackmarket.  I contend that people who enjoy chewing tobacco should not be penalised in this way.  As has been said, it is not harmful to people around and it gives a measure of enjoyment to those who use it.  I support Senator Manning's amendment and I appeal to the Minister not to put snuff in the same category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without elaborating on this amendment, I am most reluctant to disagree with my friend across the way in relation to the obnoxious habit aspect but I must take issue on two points.  The first is the contention that chewing tobacco does not harm anybody else.  In order to chew tobacco properly you have to spit and if you spit, first, you are creating a public nuisance and, second, you are creating a health hazard.  Allied to those, spitting in public is an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting into the prissy stages now.  This is a good Bill. Members in both Houses want to see it on the Statute books.  At a certain stage this good Bill becomes a busybody Bill and that is what I am objecting to here. There is an important principle in all of this.  There are frontiers to what the State should do in the interests of health and virtue.  At its most simple, we are saying to a man who is probably in his late seventies or eighties, who perhaps fought in the War of Independence, defended his State during the emergency, who has been a law-abiding citizen all his life, probably even votes Fianna Fáil, that he is now breaking the law if he chews a little <Col N="2099" /> tobacco, whether he uses the spittoon or not.</P>
      <P>What sort of country is this?  Are the gardaí going to be out in counties Roscommon, Carlow, Leitrim or Kerry taking to these people, taking their notebooks out, cautioning them, telling them that they may well find themselves charged with a breach of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Bill, 1988, because they do something which they have been doing for the last 50 or 60 years?  The habit is dying out.  The production of this tobacco is a very small part of the overall production of tobacco in this country.  If there are new-fangled substances which are being marketed in a way designed to lure young people, then by all means name and outlaw them. But why are we moving in here to outlaw a habit which is doing harm only to the person who willingly pursues it?  In spite of of what Senator Mooney says, it is doing no harm to anybody else.  We are now talking about taking away one of the few small pleasures an old man has in the twilight of his days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sincere and I am right in what I am saying.  There is a new book, which is more than most people know, setting limits to the extent the State should intervene.  Senator Murphy has been a great defender in the past of the rights of minorities against busybody civil servants and a busybody State.  I take this amendment seriously.  I want to see that right &mdash; and it is an important right &mdash; defended and preserved.  I would ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is put forward.  I am quite certain that if there was a free vote in this House there would be a majority in favour of this amendment.  If the Minister talked to half a dozen people in his own constituency, he would find that they would all favour this amendment.</P>

The Minister said very coolly and calmly that he was not going to accept amendments Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 31.  We are set now for some few hours debate, I expect, on this Tobacco Bill.  I would like to know if the force of argument, if the force of reason, if the conviction of Senators will convince the Minister to take any amendments at all on board, or are we engaged in an exercise which is purely one of verbal gymnastics and the putting forward of point and counterpoint? If the arguments are good, if Senators in the main agree, are we going to succeed in having any amendments taken on this Bill?  I would like the Minister to clarify the position at this point in the debate.</P>

      <P>That is the most relevant question that has been put.  If the answer is in the negative just because the other House is in recess, then perhaps we should go into recess and go home.  I think the Minister will find that this House, above anything else, when it has legislation before it wants to improve it, whether by amendment or debate, constructive and otherwise, and that the most important thing for all of us is that any legislation that is passed through this House would be operable and enforceable. One could say that this is a great House for sussing things out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has now shown up an anomaly.  As Senator Fennell has rightly said, the Minister has now confirmed that even snuffing is excluded from the public places designated.  That is all that we are worried about.  The next section will deal with the areas that the Minister will have the right to designate. <Col N="2101" /> I am prepared to sit here all day and all night to get the legislation right.  Could we just for a moment as serious legislators &mdash; which we are in this House &mdash; address the problem that Senator Robb has raised about consumption, inhalation, ingestion, swallowing, chewing or whatever?  What terminology will have a legal and binding effect?</P>
      <P>If we consume something, we expect that it is will be ingested and through the whole digestive process will be assimilated and excreted.  Tobacco inhalation is exhaled, to the detriment of all the people around, which is what Senator Mooney and other Senators are worried about, whether into a spittoon, or into the environment, or otherwise.  I am particularly concerned about old people in geriatric and psychiatric hospitals.  I made this point on the Second Stage but it was not referred to by the Minister. The Minister would have the power to designate hospitals and most people would agree that in an acute hospital there should be a ban on smoking.</P>
      <P>Let us consider psychiatric hospitals. Anybody that knows anything about them, or has visited them professionally, or representing health boards, health authorities, or whatever, will know that agents of the State distribute daily quotas of smoking, snuffing and chewing tobaccos to people with psychiatric problems which, if prohibited will have to be replaced by drugs which could be addictive and create many more problems than ever have been attributed to tobacco.  Members of this House should address themselves to the fact that this does happen.  They can check on the budgeting of any health board.  A certain percentage of pensions goes towards the purchase of tobacco for old age pensioners in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that we are trying to make sure is that whatever legislation passes this House will be operative, will be enforceable and will not be seen afterwards to be an ass which it will be if it goes against normal habits.  You can preach piously for ever about whether it is nice or not nice, whether it is fashionable, or <Col N="2102" /> whether it is unpleasant to us as individuals or otherwise.  That is what is happening. How can we stop it by legislation without having a jackboot regime that will enforce the law in hospitals, psychiatric and geriatric, and all sorts of other places which the public frequent?</P>
    <P>All that Senator Manning is trying to do is to make the legislation operable. He has defended the Minister's Bill in the overall context of what it wants to do.  We want to try to improve it and make it workable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach is going back to the very early days. I am not sure what Senator Murphy means by it &ldquo;suiting&rdquo; me.  I listened to the debate here with increasing amazement. If people discovered a therapeutic drug which, on the one hand, conferred considerable benefits on people and made them better but had the adverse effect that tobacco has on so many people who consume it, the drug would not be allowed to go on sale.  There is evidence of a drug that was banned from circulation last year, even though it had a considerable beneficial effect on people who suffer from arthritis.  Because there was evidence that in a limited number of cases, it had very severe side effects, that drug was withdrawn from circulation, notwithstanding the benefits it conferred on some people.  This is a similar case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that some people enjoy chewing tobacco does not get away from the fact that it is harmful and damaging to people's health.  Sooner or later, we will have to take action to try to stop it.  We are not just talking about one generation of old people at present.  Somebody suggested that perhaps we should wait five years before this is implemented but the point is you cannot go on forever encouraging and supporting people in doing things that are injurious to their health. The medical evidence shows that chewing tobacco damages people's health.  It is like any other drug.  Unless there are overwhelming reasons for using it, if it has such an abundance of side effects which are harmful to people's health, the casual pleasure it gives to some people is <Col N="2103" /> not proportionate to the damage it can do and, therefore, it should be prohibited. That is why I would not dream of supporting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning spoke with unusual passion on a matter that some people might assume to be trivial. I do not necessarily think that it is and, even if it was, he is perfectly entitled to speak with that degree of commitment and passion on it.  I hope that this will be followed up and that if he takes it seriously he will call for a vote.  I note, with considerable seriousness, what Senator Bulbulia said and it is something about which I have had a brief discussion with her because it is open gossip around the corridors of this House that the Government have decided that no amendments will be taken before the end of this session.  If this is the case and if what the Minister says confirms it, then it appears that the relevance of this House is about the same as the hind tit of a jackass.  The sooner we establish whether this is the case, the better.</P>
      <P>I most certainly will be calling for a vote on my amendments because I take very seriously the noble sounding words of the Minister in his various pronouncements on this issue when he made it perfectly clear that we are talking about saving human life.  I do not think that the recall of the Dáil &mdash; which seems to be the principal stumbling block to the acceptance of any amendments &mdash; the inconvenience that this might cause to some holidaying members of the Lower House, is sufficient reason for taking measures which may save people's lives. I invite Senator Manning to call for a vote on the amendment about which he feels so passionately.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris asked us to be realistic about old people in hospital but is it realistic to think that you can somehow provide tobacco for a section of the population while restricting its use elsewhere?  That is totally unrealistic. Of course, there will not be armies of jack-booted, law enforcers going <Col N="2104" /> around the geriatric wards but, sooner or later, whatever noxious habits are tolerated or permitted on compassionate grounds will be phased out anyway.  I do not see how you can exempt a generation or a particular section of a generation from the law generally.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning seems to be giving the impression that if there was a free vote, as he puts it, his impassioned plea would be welcomed by all sides, I oppose the amendment notwithstanding his impassioned, very genuine and sincere contribution.  I do not wish in any way to diminish what he said but I have to go along again with what was said on the Independent benches by some of the Members.  It is all very well to talk about depriving elderly people of pleasure &mdash; and I do not wish to be seen to be an old grouch or scrooge in that respect &mdash; but a start has to be made somewhere and in the context of this legislation the start is now being made.</P>
      <P>If I were unfortunate enough to be in a public health hospital or geriatric ward of a public health hospital, because that is really where the legislation is directed at rather than at private medicine, I am sure that if the nursing staff were to come to me &mdash; if I was a heavy smoker or snuff taker or if I chewed tobacco &mdash; and said that the law of the land now was that I could not do so in public, it is possible that there might be some way around it if it would cause me great physical or mental distress.  However, we must legislate for the common good and in that context I am against the amendment. Secondly, in these situations, one always tends to think of the victims of the effects of legislation &mdash; those who chew tobacco, those who smoke, and those who are snuff takers &mdash; but in the public area, as a non-smoker I resent having smoke blown in my face.  I resent having to sit in a restaurant, a cinema, a railway station or a public institution and to absorb smoke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The finger of suspicion seems to be pointed at me.  I am endeavouring to be helpful here.  In general terms we have all agreed that this is an unacceptable social habit and there is no doubting the feelings of Senator Manning on the issue.  The terms of the argument put forward do not lead logically to his amendment.  Senator Manning made the point that smoking is a pleasure but none of our pleasures is left unrestricted.  There are restrictions on all the pleasures that are left to us no matter what age we happen to be &mdash; 73, 20 or 40, younger or older.  We were just discussing the fact that there are such restrictions on us at all levels.  However, if we are talking here about something which will hit, affect and restrict old people to a certain extent, it seems that the logical amendment &mdash; as was done with great wisdom in the Fisheries Bill &mdash; would be that people over a certain age be exempted from the requirements of the legislation.  Perhaps Senator Manning would put down an amendment of this nature on Report Stage to exempt people over 70 years of age from the requirements of the Bill.  I would welcome Senator Manning's view on that point.  It does not cut any ice to say that because it restricts 70 year olds plus we should now make it available to people of 10 years plus.  There is no logic there.  The logic of the argument is to exempt the people he is worried about.  I would like to hear the views of the proposer on that issue.</P>

      <P>I find it a fitting and simple description of the Senator's status. He is the junior Senator from Trinity in that he is the most junior member of the House of an official constituency.  If offence is taken it certainly was not intended.</P>
      <P>A number of important points remain to be made on the issue before us.  First, is it intended to prohibit the production of this substance in this country?  Can we have a clear statement on that?  Secondly, on the question of snuff &mdash; in spite of what Senator Mooney said about the discomfort caused by people taking snuff &mdash; I think it is unrealistic that the taking of snuff in public places be prohibited from this point on?  Thirdly, would the Minister answer the question raised by Senator O'Toole and Senator Bulbulia as to his intentions on the Bill generally?</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the very helpful and as usual positive suggestions made by Senator O'Toole &mdash; and he is unfailingly helpful in his efforts to expedite the business of the House &mdash; I would find it difficult to accept a provision for an age limit.  Such a provision would result in people going around with a snuff box in one hand and a birth certificate in the other.  I do not want to hold this legislation up.  There is an important principle and point here and I would like the Minister to answer the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendments, and I want to make it quite clear that I am under no obligation not to accept amendments, if amendments come forward that we can incorporate in this Bill they will be taken on board.  I <Col N="2107" /> am impatient to bring this Bill out of this House as quickly as possible, have it signed by the President, bring it into law and have the regulations drafted during the summer.  I confess to that impatience because I believe the Bill is very important. Senators are well aware of the difficulty of making amendments at this stage but if I feel I should accept amendments I would have no hesitation in doing so and let the Bill go on to the autumn session if necessary.  However, it would be beneficial to have this Bill passed as quickly as possible.  I accept the point made by Senators Bulbulia, Manning, Norris and others that the fact of the Lower House not being in session at present leads to problems.  At this stage we have not come across any amendment that we find acceptable &mdash; I am referring to amendments Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 31.  &mdash; that is why we are opposing them and we will vote them down if the Senators so desire.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify another point.  The manufacture of chewing tobacco will be banned.  Under EC regulations we are required to prohibit the manufacture of all forms of oral smokeless tobacco, including chewing tobacco.  That is quite clear in section 6 (1) of the Bill.  We do not want such product consumed here or anywhere else.  We do not want to contribute to the damaging effect chewing tobacco has on the health of our population and on the health of the population abroad.</P>
      <P>The use of snuff is not being banned but it will be controlled.  It can be used, for example, in enclosed public places which will be specified in the regulations. As Senator Mooney has said spitting is equally a problem in enclosed areas and so is the effect of taking tobacco which I understand causes sneezing and has a damaging health effect, too.  We do not find that practice acceptable.  If people wish to use snuff they can use it in open spaces or in their own private domain but under this legislation it will be banned &mdash; as well as smoking and chewing tobacco &mdash; in certain places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to chewing tobacco for the <Col N="2108" /> elderly and for those in welfare homes, in psychiatric hospitals and so on, I am very sympathetic.  I have not come across this habit even though I move around in the constituencies and visit welfare homes and so on.  It may be that it is not allowed in the places I visit.  Nevertheless, I am aware that people chew ordinary tobacco &mdash; that is plug pipe tobacco &mdash; and that is not being banned. The new chewing tobacco products which are coming into use and which were not available heretofore are becoming more attractive.  We are banning the production and sale of those products. Patients in welfare homes, psychiatric homes and anywhere else, are used to chewing plug pipe tobacco.  They do not as a rule purchase specially manufactured chewing tobacco products.  The regualtions to be drafted under section 2 (2) of the Bill will give the Minister power to designate certain areas within health premises as smoking areas.</P>
    <P>When we are drafting the regulations we will sympathetically bear in mind the points made by Senators in relation to chewing tobacco in welfare homes, psychiatric hospitals and so on.  Where elderly people chew pipe tobacco we will bear in mind the points made by Senators and we will be conscious of the tradition of elderly people in this regard.  Basically, we are trying to ensure that young people do not become hooked on this health hazard of chewing tobacco, smoking cigarettes and other such products.  We want to avoid that and we are avoiding it by banning it.  That is specified in this Bill.  I will be dealing with this issue in greater detail on amendments Nos. 28 and 29.</P>
    <P>In summary, I want to say that this legislation is vitally important.  Senators should not feel that we are trying to force this Bill without amendments.  If this Bill is proved by Senators to be defective in some way we will have to take that on board and bring the Bill back to the Dáil in the next session.  We are not under any instructions to get this Bill through here without amendments, but the Minister and I are anxious to get this Bill through before the summer recess in the Seanad, draft the regulations during the summer <Col N="2109" /> months and bring the legislation into operation as quickly as possible.  This is a serious matter.  The health of the population is involved and I feel it would be preferable to have the legislation in operation without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a considerable part of the way.  If, when the regulations are being drawn up, we could have an assurance that the provisions he has mentioned as likely to be considered will be considered, and if there could be some provision in the regulations which would allow the traditional chewing tobaccos to remain on sale, that would meet my major objections.  The suggestion about snuff is clearly silly and inoperable and probably can never be enforced in practice anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned that a Bill is brought in here at this stage in the parliamentary session and we are told that either we accept it and allow important reforming legislation to go on the Statute Book &mdash; the impact of this Bill is 95 per cent plus or good or we vote in some amendments which means it will not become law for another two or three months.  That is a bad way to do business. We are to a certain extent faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> here today.  Either we accept what the Minister says or we run the risk of the obloquy of holding up important legislation.  The regulations will come to this House in the fullness of time &mdash; is that not correct?  The regulations must be approved by this House. We saw last week that the regulations on the granting of licences to restaurants were plain daft and silly.  This House, unlike the other House, did something to expose the general restrictive nature of those regulations and of the capitulation to one lobby.  We could come back and find regulations which do not meet the concern expressed in this House here today and that we have taken on faith something which is not going to appear. Therefore, if I can have an assurance that the regulations will make an attempt to embody the bona fide concerns expressed here today, I will be happy to withdraw <Col N="2110" /> the amendment.  Otherwise, I certainly will press it to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The first response to Senator Manning was about the prohibition on the manufacture of chewing tobacco and the Minister confirmed that in section 6 the manufacture will be outlawed in this country.  Whether we like it or not, whether we think it moral or immoral, economically viable or otherwise, the manufacture of chewing tobacco is going on here.  I understand that in the other House the Minister gave a commitment that he would have consultation and a process of dialogue with the company concerned.  You cannot suddenly close down a factory because all people who have a concern in the matter in question consider it appropriate to legislate.  You cannot do that without the efforts of the company to rationalise and go into other areas of production which, as I said on Second Stage, the tobacco companies are doing.  Because of the serious implications involved in this case, I hope there will be a process of dialogue. I will not say I am condoning the manufacture of chewing tobacco but the legislation will create a problem from an employment point of view and so on.</P>
      <P>We are at a complete loss to know what the Minister is at.  He does not even meet Senator Mooney's reservations now.  He suggests that he will allow people to chew pipe tobacco but that he will not allow people to chew chewing tobacco.  Who is to know what a person is chewing, whether it is chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco?  It would be impossible to devise regulations that would allow for differentiating between chewing a jot of pipe tobacco and chewing a jot of chewing tobacco?</P>

      <P>Either it is wrong to chew tobacco in any place designated or it is not wrong.  Changing the quality of the tobacco does not meet the Minister's whole concern in this area.  If you are serious about it you will ban all chewing <Col N="2111" /> tobacco, pipe tobacco and everything else, in all places designated and you will ban all snuff and all smoking tobacco.  If that is what the Minister wants to do let him be honest and up front with everybody and tell them this is what this Bill is doing.  Then at least we will have some credibility.  You cannot now tell a person he can buy a jot of tobacco which is legal to manufacture, that he can chew it and spit it out but that he must not chew chewing tobacco which is illegal to manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us talk facts up front.  What is the Minister talking about in this area?  Is he talking about all tobacco products for chewing?  The consumption is the concept of the amendments, and the Minister has not addressed himself to the question raised by Senator Robb about chewing, consumption, smoking, inhalation and otherwise.  Somebody might bring a case to court where questions would be asked about whether people were consuming or smoking tobacco, smoking chewing tobacco, smoking smoking tobacco or chewing smoking tobacco.  Now it is highly technical.  Fair dues to this House, even by way of amendment it has at least sussed out some of the problems in this area.  From our knowledge of what happened in the other House, nobody was aware, first, that snuff was included or that deliberately the manufacture of the product for export would be forbidden. Let me repeat what I, Senator Manning and others have said, that we have defended the ban on the importation of special products which were coming in and which the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Barry Desmond, also forbade to be inported, by way of Ministerial order. That was defended by everybody because it was recognised that a particular product which we identified and named on Second Stage was undesirable, but that ban did not refer to what was manufactured here in the way of chewing tobacco.  Now at least we know the Minister is going to ban the total production of chewing tobacco, but I am worried that he is going to allow people to chew pipe tobacco in certain designated areas. <Col N="2112" /> In my humble opinion there is an incompatability about what we are trying to do because people will be still spitting it out and will be offending all sorts of people on both sides of the House if they do that. This provision seems to be incompatible with what the Minister is trying to do here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very shocked if I thought Senator Ferris was suggesting that it should be possible to manufacture under licence products that were regarded as noxious for our domestic consumption and allowed them to be exported to other jurisdictions.  I believe as a matter of principle that this would be utterly wrong.  Certainly I will support the Minister if he is taking a principled stand on the basis that what is not good enough for the Irish people is not good enough for the Irish people to foist upon other peoples around the world.  I reiterate a point I made previously when discussing this kind of legislation, that I hope sincerely that the Government will stick to this principle when it comes to the manufacture of mercury soap.</P>

      <P>As a relatively new Member I have been hearing comments on legislation on occasions in this House which may not meet with a particular point of view, such as, &ldquo;Ah, Minister, sure it is not enforceable, the law in an ass, this is daft&rdquo;.  I am beginning to wonder if there is not a very serious implication in many of the attitudes portrayed in this House.  As I said and as I think is agreed on all sides of the House, this legislation is a beginning.  It has been initiated by this Government but it was planned by previous administrations, and efforts were made by the last administration, as Senator Ferris has said correctly, to curtail this activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation was initiated and it is being put through as a direct result of a growing public objection to what is increasingly seen to be anti-social behaviour. I wish we could say the same about the abuse of alcohol.  Unfortunately, we have not reached that stage yet, but we seem to be close to reaching a stage where <Col N="2113" /> the consumption of tobacco products of whatever ilk, is being increasingly seen by the vast majority of the population, if statistics are to be believed, as being anti-social.</P>
    <P>While I fully accept the bona fides of what my colleagues on the other side of the House have been saying in relation to the specifics &mdash; and I will be awaiting the Minister's reply to the questions raised by Senator Manning and Senator Ferris &mdash; once this legislation is in place, it will be a very brave person, man or woman, who will attempt to go into any public area and consume tobacco products, whether the law specifically states that they should, can or will in a specific instance.  I believe there is a very strong moral force behind this legislation because many people are interested in it. There is widespread public acceptance of the principles behind the legislation, despite the difficulties which seem to have arisen here on this section, and once the legislation is in place, it will be operable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily &mdash; I have been accused of saying that every time I stand up and might as well reinforce the stereotype at least &mdash; but I think we are seeing problems that do not exist at this stage. Section 6 defines what is being banned for import, manufacture, sale or otherwise, as an oral smokeless tobacco product, which is a product or substance made wholly or partly from tobacco intended for use only by being placed in the mouth and kept there for a period or being placed in the mouth and sucked or chewed.  If a manufacturer attempts to market a product which is unsuitable for smoking then the market will not buy it and it will go off the market.  On the other hand, if people who want to chew tobacco choose tobacco which is manufactured for smoking, then there is nothing in this legislation to prohibit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to be totally draconian, he could have banned all tobacco on the grounds that people could chew some kinds but he chose not to do that.  I am coming to the conclusion that <Col N="2114" /> the whole thing should be made illegal anyway.  There is no logic in not making tobacco illegal.  It is probably the most socially damaging and health damaging and offensive drug in widespread consumption. The logic of other people's use escapes me although I do not dispute their sincerity and goodwill.  Nevertheless, if some other drug, like cocaine, was in widespread consumption and then we discovered how damaging it was, would we have similar arguments about the need to be careful, sensitive and concerned? We would not.  We would say it is appalling and should be stopped.  It is a bit like saying that where people have been drinking and driving for 20 years, we should have a transition period during which they are allowed to drink and drive until they get used to the new regulations. No such latitude is offered because what is being done is so damaging to health. The sight of old people smoking can often encourage young people to do the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come a long way &mdash; in fact, further than I would be inclined to encourage him to come &mdash; in saying that the regulations will recognise the concerns and the feelings of old people. If he was to say that the present generation of old people were to be recognised by the regulations, in other words, to have a temporary clause to cover the needs of the present occupants of psychiatric hospitals and welfare homes.  I would say fine, but I do not think we should necessarily have a permanent exclusion of old people from the provisions of the Bill.  It may well be necessary as a transition measure but not as a permanent measure.  I do not see any merit in the amendment.  The Minister is right, if anything, he does not go far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that under section 10 every regulation will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the regulation as passed by either House in the next 21 days in which the House has sat after the regulation is laid before us, the regulation <Col N="2115" /> should be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  That clarifies that point.  The regulation will come before the House in the normal way and can be debated at that stage if Members wish.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify a point for Senator Ferris.  In the course of the debate we were pointing out a few facts.  Under section 2 the chewing of pipe tobacco will be controlled by regulation in common with the use of snuff and types of smoking tobacco.  For obvious reasons, it is not realistic to ban pipe tobacco.  We recognise that pipe tobacco is chewed by a small number of old persons.  We do not condone this, but we recognise it as a fact.  In the debate I said we understand that quite a number of older people who have the habit of chewing tobacco, were chewing tobacco before some of these new products came on the market.  The chewing of that type of tobacco will be banned in the restricted areas as laid down in the legislation.</P>
      <P>At present there is one brand of chewing tobacco being manufactured in this country and it only constitutes 3 per cent of all the hard-pressed tobacco manufactured by that company.  There is not a significant economic interest in the manufacture of chewing tobacco here and that will have some effect, but very little effect, on that particular company.  As I said, the manufacture and consumption of that product will be banned.  I want to make this point as clear as I can.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Senators are eliciting information about this Bill because it gives me an opportunity to make crystal clear, exactly what we intend in this legislation.  The points made by the Senators will be taken on board, but we cannot vary the legislation.  I want to make it quite clear to old people that chewing tobacco products will be banned, and there will be no exemptions.  We realise that quite a number of elderly people chew pipe tobacco, and we are not banning pipe tobacco.  If there are any other points I will be delighted to clarify them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 23, to delete &ldquo;either prohibited or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was being discussed on Second Stage, a number of Senators, including myself, made the point that the Bill insisted on an absolute prohibition on smoking, whereas there are those of us in this House and in the other House who felt that there was a very strong case for a restriction on smoking in certain places, but not for a total prohibition.  In all of these amendments I am proposing that all the references to an outright prohibition of smoking be deleted and that we confine the Bill to providing for a restriction on smoking.  This would enable the rights of smokers to be respected, subject to the overriding rights of the non-smokers.  To a certain extent these amendments anticipate the regulations which will be framed by the Minister when this Bill is enacted as being extremely restrictive.  There is no doubt that the mind of this Minister differs very little from that of his predecessor in his attitude on this question.  Both the former Minister, Deputy Desmond and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, have made it clear that they take an extremely restrictive view on smoking. Their view goes virtually as far as an <Col N="2117" /> outright and almost blanket prohibition on smoking in all public places.  I can accept that there must be a wide range of restrictions on smoking in all places of indoor entertainment.  I would like to see large areas of restaurants designated as smoke-free areas, but I am worried about what I see as the excessive restrictions involved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the concept of prohibition used as sparingly as possible in a free society.  It is for the reasons which I outlined in my Second Stage speech, that I prefer education to a regime of coercion, to persuade people rather than prohibit them in a blanket fashion, that I am moving these amendments.  I do not expect that the Minister will accept them. But I am concerned that the minds of this Minister and the previous Minister are excessively rigid on this question.  I would like to ask that when the regulations are being drafted some consideration should be given to the rights of choice and to the rights of non-smokers in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments as grouped deal with two different sections.  Our amendment No. 6, deals with section 2. In this Bill we have to qualify what we are trying to do in the area of legislation on smoking.  None of us on any side of the House is removing the right of the Minister to restrict the use of any tobacco product in designated areas.  Many of us welcome the fact that the Minister is doing this.  According to the survey which was carried out, even smokers agree that it is appropriate that there should be certain restrictions, but I do not think I can go along with the total prohibition of smoking by way of regulation in any designated area.  The concept of our amendment is that after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; the words &ldquo;having regard to the rights of non-smokers and smokers respectively&rdquo; should be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued here on Second Stage &mdash; and possibly again today &mdash; that smokers have no rights.  Many people hold that view and I respect that view. People feel it is a health hazard for them to be passive inhalers of cigarette smoke etc.  None of us condone the fact that <Col N="2118" /> there should be the freedom to smoke in any place if one so wishes.  I agree that there should be limitations on the rights of smokers.  What we are asking is that the Minister would, in the laying down of regulations and restrictions, have regard to the fact that there are people who need to smoke and that he recognise that he cannot totally prohibit it; some area will have to be set aside in all of these institutions, public or otherwise, where smokers can participate in what is now regarded as an unhealthy pastime, pleasurable as it might be.  It is not unreasonable for the Minister to restrict smokers, but he should designate places where they can smoke.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that whether on public transport, aircraft, in restaurants or anywhere else, the greater part of those areas should be designated in the Minister's regulations as being for the pleasure and enjoyment of non-smokers but he should not forget that there are a group of people who may need to smoke.  Whether we regard them as having rights or otherwise, prohibition will confer no rights on anybody.  It will prohibit everything and everybody. Restrictions would at least recognise that there are people who need and want to smoke whether we like it or not.  Let us not outlaw everybody by way of legislation.</P>

Let us do it that way but let us sit down and talk about it because other people have rights, whether we like it or not.  What did we do for the past 60 years with all these people?

      <P>I would have been much more in sympathy with Senator Ferris's <Col N="2120" /> point of view the day before yesterday than I am today.  Having just returned from a surgical conference in Iceland I had a fairly long trip on an aeroplane. On the first plane, which was Iceland Air, smoking was completely prohibited all the way from Reykjavik to Glasgow.  On the second plane, which was British Airways, I asked for seating in a non-smoking area, but I found myself in the front line of the non-smokers area and in the back line of the smokers there was the most prodigious smoker in the whole plane.  In fact, had I chosen the front row of the smoking compartment I would have been in a better health situation than I was behind the back row of the smokers' compartment and in the front row of the non-smokers'.  It can be seen that smoke has a considerably confusing effect and I am sure it was highly deleterious to my state of health and wellbeing. Having said that, I hope that we do not become so restrictive in our thinking that we overlook all situations.  For example, in hospitals we have to deal with the relatives of very sick and dying patients who have to sit, very often, in not very comfortable surroundings, through no fault of their own, for very long periods during the day and night.  They may be smokers and that may be their way of releasing some of the understandable tension they would be suffering.  The ideal of course would be to have a smoking room and a non smoking room for relatives.  I hope we will gradually move in that direction and, beyond that again, that we will not have to deal with this problem at all because as the health hazards associated with smoking become more fully appreciated no one will smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However we cope with it, we must at least be aware of the difficulties and be practical in our approach.  I always come back to the great ideals pronounced in the Litter Bill when I look at the state of Ireland today.  Let us hope that in pushing forward an anti-smoking Bill we will not find in five or six years time that nobody has paid any attention to it at all because we did not exercise our commonsense <Col N="2121" /> in the passage of the Bill through these Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two speakers, Senators Ferris and Robb, spoke with great commonsense on this question. Senator Ferris in particular outlined the type of changes he would like to see made in the Bill to ensure that smoking would not be totally prohibited.  He made a very reasoned case.  Senator Robb gave some examples of cases where sheer humanity would dictate that the provisions of the Bill could be unduly restrictive.  I do not want to be offensive but what worries me are the attitudes of the backbenchers on this side today, the serried Savanarolas, who are going to make people good regardless of whether they want to be good.</P>

The rights of minorities that are constantly being called for from that backbench are in this case out the window.  I ask people in the back row today to try to inject a little of the humanity of Senator Robb and the commonsense of Senator Ferris into this provision.  Then we might make a little progress on it.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at Senator Manning, to say the least.  When he talks of minorities he should equate the effects of a most harmful drug, whether he likes it or not, with the more illustrious activities of minorities or the aspirations of some of my colleagues on the backbenches.  I do not see the correlation at all.  I agree with Senator Manning when he says that we cannot legislate for moraltiy.  We cannot force people to be good.  I go down the road completely with him on that but what we are talking <Col N="2122" /> about here is the prohibition or restriction on the consumption of tobacco products in aircraft, trains, public service vehicles and other facilities as may be specified.  We shall consider what the implications of this legislation will be.</P>
      <P>It takes the vast majority of people who travel by air to our cross-channel neighbour, Britain, one hour to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot go direct, one would have to change trains at some stage.  Let us take, for example, the question of a restriction or prohibition on smoking in health premises.  I could not help thinking, when Senator Robb remarked on the provision of smoking and non-smoking rooms, of my experiences of smoking and non-smoking rooms, the most recent being in February when I found myself among a group of people waiting anxiously and nervously for news at the National Maternity Hospital.  I went into the room provided for, what could loosely be called, expectant fathers only to be met by a billow of smoke despite there being nobody else in the room.  There was a sign there stating, in black and white: &ldquo;No Smoking.  Smoking is a Health Hazard&rdquo;.  I checked with the nursing staff and they agreed that although it was a no-smoking hospital they found it very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent particularly anxious fathers-to-be from smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Senator Manning says about the difficulties there will be in trying to enforce this legislation but I still cling to the hope that this legislation will <Col N="2123" /> lead to a change in attitudes.  Attitudes are already changing.  I still retain the right to say, that as a non-smoker, I resent having smoke blown in my face.  I resent, too, being in cinemas in which sections are blocked off for smokers. There is medical evidence to prove that passive smoking is equally injurious to one's health as is active smoking.</P>
    <P>I may sound very right wing and intolerant. That is not intended but I just believe as passionately about this legislation as Senator Manning does about the points he has raised.  While I accept what Senator Ferris has said in relation to his amendment on legislating for smokers as well as non-smokers, I am afraid I am intolerant.  I believe it is time that legislation in this country reflected the majority view.  I hope that this legislation will ultimately lead to the position where the number of people smoking will be very minute.  That is why I go along with all of what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate that what we are seeking in this legislation is, surely, the Republic of health, not the Republic of virtue.  Therefore, we cannot be properly accused of being killjoys or restrictive in the sense Senator Manning wants to make us out to be.  Surely, the overriding principle is the right of all the citizens to breathe clean, smoke-free air when they are in public places.  That is the only right.  In the public context, smokers have no rights. If they are mingling with non-smokers, sharing the same air, they have no right to pollute that air.  It is nonsense to talk of smokers having rights in that context. I must say that I have rarely seen such a stupid suggestion as the one contained in this amendment, which uses the phrase &ldquo;having regard to the rights of smokers&rdquo;. Smokers simply do not have any rights. Senator Manning said that we should be seeking to persuade and cajole people instead of forcing them to do things.  The day for that has gone.  Asking people, voluntarily, not to smoke in public places has, by and large, been unsuccessful.  We <Col N="2124" /> require this measure as a measure of public health.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised that Senator Robb brought up the compassionate case once again of mourning relatives gathered around a hospital bed.  I am afraid, quite simply, that they should get used to a situation where smoking is forbidden. One cannot behave anti-socially and one cannot do it in situations of joy or in situations of grief because once you begin to make exceptions the legislation falls apart.  I remember, not so many years ago, asking a ticket collector on a train to ask two ladies who were smoking in the same compartment, a non-smoking compartment, to cease smoking.  He chatted with them and then went away for a while.  When he came back they were still smoking.  I asked him if he had asked them to stop smoking as they were sitting in a non-smoking carriage and he said: &ldquo;sure, I did not like to be too hard on them.&rdquo; That is exactly the philosophy behind the amendments of Senators Manning and Ferris.  The attitude is &ldquo;Ah, sure God help us, we would not like to be too hard on them.  Let us not take this legislation seriously, to that extent: We do not want to upset people.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>In short, the amendments undermine the principle of the Bill.  I do not see how Senators can put forward these amendments and maintain that they support the Bill as a whole.  I would go further and ask the Minister, when he is designating by regulations areas where tobacco products may not be consumed, that he include many areas of Leinster House as prohibited areas where smoking is concerned. Why should we have to endure other people's smoke in the Library, in what is now a very confined and unsatisfactory premises?  Why should we have to breathe people's smoke in a crowded self-service restaurant?  Surely this House should give an example.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously designating these areas of Leinster House as no-smoking areas.  In Leinster House there is no lounge as such.  People use the Library as a reading lounge, a working place and so on.  Certainly smoking <Col N="2125" /> should be prohibited in that area and I hope it will be done before long.</P>

      <P>I am loath to appear to disagree with my colleague.  Senator Manning.  The amendments he has put down are largely personal amendments and spring from a certain sympathy which is part and parcel of his delightful nature. He seems to think that most of the recalcitrance came from the back row but I am pleased to tell him that there is somebody here in the front benches who thinks slightly differently.</P>

      <P>Just you wait.  There is a certain rearguard action being fought on this legislation in relation to these amendments.  I understand the thinking behind it, the unwillingness to be harsh, the sensitivity, the feeling for people and so on.  That is all very nice but I do not hear any allusions to the health evidence, to the statistics, to the research, to the information and to the facts which the Minister gave us in his introductory speech to this Bill and to which those of us who believe passionately in the need for this legislation gave chapter and verse when we contributed on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Freedom is fine but freedom is always relative and I agree with Senator Murphy when he talks about the rights of non-smokers and the fact that smokers as such have no rights except when they are smoking in private.  This is public health legislation and I would like to think that we have sophisticated attitudes in relation to public health in this country. Whenever I visit a Third World country I notice there is a degree of smoking and indulgence in tobacco which was the norm here in the thirties, forties and fifties but which has, thankfully, undergone quite a change and a change in attitudes will be even further enforced by virtue of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robb referred to hospitals and the needs of anxious people who are visiting their relatives who are gravely ill or terminally ill or dying and the need to have a place for them to relieve their <Col N="2126" /> tension and frustration by indulging in the habit of smoking.  I understand that and I appreciate it and I believe hospitals should, perhaps, provide a facility for this activity because they wish to be compassionate. Such people often go for a walk on the perimeter of a hospital to smoke a cigarette and go back in again. I have seen people who were visiting patients in a hospital smoking in a room where oxygen was in use despite the fact that there was a large notice up to that effect and warning signs in red letters.  It is horrifyingly stupid to light a cigarette in such circumstances apart from the fact that it is an obnoxious habit.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the arguments being advanced about designating part of Leinster House as a &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; area. I find my enjoyment of the Library in Leinster House spoiled to some extent by the fact that so many people wish to smoke there and by the presence on the tables of ashtrays which positively reek of tobacco.  If one happens to be reading a newspaper in the area of one of those ashtrays it is quite an unpleasant experience.</P>
    <P>I would also be concerned that the Minister when he is publishing the regulations might have something to say about local authority meetings.  It is my misfortune to sit in the proximity of the two smokers who are members of my local council and I patiently pass the ashtray to one of my colleagues who sits immediately beside me at the corporation meeting and whom I suspect is not too far away from me in this gathering here today.  This person manages to refrain from smoking when he is in this Chamber. Everybody who sits in this Chamber refrains from smoking but it seems to be a more difficult exercise to refrain from smoking at a local authority meeting or, perhaps, the tensions, stresses and politics of local authority meetings are so much greater and require people to indulge in their habit, which is not the case when they are in this House.</P>
    <P>Overall, the question must be asked, if this legislation is for real &mdash; and I hope it is for real &mdash; who is going to enforce these regulations?  The Minister has to <Col N="2127" /> put this on the line, because if he does not and if we do not know and if the legislation has no credibility because there is nobody to enforce it then we are largely wasting our time.  I agree with Senator Murphy's point about the guard on the train whose attitude was: &ldquo;Ah, sure I did not really like to ask them; ah, sure they were enjoying themselves&rdquo;.  We have to get away from that type of thinking and that type of attitude.  I hope the Minister will tell us that he will fund a large body of enforcers to ensure that this legislation is going to be realistically implemented.  It is important that he should spell that out in no uncertain terms.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, people are talking about the rights of smokers. People have a right to smoke in a room on their own, which in my view should have a skull and cross bones on the door saying: &ldquo;Warning, if you insist on using this room, you are putting your life in danger&rdquo;.  I am a committed liberal, committed to the freedom of the individual to do anything, including to commit suicide if they wish.  If people wish to put their lives in danger I will defend that right, but I will not defend the right of anybody to put my life at risk in order to indulge in their own filthy habits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have to live with these things but that does not mean that we should pretend that people have rights to do these things.  Like Senator Murphy, I travel frequently by train &mdash; thankfully at this stage smoking on trains is widely prohibited &mdash; and the presence of one smoker in a carriage of non-smokers at the very far end of it immediately becomes evident to those of us who do not smoke.  The fact that the mere presence of a smoker causes offence at this <Col N="2128" /> stage is offensive.  In addition to being offensive it is also a threat to my health. As I occasionally travel by train or other forms of public transport with my three children, who are all under the age of ten, I particularly resent having them subjected to any prospect of passive smoking at that age.  The idea that people who smoke have any right to inflict their habit on me or my children or anybody else is a load of nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is so much fuzzy thinking about the issue of smoking.  For example marijuana is banned in this country.  It is a criminal offence to have even the smallest quantity of marijuana in one's possession. There is some medical debate going on among scientists and doctors about the health hazards associated with marijuana but I am not going to get involved in that red herring at this stage. Nobody has suggested that if I consume marijuana I will do the person beside me any harm but, quite rightly, we still make it illegal to possess it and, by implication, to consume it.  I am not a prohibitionist because I believe that prohibition is often counterproductive, but we have decided as a society that the risks involved to people and society of possessing any quantity of marijuana are such as to justify its prohibition.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we have tobacco and there is no further doubt among scientists and doctors about its damage either to consumers or those who have it imposed upon them.  Yet, we have some sort of libertarian notion that those people have the right to impose their habit on the rest of us.  If people want to charter trains and planes so that they will be occupied entirely by smokers, let them at it.  However, I reject that they have some right to impose themselves on me on a four or five hour plane or train journey and smoke because they have become addicted to a particularly offensive drug.  If they want to find little rooms for themselves in private out of the way places where the rest of us neither have to notice or put up with their habit, let them at it and I will defend their right to do so.  I defend the right of many people <Col N="2129" /> to do things in private and I, perhaps, would not necessarily approve of or actively engage in.  However, I do not defend the right of people to engage in public in a habit which not only damages themselves, and that is fair enough, but also damages my health and the health of two-thirds of our adult population who choose not to smoke.</P>
    <P>It is about time that a lot of the nonsense about cigarette smoking was got rid of.  People were shanghaied into this habit by peer group pressure, by seductive advertising and many other ways.  The reason cigarette companies are so successful is that they persuaded people to start a habit which becomes physically and psychologically addictive.  It is our duty to break that cycle of addiction by every means possible.  That is why the idea of not allowing a Minister to prohibit the use of tobacco in a number of areas is such an appalling proposition and why the amendment is wrong.  The only thing that is wrong with the Bill, and Senator Norris to his great credit is trying to remedy that, is that it does not go half far enough.  I hope the Minister will accept all or most of the amendments tabled by Senator Norris because he identifies a number of areas of public congregation which so far, regrettably, are not covered by the Bill.  Those of us who do not smoke and do not wish to have smoking imposed upon us should not be afflicted by the nefarious activities of this decreasing minority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who have expressed the view that these amendments serve to undermine the intention of the Bill.  For that reason I join with the Government party in opposing them.  Of course, I accept certain elements of the civil liberties view with regard to smoking but I would like to put it in a phrase with which I am sure the Minister will not be surprised that I am familiar, that is, that I believe in the right of consenting adults in private.  Smoking is something that only consenting adults in private should be allowed to engage in. Like other Senators I am rather surprised that provision is made for smokers <Col N="2130" /> throughout Leinster House, with the exception of the debating Chambers.  It came as a considerable surprise to me to see the lavish and obviously longstanding provision made in the Library for smoking and in the restaurant although there was a small gesture there in terms of a notice in the self-service restaurant which asks us to please not smoke while close to the food service area.  However, that type of notice is redundant because people smoke while they are queuing for a meal because there is no clear ban. Where the issue is fudged people will cross the boundary into the grey area.  I have just come from an office in the House where there is a minority of smokers and when I let it be known that we were discussing the Bill the junior members of the staff expressed great pleasure but the senior members, whom I gather are addicted to nicotine, were by no means so pleased.  There is a crux here because nicotine is an addictive drug.</P>
      <P>It should be possible for one person in an office to require the atmosphere to be declared a non-smoking area.  Where possible if a person is seriously addicted to nicotine a caring employer should provide a smoking office for that person. Nicotine is a very serious form of drug addiction and one must have some compassion for those who suffer from it, including those like myself who are recovering from it.  The amendments under discussion are specifically designed to water down the legislation and on this occasion, paradoxically, I hope the Minister will not accept them.</P>

      <P>The Chair will be glad to hear that I can be persuaded by debate and, having read the amendments to be proposed by Senator Norris, I am sympathetic to the point of view he has expressed.  It may be possible to ensure that in such places as hospitals there will be a clearly designated smoking ward and smoking lounge.  We should not forget that, while we have a smoking room, the people who may have to lie on their backs for four or five months, at a time when they are most vulnerable if they are addicted to nicotine, have a greater need. <Col N="2131" /> They may not have had the benefit of the type of education most Members have had.  We should consider what is a designated smoking area.  It should be assumed that the place is a non-smoking area but with provision for people to smoke in a designated area.  The small designated area must be capable of coping with all the operatives, not just the board of directors in a nice cosy and well-appointed smoke room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robb had put out amendments in the proper context.  I do not want them to be misrepresented by any Member.  They have been misrepresented in that some Members believe that we do not recognise the right of people in non-smoking areas to enjoy that smoke-free environment.  We have not suggested that people who wish to smoke should have the right to interfere in areas reserved for those who want a smoke-free environment.  It is important that that is made clear.</P>
      <P>We want the Minister to recognise in the regulations the need to set aside areas for those who smoke.  I expect that the members who are highlighting their rights will not enter a smoking area in a hospital, psychiatric institution, waiting rooms and so on.  Occasionally, on a train a non-smoking passenger may have to sit in a smoking area.  In that case the passenger must make the choice of whether he or she wants to sit for the remainder of the journey and tolerate the smoke or stand in a smoke-free carriage.  Those who must spend two hours on the train journey from here to Limerick Junction on occasions have to make such a choice and often at the end of the journey regret their choice of staying with the smokers.</P>
      <P>We want the Minister to designate areas in public buildings where people can have a smoke without being imprisoned or watched by patrols of health board inspectors or tiers of another bureaucracy the Government do not have any intention of funding.  If that occurs we will have people appointing themselves as the upholders of the legislation. They will preach to everybody.</P>

That would meet the point made by Senator Robb and it will have to be the case if we accept the position that exists in psychiatric hospitals.  If we designate the whole psychiatric hospital as a non-smoking area it will be like a prison and it could not function as a psychiatric hospital.  Other drugs would be needed to quieten the unfortunate people who are committed there.  The section gives the Minister power to prohibit smoking on an entire aircraft, an entire train or an entire public service vehicle.  To prohibit smoking on an entire aircraft would be the ideal.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely serious. This is how the section is worded.  It gives the Minister certain powers in relation to such premises as hospitals and even schools.  We have all preached about the <Col N="2133" /> desirability of not smoking in schools. The Minister still has not excluded the entire school.  This section gives the Minister power to designate part of the school designated as a no-smoking area.  This recognises the fact that, as Senator O'Shea said, a teacher might want to have a smoke but not in the presence of his class, and rightly so.  It is appropriate that good example is given.  The section gives the Minister power to designate part of a facility or building as a non-smoking area but there is no such provision for aircraft.  The section refers to the whole facility.  Senator Norris wanted to have taxis included.  Many taxis display no-smoking signs.  You can always ask the driver at the taxi rank if he caters for smokers or non-smokers.</P>

Until there is a majority of people who do not smoke it will not be possible to make this legislation operable.  That is a day we would all welcome but in the meantime we must realise that there will be a section of the community who will need some smoking facilities.  Everybody is entitled to his opinion and everybody's view should be respected.  We have a right to express our views in this House and I intend to implement that right.</P>

Senator Ferris was allowed to argue his point in relation to parts of buildings and I am attempting to respond to that.  I just wanted to ask the Minister to specify the reasons he is singling out schools and parts of schools.  Perhaps I am straying a little from the point.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) refers to such other place of indoor public entertainment as may be specified.  Why did the Minister not include cabaret and ballrooms in the places of entertainment.  Is it because the phrase &ldquo;indoor public entertainment&rdquo; is seen to cover all public entertainment?</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris spoke about the rights of smokers.  According to statistics, the majority of people in this country are non-smokers, so to say that there will sometime be a majority of such people is misleading.  The major decline in smoking is among the upper age groups, the over 25s.  Unfortunately, the biggest increase in smoking is among the teenage group, from 12 or 13 years up to 21 or 22 years.  Within that group it is mostly young women rather than young men who seem to smoke.  We should attempt to restrict and prohibit smoking as much as possible among this age group, particularly in schools and in cinemas and theatres where young people in the main congregate.  We should restrict and prohibit smoking in those areas so as to inculcate an attitude of mind that at least if we cannot save this generation we will save the next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on the record of the House what the amendments would mean, if they were accepted.  Under section 2(2) the Minister could not prohibit the consumption of tobacco products in an aircraft, train, public service vehicle or other facility. He could restrict it but could not prohibit it and that is what people have stated they are in favour of.  Under paragraph (b) he could not prohibit the consumption <Col N="2135" /> of tobacco products in such part of a health premises as may be specified. There is nowhere in a health premises that the Minister could prohibit the consumption of tobacco if that amendment was carried but he could restrict it.  Similarly, under paragraph (c) the Minister could not prohibit the consumption of tobacco products in such part of a school as may be specified.  He could not prohibit it in any part of a school but he could restrict it.  As the Bill stands, he can prohibit or restrict it in such parts as he sees fit.  I think that is far too generous and I am seriously contemplating putting down an amendment on Report Stage to delete &ldquo;or restrict&rdquo; from all these paragraphs. My considered and very strongly held view is that smoking should be prohibited in all these areas.</P>
      <P>Under paragraph (d) the Minister could not prohibit the consumption of tobacco products in such part, as may be specified, of a building to which the public has access and which belongs to or is in the occupation of the State.  He could restrict it and say that people could smoke in one half of a room but not in the other half but he could not designate a particular part of any public building and say that nobody could smoke in that area. If that is the intent of the people who proposed that amendment it is outrageous. If they did not read the legislation they have wasted much of our time.</P>

      <P>I do not support the amendment.  I subscribe very heartily to the provisions of this Bill.  They are long <Col N="2136" /> overdue and will bring us into line with regulations in other countries.  For instance, in the United States you can choose to have a smoke-free floor in a hotel if you so wish.  What will happen, and it is not a bad thing, is that if smokers are intimidated out of their bad habit by the fact that there is prohibition they will feel like a hunted species.  Apart from the long term effects of polluting the air for all of us who are entitled to have clean air, there are also immediate effects for anybody who spends time in a smokey room.  When you come home you can get the smell of smoke on your clothes and hair and it can affect your voice and eyes. These are immediate discomforts that I resent.</P>
      <P>One area on which I would possibly not feel as strongly as others is the prohibition on smoking in hospitals.  Some people have to go into hospital for long periods of time and I believe it would be unnecessarily cruel to impose on people who are sick, the withdrawal symptoms and all that is involved in giving up smoking. I should like the Minister to find a way &mdash; and I think there is a possibility of doing this under the section &mdash; to give some consideration to this group.  Like Senator Bulbulia, I do not support these amendments and I agree with the provisions of the Bill.</P>

I know he will but I want to make the point &mdash; and Senator Mooney has reminded us of this &mdash; that the greatest problem is among the young and the need for good example, particularly among teachers, is paramount. It seems to make a nonsense of the good intention of the Bill to say, &ldquo;We would not expect a teacher to smoke in front of his pupils because that would be a very bad example but he may go in to the designated common room in the school and smoke away to his heart's content&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pupils are very knowledgeable about these things.  They are very straight and honest and they know that teachers are going into the common room to smoke. <Col N="2137" /> The bad example will be all the greater if the pupils knew what teachers are smoking in the designated area.  The only solution to this is to make schools absolutely prohibited zones, whether they are publicly funded schools or private schools.  I do not accept that there is a valid distinction there.  I am beginning to wonder whether Senators Manning and Ferris have not among their constituents a disproportionately large number of smokers.</P>

      <P>The objective of the Bill is quite clear; it is only a restrictive or protective measure.  This amendment seeks to subvert the Bill.  It is inherently contradictory to what the Bill sets out to do.  The arguments made for the amendment seems to suggest that the Bill will stop people from smoking.  It will not. The Bill sets out to address those people who act with less than a complete social responsibility.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage contribution on the Bill I referred to a conference which I attended on the abuse of different substances and smoking in public places was one of the topics discussed.  People from the enlightened parts of the Continent, particularly Scandinavia, found it unbelievable that people would smoke in a public place and they felt that such legislation should be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish psyche is somewhat different. I would refer the proposer of the motion to an excellent publication by a good friend of mine, Micheál McGréil which is about the tolerance and the rights of minorities in Irish society &mdash; I cannot <Col N="2138" /> think of the precise title &mdash; and was published some years ago.  He makes it quite clear that the only way we will change the views of Irish society is by first legislating. We have had all sorts of experience of this.  I refer in particular to the equality legislation, the only legislation which managed to get parish priests and people like them to address the problem of equality.  It is only when there is a legal base on which to fight an argument that one can get through the long-held and very regressive views of some of our population.  Of course, I would not in any sense apply that to the proposer or seconder of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Moving back to the amendment, I would have to say that when referring to the rights of smokers, of minorities and so on, I think there is a certain confusion about what is meant by the protection of the rights of minorities.  The protection of the rights of minorities has never meant an abuse of the majority or an imposition in any sense on the majority. It is a sense of living together and a sense of live and let live.  It seems to be an intolerable intrusion on half our nation, or whatever portion of our nation, that they should be subjected to the polluted air, smoke or exhalation of the other half of the popoulation who choose not to control their habits.</P>
    <P>I am not making a judgment at this stage about the goodness or otherwise of smoking.  We have been through all that. Neither are we saying that these people should be stopped from smoking or that they should be stopped from carrying on with their suicidal intentions.  We are saying that whatever they do should not be an imposition on the rest of the population. That is very little to ask and that is what the Bill sets out to do.  I believe this amendment subverts the objective of the Bill and this is why I would be totally opposed to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22 and 24 together.  There are a number of reasons why I do not think it would be correct to accept these amendments. Section 2 gives the Minister for Health the general power to prohibit or restrict smoking in designated areas or facilities.  Subsections (2) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) simply highlight the specific public areas which I would regard as priority areas for the enactment of these controls.</P>
      <P>In his 1986 report on the health consequences of involuntary smoking, the United States Surgeon General stated that the scientific case against involuntary smoking as a health risk was more then sufficient to justify appropriate remedial action and the goal of any remedial action must be to protect the non-smoker from environmental tobacco smoke.  The goal of section 2 of this Bill is to protect the health of non-smokers.  Therefore, given this objective the Minister for Health must retain ultimate discretion to exercise his responsibilities in protecting public health.  He must retain the power to prohibit smoking when such action is justifiable on public health grounds. Protection of public health must be the overriding concern.  We are also protecting of course, the health of smokers by restricting them from smoking in these areas.</P>
      <P>However, in making regulations for the control of smoking in particular areas or facilities I will, of course, consult with all the interested parties.  Any legitimate concerns which are presented regarding such issues as safety will be considered when drafting the regulations.  This is particularly obvious in relation to aircraft a matter which has been mentioned already.  We will have discussions with the management of the airlines with regard to their safety requirements before we bring forward the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 6, this would restrict my room to take the necessary measures required on public health grounds.  Following on what Senators Murphy and Bulbulia have already said, <Col N="2140" /> the protection of public health is my primary objective in this Bill and a restrictive provision of the nature proposed could, arguably, jeopardise my responsibilities towards this end.  Medical evidence indicates that the simple separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same airspace may reduce but does no eliminate the exposure of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke.  Therefore, to ensure adequate protection in enclosed indoor areas for the majority of the non-smoking population I should wish to be assured that effective segregation is possible before considering partial restrictions on smoking.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions during the discussion on this Bill, both on Second and Committee Stages I raised and quoted the figures relating to local authority house building and the extraordinary reduction in the number of completions estimated for 1987 and, now, for 1988.  This seems to be an appropriate occasion to ask the Minister to confirm the statistics that he or his junior Minister supplied in the Dáil in April 1988 and perhaps give us some indication of whether he expects that the sort of low level of local authority house completions we have seen in recent years will continue.  Within the context of grants or subsidies for dwellings and so on presumably he must have some idea of what are future prospects.  At the nub <Col N="2142" /> of many of the issues dealt with in this Bill &mdash; to do with homelessness in particular and other matters &mdash; is the question of whether sufficient local authority housing, that is, low-cost State subsidised housing, will be available.  Would the Minister elaborate on how he envisages the future for the sort of housing provided for under section 15?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle behind the Bill is to provide accommodation for the homeless, the aged, disabled and travellers. While we might be meeting a housing need in certain areas there are others in respect of which we are not meeting those needs.  This is very obvious in many areas in relation to the elderly.  We have in our population some very old and some very young people.  Housing for the elderly is an especially important issue in urban areas where there are long waiting lists.  The waiting and transfer lists are very long in my local authority area.  If we are to house the aged, local authorities need capital allocations.  This year Dublin Corporation received no housing allocation whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Another principle behind the provisions of this Bill is the housing of the disabled.  The disabled can be housed only if the money is provided by local authorities for the building of local authority dwellings that can be adapted to the needs of handicapped people.  If there is no finance available, they cannot be adapted.  It is essential that the Minister should consider these categories at this time, namely, the elderly and handicapped and allocate the necessary funding to local authorities to provide accommodation for those categories.</P>

      <P>Since January of this year the loan charge subsidy system for funding of local authority programmes, including housing programmes, has been replaced by a grants system.  Section 15 of this Bill is necessary to provide the statutory back-up for this change.  It is a broad provision allowing for either a grant or a subsidy system.  In the past it was always a subsidy.  Now it will be by way of grant <Col N="2143" /> with a circular transfer rearrangement so far as the Local Loans Funding is concerned. The provisions of this section will enable that to be done by way of grant or subsidy.  Section 10 of the 1979 Act is being replaced by this section for subsidies only and not for grants.  That is the basis for this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is not prepared to discuss the scale or otherwise of local authority house building in the immediate future.  Senator Doyle and I asked him on a number of occasions to comment on the figures because they are related to the intent of this Bill.  If there are not going to be any local authority houses built in the next few years, many of the good intentions of this Bill will be simply pious aspirations achieving nothing.  What is the point of having a scheme of priorities for letting local authority dwellings if there are no local authority dwellings available to let? It is a fine and nice aspiration.  Presumably it means that anybody who is not number one on the Dublin Corporation housing list will not get accommodation.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister would either tell us that he does not want to talk about it &mdash; in which case I suppose we will have to put up with it &mdash; or at least respond to Senator Doyle's concern, as a member of a local authority, and mine, as a Member of this House, using the figures supplied by the Minister to the Dáil about the estimated numbers of completions for this year and the dramatic prognosis for the future.  Can the Minister give us some idea?  Does he have any view as to what will be the sort of level of local authority housing completions in the immediate future?  Is there a policy on it; is it an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement that will be dependent on the discussions on the Estimates taking place at present, or does he know anything about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of discussing the content of the discussion on the Estimates in so far as housing or any other element of the departmental brief is concerned in the Seanad today.  That is <Col N="2144" /> not what this Bill is about.  As far as I am concerned, the Government and the Minister will provide whatever funding is required for any housing programme they think necessary in the circumstances. This is the means whereby that can be achieved by way of grant assistance to local authorities.  I do not think it is relevant to be talking about budgetary estimates or whatever on this legislation.</P>

      <P>I made a passing reference to Estimates.  The marginal note to section 15 refers to grants or subsidies by Minister for dwellings, sites and assistance provided by housing authorities.  I am simply trying to elicit from the Minister his view on the future scale of local authority house completions.  Could he confirm the figure supplied to the Dáil in November 1987 on the estimated number of local authority house completions for 1988 of 1,600?  Was that too low, or too high, or does he know?  Can he confirm the figures supplied to the Dáil on 27 April 1988 that the allocation for new house starts in all the major urban areas was nil for 1988?  Both of those figures are relevant to the provisions of section 15.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to move forward on this, can we be more positive? This section gives the Minister certain powers to transfer, by grant or subsidy, funds to local authorities to do various things.  From the information available to us and from the figures available to members of local authorities, this year the number of new house starts is minimal throughout the country and particularly in rural areas.  Is it appropriate to ask the Minister in view of waiting lists for local authority housing throughout the country, seriously to consider the new powers conferred on him here and, in line with the Estimates approved at Cabinet level in the preparation of the budget, to increase funds under this section so that the principles of the Bill will be met and the situation addressed in parts of the country where there are growing waiting lists, particularly for old people's dwellings and family houses?  There are exceptions in built-up areas.  In some towns <Col N="2145" /> houses are locked up, but I am talking about the overall position and the overall figures, to which the Minister has access. There are large numbers of people in need of housing and their needs cannot be met by the local authorities with the funding allocated to them at present.  This section gives the Minister new powers to do this by grant and/ or subsidy.  Can the Minister address that problem and be more generous in the coming years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give special categories, namely, the aged, the disabled and the homeless, priority in housing.  There is little or no use in local authorities giving people priority for housing unless there are houses to allocate.  That is the essence of the Bill.  You give priority only when you can give people accommodation.  I speak on behalf of the disabled and the elderly, because they are in desperate need of accommodation in Dublin and, I am sure, in other areas.  I could not, in conscience, ask for a capital allocation for housing generally, but for inner sitting housing certainly.  Leaving that aside, I can make a good case for the elderly and the handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose Senators might see a relevance attached to it as far as housing in general and housing policy are concerned but it has nothing to do with the subject matter of section 15.  While I try to be as accommodating as possible, I would be leading Senators on to be repetitious and to speak off the section and for maintenance of good order I do not think I should do that.  This section of the Bill provides the method whereby the Minister for the Environment will be able to fund whatever housing programmes are necessary henceforth to meet whatever lists are available from the assessments already indicated in the other sections of this Bill.  I cannot go beyond that.  Surely everybody understands that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">

I would have been satisfied if the Minister had responded to them on the conclusion of Second Stage, which was a reasonable expectation of Members of the Seanad.

      <P>Could we remind the Minister that section 15 (1) (a) talks about &ldquo;the provision of dwellings (including houses, flats, maisonettes and hostels) by the authority&rdquo;?  Surely that is what we are talking about.  The Minister can quantify or qualify that in any way he likes, but it includes all those definitions of dwellings about which we are <i>au fait</i> and concerned.  Senator Doyle has limited his demand to a special category and has stated that he could not look for an overall blanket allocation.  I have mentioned old people's dwellings in particular, but they all come within the definition in this section of dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain to the Minister why we have to do these things.  It is because matters that were raised on Second Stage were not dealt with.  It was uncharacteristic of the way in which a number of Ministers have treated this House in the past number of weeks, when we have been extremely busy and when they put considerable effort into replying in detail to complex issues raised on Second Stage.  If it had been done, we might not be doing what we are doing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to defend my right to adjudicate on legislation in this House on the basis of whether it will work; whether it meets a perceived need; whether it fits into the <Col N="2147" /> context of the general body of legislation in the area.  Quite clearly, a Bill like this, full of pious aspirations about what local authorities are supposed to do in terms of priorities of lettings etc., but not backed up by sufficient resources to meet existing needs &mdash; not to mention the additional needs listed here &mdash; is something close to being farcical.  I would like to know whether the Minister proposes to respond to the increasing concern of a large number of people that we will have a housing crisis in a short period of time because of the decline in local authority house building.  This section gives the Minister the power to make money available which, depending on his action, will either alleviate or add to that crisis.  This is a perfectly logical and reasonable request.  It is perfectly clear that the Minister is not prepared to discuss the matter. I cannot make him discuss it and neither can the Leas-Chathaoirleach, but I profoundly regret that we cannot be allowed to make a proper adjudication on the relevance or otherwise of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a point with the Minister on a previous section and he correctly referred me to section 23.  It is the anomaly that has arisen regarding people who have already opted for the old purchase scheme and are not in a position to avail of the new generous scheme announced by the Minister.  At this stage I am talking about mortgages, because people have entered into mortgages with local authorities.  Perhaps section 17, which deals with mortgages on houses sold or leased by housing authorities, is the relevant section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I have looked at the <Col N="2148" /> Standing Orders of the House with a view to putting down an amendment either to this section or the one to which the Minister referred.  This would propose that existing mortgage owners would be afforded an equalisation clause because of the anomalies that have arisen in the values previously placed on houses.  I refer to comparable houses in schemes beside one another in which people opted to buy houses before 31 December 1987 and had them legally transferred.</P>
    <P>Within weeks the Minister announced a new scheme which had a different set of values and a different process of market valuation.  This has now resulted in an anomaly in that some tenants living beside others with similar incomes, opted for the previous scheme.  We could all say that it is hard luck, that they opted for the other scheme but I was hoping that there could be some sort of ministerial amendment or at least a commitment that the Minister would look at the anomaly that has arisen and have an equalisation process by, maybe, shortening the period of the mortgage repayments for the people who opted for the previous purchase scheme.  I hope I am making myself clear so that the Minister might address the problem which has arisen.  I have defended the new scheme; I have advocated it; it is an excellent scheme and it will achieve a lot of what the Minister has been trying to do.  There is widespread support for it.  I want to make this crystal clear because I was misrepresented yesterday &mdash; not by the Minister but by other speakers who said I was against it.  I am totally in favour of the new scheme, but because of its generosity, it has thrown up the anomaly to which I referred.  The Minister might address that problem now or come back with an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made that point yesterday and it has nothing to do with section 17.  It could be raised under section 23 but it is not for me to say that. That is the section that deals with the tenant purchase scheme as announced some time ago which operated from 1 <Col N="2149" /> January 1988.  Section 17 is purely technical, dealing with a different thing entirely.  I have already responded to the item the Senator raised last evening in so far as I undertook to look into the matter to see if there was substance in what he said and if there was need to discuss the matter further.  Perhaps the Senator would make the case again on section 23?</P>

      <P>There is already within section 114 a mechanism by which the level of rental income specified in this section could be increased.  It can be done by amending regulations to be made by the Minister in accordance with section 114 (3).  Section 114 of the 1966 Act is not one that I particularly considered in the context of the present Bill, as an increase in the limit does not require to be provided for in the Bill.  I am not in a position to say whether there is a case for any increase in the order suggested, which is £130 per annum to £2,500 per annum.  I must admit that there may well be a need to look in detail at the section and to decide after examination if a new rent level should be set and, if so, by how much.

      <P>In page 19, between lines 10 and 11 to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a dispute arises between the purchaser and the local authority as to the amount of the open market value the dispute may be referred to arbitration by either party to an independent arbitrator. The costs involved in the arbitration shall form part of the purchase price of the dwelling and shall be included in the terms of the mortgage.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was the section we wanted in connection with the new tenant purchase scheme.  It was put in at the time the scheme was announced and was generally thought to be ideal in the event of disputes arising about the market value. Since the market values have been announced the need for this arbitration may not be as great as considered initially.  It is important to be honest with one another in this House.</P>
      <P>The market values that have been announced are generally satisfactory and reasonable.  I do not see the need now for an independent arbitrator.  I have not discussed this with Senator Ryan but I have a list here of every house in my own county with which nobody could argue. However, I will deal with the problem on the section.  The Minister might like to confirm, as communicated to him by the local authorities, the take-up on this scheme and how it has been formulated throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very fair of the Senator and that is exactly the experience we had in the matter.  It might have been thought at the start that there would have been a lot of problems attached to this. Guidelines which were issued in the matter to local authorities indicated that <Col N="2151" /> they should be reasonable in their valuations and not set down something that would make it impossible for people to participate in this scheme.  They have taken that on board everywhere and I have had no complaints from any local authority.  There were little problems at the start and they were ironed out amicably between the local authorites and the Department.  We do not want an elaborate arrangement which would inevitably lead to delays.  The Senator understands that until section 23 becomes operable following the signing of the legislation by the President, we cannot finalise any of the sales so there is a little delay.  Seeing that it is a short scheme, operable only from 1 January 1988 and terminating at the end of 1988, I am anxious to press ahead with all haste now to give the thousands of people &mdash; I cannot give the exact numbers &mdash; but it is a very substantial number of the 119,000 local authority dwellings who want to avail of this purchase arrangement a chance to do so.</P>
      <P>The Senator is quite right in saying that we do not have a problem in the matter.  It would not warrant setting up an elaborate system of review.  For that reason I appreciate the fact that the Senator is withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a dispute arises between the purchaser and the local authority as to the amount of the open market value the dispute may be referred to arbitration by either party to an independent arbitrator.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude on the amendment I accept what the Minister has said. I was waiting to attract his attention to wrap it up.  Apart from the other problem I have raised about the redeeming of annuities for older applicants to the other scheme, I mentioned the peculiar anomaly that has arisen with the low cost housing and I hope the Minister will have an opportunity, to look at that.  It is special to the low cost houses, particularly as some have been repaired and have been offered to people.  The non repaired houses have been offered at a lesser value but the differentiation between the two is so high that I feel the Minister should examine the position in consultation with the local authority involved in the reconstruction programme because most people would like to buy the houses when they are repaired but very few would be capable of repairing them to the standard that would be required.  The kind of people we are talking of are in a special category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a request from my local authority in South Tipperary to look at the matter.  There was unamimous agreement by all the members, including members from the Minister's party that this was an anomaly which the Minister might not have foreseen.  The Minister <Col N="2154" /> felt that the present day market valuations would have covered the problem but that was not the case.  I would prefer if the local authority was grant-aided, the houses reconstructed to the required standard and then offered to the tenants but that may not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that I may understand the Senator accurately, the tenant purchase scheme 1988 applies to applicants who were tenants on 1 January.  Valuations were put on the houses concerned and there were different discounts given. If repairs were carried out to a house last year by a local authority in the normal course of events or whatever that would mean that the house would have certain valuation if valued now.  If a house did not have repairs carried out to it last year, a certain amount of money would be required to carry out the repairs but it was included in the guidelines that the repairs element would be taken into account in the estimation of the valuation of the house at current market values.  I can see that people might like to have the repairs done before they would buy the house.  Knowing that that would be the case I deliberately wrote in a provision whereby if a house was in need of repairs, the estimate of what it would cost to put it into repair would be taken into account with the market value estimate of the house.  I was hoping that that would satisfy the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look at the figures that have transpired on the ground, you would actually have to pay money to all the existing tenants who are left.  In the low cost houses there was major reconstruction. Walls, roofs, etc. were changed.  This was not just the normal reconstruction to various different kinds of houses.  We are talking about a special group of houses in respect of which a pilot scheme was carried out, and it was highly successful.  The Minister has continued to allocate money to the councils <Col N="2155" /> to allow that programme to continue. There are people in houses which have now been identified for repair work, where contractors have been appointed who are going ahead with the work.  That coincided with valuations being put on those houses by the local authority and the valuer in the area for the houses as they saw them.  The value of such a house now, in its non-repaired state, is such that if you were to take into account the cost of repairing it, you would have to give money to the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If a contract has been placed through the remedial works scheme I announced for a particular set of houses and if the contractor is in and has started the repairs and some are not finished when the valuation is given, the valuation will obviously take account of the house as it will be when finished just as, say, the one next door that happened to be finished last month had a certain valuation put on it.  This does not necessarily mean that the person would be disadvantaged because of that.  They can proceed with their application for tenant purchase.  I tried to indicate to local authorities that if there were houses in the one estate and they were more or less the same, the same valuation would apply to them all.  If some houses in an estate are having work done on them and a contract has been agreed under the remedial works scheme for work on the others, the same valuation would naturally apply even though the work might not be finished for another month or two.  Those concerned will not be disadvantaged in that regard.  If there is a particular case or cases or an estate about which the Senator is worried and if he would like me to give special consideration to, I would be pleased if he would convey the details to me as quickly as possible because obviously there is a time scale attached to all of these so far as the Department are concerned.  I will look as sympathetically as possible at any such case.</P>

I would not be raising it in this way if I did not know the local authority's difficulty in the matter.  I can give the names of the schemes now.  They are Carron Reddy Estate, Tipperary, Wood-view Estate in Cahir, a special scheme in Ballyclerihan which is due for demolition and the balance of the scheme at Castle Quarter in Killenaule.</P>

The Minister now knows the schemes and the timescale.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slightly different element introduced now by the Senator. Where refurbishment is under way or has been contracted for or money allocated to it under the existing estimate, then what I said applies.  Should it transpire, for whatever reason best known to the Government, that the remedial works scheme is terminated &mdash; that is not my intention but let us take a hypothetical case where there is a change in the next couple of months and it is terminated by somebody else &mdash; then the money would not be funded in there and consequently the Senator's proposition could not stand.  It can apply only in so far as this Minister's allocation of remedial works schemes applies this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister, with his advisers, look at the schemes I have mentioned he will see the problem.  I want to be fair to the Minister and to the tenants who want to buy their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go back to the anomaly that has arisen regarding people who purchased even as late as 31 December.  I know of somebody who had the title deeds to the house formally transferred almost on New Year's Eve.  Two days later their relative next door, who did not have such an efficient solicitor, did not have a formal transfer is now paying almost £20 a week less &mdash; or will be &mdash; for an identical house in the same street.  I realise this is a legal problem but I am suggesting the Minister has the power to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which would take this anomaly into account.  I am suggesting it only for where there are direct comparisons of houses in a street, all considered to be of the same value, <Col N="2158" /> or tenants in the same income bracket paying different amounts for the same kind of house in the same condition and of the same value if all the houses were to be valued now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one way to meet this is to reduce the mortgage period of repayment as an equalisation process.  It is only a suggestion.  I suggest the Minister has the power to make the necessary amendment and I am begging him to do it.  I cannot do more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see there cannot be a dispute because the house will never be on the open market.  That cannot arise. As the 1988 tenant purchase scheme is in process at the moment with guidelines set down is in the course of being implemented, there is no way one can force the Minister to commit himself here, however sympathetic he may be.  I would dearly love to see Senator Ferris's plea to the Minister succeed because I would come up quickly with a number of schemes.  However, I cannot see it occurring.  I do not want to be negative, but I cannot see the Minister interfering now where clear guidelines have been set down and the scheme is in progress.  As I said last night, it is the best scheme ever introduced by a local authority.  It is very successful.  Those who have houses which were repaired prior to the purchase scheme being announced are very lucky. Where houses were not so repaired the people concerned can also take advantage of the provisions in the scheme where allowances are made.  For members of a local authority this is fairly simple arithmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the scheme fully and I am encouraging tenants to take part in it as actively as they can.  It is one of the finest schemes ever produced by any <Col N="2159" /> Government.  Perhaps the Minister can give me some guidance on an aspect of the scheme which has been brought to my notice.  The scheme provides that local authorities shall put up a 100 per cent loan for the houses and that the houses shall cost the market value less 40 per cent.  As the Houses are comparatively new, that is 40 per cent less the £2,000. In this new scheme £13,000 is the net figure.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that a building society have offered them a figure of £16,000.  The net price at which they should buy is £13,000 but they are being offered £3,000 up front as well.  In other words, it is £16,000.  Is that type of arrangement legal?</P>

      <P>I agree totally with Senator Ferris regarding people who have availed of a previous scheme and I ask the Minister to be as sympathetic as possible in such circumstances.  In some way it reminds of the parable about the owner of the vineyard who paid workers who came in at the 11th hour as much as those who were in at the start.  I suppose <Col N="2160" /> in equity they do not lose out due to the fact that this is probably the best tenant purchase scheme of all time.

It is a view widely held and it applies only to houses of similar status in similar schemes in towns and villages.  We do not expect the Minister to make a widespread exemption order for the whole country.  That would be unfair.  A compliment to his existing scheme is the fact that it has exposed the anomalies of the past two years.  We are not blaming the Minister for them but we are asking him, because of his now generous scheme, to address the problems that have arisen, perhaps by way of resolution or order or at least to give a commitment that he will look at them.  Let him ignore the comments of Senator McGowan and come back with an amendment on Report Stage.  None of us is infallible and we would like to help the Minister.</P>

      <P>I have had cases of married people applying for a new house and being given a grant and then the marriage was dissolved or there was a legal separation. In one case of a legal separation part of the arrangment was that the man retained the house and for a number of personal reasons the woman with her children had to go elsewhere.  She applied <Col N="2161" /> for a grant and built a new house.  Then she was told she could not be given a grant to build a new house, although it was her first house, because she had been considered a beneficiary of joint ownership under the previous Act.

      <P>In short, this section &mdash; and I know it will be welcomed unanimously by the Seanad &mdash; amends section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979.  That was the statutory basis for paying the new house grants.  The effect of the amendment is to broaden the category of exceptional circumstances under which the £2,000 first time purchaser's grant can be paid to previous owner-occupiers, and is to include now formal marital breakdowns.  I was concerned that there were cases of undue hardship, and considered this was a good thing to do in certain specified circumstances; but because they are specified circumstances, I have to refer Senators to subsection (5) (a) (i) and (ii), and all the provisions indicated in the section for precisely the kind of person who can now be entertained for what often is a second grant.</P>

Where marital breakdown and deeds of separation are concerned, it can often happen that hardship would be suffered <Col N="2162" /> by individual spouses who might have to leave the marital home and would seek to rehouse themselves.

      <P>Sorry, I misunderstood the word &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;, not the first time I made a mistake.  As I said on Second Stage, I want to compliment the Minister on the provision in the Bill.  Many people have talked about it and the Minister has finally got it done.  It was a particularly offensive piece of legislation and we do not know how widely it was used.</P>
      <P>There is still a section in the Garda Commissioner's report on the Vagrancy Act in which begging is one specific offence that is referred to, and the rest are compounded under the title &ldquo;other offences&rdquo;.  No amount of effort can elucidate from the Garda authorities the actual breakdown of the &ldquo;other offences&rdquo; under the Vagrancy Act.  I suggest that the whole offensive Vagrancy Act should be disposed of because it contains references to offences which no longer have any real relevance.  There is reference to people displaying their wounds in a way to curry favour.  It refers to fortune telling, magic, spells and all sorts of stuff which have a lot more to do with the perception of the early to middle 19th century than with the late 20th century. It also refers to begging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own feeling is that begging ought not to be an offence of itself.  Begging ought to be an offence only where it gives offence to other people or is done in a threatening fashion.  The suggestion that the poor old guy who stands on O'Connell Bridge and holds out his hand is guilty of the same offence as somebody who aggressively accosts pedestrians in, say, Grafton Street, is quite ludicrous, but they are both committing the same offence, which is the offence of begging. Begging is actually an offence for which the only penalty is imprisonment.  There <Col N="2164" /> is no provision for a fine for begging. That is why I raised the question here, not in the expectation that the amendment will necessarily be agreed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a long-standing commitment to the rights of the travelling people and has extended his concern to the homeless.  The application of the vagrancy laws against those who are most disadvantaged in our society ought to be re-examined by the Government, and there is none better than the present Minister to be the driving force in the Government for that re-examination.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment: if possible to accept it but, if not, to pursue the matter within the Government and have this offensive legislation replaced by legislation which reflects the practical problem.  There is a practical problem here.  People are entitled not to be harassed, offended or threatened by people who beg.  To suggest that the fellow who stands with his hand out on Partick's Bridge in Cork or O'Connell Bridge in Dublin is somehow guilty of an offence which could land him in prison is quite ludicrous, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already addressed himself to the Vagrancy Act, 1824, as applied to Ireland by section 15 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, and we are amending it by removing what was an obnoxious section &mdash; that every person wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, not having any visible means of subsistence, and not giving a good account of himself or herself.  We were wondering why the Minister did not amend the whole Act.  One way of finding that out was to put down this amendment. Perhaps the Minister will say why he has kept some sections of this antiquated Act.  There must be a very good reason for it and this is an opportunity to hear from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to include this section in this Housing Bill.  I am pleased that the inclusion of it is getting such a <Col N="2165" /> warm and unanimous response from the Seanad.  The reason we cannot go further at this stage is because only one section of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, applies to Ireland, namely, section 4 and the proposed amendments are defective in that important respect.  The Senator said that he did not put it down for that reason so I can understand his point of view. Moreover, it would not be appropriate to provide in a Housing Bill for the repeal of section 4 of the 1824 Act which is a provision concerned with a range of offences many of which are not concerned or connected with homelessness or other issues that are relevant to this legislation.</P>
      <P>The limited amendment to section 4 proposed in section 28, however, is related to homelessness and the repeal of section 4 in its entirety could not be contemplated without consideration being given to the alternative provisions that might be required.  The Law Reform Commission have recommended that a number of the existing offences should be replaced by new provisons and the Minister for Justice will be considering the question of whether section 4 of the 1824 Act should be retained in the context of his examination of the Law Reform Commission report on vagrancy and he will be making recommendations to the Government on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue with the Minister.  At the end of what I have to say, which will be brief, I will be withdrawing the amendment.  The Law Reform Commission's report on vagrancy is quite illiberal on the issue of begging.  It makes no distinction between different kinds of begging.  For example, there are children who beg.  It is offensive to all of us that children should have to beg either because of need or because of parental neglect or parental pressure. There are those who stand and beg and cause no offence to anybody other than the visual offence of that sort of poverty or human degradation but that is not their fault.  Then there are those who beg in a way which is offensive or threatening to <Col N="2166" /> people.  There are three different categories involved; one to do with the care of children, one to do with people who just stand and beg and another to do with threatening behaviour.  Unfortunately, the Law Reform Commission did not make such a distinction in their report.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister who has an interest in this area perhaps will convey these sentiments to the Government so that the Government will think about begging in terms of those three categories. It is ludicrous to suggest that the harmless individual who stands or sits and begs and does nobody any harm is somehow in the same category as the people who cause great offence and often frighten others by their manner of begging. I simply put that to the Minister as a suggestion and a request.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about section 55 of the 1966 Housing Act. Section 55, under the marginal note &ldquo;Building Programmes&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of a housing authority, within such period after the commencement of this section as may be specified by the Minister and thereafter either at least once in every five years or at such intervals, being less than five years, as the Minister may direct from time to time, to prepare and adopt a programme (in this Act referred to as a building programme) setting out the works which they propose to undertake having regard to the housing needs of their functional area.</P>
      <P>(2)  A building programme shall be in such form as the Minister may from time to time direct and shall include the proposals of the housing authority, as respects the period to which the programmes relates, for the provision of houses, amenities, buildings and other land together with ancillary works or services to be provided in connection therewith,....</P>
      <P>It is a long section and occupies almost two pages in Achtanna an Oireachtas.

      <P>Section 55 has to do with a building programme.  Section 20 has to do with having regard to the assessment where it states, &ldquo;maintain a reasonable balance between the respective needs of classes of persons&rdquo;.  That could be a reasonable balance between the respective needs of the classes of persons specified for a static housing stock, or indeed a diminishing housing stock.  There is nothing in section 20 which suggests that a housing authority must put together a building programme.  That is what I am trying to figure out.  Why will there no longer be an obligation on a housing authority to do what they are required to do under section 55 which is, as the Act states, to prepare and adopt a building programme setting out the works which they propose to undertake?  Section 20 would mean that they would have to continue to look at how they allocate or propose to allocate their existing housing stock in the light of the assessments they have made.  It imposes no requirement on them to develop a building programme. There is a fundamental difference there. I would like the Minister to explain, if possible, why he feels they do not need to do a building programme any more.</P>

The note in the margin beside section 20 states that its additional provisions relate to sections 56 to 58 of the Principal Act.  It says nothing about section 55.  Section 20 of the new Bill does not refer to section 55 of the existing Principal Act.  That is why we are concerned about its deletion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 55 of the 1966 Act is being repealed.  I will briefly give the background to the repeal of section 55 of the 1966 Act.  Section 55 imposed a statutory duty on housing authorities to prepare and adopt a programme setting out the works the authority proposed to undertake, having regard to the housing needs of the area.  The programme was to include proposals for the building of local authority housing and also provision for assisting owner occupiers.  However, the key element to the programme was, of course, the provision of local authority housing, and section 55 could only make sense in a situation where all, or virtually all of the cost, of their housing programmes were met by the housing authorities themselves.  In this connection, the normal rate of subsidy for local authority housing envisaged in the 1966 Act was 33? per cent.</P>
      <P>As the Exchequer progressively met more of the cost of local authority housing, the preparation by local authorities of building programmes for which the Exchequer would have to foot the bill was seen as an increasingly irrelevant exercise and over the 22 years section 55 fell into disuse.  There is no point in retaining on the Statute Book a redundant and irrelevant provision.  Section 55 is being replaced by the much more relevant requirements of section 20 (1) which requires housing authorities when providing dwellings to have regard to their latest assessment of needs under section 9 and to seek to maintain a reasonable balance between the needs of the different categories identified in that assessment, including the homeless, elderly persons and disabled persons.  This new provision is designed to ensure that the local authority house building programme will in the future more accurately reflect the range and needs of the waiting lists rather than as in the past when we simply concentrated on family-type dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister or a Member who is a member of one of the local authorities can clarify this for me. Under what statutory provision will local <Col N="2170" /> authorities draw up house building programmes? There must be a reason for repealing that provision.  It was a useful provision.  I am not aware and I could not be in a position to be aware of to what extent it has fallen into disuse, but what is clear is that in order to have a coherent policy of house building, local authorities must have some plans.  They cannot decide now to build houses tomorrow as many things obviously would need to be done, such as the acquisition of sites etc. and these take time and require a plan or a programme.  There has been enough political debate in this country over the years on the difference between a plan and a programme and I do not want to get us distracted on that issue, but in the light of the dramatic decrease in funding for local authority housing I am not prepared to be entirely persuaded that the repeal of section 55 is entirely unconnected with the dramatic drop in the provision of funds for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>Who is going to decide when or if a local authority are going to plan to build more houses?  On the other hand, if one is to assume that there will be virtually no money available for local authority housing for a number of years, then the whole idea of compelling them to plan a building programme, following which they will be told by the Government that they cannot build it and they will not be given the money to do so, seems to be potentially somewhat discomfiting for the Government and, therefore, it might be better to get rid of section 55.  However, if the Members who are members of local authorities tell me that local authorities no longer plan building programmes and if they explain to me what they do instead then I would be less suspicious.  I am perhaps a bit suspicious by nature at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any need for the Senator to be that suspicious. The position is quite simple in so far as local authorities are concerned.  Under the new provisions in this legislation they will have to carry out assessments in accordance with their priorities as laid <Col N="2171" /> down here for the various categories of people who need to be housed in their areas.  Having carried out these assessments they will uput together their plans and seek funding from the Minister for the Environment to finalise the necessary arrangements to cater for their housing needs.  It would then be a matter for the Minister of the day, from the funds available to him, to respond to those requests from the local authorities.  That is the way it is done.  There is no great secret about it.  That is the normal practice which local authorities engage in and they do it quite efficiently.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 34, to delete &ldquo;55&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I found the Minister's explanation for the deletion, in its entirety, of section 55 of the 1966 Act entirely unconvincing.  I have spent &mdash; as have a number of Members of the House &mdash; a considerable period of time trying to get the Minister to talk about house building, housing policy and the future development of housing policy with no success.  On a few occasions the Minister appeared to be trying to regulate the business of the House and decide on what we should and should not discuss on certain sections.</P>
      <P>At this stage I am not so much concerned about the practice on a day-to-day basis of local authorities but the elimination from legislation of a legislative requirement on local authorities to plan a building programme seems to be an altogether retrograde step and one that does not seem to be consistent with the provisions of this Bill.  It is clearly not adequately dealt with under section 20 because section 20 could just have to do with how local authorities choose to allocate a static, or indeed a contracting, housing stock.  Therefore, there would be no legislative provision in place which would require housing authorities to continue to look at their house building programmes and to at least go through the motions of carrying out an assessment or drawing up a housing building plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to conclude that the repeal of section 55 is not unconnected with the drying up of funds for local authority house building.  It would, of course, be perfectly logical to propose the repeal of section 55 of the 1966 Act if virtually no funds were going to be made available for local authority house building in the immediate future.  It would be somewhat farcical to place us in a position where <Col N="2173" /> large amounts of local authority time and the excellent skills of their staff, whom Senator McGowan defended so eloquently last night, were to be used to prepare building programmes in the full knowledge that there was going to be no money available to do anything about those building programmes, not even to have restricted funds but as is the case in all the major urban centres this year, to have no money available for new house building.</P>
    <P>I have to suggest that the proposal to repeal section 55 of the Housing Act, 1966, is as much a reflection of the future prospects for local authority housing as it is a reflection of the intent of this Bill. Therefore, I am opposed to the repeal of section 55 and propose this amendment to the Schedule, to delete section 55 of the 1966 Housing Act from the sections to be repealed under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The Minister has said that section 55 is superfluous and does not need to be included in this new Bill because the local authorities were not using its provisions and because most of the funding comes from the State.  Be that as it may, at least section 55 placed an obligation on local authorities to build houses.  You can go on forever requesting them to draw up plans, programmes, assessment of needs and so on which they can submit to the Department of the Environment, but if there is not legislative power to require them to build houses is there much point in asking them to do so?  I want to be assured, because on rereading section 20 to see if there is specific power to request local authorities to provide houses I came to the conclusion that, if there is, it is very weak.  Let us be honest with one another.  We are legislating to ensure that local authorities meet the demands Government will make arising out of this Bill.  We can argue admittedly about whether there will be sufficient funds to do that, but let us not fool ourselves that we do not need legislation to request local authorities who are particularly dependent on legislators to provide the money to do so.  They are linked intrinsically, <Col N="2174" /> as Senator Ryan suggests.  Perhaps the Minister can reassure us that, in some section of this Bill, there is a specific requirement for local authorities to build houses in accordance with the plans drawn up by them, based on their assessment and submitted to the Minister and agreed by him, that is there a follow through in legislation because, if not, it is seriously defective.</P>
      <P>I will take note of your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, on whether the Minister had time between the last Stage and this Stage to take on board an amendment in the area I suggested, or whether he is just giving a commitment to look at the problem I raised which was also addressed by Senator Fitzsimons.</P>

Certainly section 55 of the Housing Act, 1966, had the word &ldquo;building&rdquo; in it and required local authorities to build. Section 20 of the present Bill which replaces that section is very passive about meeting their assessments and their requirements under section 9 and in no place does it say that local authorities are empowered to build houses.

      <P>Section 55 of the 1966 Act did not require local authorities to build houses.  The power to provide houses is in section 56 of the 1966 Act and the housing programme, as always, will be determined in consultation between the Department and other relevant bodies, and the Department foot the bill.  Once assessments are made, once local authorities know what they require for the particular categories that are set out specifically in this legislation which I <Col N="2175" /> regard as a most important feature of the legislation, local authorities can assess what they require in the matter and, in normal circumstances, the matter will be dealt with by the Department under whatever housing allocations they have available to them.  The important thing is that section 55 never required local authorities to build houses and that should be corrected for the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I did not think that section 55 required local authorities to build houses and I never said so?  I proposed the amendment.  The section required local authorities to go through all the necessary preliminary work that you would have to do before you could build houses which is to plan a building programme and to go into such detail:</P>
      <P>A buildings programme shall be in such form as the Minister may from time to time direct and shall include the proposals of the housing authority, etc.</P>
      <P>I am not under the illusion that, because section 55 is to be repealed, local authorities will not be able to build houses.  I am simply saying that the legislative base under which they can be directed to move towards the necessity of building houses is being diluted.  As I have already said, there is nowhere in legislation now where a local authority can be required to take the first steps towards building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly aware after the debate on this Bill that the Minister has a strong objection to local authorities being compelled to do anything which would require them to house any particular group of individuals, however deserving. The Minister is not in favour of requiring that people should be housed.  It is a deeply held objection of his which flies in the face of all the advice from every voluntary organisation.  I am well aware of it at this stage.  I have heard it so often over the past six or eight months that I could not but be aware of it.  I did not think there was any requirement of local authorities to build houses but there is a <Col N="2176" /> requirement in the 1966 Act.  Perhaps it has not been implemented or operated. Nevertheless, it is there requiring them, in the words of the Act:</P>
    <P>to prepare and adopt a programme ... setting out the works which they propose to undertake having regard to the housing needs of their functional area.</P>
    <P>Under section 20 of the Bill they can have all the regard they wish to all the assessments they make, but if they have no houses then they have no houses.  It is a logical part of any housing policy that they should be required to plan and to build local authority houses to meet the needs assessed under sections 8 and 9.  I do not believe local authorities will stop building houses if they have the funds.  I also still believe that, at a time when there will be apparently close to zero funds available for local authority house building, the repeal of section 55 is at least symbolic of the future policy in this area if not of some significance in terms of reducing the attention which will be drawn to the inadequacy if not the absence of local authority funding for housing.  That is why I moved this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To put it in a nutshell, I regard section 55 of the 1966 Act as a paper exercise. The section has fallen into disuse and is of no consequence.  It is not required and I am not interested in maintaining on the Statute Book sections that can be written off the Statute Book with no ill effects.  I regret that the last speaker has such a poor opinion of local authority members, as they constitute a housing authority. There was a certain amount of implied criticism that, as elected members of local authorities and housing authorities, they <Col N="2177" /> would somehow neglect the requirements and the needs and the responsibilities for housing the people they represent.  I do not share that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to address the problem which I have raised with him now on a few occasions and which is particularly relevant to section 23?  Perhaps the Minister would be generous enough to say, as he has not brought forward a Report Stage amendment which I requested in the course of the debate, that he will give me a commitment to address the problem I have identified and that he will communicate with me as to what action, if any, he is prepared to take, particularly with regard to the anomalies which have arisen for certain categories of tenant purchasers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Final Stage of the Bill.  I have peculiar feelings about what is in this Bill.  On the one hand, I am very happy to see a number of provisions in the Bill.  It is the first time that people who are homeless have been identified in housing legislation as being a particular category of need and that is, of course, important.  It is also true that a duty has been imposed on housing authorities to identify them, to attempt to assess the extent of the problem of homelessness and the extent of the needs of those who are homeless.  That is also welcome. The repeal of the offensive section of the Vagrancy Act is also welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy is that section 10, which could have been the beginning of the end of the extraordinary exclusion of many people from the right to shelter, is so weak and ineffectual and contains so many extraordinary anomalies under which housing authorities will be able to attempt to direct voluntary organisations <Col N="2178" /> as to who they should or should not house.  Section 10 will enable housing authorities to tell voluntary organisations, who may have housed people under the provisions of section 10, that because they, the housing authority, no longer believe that person is homeless they must be compelled to leave.  I find that provision quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I also find the provision that people who are housed by a voluntary organisation could be required to pay rent to the housing authority rather peculiar. Apart from those anomalies I have to say that every voluntary organisation I am aware of do not believe that that section will work in the way that the Minister almost alone among those who have concern for the homeless seems to believe it will work.  The extraordinary administrative changes that would be required of a housing authority for them to be able to advance money to people, to be able to arrange lodgings for them, are dependent on the goodwill of financially-pressed housing authorities who will have within 12 months large numbers of people on their housing lists.  While I am not for one moment arguing about the goodwill of many people towards the homeless I am outlining the considered view of a large body of opinion including, for instance, that of the Archbishop of Dublin and his advisers on the whole area of social concern.  The Archbishop of Dublin about three or four months ago quite specifically criticised the Bill because of the absence of a provision that would compel housing authorities to make provision. I do not want to go on that line because I do not want to behave in a disorderly fashion.  I am talking about what is in the Bill and what is in it, in my view, is hopelessly inadequate on the one critical issue.  I would not expect what is in the Bill to suit me but I have not been convinced that what is in it is either workable or that the goodwill among the organisational and executive authority in housing authorities exists to ensure that section 10 will work.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister, alone among those who have concern in this area, felt obliged to pursue this line.  It leaves an <Col N="2179" /> unfortunate and regrettable sour taste in my mouth about a Bill which has so much in it that moves in the right direction but then, having identified the problem and who should be responsible, fails to follow through leaving us with an uncertain future.  The one guarantee I can give is that whatever the legislation does it will be carefully monitored by many people. The effectiveness, or otherwise, will be assessed by many people.  If, as I suspect, it proves ineffectual, I shall be back, with other Members, with the necessary amending legislation to ensure that what should have been in the Bill is included in the next one.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Bill has been given a speedy passage through the House.  As a Member of the House I should like to say to Members of this and of the other House, as well as to social workers, Archbishops or any other category one likes to include, who claim to be the sole custodians of concern for those with a housing problem, that they are codding themselves.  We are all concerned about those people.  Those who profess to know most about this problem may at the end of the day be embarrassed if they are asked to listen to an interview with homeless people.  The Bill does as much as possible for those people.  The problem is so great that no legislation could cure all the ills.  We have to look after a wide range of people, from those who sell videos and televisions on the motorways to the unfortunate créatúr who has to sleep under a jute tent at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has tidied up a lot of housing legislation.  When I heard a Senator refer to section 55 of the 1966 Act I was tempted to ask if that provision had ever been used.  Did any Minister, or official from the Department, ever direct a local authority to get on with the job of building houses?  Members can use jargon until they are blue in the face but they must recognise the problem that faces the Minister, how will he raise the cash.  All local authorities, from the most inactive to the most progressive, have numerous <Col N="2180" /> plans to provide houses but the Minister's problem is to persuade his collegues in the Cabinet, and ultimately, the taxpayer, to commit more funds to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>In general we welcome the Bill which has many commendable provision.  It was very progressive of the Minister, and in keeping with the spirit of the debate on the Bill, to undertake to re-examine the need for caretakers at halting sites for travelling people.  I understand that the Minister, on Committee Stage, indicated that the Department have not received any complaints about the market value of houses to be sold under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  The scheme does not encourage people to complain about valuations.  For example, Dublin Corporation valuations will not be available until the autumn. The Minister should consider having such complaints dealt with by an independent arbitrator, the cost of that arbitration to be incorporated in the price of the house.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, in particular the provision for the homeless.  I feel obliged to point out that the local authority of which I am a member have been very responsible in regard to providing accommodation for the homeless. In the course of the debate the Minister informed us that he would be asking local authorities to be reasonable when valuing local authority houses.  He should ask local authorities to adopt the same reasonable approach when implementing section 10.  The Minister should explain <Col N="2181" /> to local authorities the concern expressed by Members, particularly Senator Brendan Ryan.  It is important that they should understand the principle in section 10.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair and the Members of the Seanad for the speedy passage they have given to the Bill.  In response to Senator Ferris, the question of the price of houses under the tenant purchase scheme is not a matter that is laid down in legislation.  It is an administrative matter and it did not require any response by me by way of amendment.  I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the debate. It was a good debate and the matter was dealt with in a very positive way.  It is some time since this Bill was first mooted, on 9 November 1983.  I would have thought that some Senators would have referred to that as it has been a long wait for this legislation.  Many people felt it might never come to pass and I am pleased that it has, finally.  It is progressive and far-seeing and it will greatly change many apsects of dealing with housing for those less fortunate than ourselves. I was particularly pleased that section 10 was passed unanimously without a division in this House</P>

Senator Ryan asked the number of people who die each year as a result of smoking.  We estimate the number to be 5,000, that is 100 people per week.  It is a frightening statistic and anyone who has seen a person dying from a tumour will realise the effect of it.  The programme I mentioned earlier was very graphic.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, thank you.  Amendment No. 5 proposed to expand the provisions that already exist in the Bill regarding smoking by persons in public service vehicles, including buses and so on.  It would seem a very logical extension to include taxi cabs.  Also, it seems quite illogical to appear to exclude private buses available to the public for hire.  I would see considerable logic in making these extensions.  It is particularly appropriate to point out how many of the speakers, from all sides of the House, have alluded to the taxi cabs.</P>
      <P>On the first day when this was discussed, the question of notices in taxi cabs was raised.  People from both sides of the House felt that the polite notices in taxis &mdash; which originated principally in North America, saying &ldquo;We thank you for not smoking&rdquo;, were to be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very well aware that not only passengers but also drivers of taxi cabs are most anxious that they should have some support in reducing the incidence of smoking &mdash; in fact, doing away with it altogether &mdash; in their taxi cabs.  Apart <Col N="2187" /> from the question of health, there is also the question of the danger of taxi drivers from fire on late night runs, when taxis frequently are filled with inebriated customers. I know this because I happen to use taxis from the O'Connell Street rank quite frequently.  The taxi men are decent people &mdash; not at all puritans &mdash; but they feel under some threat by virtue of the irresponsible behaviour of some of the occupants of taxis late at night.</P>
    <P>I reinforce the point by saying that we have been talking at some considerable length about passive smoking.  It is one thing for a non-smoker accompanying a smoker on a journey for the duration of half an hour in a taxi, who then gets out into the fresh air but the taxi driver, if there are not strict legislative plans laid to protect his or her health, will be placed continuously, in a very small and confined place, in the position of having to inhale particularly dangerous fumes from the lighted end of a cigarette.  I would remind the Minister that he expatiated at some length on the dangers of passive smoking, on the fact that the non-inhaled fumes of the cigarette are the most dangerous.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about aeroplanes, how it is most unpleasant for people to have to be subjected to the smoke of other passengers and ludicrous to declare non-smoking areas were there is no physical segregation of the passengers in the aeroplane.  You can multiply that many-fold when you are dealing with the interior of a taxi cab.  It seems that there is great and persuasive logic behind this amendment which I believe will have support &mdash; certainly, moral support &mdash; throughout the House.  Should I go on to the other amendments straight away?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unnecessary amendment because it is already included in section 1 of the Bill in line 25.  It says: &ldquo;designated facility means an aircraft, train, public service vehicle or other facility which is used by the public&rdquo;.  That includes taxi cabs for hire or a private bus company or whatever mode of conveyance the public use.  If there are taxi cabs on the rank in O'Connell Street all they have to do is ask their fare if they smoke and if they do the driver will not take them.  It is as simple as that.  Many taxi cabs have a &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; sign displayed and, generally speaking, people respect it.  We are dealing with reality here.  Let us not be either Utopian in our outlook or prohibitive about what ordinary people do every day of the week.  It is a free society and if people choose to run a taxi for the convenience of people and allow their passengers to smoke, why should the Minister have the right to stop it?  There could be a constitutional case here.  We all love to look at the constitution which confers certain rights on individuals, perhaps the right of a taxi driver to smoke if he wishes to and to take passengers who smoke.  That fact must be recognised.  You can lay down all the laws you like but this law would be inoperable.</P>
      <P>The Minister would not lightly start telling private people what they should do in their business, a private bus company, a private taxi or otherwise.  It is a matter for the public to decide which mode of conveyance they want to avail of.  We should not be as restrictive as Senator Norris suggests.  I accept his bona fides in this but I caution that we are going down an impossible road in this regard.</P>

      <P>I can deal with the rest of the amendments as they arise.  First, I will deal with amendment No. 5 which we do not propose to accept.  Senator Ferris is quite correct in the sense that the Bill gives us certain powers to designate non-smoking areas but it is not practical in relation to taxis.  Most taxi owners or taxi drivers request their clients not to smoke.  As I mentioned earlier in the debate, private car owners, for their own sake and that of other passengers, will have to lay down the rule that there should be no smoking in cars.  I am sympathetic to Senator Norris's point of view but Senator Ferris has explained it fairly well from the practical point of view.  It is not enforceable in a private taxi vehicle. Most taxi drivers are now laying down the rules in their own vehicles that they will not allow smoking.  The drivers have no barrier between them and the passengers and they are putting their lives at risk by allowing passengers to smoke. The point made by Senator Norris is quite correct and it will be taken by taxi drivers. When they realise the danger they are putting themselves in they will lay down the rule themselves that they will not carry passengers who smoke.  We will not accept the amendment but we have the power to designate certain vehicles, mainly public service vehicles.  We do not intend to bring in a regulation in relation to taxis, private cars or anything like that. It would be unenforceable and we want the Bill to be enforceable.  The Senator's amendment would be impractical and that is why I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to come back to the points raised by Senator Ferris.  There is a contradiction between what he says on the one hand and what the Minister says on the other and there are also internal contradictions in what the Minister says.  Perhaps I may be allowed to expand slightly on this? Senator Ferris maintains that this question of public taxi cabs and private bus <Col N="2190" /> companies is covered in section 1 but clearly it is not.  There is a possibility of it being covered by regulation.  The Minister says that the possibility does exist but that he will not take it up, so there are two contradictions there.  There is a contradiction in what Senator Ferris said &mdash; either it is covered already or it is not.  The Minister says that it is not explicitly covered but it is potentially covered and he does not intend to use the regulations to cover it.  There are a series of inter-related contradictions which is the precise reason I put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ferris, I claim to live in the real world.  Possibly we have different definitions of the real world but the real world in which taxis operate is one in which certain practical considerations very rapidly emerge.  It has been suggested, for example, that a passenger wishing to have a taxi ride in a non-smoking taxi merely passes along the line and asks if a particular taxi is a smoking taxi or a non-smoking taxi.  There are certain taxi ranks at which you would be taking your life in your hands and we all know that perfectly well.  You only have to consider the rows that went on in Dublin Airport and the squabbles between taxi drivers to realise this.</P>
      <P>I am living in the real world and the Minister knows perfectly well that I am. You will only raise contention among taxi drivers if you have this kind of free range with tourists and other people passing up and down asking &ldquo;Excuse me, are you...?&rdquo;&ldquo;Get in and like it&rdquo; would be the answer.  The other situation is when taxi drivers may choose their customers. This is totally unrealistic, particularly in the early hours of the morning.  I would like to see the taxi man who will tell a group of three gougers that they are not acceptable in his taxi because they are smoking, unsupported by an absolute rule.  If we are serious about banning smoking this is the point at which we have got to make the stand.  It is obvious that we must have regulations here for the protection of taxi drivers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would very much like the Minister when we eventually get to the point <Col N="2191" /> where he can reply &mdash; and I regret that perhaps we will have to go through the whole range but there is a certain logic perhaps to that, I do not know &mdash; to explain why there should be a difference between Bus Éireann's vehicles and those of the private bus companies.  If there is a principle here why is it, for example, that somebody travelling back to Galway or to the very beautiful and civilised county of Roscommon should be forced to take a bus in which their health will be impaired?  Why should they be forced to do so?  Why should the office workers that engage in a mass migration from the capital city every weekend be placed in a situation where, possibly because of the inadequacies of CIE there is, as the Minister acknowledged a serious risk to health?  Is there some difference between Bus Éireann and the private bus companies that has yet to emerge to the intelligent on-looker?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (b), line 15, after &ldquo;specified&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including hospital wards and waiting rooms (with one lounge reserved for smokers' use)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge the acceptance of this amendment also.  We have heard a number of people talking on this amendment by a kind of serendipity, fortunate accident perhaps, because they spoke from all sections of the House and this indicates that there is very wide support for the amendment.</P>
    <P>For example, Senator Mooney from the Government benches spoke as a some time expectant father about his concern for the next generation of Mooneys &mdash; and I speak not of a spiritual persuasion but of the ancient clan of this country &mdash; of when he entered a hospital ward and discovered that it was infiltrated by nicotine addicts and so on.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious point, particularly taking into account the information I have.  I may, perhaps, be called Big Brother again on this occasion but the <Col N="2192" /> medical information at my disposal suggests that the effects of nicotine consumption on the foetus in embryo is in fact far more serious than it is on the expectant mother smoking.  This must also be true of passive smoking.  In other words, if a pregnant woman is engulfed in smoke in a hospital ward, not only is damage being done to the mother's lungs but damage is also being done to that wonderful entity upon which the Government in their wisdom have conferred the status of citizen, the unborn.  I would like to hear some reaction with regard to the right not to smoke upon what has been regarded and described with great feeling as the most vulnerable section of our society, the unborn.</P>
    <P>Everybody must agree with this situation which exists in hospital wards. Senator Robb, a distinguished surgeon, spoke on this point earlier and I believe, had he been here, he would have supported this amendment.  He indicated to me earlier in the afternoon that he would support it but unfortunately he was unable to be here.  Are we not going to listen to these very powerful arguments from the heart of a profession that ought to know what it is talking about?  The Minister will, of course, notice that within the parenthesis it is proposed that one lounge will be reserved for smokers' use.  Nothing could be more eminently sensible on a whole variety of grounds than to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is important to have the Bill completed and sent to the President for signature but we have the clear suggestion from the Minister that there is no intention of proceeding with indecent haste, or of resisting amendments.  He suggested clearly that it would be unthinkable that the Government should push this through in order to go off on holidays and that the recall of the Dáil would present no obstacle, that even if it did present an obstacle they would suspend the transit of this Bill until the autumn, if there were amendments with which the Minister could agree.  I suggest that the Minister, who is a highly intelligent and sensitive person, will have very little difficulty in agreeing with this <Col N="2193" /> because he is, as Shakespeare wrote of another politician, an honourable man.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 States:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (c), line 17, after &ldquo;specified&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and impose a ban on smoking in all school classrooms, lecture theatres and tutorial rooms, laboratories, gymnasia and libraries, and in similar areas in third level-institutes of education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me as to what his objection is to this or if there are other Senators who object to it, perhaps they will let me know what their objections are.  Is it contemplated that there should be smoking classes or that there should be smoking drill in gymnasia because in order to ascertain the validity of this, one logical test is to invert the proposition and see if it becomes ludicrous? If the Minister does not support this, does he support the contrary or what is his position?</P>
    <P>Again, let me reiterate that the enforcement of this eminently sensible Bill will act as a deterrent in school classrooms where there are students who might be tempted to smoke or, indeed, teachers or lecturers.  People not only in second level but also in third level institutions have been known to smoke and set a bad example in front of their pupils.  The Minister will notice from the array of amendments I have put down, that I can only contemplate the Bill as a sensible skeleton.  I am trying to flesh out this sensible skeleton and give it some muscle, some bite.  It is eminently sensible to include school classrooms, lecture theatres, tutorial rooms and laboratories. After all, is it excessive to suggest that people should not smoke in laboratories where, apart from anything else, one may be exposed to dangerous chemicals, dangerous gases and so on?  What precisely is inhibiting the Minister from accepting this amendment other than the practical difficulties of ramming this legislation through?  If every single amendment is rejected by the Minister people like myself will have only one conclusion to draw and that is that the Minister is the pawn of other more powerful political <Col N="2194" /> figures who are insisting that this legislation must be rushed through because, as I have said, he is an honourable man. If one amendment is rejected it is unfortunate; if two are rejected it is coincidence; if three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and up to 31 amendments are discovered by the Minister to have absolutely no substance, there is something a little strange and the observer of empirical fact would be led to conclude that something untoward was happening not entirely unrelated to the fact that this is the season of political closure.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (e), line 27, after &ldquo;specified&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including public sports halls, swimming pools, and all art centres, galleries and museums open to the public, whether fee-paying or free of charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to a number of professional bodies and interest groups who suggested some of this material to me.  I have simply attempted to interpret what is obviously in the Minister's mind.  If my interpretation is correct how can the Minister possibly disagree with it?  It seems to me that when dealing with sports halls, swimming pools, art centres, galleries, museums open to the public, whether or not they are fee-paying, it would be absurd to exclude by implication from the operation of this Bill precisely these places.</P>
    <P>I want to point out &mdash; and I may come back to this &mdash; that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has himself been made aware of a number of these amendments and has responded to the anti-smoking lobby and the organisations concerned by saying he is considering them.  It would be very remarkable if the Minister was, in fact, considering over 20 amendments put down and found not one of the amendments, which have the support of Senators from all sides of the House, was worthy of inclusion.  I would find that a little difficult to believe, but perhaps I am not sufficiently gullible for my own good.  Amendment No. 17 deals with the question of consumption of <Col N="2195" /> tobacco products in hotels and restaurants. It reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in all hotels and restaurants listed in the Bord Fáilte &lsquo;Dining in Ireland Guide&rsquo;, 1988 and following editions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems that this is again an eminently sane and practicable thing to do, and I would draw the Minister's attention and that of his advisers to the fact that it includes the phrase over which there was some contention this afternoon, &ldquo;prohibit or restrict&rdquo;, so that nobody could come back and say, &ldquo;Well, in the interest of tourism we could not do this&rdquo; because there is sufficient flexibility allowed there for discretion to be exercised so that smoking areas can be provided. However, it also has the objective, and would succeed in my opinion, of giving some degree of bite to the intentions of the Bill.  Again, I would say that the wholesale rejection of all these amendments would lead me to suppose that the Minister and his advisers have been caught up in what was earlier characterised during this debate as a perhaps unconscious desire to undermine the very principle of the legislation itself.  Amendment No. 18 provides:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(g)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in all bookshops, pharmacies, banks, building societies, investment centres, post offices, supermarkets, food stores, department stores and lifts.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again here is a list of places where it would be eminently sensible to implement this kind of legislation.  In other words, here I have taken on board the Minister's own sentiments and given them some reality.  I say to the Minister <Col N="2196" /> that without this kind of specific provisions the legislation is nothing other than wishful thinking.  It remains in the area of a kind of dream landscape where people will be told, &ldquo;Well, it would be much better if you did not smoke and we might have been able to penalise you but we thought on the whole perhaps a little bit of a warning would be better.&rdquo;  I am not going to go through all the different categories, but in bookshops again there is a risk of fire.  Regarding pharmacies, if somebody has a severe asthma attack and goes into a chemist's shop in order to get a prescription for medication for asthma and finds (a) the pharmacist himself or herself smoking like a chimney or (b) other customers smoking like a chimney, it is not going to be a very pleasant, satisfactory, civilised or comfortable experience for that person.  I will leave aside investment centres because I have colleagues who are perhaps better capable of dealing with this.  However, I am glad to say as a socialist that I possess no investments whatever, so I am unaware of the inside of investment centres and perhaps if the capitalists of this society smoke themselves to death we would all be better off.</P>
    <P>In regard to supermarkets, food stores, department stores and lifts, I am not going to exasperate the House by itemising every single one, but out of a feeling of simple logic let me end this matter on lifts.  Can you imagine somebody who was irritated by smoke &mdash; I use &ldquo;irritated&rdquo; in the medical, not the psychological sense &mdash; in other words somebody to whom the smoking of cigarettes causes serious distress, being put into the claustrophic environment of a lift and the lift jamming and the person being stuck there in a partially ventilated space?  It seems to me absurd that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  Amendment No. 19 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(h)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in all places of work, both public and private <Col N="2197" /> sector, where one or more non-smokers request a smoke-free healthy environment at work, under the Health Employment Acts.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I urge this very seriously upon the Minister. He has spoken at great length about the need for people to take precautions against smoking, the dangers of passive smoking, the dangers of passive smoking in confined places, the dangers of passive smoking in the workplace and so on.  Is there any reality behind the Minister's intention if we do not grant to non-smokers the right to work in a non-smoking environment?  That is all this amendment seeks to do.  In other words, it seeks to realise the intention of the Minister which otherwise will remain merely at the level of intention.  I will be very surprised if any cogent reason can be found not to accept his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise not because there is anything to add to what Senator Norris has said but simply to compliment him on the thoroughness of his amendments. I support them all.  I would wish that the Minister would accept them all, but I believe the Minister has a profound obligation to give us a good reason for not accepting them.  I have been in this House long enough to have got to the stage of anticipating non-acceptance rather than acceptance of amendments by members of the Government or representatives of the Government.</P>
      <P>These amendments are all serious attempts.  For instance, it is perfectly sensible of Senator Norris to suggest that it is daft to go to lengths to ban smoking in certain areas and yet in a case where a person is confined in a lift to permit somebody on one side to produce enormous plumes of smoke from a pipe and somebody on the other side to produce equally enormous plumes from a large cigar.  It is absolutely at variance with the entire intent of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only regret is that Senator Norris has not confronted the single greatest area of tobacco consumption in our society, that is the public house.  It is far too easily presumed that because one <Col N="2198" /> enjoys drinking and the ambience of public houses, one must therefore suffer through the offence of having people smoke in one's face.  I cannot understand how somehow in all the thinking and talking about smoking, most of us have to put up with more smoke in public houses than in any other place where we spend sometime or congregate.  It is time that area of air pollution was dealt with.</P>
    <P>I support all the amendments and I commend Senator Norris for introducing them.  I wish them well and I tell the Minister that if his good intentions are to be taken in the least bit seriously he had better have a good, thorough, detailed response to all these, not of the &ldquo;it is not appropriate&rdquo; kind but the reasons he thinks they are not appropriate.  I have had fair experience in the last two days of Ministers pronouncing up on high that things are not appropriate.  Reasons are much more important than Ministers' views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much inclined to support Senator Norris's amendments. I agree with the thrust of them and I think we should make this Bill as strong as possible.  Let me suggest the amendments are rather aspirational at this point because the Minister will have the powers under section 2 to make whatever regulation he sees fit.  It is right that these proposals should be put at this point and suggestions made as to what Members feel about the matter.  Given that these regulations under section 10 cannot be put into force until they are passed by both Houses, and that cannot happen until after the Dáil and Seanad recess, it would be more appropriate if we had the present debate when the regulations are before us.  This would suggest that there is no great urgency about ensuring that none of the amendments are taken tonight.  The Bill will not be much good until the regulations are made and passed.  Therefore, while it would be desirable if these amendments were agreed to, it will not be so bad if they are not, because we can debate them when the regulations are before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendments put down by Senator Norris, I suspect he has been in contact with the Irish Association of Non-Smokers and that they have put forward some very useful suggestions.  We have been in communication with that group about this legislation and other tobacco-related legislation, and they have been very helpful. I know Senator Norris has direct contact with that association through the chairman.</P>
      <P>In dealing with amendments Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 to section 1, the points made by Senator Norris may be covered in regulations and the points he is putting forward will be considered in that context.  I do not propose to accept any of these amendments.  Senator Norris's amendments are of a very specific nature, and many of his suggestions can be implemented under the provisions of section 2 (1) of the Bill which empowers the Minister to restrict or prohibit the consumption of tobacco products in any area or facility so designated by him. Section 2 (2) specifies particular priority areas in all or part of which the Minister would intend to implement smoking controls. It is not necessary, therefore, to be as specific as Senator Norris proposes in his amendments Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19, but nevertheless the points put forward by Senators Norris, Fennell and Ryan will be taken on board in relation to the regulations.  There is no need whatsoever to go through the specific details in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I dealt already with taxis.  They are not controlled specifically under the Bill. Taxis are normally used singly or are voluntarily shared by friends who can easily agree a common attitude towards smoking in this facility.  I am heartened to note that many taxi drivers do not allow smoking in their vehicles and this is a further example of how a non-smoking climate is evolving in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned private bus companies in amendment No. 5.  The Bill as drafted in section 1 enables the Minister to control smoking in all buses which have a seating capacity for more than eight persons, irrespective of whether <Col N="2200" /> they are privately owned or owned by a State company.  Airport lounges and bus stations may be controlled to the extent that section 2(d) of the Bill applies.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 11 proposed by Senator Norris in relation to hospital wards and waiting rooms, I would like to point out that the definition of &ldquo;health premises&rdquo; included in section 1 of the Bill is specifically drafted to encompass all premises in which public health services of any kind are provided. The specific nature of smoking control in particular types of health premises will be determined by regulations.  Senator Norris's amendment is in relation to hospitals only, but there are other health premises as well.  We are very conscious of that.  We will draw up regulations which will be acceptable in a sense but also enforceable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 2(c) of the Bill allow the Minister to control smoking in first and second level schools.  These provisions are intended to protect the health of students and staff from passive smoking but, more importantly, to ensure exemplary behaviour in school and to impress on school children that non-smoking is the majority adult behaviour. Senator Norris's amendment would extend these controls to third level institutions. The Minister did not include third level institutions as priority areas for smoking control for a variety of reasons. First, these institutions are used by adults and are not normally confined to classroom-type situations.  In addition, it is likely that enforcement would arise in relation to smoking in common areas, restaurants, etc, in third level institutions, and the Minister does not feel it desirable to impose smoking control in areas where there is likely to be little public support.</P>
    <P>Senators who have not been as close to the development of smoking control as we have been in the Department of Health may not appreciate the stategies and inherent difficulties involved in attempting to change behaviour to improve the environment in this area. The position of third level institutions <Col N="2201" /> is an example of how we must proceed gradually.</P>
    <P>In summary, we will bear in mind the amendments put down by Senator Norris in relation to the regulations.  I wonder if the Senator will be looking for a job in the Department of Health when we are drawing up those regulations because he has such specific detailed submissions in relation to this matter.  I assure him that we will bear what he said in mind.  It is difficult to draw up regulations to encompass all types of buildings, but we have a list of priorities that we will take on board as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to accept any additional employment, if it carries a degree of remuneration.  I accept a certain amount of what the Minister said and take it on trust.  However, he can scarcely expect me, being a logical person, to accept what he said in regard to the question of taxis because he has already given the game away.  The Minister has already said there is absolutely no intention to govern this by regulation. This is clearly a situation in which I could not accept what the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Irish Association of Non-Smokers also took a similar attitude. I understood this from a letter the Minister was quoting, dated 8 June 1988, signed by a private secretary on behalf of the Minister for Health, dealing with the question of taxis.  He said, and the Minister quoted, that they are not controlled specifically under the Bill because it is felt that they are normally used singly or are shared by friends who can easily agree a common attitude towards smoking in this facility.  The Minister must be very lucky in his friends, or else has a very idealistic understanding of the nature of friendship, particularly post 11 p.m. Serious altercations have been known to break out between persons on this score. I do not believe it should be left to a capricous and tenuous nature of friendship to determine this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas I would be prepared to accept what the Minister says with regard to some of the other amendments, and I am very grateful to him for having indicated <Col N="2202" /> that these matters will be looked at seriously when the time comes to draw up the regulations, it would be scarcely logical of me to accept as a blanket guide the fact that regulations will have to be drawn up, when the Minister said he had no intention of drawing up anything approaching the kind of regulation I am seeking on the advice of the Irish Association of Non-Smokers with regard taxi-cabs which is covered in amendment No. 5.  How could I logically be expected to be happy with the fact that the Minister has said: &ldquo;No, thank you.  We are not going to accept this and, furthermore, we are not going to include it in the regulations.  Theoretically we could if we felt like it, but we do not feel like it&rdquo;.  He blows me a very polite raspberry and expects me to sit down and be content.  I will sit down but I will not be content, and I will be calling for a vote.</P>

I now find that not only are those pupils outside the State system but they are also outside the parameters of this Bill.  The Minister has identified for us which schools will be covered by the Bill and the position is that private schools are excluded.  I see no reason, no argument and certainly no case for excluding private schools from the definition of &ldquo;school&rdquo; in section 1 of this Bill.  I could not see how anybody could support that section of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches as I now believe that the Minister is trying to develop an argument against my point of view.  The Minister <Col N="2204" /> has confirmed my interpretation of the definition of &ldquo;school&rdquo; in that section of the Bill.  This means that the other schools are excluded and therefore there is a small proportion of primary school pupils who are going to be subjected to the worst abuses of smoking and passive smoking.  I put it to the Minister that this point alone is enough to justify rejecting this legislation.  Earlier we talked about the rights of minorities and the need to support smaller groups.  I think that the parents who are unwise to sent their children to private schools, and some of my colleagues would fall into that category, are still deserving of our support.  For that reason I could not support this section of the Bill.  Now that I have drawn the attention of the Minister to a weakness in the Bill I am sure he will accept my point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the education of one's children, for parents, is a constitutional right.  There are some parents in this country who choose &mdash; whether wisely or unwisely is a matter for their own judgment &mdash; to have their children educated in private preparatory schools outside the State system.  By so doing they must be made aware that their children will not have routine health inspections, dental inspections, and optical inspections and they are disadvantaged to that extent, but presumably parents who opt for this system are aware of that and make their choices accordingly.  I dare say that they in many instances have more of an input into the actual structures of those schools and the rules and regulations operating within those schools than parents of pupils who attend schools within the State system who do not have the same democratic rights and who have to withstand many things that they might be unhappy about.  However, I am <Col N="2205" /> unhappy about this debate about the regulations and the nitty gritty that we are getting down to.  I welcome the Bill and I support what the Minister is attempting to achieve.  I think this is very important, substantive and seminal legislation.</P>
      <P>What we are doing now is actually having a debate on the regulations.  We will in time be able to have a debate on the regulations and all of these amendments can quite properly be discussed in that context.  I feel that in a way we are to some extent abusing the privilege in this House by having this kind of detailed discussion on the Bill rather than in the context of the regulations where I feel it more properly belongs.  I ask my colleagues who have put down so many amendments which properly apply to the regulations to perhaps consider what I am saying because I feel that the point I make is absolutely valid.</P>

The Senator has been here throughout the entire debate and must know that what she says is palpable nonsense.  I stand over the use of the word &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nonsense&rdquo; means it is not sense.  It is not sense to maintain, as Senator Bulbulia has, that the proper place for discussion of this is when the regulations are discussed and debated.  The Minister has very clearly indicated that it is not the intention of the Government to incorporate this section or its purpose into the regulations, so now is the time to fire the first shot if we are at all serious.  I would like to know do we have an Opposition in this House, apart from the six Independent Senators, or do we have a collaboration of comfortable intellectual sloths?  It seems that that is what we have. I must say that I indicated to the Minister that I will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, the practical outcome of this remains the same and that is that having indicated that I would take on board the Minister's goodwill and assurance of good intentions with regard to some of the regulations, I cannot possibly be expected to take with any degree of comfort the Minister's perfectly clear statement that there is no intention whatever of including this in the regulations.  I do not know what it seems like.  Can I say it seems like nonsense?  It seems like nonsense to me and I will be calling a vote on it.</P>

      <P>There is a certain dilettante quality creeping into all of this. Much as I enjoy Senator Norris's verbal meanderings which are skillful, witty and entertaining, I hope he will accept the bona fides of the Fine Gael group as I accept his bona fides and his very genuine concern about this legislation.  There is a rigorous parliamentary Opposition to this legislation.  I would also advert to the fact that both Senator Nuala Fennell, our spokesperson on health, and I, have opposed from within, so to speak, certain amendments coming before this House because we sincerely believe in them and have adopted a very principled approach. <Col N="2207" /> I would be far happier if Senator Norris chose to recognise that fact rather than indicating that he felt that there was not a proper parliamentary Opposition.  What we are doing is probably far more difficult to do than to merely oppose for opposition sake.  We cannot necessarily have the same indulgent attitude towards legislation as some Independents.  I still hold that the debate we are having more properly belongs to the regulations.  I hope the Minister will take on board the very fine and detailed argument which is taking place during the course of debate on the amendments and also take on board some of the points that are very seriously, being made out of concern and out of a wish to see this legislation being effective, strong and intelligent and reflecting the realities of health and the research that has gone into the background of this Bill.</P>

I am very grateful to him for several reasons and for personal reasons I do not want to go into, but it is extraordinary that private schools should be discriminated against in this Bill.  It is not the sort of thing you look for in a Bill because you look for quite the opposite.  That is quite a worry now because my children are at private school, the same private school as Senator Bulbulia's children are at, and I have developed a concern not only for my own children but for Senator Bulbulia's children as a result of this Bill.</P>

That is the reason these amendments will not be <Col N="2208" /> accepted and that is the reason we should call a vote on every amendment here tonight because we are going through some absurd motions.

I feel there is no personal confrontation between either myself and the Cathaoirleach or myself and the Minister, but I would have to say in reply to Senator Haughey that the reason I am sticking at this point is very clear and I think it is legitimate.  It is that, within this section is contained amendment No. 5, and the Minister has very clearly indicated that it will not be the intention of the Government to include this amendment or anything resembling it in the regulations. Now is clearly the time to discuss it.  As an earnest of the fact that I am not obstructive or difficult, I will resist the temptation to call for the protection of the Chair when language describing me as being indulgent, meandering and dilettante is used which I could I am sure <Col N="2210" /> claim was as unparliamentary as the word sloth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to allay the fear of Senator O'Toole because all schools are recognised and grant-aided by the Minister for Education.  They are all recognised. The point made was completely unnecessary.  Some schools may be outside the system such as Montessori teaching at the junior cycle.  It may allay the fears of Senators to know that under section 2 (1) of the Bill the residue of the private schools can be brought in under regulations.  The so-called private schools and the public schools are covered by the Bill.  The regulations applicable to this Bill will apply to all.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross said we cannot accept amendments.  We have no objection to including amendments which we feel are right.  We have amended many Bills here in the Seanad over the past 12 months and we will do so again.  There is a technical problem, as the Senators are aware, in relation to the Lower House.  Nevertheless if it would make this Bill better, we would accept an amendment.  It would entail delaying the Bill but if it made the Bill better it would be better to delay it for three months than to bring a defective Bill before this House.</P>
      <P>We will be designating the schools and we will nominate them.  There is no difference between private and public schools in this regard.  There are a few schools like the Montessori schools which are not inside the system but we can cover them under section 2 (1) if so desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but not only can I not accept the Minister's reply, but it is incorrect.  The Minister said that the Minister for Education recognises all schools whether they be private or otherwise. First, that is not true.  Second, it is irrelevant because what the section says is &ldquo;recognised and grant aided.&rdquo;  It is certain that not all primary schools are grant-aided.  I can give the Minister a list from the top of my head of three or four of those schools immediately.  Similarly our inspectors do not recognise or visit <Col N="2211" /> them and it goes on and on.  The schools are not recognised.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister at least would say that he accepts the point I have made because I went to the trouble of asking him at the beginning what kind of schools were covered by the section and he told me very clearly what those schools were. I then identified for him those schools which were not covered by the section. Having identified them, the Minister now stands up and tells me that they are covered anyway.  At one stage or other the Minister must have been misleading me.  Before I go on to talk about private hospitals covered under health premises &mdash; which is an even more difficult area to deal with &mdash; I now want to get a very clear answer on that point.</P>
      <P>I also want to refer to a number of other issues which have arisen so far in the debate.  I did not raise the difference between private education and public education.  I asked for an interpretation of what was written in this Bill, when it says &ldquo;school&rdquo; means etc.  Having been told that, I then pointed out that there were other pupils who did not attend schools covered by the definition and, therefore, were not covered by the Bill. For that reason I felt it was important to raise the point.  I do not challenge the constitutional right of parents to educate pupils as they wish.  I recognise that schools are there <i>in loco parentis</i> and I accept that parents have the right to send their children to schools of whichever type they want, so that is not an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise the question of regulations. I took the troulbe here last week to discuss with the officials the question of how regulations are presented and dealt with by this House.  It is not relevant to discuss the regulation in regard to restaurants at this stage.  However, I went to some trouble to work out the procedure involved.  It was made clear to me that the regulations are presented for acceptance or rejection to the House and not for amendment.  Therefore, when regulations are presented we vote for or against them and they are accepted or lost on the basis of that vote.  One could <Col N="2212" /> have a minor objection to one provision in the regulations but it would not be possible to have them amended.</P>

I do not want the Senator to get upset about that statement.  I accept that he has a soft spot for that topic, as I have, but a debate on education cannot be permitted now.  The Senator should confine his remarks to the amendment under discussion.</P>

      <P>That is reasonable.  If the points I have made are not clear I should like the permission of the Chair to expand on them.  The first point I should like to raise is the interpretation by the Minister of the schools recognised in the Bill.  I pointed out to the Minister the schools that are not covered in it. When the question of regulations was raised the Minister told the House that they will not deal with the interpretation of section 1.  It is important to point out that those regulations cannot be changed by the House and that the only way we can have any impact on this flaw in the legislation is by rejecting or changing section 1.  That is logical, simple and straightforward and the Minister has not said anything that will cover the points I have made.</P>

      <P>Section 1, which deals with regulations, outlines the power of the <Col N="2213" /> Minister under section 2 to designate any building or otherwise as being an area in which the consumption of tobacco products is either prohibited or restricted.  The Minister has said that he intends to make regulations in areas where they were enforceable.  He expressed the view, one that I share, that he could not enforce a regulation that would deal with taxis available for hire by the public.  People have certain rights and a taxi-man has rights.  He can refuse to allow smokers into his car and a non-smoker can refuse to sit in a taxi if the driver is smoking. We are talking about the freedom of the individual to choose.  I accept that that may cause some problems and may mean that people will have to run up and down a taxi rank inspecting the vehicles but I do not think we can insist on the regulations specifying taxis used by the public.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has raised a valid point in regard to schools.  A school is defined as follows, &ldquo;as the context may require, a first level school (including a special school), or a second level school, which is recognised and grant-aided by the Minister for Education&rdquo;.  The Minister of State has told us that the regulations will apply to grant-aided schools and those which are recognised by the Minister for Education but Senator O'Toole asked if a private school that is not grant-aided will be covered by the regulations.  I understood the Minister to say that he will have power under section 2 to extend the regulations to a private schools if he accepts Deputy O'Toole's point as valid.  I do not see anything argumentative about that and we should not be running off on tangents.  The Minister has satisfied me that he can include any area, a private school, a public school, an aircraft or a taxi in the regulations. However, he was honest in telling us that he would not include taxis because it would not be possible to enforce regulations in regard to them.  He pointed out that health board officials or gardaí could not patrol taxi ranks at night to ensure that the regulations were enforced.  That is the position or are we living in a different world?</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Senator Ferris is of the opinion that taxi cabs cannot be subject to the law on this matter.  They are already subject to a licensing authority and in other jurisdictions the regulations we are suggesting apply and are observed.  I hope that disposes, effectively, of Senator Ferris's reservations in regard to the amendment.  I do not see the direct relevance of introducing this notion of a health inspector. Such an official is not necessary for the implementation of the law.  I hope I am not wandering too far outside the scope of the debate and that I am allowed, because of the intellectual justification and irrefutable logic of this, to point out that another amendment has been tabled to cover this.  A member of the public could register such a complaint at a secondary level with the authority involved.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the very cogently argued case put forward by Senator O'Toole has illuminated an area that I did not see.  There are two joined ideas in the phrase and I am not sure that they are legally separable.  I am referring to the phrase, schools which are recognised and grant-aided by the Minister.  Will the Minister give us a legally advised reading of that phrase?  Is it necessary to incorporate both considerations, as seems logical? I note the Minister is nodding.  If what I have said is correct, then Senator O'Toole has proved his case and, apart from the other matters, this has made this evening a valuable exercise in illuminating a potential area of difficulty in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a genuine drafting difficulty in regard to this.  It appears from a reading of the section that Senator O'Toole has made a valid point in that private preparatory schools which are not State-aided and are not recognised cannot, despite the Minister's good intentions, be covered by the legislation. I know the Minister would wish to give something at this stage because there has been very little give on his part today.  He has displayed endless patience and a great understanding of the views put forward <Col N="2215" /> by Senators but there has been no capitulation or agreement by him.  I imagine it was in an effort to make progress that he indicated he could make the regulations apply to the very few private preparatory, Montessori or Froebel schools which exist here.  I do not see how the Minister can make his rules or regulations apply in the private sector, a sector of education which does not have any State involvement and is not the recipient of public health visitations like State primary schools.  They do not receive any subvention of teachers' salaries or grants.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can say he wishes this legislation to apply.  I expect that it will apply anyway but it will be largely due to the goodwill of those who operate these schools rather than by legislation or regulation.  Those who drafted this section of the Bill overlooked the existence of this small number of schools. A very valid point has been raised by Senator O'Toole.  Obviously one would wish that, under legislation, all children would be excluded from any risk from passive smoking but I do not see how it can be done given the existence of these schools where the State has no remit whatsoever.</P>

I sincerely believed that when the regulations for this Bill came before us we would have the opportunity to propose changes and I regret we cannot do so.  I think it is wrong.  Regulations as important as they should be open to scrutiny and the Minister should be open to proposals or amendments.  One must question why we have a debate on them at all if they are going to be rubber-stamped anyway.  I feel very strongly about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Norris's amendment No. 5 in that taxi cabs should be included. I say this very forcibly in view of the fact that we will have to accept what is in the regulations.  Very few people travel long journeys in a taxi cab.  The journeys are usually short.  I do not think it would <Col N="2216" /> impose any stress on people to have to abstain from smoking while in a taxi.  I support this amendment and I hope the Minister will take it on board when the regulations are being drafted.</P>

      <P>In regard to the educational position, I want to make it clear that the draft has the approval of the Department of Education.  The actual detail of the schools involved could be best defined in legislation.  We should bear in mind that it will be much easier to enforce this legislation when the inspectorate of the Department of Education is involved.  The majority of fee paying private schools are grant-aided by the Minister for Education and are, therefore, State controlled schools.  For the information of Senators, I want to make it clear that the actual detail in this Bill was approved by the Department of Education as the best way to describe the schools involved.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has made the point that quite a number of schools do not recieve any support from the State but are totally private first level schools.  In drafting this legislation we had to define a school.  A school means, as the context may require, a first level school including a special school or a second level school which is recognised and grant-aided by the Minister for Education.  That drafting was approved by the Department of Education and there is no reason for any great concern about it.  Approximately 99 per cent of the schools are in this category. We can bring in the regulations for those schools and in time, after the enactment of this legislation, we will have power to bring in regulations in relation to other private schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have power to include taxis in the regulations, as Senator Ferris rightly said, but I do not think it would be appropriate at this stage.  We have to take this legislation step by step.  We will introduce the regulations as a matter of urgency and in time we can add to them to cover other public buildings, vehicles and so on. Quite an amount of consultation, with airline companies and so on, is involved in relation to how best the regulations <Col N="2217" /> will be enforced.  We want to see these regulations enforced.  We do not want to bring forward any regulation that is unenforceable.  All those considerations must be borne in mind.  I want to assure Senators that the points raised by them will be taken on board when my Department are preparing the regulations under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Senator O'Toole and other Senators in relation to private schools outside the so-called State support system will also be considered when drafting the regulations under this Bill.  I hope I have clarified this matter.  I want to thank Senators for raising the issue for clarification purposes.  That is the advice I would give them in relation to the definition of schools in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification of the matter.  I find his final reply more acceptable than the earlier one in which he tried to explain that section 2 (1) could have dealt with the matter but does not do so.  Section 2 (1)  could in no way be extended to include primary schools.  I have no doubt that these regulations were approved by the Department of Education.  In the Minister's own words, they were approved by the Department of Education for the schools involved.  I was not worried about the schools involved. We have been through all that before.  It is the schools that are not involved and that we have now identified quite clearly that I am concerned about.  We have not progressed in any direction.  We have identified a problem and accepted that the subsection does not cover these pupils.  The latest statistical report from the Department of Education, which unfortunately is two years old, gives a figure of close to 5 per cent of pupils attending private primary education and these pupils are not covered by this legislation. It would be remiss of me as a legislator, and in a sense it would be an abrogation of my responsibility to ensure that we have proper legislation if I were to accept this section.  It would be impossible for me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> What saddens me somewhat is that I know the Minister agrees with me.  I have much respect for the Minister and he has made a very clear and concise point.  It would be more appropriate, if the Minister finds it impossible to accept the rejection of this section, that we should perhaps stop the debate on the Bill at this point and come back in the next session with a redrafted section 1.  Otherwise, we will deal properly with this problem.  It would be irresponsible of us to pass this section.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of private hospitals.  Health premises are referred to under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970. Are there hospital or clinics which are not covered by that legislation?  I hope the Minister accepts that there is a serious flaw in section 1 as it deals with schools. It could not possibly be acceptable to this House.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole.  He has done the House a very valuable service by extending to us his insight into this crux in drafting.  One of the most valuable things this House can do is to illuminate an area where there may be a possible legal difficulty and he has very clearly done that.  I welcome the very slight degree of movement the Minister has displayed with regard to the question of taxi cabs.  Without being pestilential, I believe this is precisely one of the points in this form of parliamentary procedure &mdash; you simply come back to your point, attempt to expand it and illuminate it so that eventually pressure is applied of such a nature that a small degree of movement become visible. That small degree of movement has now become visible and apparently it has been gathering support from within the Opposition benches, which it did not have earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this in the most positive way possible to my distinguished colleagues because they will agree that initially they believed this was not the appropriate time to discuss it.  They have <Col N="2219" /> now put on the record that they are convinced that it may well be because of the impossibility of amending, in any substantial way, the regulations.  This was the method the Minister used to fob us off, despite the fact that he indicated he did not intend including this material in the amendments.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, tedious as it may be, that this process is useful because it is part of the parliamentary method of exerting pressure in order to achieve some degree of change.  Unfortunately, the level of alteration in the Minister's attitude, gratifying though it is, is not sufficient to fob me off.  In addition to the points I have made, the points so ably illuminated by Senator O'Toole have convinced me that we would be failing in our duty if we did not attempt to have this section of the Bill withdrawn.  I should like to join my voice to that of Senator O'Toole and say that I believe that because of the consistent series of defects that have been revealed in the Bill the proper thing to do is to send it back to the parliamentary draftsman and require him to incorporate the amendments recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering which way I was going to vote on this issue and surprisingly enough I have been convinced by the arguments put up by Senator Bulbulia, Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris.  It is absolutely evident from what we have discussed here that this is an extremely valuable exercise and that the Minister, with the best will in the world, has actually changed his ground. First, he told us that this covered all schools but then he said that it covered 95 per cent or 99 per cent of schools. This is unacceptable.  It is an obvious and classic case for redrafting and the Minister should come back to us in the autumn and tell us what this really means. It is not good enough that these Bills should be rushed through the House because it is summer.  Senator O'Toole raised a very important point, maybe late in the session and maybe late in the day. Under scrutiny and examination a flaw <Col N="2220" /> has been found in this Bill.  That is why we are here and that is why this section should either be taken back, withdrawn by the Government or defeated by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that there was no crux in the drafting of this Bill.  I have no intention whatsoever of deferring this Bill until the autumn because it is a crucial Bill and the lives of young people are at stake.  It is crucial that this Bill be brought forward as quickly as possible and the regulations brought in to protect the health of young people who are affected and the nonsmokers, or so-called passive smokers, who will benefit under this Bill.  We should all co-operate to ensure that the Bill goes through the House as quickly as possible and the regulations drafted.</P>
      <P>Senators can bring up as many so-called difficulties as they want but I want to make it quite clear that all the points they raised are covered in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill will give the Minister the power to designate those areas.  I will not go through section 1 again in detail except to say that &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as &ldquo;...a place or building specified in regulations made under section 2 of this Act as being an area in which the consumption of tobacco products is either prohibited or restricted; ...&rdquo; Senator Ferris put his finger on this throughout the debate.  That provision gives us an immense amount of power in relation to the regulations.  I cannot gives the precise percentage of schools &mdash; and I will not go into that area here &mdash; but the majority of schools are covered directly under the section referred to.  Ninety-nine per cent of health premises are covered and other premises in the educational and health areas are covered under section 2 (1) of this Bill.  We have covered every possible area and avenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are arguing on the specifics of the enabling legislation.  The Bill has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman to deal first, with specific priority areas and, second, with other areas.  I have <Col N="2221" /> listened to the points raised here in the discussion on the Bill and I welcome these because they have clarified certain points in relation to the powers the Minister will have under the Bill.  The regulations will be put before both Houses of the Oireachtas and if, within 21 days, there are objections to those they can be rejected by both Houses.  I am anxious to get this Bill through but if there is an area which could cause some difficulty in the enforcement of the Bill, it will be my responsibility to ensure that such an amendment will be taken on board. However, I have not been so convinced. There is no crux.  The Bill covers the points raised by the Senators.  We should get on with the business of getting this Bill through so that we can get on with the regulations.</P>

      <P>I want to say at this stage that if the Senators want to refer to the last reply of the Minister and query a point that is all right but I ask Senators not to be repetitive if they can help it.  They have given the Bill a good airing and if they wish to raise a point on the Minister's last statement the Chair will allow that. Senators have been very good in teasing out this Bill and they have done it very well.  Inasmuch as the Minister wishes to get the Bill through &mdash; as I am sure most Senators do so that they can go on their summer holidays &mdash; it is imperative that the Bills which come before this House are teased out, as Senators are doing with this Bill this evening, but I ask them to refrain from repetition.  If Senator O'Toole or any other Senator has something to ask the Minister on his last statement I will allow that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to what the Minister raised in his reply.  I also want to state for the record, lest there be any misunderstanding, that whatever rush I might be in to take my summer holidays I would not go on holidays if I thought there was unfinished <Col N="2222" /> business in the sense of improper or unacceptable legislation.  I am sure the Chair will agree with me on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only do I understand that point a Chathaoirligh but because I understand it &mdash; and you may not have been in the Chair when I said this to the Minister for other reasons, but which would also cover this point &mdash; I believe that rather than going through bad legislation we should not deal with it further now but we should deal with it in the next session.  Unfortunately, the Minister said he would not do that.  I would be prepared to accommodate you, a Chathaoirligh, if you are proposing that we should leave this legislation and come back to a redrafted version of section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a proposal from me and a suggestion from you, a Chathaoirligh, to the Minister and we will wait and see how he responds to it.</P>
      <P>On the precise point of the Minister's reply, he said that this legislation dealt with the issue.  That is unfair, incorrect and misleading.  I would prefer the Minister to stand up and say, &ldquo;this covers 96, 97 or 98 per cent of schools and pupils and, therefore, I want to get it through.&rdquo; That, at least, would be honest and I would accept it.  It is not true to say that this Bill, by regulation or otherwise, can cover the schools I have identified.  I want to spell out the reasons for this, with some brevity.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1), which the Minister referred to earlier, refers to regulations in designated areas or facilities.  We are discussing section 1, under which designated areas and facilities are defined. &ldquo;Designated area&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a place or building specified in regulations made under section 2...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of my rising this evening was to have the Minister identify the <Col N="2223" /> place or building which he kindly did and confirmed that there was an anomoly in this part of the Bill.  Having done that, I thought we had agreed on the issue.  The best possible way to deal with this matter would be for the Minister to say: all right, this needs to be changed; it does not cover all schools; it covers those schools which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education.  It is not true to say that the provisions of the Bill cover private primary schools.  For that reason I cannot accept the section.  We can remain here until tomorrow morning.  Words, as they are written down in legislation, are open to interpretation.  They should not mean what a Minister or anybody else would wish them to mean.  I wish they meant all the things the Minister maintains with regard to all schools but, unfortunately, they do not and, because they do not, we cannot accept the section. Since we cannot accept it, we must argue against it.  If our arguments are not accepted we have a duty to vote against it.  It is as simple and clear as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this question of summer holidays that you yourself, Sir, raised, a number of us have spent the entire day here in the rather stuffy confines of Leinster House.  I do not think we have done so for any frivolous reason.  I am quite sure that the Minister &mdash; despite the fact that he has displayed enormous patience and forbearance &mdash; and you yourself, Sir, do appreciate that none of us is here simply to play games.  There are serious points to be teased out, sometimes levelled with humour.  But, in the course of a long day, that can be a useful method of relieving tension.  If it is not, if it irritates people, then in respect of any small contribution I might have made to that, I apologise. But I should say that my contribution is made despite the fact that today I should have much preferred to have been out in the open air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the points made by Senator Joe O'Toole very convincing.  I will leave it at that.  But I should like to comment on the Minister's attitude because two kinds <Col N="2224" /> of pressure are being brought to bear on us.  Of course, from the Minister's point of view, it is perfectly legitimate to do so &mdash; and he did so in the course of his last statement.  One is to reiterate his concern, which I believe to be genuine, for the health of young people and to say it is important that this Bill be passed. However, basically what he is saying there is, that half a loaf is better than no bread.  At the end of the day we have to accept that half a loaf to the starving probably is better than no bread but it is clear, from the protracted discussions here and from what I must say I accept are cruxes in the Bill, that it is half a loaf only.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final comment, which is that it is unfortunate that a number of people have criticised the attention being paid to linguistic detail.  I should like to place on the record of this House that language is the instrument through which legislation becomes manifest; there is no question about that. Therefore, the minute examination of language is a very appropriate part of parliamentary responsibility.  I make, and will make, no apology to persons in this House or outside it for exercising my responsibilities to bring my special expertise &mdash; which is in linguistic analysis &mdash; to bear on the legislation.  Whereas it may sometimes be tedious, occasionally interpreted as being frivolous, there is a serious intent behind it.  I would remind the House that the Seanad was specifically established as a vocational Chamber which would bring to bear on legislation the very specialised talents represented by different professions and groups within society.  Therefore, it is appropriate that we should do so in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to adhere to my interpretation of the language used in the section.  We are opposed to the section for different reasons.  I contend it is all-embracing, giving the Minister power to designate, say, private schools, nursing homes, whatever.  Again I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that in this section &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; is defined as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" />&ldquo;designated area&rdquo; means a place or building specified in regulations made under section 2 of this Act as being an area in which the consumption of tobacco is either prohibited or restricted;</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, either prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in a designated area or a designated facility.</P>
    <P>All of the other subsections of that section are without prejudice to the generality of that section.  Therefore it is possible that the Minister can so designate any place he likes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, &ldquo;designated facility&rdquo;&mdash; in section 1 &mdash; is said to mean:</P>
    <P>an aircraft, train, public service vehicle or other facility which is used by the public...</P>
    <P>That can be a private facility such as a taxi, or a private building, a school, or a private nursing home which is not grant-aided under the provisions of the 1970 Act.  There are some private nursing homes that do not receive any bed subvention or grant of any kind.</P>
    <P>I might point out that, in the provisions laid down in the next section, these regulations will have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as maybe thereafter and annulled within 21 sitting days.  Therefore, rushing through this Bill will not bring the relevant regulations into being any quicker than when the Dáil reconvenes.  I want to be absolutely fair to my colleagues and say that, rather than rush through legislation with which they are unhappy, there will be no time lost by sending the Bill back for further examination because of the 21 sitting says' stipulation.  Even if the regulations have been prepared and are ready now it will be Christmas before they are passed by the other House.  For that reason it is no advantage whatsoever to the Minister to have the legislation passed and signed by the President.  We could still have the ban on those obnoxious weeds in being before Christmas, when <Col N="2226" /> people would no longer be able to exchange seasonal presents in the form of cigarettes or cigars.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are now all enveloped by a cloud of smoke on this issue.  Like Senator Norris I have been here all day also.  It would appear we are now attempting to rush through a Bill when there is no need to do so.  If my colleagues want to call a vote on it, I shall be voting with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if Senator Ferris is right because he made a very important point.  I have to admit that I was completely ignorant of the point he made with regard to timing. If that is correct, the Minister is completely wrong about having this Bill passed as quickly as possible and enabling enforcement of its provision throughout the summer, which is what he was saying. It would be very interesting to know if that is correct.  Is it true that the regulations cannot come into effect, and therefore the legislation cannot come into effect, until October-November. Could the Minister clarify that for us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inclined to let my case rest in relation to the section.  In fact Senators are now dealing with the regulations referred to in section 10.  I do not know whether I should go into detail on that section at this stage.  In order to allay Senators' fears I should say that, if and when this Bill is passed, the regulations must then be drafted, which takes time, and they cannot be drafted until the legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>You will appreciate that the sooner the legislation goes through, the sooner the regulations can be prepared.  They have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  If a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which the House has sat after the regulations are laid before it, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, what it means is that we <Col N="2227" /> could publish the regulations, say, in August and they would be in operation and within 21 sitting days after resumption in October, they could be annulled at that stage.  It is important that we get the Bill through so we can have our regulations prepared and published.  If within 21 days after the Oireachtas resumes they are annulled, so be it.  This is covered in section 10 of the Bill.  It is standard practice in relation to all regulations.  I would like to get on with the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has got a reasonable airing in this House and most of the problems associated with the Bill have been aired.  This is a health promotion <Col N="2231" /> and protection Bill and everybody has had an opportunity to put every point that it was possible to have made on this Bill.  I propose at this stage that, &ldquo;notwithstanding Standing Orders, the Committee and remaining Stages of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Bill, 1988, be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. by the putting of one question by the Chair.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply unhappy about a suggestion that we should in some way diminish the function of this House and decline to give this legislation the thorough examination and fine combing which it warrants.  I do not know if the Leader of the House was present during the painstaking debate which has taken place to date.  If he was, he would see that not every aspect of this Bill has as yet been addressed by Senators.  The attendance at this debate is particularly good.  The contributions are thoughtful. People are genuinely concerned and wish this Bill well and want to see that every aspect of it is held up to rigorous examation. As such, I ask the Leader of the House to think again about his proposal which we on this side find quite unacceptable and which we will oppose if it is put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If we continue at the pace we were going we would probably be finished by 11 p.m. anyway.  I think it is unnecessary to put the question as it is being put now.  Perhaps the Leader of the house would have patience until about 10.55 p.m. and then see if he still considers it necessary to put the question.  A lot of the debate has already taken place on all these amendments and they will not be debated again.  It will be a question of whether they are withdrawn or not. In the interests of continuing the same atmosphere we had the whole afternoon I suggest that the Leader of the House should wait for a later period before he actually puts the guillotine motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the <Col N="2232" /> impatience of the Leader of the House and his anxiety to get this business concluded but I would point out that we have dealt in great detail with a considerable number of amendments and I think we have produced material the Minister and his advisers have found useful.  That is the function of the House.  There are nine amendments remaining.  I think virtually all, if not all, are in my name and as a public representative I would seriously resent and would certainly resist an attempt to guillotine debate on what everybody here agrees and shows by their attendance is a most important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely amazed.  I do not know what the Leader of the House thinks are the functions of this House. We have debated this matter fairly constructively for the past two hours that I have been here and for a long time before that.  I think the Minister has given plenty of evidence that this debate has at least been constructive, and that the suggestions he has received will be listened to and possibly complied with.  It seems to me that there must be some other reason why there is an attempt to curtail the debate on this particular issue.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House has given absolutely no reason whatsoever for his proposal.  It is possibly the worst motion that has come before the House in my time here, to curtail discussion on a Bill for a reason which to me is not the real reason given to the House.  It is absolutely untrue that it is being given full and frank discussion.  It is a very dangerous precedent, that because the Leader of the House and maybe some other Members of this House do not particularly like being here at this time of night and want to finish this and other Bills that we should finish and not discuss certain sections in this Bill.  It is quite outrageous and I am deadly serious about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it may be uncomfortable for those who are not interested in this Bill to be here but that is why they are elected to this House and that is exactly why they should be here.  I am sorry if they are being kept late and I am sorry if they are being kept late by the Independent <Col N="2233" /> group, but they should not be in this House if they want to go to bed early, or if they want to get away, or if they simply want to discuss something else tomorrow or if it does not suit the Government's timetable.  This is possibly what is happening: that discussion on this Bill does not really suit the Government's timetable. It has taken longer than they expected.  That is not something which we should comply with.  It is a very dangerous precedent and I strongly oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine amendments left to be dealt with and they are in three different groups.  I think it would be appropriate that all amendments could be discussed.  I do not know the reasons why the Leader of the House is proposing this motion at this time.  I feel that a more appropriate motion would be that all the remaining amendments which are in the name of Senator Norris, as far as I know, should be dealt with and perhaps be open for discussion at this point.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Ferris: I think the Bill will be concluded by 11 o'clock and the main part of the debate is over on the issue.  I suggest that the Leader of the House should refrain from putting that motion for half an hour or so and to re-assess the situation at that point.  At this stage we should open the debate on the remaining amendments and to reassess the position at that particular point rather than to create a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, to delete &ldquo;fine not exceeding £100&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;minimum fine of £50, for first offence and for a second offence, upon convication, to a minimum fine of £100 up to £200 maximum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These five amendments have one single intention and that is to increase substantially the level of penalty involved in infringements of the regulations.  I do not intend to make a lengthy argument.  I intend to defer to the spirit of the House. I would like to place the amendments on the record.  Amendment No. 21 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), line 30, to delete &ldquo;£100&rdquo; and substitute &lsquo;£500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines, 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding £500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;to a minimum fine of £1,000 up to £2,000 maximum for first offence, and for a second offence upon conviction, to a minimum fine of £2,000 to £5,000 maximum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 to section 3 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 5, after &ldquo;£500.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;These machines should be restricted to areas accessible by adults over eighteen years old, with a minimum fine of £50 on conviction for the first offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will permit myself one brief remark on this amendment which is that this is not simply a matter of making the penalties more severe; it also contains the intention of further protecting the under-age. Amendment No. 27 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 4, line 22, after &ldquo;£500&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and a minimum fine of £50 on conviction for a first offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should correct myself and say that not all these amendments are in my name. Amendment No. 21 is in the names of Senators Shane Ross, John A. Murphy and Joe O'Toole and I apologise for withdrawing it.  I understand it is being withdrawn. The amendments other than amendment No. 21 which I understand is being withdrawn, are in my name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it clear at the start that I do not propose to accept these amendments.  With reference to amendments Nos. 20 and 21, the appropriate and realistic deterrent under section 2 (3) for individuals is a fine of the order specified.  Equally the fines provided for under section 2 (4) and section 4 are also appropriate.  It is necessary to look at the Bill in total and in particular at the specific provisions in relation to enforcement.  The spectrum of fines which may be imposed under the Bill reflects the relative roles and responsibilities of individuals, owners, persons in charge and corporate bodies.  The overall scheme for enforcing the provision of this Bill is intended to ensure that individuals responsible for smoking controls effectively enforce them.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not set out to penalise smokers as its primary objective.  The principles of graduated fines was considered but it was felt that for social misdemeanours of this type it would not be necessary to keep records of offences and with these the resultant bureaucracy would make the legislation cumbersome and expensive to implement.  The control over vending machines was a major consideration when developing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in reply to the Second Stage debate, and as I said, too, section 3 (2) of the Bill was considered to be the best approach to this question in so far as its effects will be to limit the location of vending machines to where <Col N="2238" /> they can be effectively supervised and not used by persons under 16 years of age. The Bill provides for a fine not exceeding £500 for offences under section 3 (2) and I feel that the objectives of amendment No. 26 are already met under section 3 (2).  If I were to accept the amendment it would dilute the effect of the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments.  Therefore, in the overall context, it would not be possible to accept the Senators' amendments without disturbing the balance which is required in legislation of this type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the next two amendments that are down in my name are of greater substance and so, having heard the Minister &mdash; although I do not agree with him &mdash; I am prepared to withdraw these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, not moved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  The right of admission shall be reserved to these establishments, also the right to eject any members of the public refusing to observe the no-smoking regulations, without refunds where applicable, by security guards and/or ushers.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes specific the Minister's intention in prohibiting the smoking of tobacco in certain premises.  It seems to me that it would be quite ludicrous not to have some effective method of policing this particularly in terms of places like nightclubs restaurants and so on.  If the proprietors of these establishments do not have the specific authority to legally <Col N="2239" /> remove persons infringing these regulations, what is the purpose and function of them?  This should be a non-contentious matter and it is one which I urgently request the Minister to give positive consideration to.</P>
    <P>On section 8, amendment No. 30 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  (i)  Concerned members of the public, including members of relevant voluntary bodies, such as the Irish Cancer Society, Irish Heart Foundation, and Irish Association of Non-Smokers, shall have the right to report any breaches of this Act, directly to the appropriate officer, with a view to prosecution, under this Act;</P>
    <P>(a)  they shall also be entitled to notify the managers of public places, if the no-smoking policies are not being observed, and to request them to take immediate action,</P>
    <P>(b)  if this is not done, they may then report these managers to the relevant officer as noted in (i) above.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is self-explanatory and I will resist the temptation, because of the pressures on time, to go into it in any great detail. The Minister realises that I have already indicated, in dealing with previous sections of the Bill what I believe is at least part of the relevance of this strengthening machinery within the Bill.</P>

      <P>While I would agree with many of the sentiments that were expressed by Senator Norris and I fully understand his motives in putting down these amendments, in relation to amendment No. 25, in the case of a number of establishments which are now being covered by this legislation, the right of admission is reserved by the owners, for <Col N="2240" /> example, places of entertainment, theatres, concert halls etc.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that and amplify a little on the other areas covered by the legislation.  It seems to me that while the motives for putting down the amendment are of the highest, they may be somewhat irrelevant.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 8, amendment No. 30, I fully endorse everything Senator Norris has said.  I agree that if this legislation is being put in place bodies such as those mentioned would be the first to benefit from any improvement in the figures for non-smokers among the population.  However &mdash; and again I ask for the Minister's guidance &mdash; it seems to me on reading this section that there is nothing to prevent any of these bodies or any member of the public from informing the relevant law enforcers or those who are responsible for enforcing the legislation about breaches of the Act in public places.  I do not wish to sound as if I am encouraging people to make a nuisance of themselves but I would hope that the two thirds of the population who are non-smokers will identify breaches of this legislation where they see it if it is constituting a public nuisance or is being injurious to the health of people around them.  While I would fully endorse the sentiments expressed in the amendment, it is somewhat irrelevant and superflous to the legislation.  I would not be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to come back very briefly.  In particular I would like to address my remarks to some of the views expressed by Senator Mooney.  With regard to amendment No. 30 I would point out that this has been placed at the request of one of the bodies mentioned in it, the Irish Association of Non-Smokers. I assume they feel it is important that this should be done.  However, I would have to say that this is probably the amendment with which I am personally least in sympathy because like Senator Mooney and many other Irish people, I feel a little bit distanced by the notion of inviting people to become informants.  I am not terribly worried if this section <Col N="2241" /> lapses.  It is just an indication of my good faith with regard to the organisation that I put down the amendment.  I am not terribly keen on it.  I am, however, very keen on the earlier amendment, amendment No. 25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want draconian legislation and I am rather surprised that the Senators have put down these amendments.  I am not going to accept them for the following reasons.  It is the Minister's intention to authorise environmental officers of the health boards to enforce the regulations made under the Bill.  By so doing he will be engaging persons who are accountable to both the State and the public, thus ensuring that they act within the framework of their statutory responsibilities. While I admire greatly the work done by organisations such as those mentioned by Senator Norris in amendment No. 30, the monitoring in regard to compliance with the legislation has to be undertaken in the context of accountability.  However, fundamental responsibility for enforcement will rest with the owner or person in charge of the facility in question and such persons have the right to do what Senator Norris proposes in amendment No. 25.  In a public facility in which smoking is banned, refusal to comply with the ban would be a breach of the peace and can be dealt with accordingly &mdash; the Garda Síochána would have a responsibility there.  It is not, therefore, appropriate or necessary to include details such as those in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach basically to this matter is reasonable.  We do not want any draconian legislation.  We do not want people enforcing this themselves.  We want officers of the health boards, who are accountable to the State, to be responsible for the enforcement of the regulations and the Bill itself.  I have no hesitation whatever in not accepting the amendments put forward by Senator Norris, however well intentioned they may be and despite the fact that he may have responded to representations made to him by an organisation on this matter. Maybe the Senator should not always <Col N="2242" /> respond to representations received against his best judgment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot withdraw amendment No. 25.  I have already indicated that I feel virtually all the amendments are important significant amendments that are positive in construing the legal intention of the Minister in terms of the Bill.  I have, however, indicated in honesty that I am less than 100 per cent enthusiastic about amendment No. 30.  That is the only one I have this delicacy or hesitation about.  I would like to say at this stage because there will not be another opportunity to say it again that I am a little dismayed that my prophecy earlier this evening has proved to be absolutely true.  Despite the fact that the Minister did say he would consider amendments if he was convinced of their virtue, integrity an logic and would take them on board, nevertheless, out of 29 amendments so far discussed it is remarkable that not one single one has been accepted by the Minister despite the fact that he was seen frequently nodding his head, which can usually be translated into agreement.  I will finish on this point as I would like Senator Ferris to have the opportunity to move his final two amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;an oral smokeless tobacco product&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;goods described in subsection (2) of the section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) describes an oral smokeless tobacco product as any product or substance made wholly or partially from tobacco, etc.  My second amendment suggests that we delete subsection (2) and substitute it with a new subsection (2) which would take account of the views expressed in both these amendments.  We have put down these amendments on the basis of what the Minister has already said about this section under which the manufacture or export from this country of any of these products would be prohibited. We have defended the Minister's right, and his predecessor's right, to place an embargo on the importation of undesirable chewing tobacco products but we contend that the criteria which apply to imported chewing tobacco products do not apply to chewing tobacco products manufactured in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment seeks to exempt a specific type of tobacco product from the controls proposed in the Bill.  This product is sold as solid chewing tobacco.  In recent years a wide variety of oral smokeless tobacco products have been developed and promoted in North America, Scandinavia and more recently in the European Community. These products are being promoted to young people as an alternative way to enjoy tobacco and it is estimated by the World Health Organisation that about ten million people, most of them teenagers, in the United States of America are now using them.</P>
      <P>These products cause serious health problems.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, has determined that there is sufficient evidence that these products cause oral cancer and their use also causes serious dental damage.  Continual use can cause white patches to appear on the gums which may become cancerous.  The use of these products can also cause damage due to receding of the gums here the tobacco regularly becomes in contact with the mouth.  In June 1987 a World Health Organisation study group on smokeless tobacco control recommended a preemptive total ban on the importation, production and sale of all types of smokeless tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and I are deeply concerned at the potential availability in this country of the types of chewing tobacco which are being promoted in other countries to young people as safe alternatives to smoking.  The scientific and medical evidence relating to the range of oral smokeless tobaccos, including chewing tobaccos, is such that it would be remiss of the Minister and me not to provide comprehensive legislation protecting the public against these products. To exempt any specific oral smokeless tobacco could not be justified on health grounds and on exemption of a specific class of an oral smokeless product would leave the legislation open to <Col N="2245" /> exploitation.  Given the current developments by the tobacco industry internationally of new forms of tobacco consumption I have no doubt that any gaps in the law will encourage the development and promotion of the products exempted.  The range and variety of oral smokeless tobacco products now being promoted is remarkable and is evidence of how the industry is trying to diversify the ways in which tobacco is marketed.  There are varieties of solid chewing tobaccos and finely cut tobaccos which are either loose or in teabag satchets, intended to be placed in the mouth and sucked or chewed, powdered moist tobacco products for sucking and even toothpastes and confectionery products contain tobacco.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious health risks posed by these addictive products and because it is likely that their promotion would result in a new generation of tobacco users at the very time when tobacco smoking is being discouraged, the Government decided that the full range of oral smokeless tobacco products should be prohibited.  There is no point in bringing forward legislation which would make it illegal for people to use them in this country while allowing a company to produce them here for export.  That would be totally unacceptable and I do not think we could accept it.</P>
    <P>Recently I have seen young children using a confectionery product, an imitation of a cigarette.  I am making an appeal here and using this forum to request shopkeepers to voluntarily ban this particular product.  This product resembles a cigarette and its sale is unacceptable.  I do not know if we have powers to do so but I have checked with my Department to see if we can ban the sale of this product.  Once we give children an opportunity to imitate smoking they will then go on to the next step.  It is very irresponsible of any retailer to sell these products and I think there should be a total ban on them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the employment aspect, <Col N="2246" /> I appreciate Senator Feris's concern but this product which has been developed as a chewing tobacco forms only a very small percentage of the production of any of the factories at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, while we have differed very slightly in respect of views here today I think we all support the concept inherent in the legislation.  This is another major step towards preventing the abuse of addictive products.  Recently there has been talk of legalising certain drugs.  I hold the view that no drug is safe and under no circumstances would I encourage any debate for legalising so called &ldquo;safe&rdquo; drugs.</P>
    <P>There are no safe drugs.  Drugs lead to abuses and addiction.  Some prominent people have called recently, and I want to take this opportunity of refuting those calls, for the legalisation of so called harmless drugs like marijuana and other products.  They lead to addiction and to the hard drugs.  As national chairman of the Drugs Advisory Group I want to say that I totally oppose and will never allow any such legislation to come in.  To act otherwise would be to allow a most dangerous situation to develop.  Nicotine is regarded as being responsible for so many deaths that we in the Department of Health are very pleased with this legislation going through the Houses.  I want to take this opportunity on behalf of Deputy O'Hanlon and the Department to express our appreciation to this House for the very excellent contributions made during the passage of this Bill.  I want to make clear that all the points raised by the Senators will be borne in mind in relation to the regulations.  I want to place on record the work that a previous Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, did in this area when he was in the Department.  I include also in that tribute all the officials in the Department, including Michael Lyons and Cecil Beamish who are with me and who have been working on this legislation for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a privilege for me to move this motion on the Adjournment which concerns an extremely courageous, as well as gifted, student at third level.  This student, who is a constituent of mine has contacted me with regard to a situation which, while it may be legal, certainly reveals a most appallingly niggardly, parsimonious and ungenerous attitude on the part of the authorities and one which constitutes a very clear disincentive to third level study and to the achievement of independence by those who suffer, unfortunately, from what one might term to be a physical handicap.  I spoke to the person who is the subject of the Adjournment Debate by telephone this evening and he used the word, &ldquo;disincentive&rdquo;, in the course of that conversation.  He feels that the attitude of the officials involved constitutes a disincentive to him to continue his studies.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister is familiar with the details of the case.  This is a story of a young man who is almost totally blind, has struggled to overcome the difficulty and has been successful in that valiant struggle to such an extent that he achieved an exceedingly distinguished primary degree.  He has subsequently been accepted for higher study and has enrolled on the register of PhD. students. He is a candidate for the post-graduate degree of Doctor of Philosophy.  In fact, his academic distinction is such that he has received an award from the Higher Education Authority through Cavan County Council.  However, most regrettably, the attitude of the authorities has been to take the view that he is not entitled to both amounts of money simultaneously; they have subtracted one from the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> That action seems to me to be morally unjustifiable.  I agree that it is a disincentive. Having been awarded a major prize in the university on one occasion, I was subsequently told that the monetary value of subsequent prizes would not be awarded to me.  I was told that as I had received a certain amount of money, that was my ceiling and I could have the honour and glory of the titles listed but no further cash.  I can assure the Minister that I took no further steps to acquire academic distinctions.  We are living in a very practical world and it is not enough to be given empty titles, particularly &mdash; and, thank God, this is not true in any case &mdash; to somebody who is visually handicapped.  When I mention the sums of money involved the House will see that the word &ldquo;parsimonious&rdquo; is justified. The higher education grant from Cavan County Council was just over £1,000 and the pension is not a great deal in excess of that figure.  We are not talking about enormous sums of money.  The Minister has the exact figures and there need be no confusion about them.</P>
    <P>The person involved informed me this evening that he feels hurt and insulted. He has attempted to overcome his personal difficulty with as little reliance as possible on State help and on the sympathy, which he rejects, of the general public.  While part of his attitude has been to underplay his physical disadvantage and to desire that he should be treated as a normal member of the community, he feels, for the first time, as a result of this controversy that he has been treated as less than normal and that, paradoxically, his handicap is being emphasised by the unfeeling, unyielding and inflexible attitude of officialdom.  He is not alone in that view.  He has been supported by the Students Union's welfare officer in Trinity College who has described the attitude of the authorities as disgusting, disgraceful and discriminatory.  I hope the Minister will take on board these very strong feelings not just of the person involved, who I am sure the Minister will <Col N="2251" /> agree should be rewarded rather than being penalised for his excellence.</P>
    <P>I would like very briefly to run through a catalogue of the circumstances of this case.  I have been supplied by the person involved with a series of documents.  I believe he should be encouraged if his approach to medieval history is anything like as meticulous and precise as the skill he has demonstrated in preparing this brief for me so that, despite the lateness of the hour and the fact that the Minister and myself have been here now for many hours discussing other matters, I feel I can present a logical and coherent case. Rather than a disincentive, a really strong incentive should be given to him.  I would like to say, before I get into a recital of the case, that it seems not only morally right but also very practical that somebody in this situation should be so encouraged rather than discouraged.  After all, whereas this gentleman could have sat back, could have accepted welfare, disability pensions and so on and perhaps done nothing other than a little spot of basket weaving every so often or operated a telephone switchboard, instead of taking this line of least resistance, he has placed himself in a situation where he can add to the intellectual life of the country and support himself independently of pensions.  This is the kind of independence we all wish to see.</P>
    <P>On 24 September last the person involved received a document in printed form which I have here, entitled Document 1, from the Department of Social Welfare saying that the social welfare officer would call to see him on the next Friday, 25 September to &ldquo;interview you in connection with your claim for blind pension&rdquo;.  There is a further note which says: &ldquo;the appropriate officer wishes to have produced for inspection full detail of the subjects income and savings.&rdquo;  The response of my constituent was that he was not aware that the Department did not allow the receipt of a blind pension and an education grant until he received <Col N="2252" /> formal notification of the subsequent reduction of his pension.</P>
    <P>On 30 September he received a further letter from the officer concerned, Document 2, a handwritten letter which says:</P>
    <P>Further to my visit to you on 25.9.87 there are some further details that you may provide for me.</P>
    <P>Please sign the attached bank authority that I may confirm the balances on both your accounts in October 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.  I did not inspect any old bank statements for your current account to give me that information. Alternatively perhaps you could contact the bank yourself and ask them for a statement showing the balances on both deposit and current accounts on those dates.</P>
    <P>Please also state if you are in receipt of any other award or bursary from any source other than Cavan Co. Council.</P>
    <P>I enclose an officially paid addressed envelope....</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on that a little. For example, this letter states: &ldquo;any other award or bursary&rdquo;.  Is it the intention of the Department that there should be absolutely no reward whatever for intellectual excellence?  In other words, are prizes, special awards and bursaries to be, in this niggardly way, deducted from the disabled?  I cannot believe that this is the intention of any civilised person, far less the Minister whom I have come to know in debates in the House.</P>
    <P>The subject refused to sign this authorisation, of which I have a photocopy, because he read it in some detail and it is disclosed to him the fact that the form in question contains no terms of limitation regarding the time for which it is valid nor does it confer its powers on a single named person.  The subject said he was afraid that in signing it he would be providing permanent access to his financial affairs to whoever wanted to use it. That seems to be a reasonable attitude to take.  This kind of State Chamber inquiry seems to be an unnecessary intrusion into <Col N="2253" /> the financial affairs of the person involved.  This is where we get into what I think are degrading and sordid details. Having inspected the bank account &mdash; the subject makes the point that the funds in his bank account were funds accruing from savings made on his blind pension &mdash; the sum involved was annualised as £9.74.  This miserable pittance was subsequently deducted from the blind pension.</P>
    <P>We are often told about this being a Christian country.  I wonder where in this is Christian charity?  I know rules may be inflexible but I am perfectly certain that somewhere up the chain of command there resides the authority to alter or investigate these rules.  I believe that not only in this case &mdash; this is one of the reasons I took it up &mdash; but in a number of cases which this is illustrative there is a pressing need for an investigation into the unnecessary narrowness of these kinds of rules.  I exonerate the officials lower down the chain from moral culpability in this.  I do not believe there is a personal vendetta going on but I believe that these rules and regulations are totally wrong.</P>
    <P>On 1 November this man received a further document which baldly said:</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Officer has reviewed your Old Age/Blind Pension and has reported that your means have increased since your last assessment. Your weekly rate of pension will, therefore, be reduced.</P>
    <P>Please return your pension book(s)...</P>
    <P>There was no information as to by what amount it was going to be reduced or what his immediate circumstances were. Imagine the plight of somebody who is already visually handicapped, who is not by any means living at an extravagant level &mdash; you can tell that from the sums involved &mdash; and who is suddenly told in a printed form that there is going to be a reduction but is not told by how much. He telephoned the Department and was told that everything was all right and that <Col N="2254" /> he would be no worse off.  Is that not a cheering thought?  Are we not all happy? You win a prize and all the Department of Social Welfare can tell you is that you will be no worse off.  That is a big treat. However, my informant was not particularly pleased about this.</P>
    <P>He asked subsequently to receive formal notification of the decision.  A further document informed him that he could make an appeal against the decision but it did not inform him that he was entitled to make an oral appeal.  As regards the Department of Social Welfare old age and blind pensions office, it is really rather insulting that these things are so blandly joined together &mdash;&ldquo;old age&rdquo; and &ldquo;blind&rdquo;.  They are two separate and distinct items.  I will return to this because it seems to be utterly and morally disgusting that subjects are not allowed to have both the old age pension and the blind pension.  Surely to goodness it is an additional infliction to be blind as well as old and some recognition should be given to this point.  It is a particularly simple point and I would have thought that anybody could take it on board.  Perhaps the mind that conceived these sorts of documents is incapable of taking it on board because when writing to a blind person they make no mention of an oral appeal.  The section that deals with blind pensions says: &ldquo;If you are not satisfied with this decision you may appeal in writing to the above address within 21 days&rdquo;, emphasising the very qualities and areas of expertise in which blind people experience difficulty.  This insensitivity is most regrettable although I accept that it may well be just an oversight.</P>
    <P>Subsequently my constituent provided further information, including a letter which I would like to read into the record because it is from a most distinguished Dublin ophthalmic surgeon.  Am I allowed to name the doctor or is that inappropriate?</P>

      <P>I specialise in being unusual so I would like to say that Professor Peter Eustace, who is a very distinguished doctor, has placed on the record a letter which says:</P>
      <P>The person named has been a patient of mine for the past three years.  He has extremely serious visual problems resulting from congenital cataracts which were operated on early in life. His present visual status is that he could be registered as blind but although he has very reduced vision, with extreme perseverance he has managed to obtain an excellent degree in Trinity College, Dublin.  To reduce his blind pension allowance in any way is quite unfair. This person needs very complex visual aids to continue on in University.  He has such severe visual problems and as I have already said he could be registered as a blind person.</P>
      <P>This is the opinion of an authoritative source within the medical profession.</P>
      <P>The matter was then raised as to whether there were expenses that could be used in computing and I may say that at this point there appeared to be flexibility on the part of the various ministerial personnel involved, which I welcome.  I look forward enthusiastically to a substantial degree of movement in this matter from the Minister.  The social welfare officer involved in this case &mdash; and I have to put this in parenthesis because it is worthy of note &mdash; when questioned as to whether there were special expenses replied on behalf of my constituent: &ldquo;No, there were not&rdquo;.  This is what he understands although there were special circumstances, and circumstances referred to by his doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into the area of impugning the reputation or the professional expertise of welfare officers because that would be grossly wrong and would too far particularise the case. However, I would make the point that there are special circumstances involved. This person does not live at home, yet <Col N="2256" /> the pension is the same for somebody who lives at home in Dublin and for somebody who has to move from Cavan and find secure accommodation elsewhere.  No allowance was made at that point for the special visual aids or the special materials that are necessary for the continuation of his studies.  This may be made subsequently and I hope it will be taken into account by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a further letter to the Minister for Social Welfare Deputy Woods, written by my constituent and which is dated 16 November 1087.  Considering the prehistoric attitude towards the blind revealed in this rather sad case I could believe it was 1087, but it is a mistake and the correct date is 1987.  It says:</P>
    <P>I have been obliged to find accommodation that is near to my place of study.  In the light of a number of attacks on visually disabled students, as well as the fact that I am living alone, I am obliged to live in a building with adequate provisions for security.  I also need accommodation with as much natural light as possible in which to read, as I find long-term reading by artificial light both tiring and painful.  I am fortunate to have found accommodation which combines all of these factors.  However, such accommodation is not cheap.  It has only been through combining my blind pension with my maintenance grant that I have been able to afford it.</P>
    <P>Is this person to be placed at risk of attacks of the kind that have already taken place because we are too mean in this State which guarantees to cherish all its people equally?  I would say &ldquo;equally&rdquo; means not subtracting one prize from another in terms of a means test; it means giving equal opportunity, &mdash; I stress that phrase and I claim that my informant has not been given equal opportunity with other citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>My informant maintains that the <Col N="2257" /> system of inflexible means testing is completely unsuitable for blind people.  They all have different types and levels of expenses, depending on the nature of their disability, its cause, the age of the person and so on.  Arising from such matters there is another inequality which the Department defend in the name of equity.  This person is expected to live away from home and in rented accommodation on the same amount as is paid to somebody living at home, a point I have already made.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude referring to pensions and the way in which they are calculated. With regard to non-contributory old age and blind pensions, a blind persion can continue to be paid with widow's pension until age 66.  However, payment of blind pension will stop if the pensioner is awarded a retirement, invalidity or old age pension.  This is quite disgraceful and I ask the Minister to use this specific case to open an investigation into these inflexible rigid rules and regulations.  It is bad enough to be blind but it is a lot worse to be old as well and consideration should be given to that point.  What counts as means for the purposes of the means test are cash income, property, investments, etc.  What does not count as means are supplementary welfare allowance, rent allowance or, if one has a job, part of the earnings are not counted in some cases.  If somebody has a job and is allowed part of his earnings why is it that by intellectual effort somebody who acquires a prize or distinction is not allowed to have this discounted also? That is earnings and there can be no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I know that there will be sensitivity in this area.  There should be some movement and I look to a positive reply from the Minister regarding a situation which deals with sums that are so pathetically small that very few of us would find ourselves capable of the intellectual and physical ingenuity required to live on <Col N="2258" /> them.  I hope that there will be generosity and that the Minister will find it possible to reward this unusual intellectual distinction, an intellectual distinction that would be unusual in somebody who is fully visually equipped but is remarkable, brave and to be commended in somebody who is handicapped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, is unable to be here.  He is abroad at a Council of Ministers' meeting.  I am representing him in replying to Senator Norris's Adjournment motion.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern in regard to this case.  The person involved is obviously a talented student who has shown great determination and courage in coming to terms with his visual handicap and in overcoming the limitations which many people might feel exist for those who are partially sighted.  I am, however, surprised at the statement in the motion that the reduction in the blind person's pension is effectively preventing the student from completing his education. I do not accept this.</P>
      <P>The blind person's pension, payable from the age of 18 years, is an income maintenance payment for persons who satisfy the conditions regarding blindness or visual impairment and means.</P>
      <P>Any applicant for a means-tested income maintenance payment must have the full extent of his means assessed as this is the only fair way to determine the appropriate social assistance payment. Where the person concerned is receiving a contribution from another source towards his maintenance, that amount cannot &mdash; in equity &mdash; be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all social assistance payments, the statutory position is that the amount of the payment is related to the means of the claimant from other sources.  For a single blind person the maximum rate of pension is payable where other means do not exceed £6 per week.  In addition, if <Col N="2259" /> the person is working, the first £6 per week of earnings are disregarded in making the assessment of means.  The rate of payment then depends on the actual rate of the means assessed.  No pension would be payable to a single person who has means of more than £50 a week.</P>
    <P>The normal position in relation to higher education grants is that it is made up of two elements.  The first element is to cover the tuition fees and this is paid direct by the local authority to the college in question.  The second element is the contribution towards the maintenance of the student.</P>
    <P>While I consider that this student should be offered every possible assistance and encouragement to continue with his studies and to fulfil his obviously considerable potential, I think it is important to emphasise that the Social Welfare system has been formulated to deal equitably and consistently with situations of need.  I have no doubt that we would all be in agreement about the importance of ensuring that all individuals who apply for assistance to the Department of Social Welfare have a consistent set of rules applied to their claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare was pleased to announce recently that considerable efforts have been made to introduce flexibility into the Social Welfare system and to tackle problems which might be perceived as having arisen because of over-rigid procedures or because of anomalies which have been identified within the system.  The media coverage which this case has already received shows that there could be a perception that the student involved might not be fairly treated.  I would like to assure Senators that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to emphasise that, while every effort is made to take account of the particular needs of individual clients and to deal in a flexible manner where this is appropriate, there <Col N="2260" /> are rules to be applied in the determination of means which, in equity, cannot be overlooked in any one case. These rules, which are used in assessing the extent of means and calculating the rate of pension or allowance which is appropriate, are applied equally to all applicants.  Decisions are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers in accordance with the statutory rules.  Individual circumstances are always carefully assessed by the deciding officer or the appeals officer before making the decision.</P>
    <P>The only special feature of this case which impinges on the means testing requirements is that it has been established that the student necessarily incurs additional expenses in pursuing his post-graduate academic studies because of his visual impairment.  These expenses are in respect of special audio and visual equipment. Recently the Minister for Social Welfare directed that they should be regarded as tantamount to tuition expenses in such cases as this where equipment is essential in order to pursue the studies.  The details of these expenses have recently been obtained from the student.</P>
    <P>The person in question was originally awarded blind person's pension at the maximum rate, with effect from his 18th birthday, in August 1983, on the basis that he had no means.  In 1987 the Department were notified that he had changed his address to Dublin.  He was visited by a social welfare officer in September 1987 for a routine review of his entitlement.  He was asked for details of his means and it emerged that he was in receipt of a higher education grant awarded to him by Cavan County Council in September 1983.</P>
    <P>He had not disclosed that he had a bank account when his means were originally being assessed for purposes of determining eligibility for pension, nor had he notified the Department of the fact that, following award of pension, he was subsequently awarded a higher education <Col N="2261" /> grant which included a maintenance element.  Both the maintenance portion of the grant and the money held in the bank account constitute means and it was necessary to review the level of his pension taking these into account.  The portion of the grant applicable to tuition is not assessed.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that a claimant for any social welfare assistance payment, including blind person's, is required by law to fully disclose his means when applying for pension and to notify the Department of any increase in means which occurs after a pension has been awarded.  In this case, the person concerned did not fully disclose his means. When information concerning the additional means came to light, his means assessment &mdash; on which his rate of pension was based &mdash; had to be reviewed. This review led to additional means being assessed, resulting in the pension being reduced from the maximum rate of £47.10 per week to £27.10 per week, with effect from 13 November 1987.</P>
    <P>When details of this case were first brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, the Minister was anxious to ensure that, in assessing this student's means, due account would be taken of the fact that the grant in his case has to be spent not merely on tuition and maintenance, as would usually be the case, but also on specific extras in connection with this student's education owing to his being visually impaired.  Further information was then sought in relation to the additional expenses he has to meet, such as specialised reading equipment and the purchase of an electronic typewriter, in order to establish whether they could be regarded as being additional tuition expenses which would not have been borne by other students. If this proved to be the case, there would be scope for reducing the net maintanance part of the grant assessed for purposes of the blind person's pension.</P>
    <P>This further review of the case has been <Col N="2262" /> completed.  Details concerning items purchased have been made available.  This information was not available for consideration previously.  It should allow an assessment to be made regarding special expenses arising owing to this student's visual impairment.  Therefore the case has been resubmitted to the appeals officer, with the additional information, for consideration of the new facts and evidence now available.  The appeals officer will examine the case and determine whether the previous means assessment should be revised.  The decision of the appeals officer is expected soon and the person concerned will then be notified immediately.</P>
    <P>I trust that an early resolution of the case will avoid any further uncertainty for the student involved.  I would like to take this opportunity of wishing him continued success with his academic career.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to Senator Norris that, although the Minister and myself, as Minister of State, would be fully sympathethic to his case, in these circumstances officials of the Department of Social Welfare have to comply with the law, they have to comply with the regulations and the law as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They must also bear in mind that the student concerned had benefitted for four years from the maximum blind pension and the maintenance part of the grant from Cavan County Council.  He has a very impressive record and must have tremendous academic ability to persevere with his studies.  I know this has caused him concern and I hope it will not have placed him at any disadvantage in relation to his studies.  I can only reiterate that officials of the Department of Social Welfare have to comply with the law in relation to this matter.  I hope the matter will be satisfactorily resolved &mdash; when the extra expenses incurred by the student will be taken into account by the appeals officer and a decision will be taken as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply which was clear but not over generous.  I have some further information which I would like to give him when the Seanad adjourns.  I would like to ask him, if I may, to consider also the special circumstances of the student's residence and the additional expense involved.  This is a special circumstance in that there have been attacks on the <Col N="2264" /> visually handicapped and it is vital for him to live in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask the Minister a rhetorical question, which is precisely how many blind students have been put on the Ph.D register?  I doubt very much if there is any other at all.  I thank the Minister for his reply and I hope that there will be a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 July 1988.</P>
