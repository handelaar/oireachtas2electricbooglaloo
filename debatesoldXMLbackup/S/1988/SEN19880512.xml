      <P>I have notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The inclusion of County Leitrim as a pilot area for funding through the integrated rural development scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Phil Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to recognise the important contribution that Kilkenny Design Workshop has made to industrial and economic development in Ireland and asks the Minister to confirm his support for the continuation of the Kilkenny Design Workshop.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Reynolds and Hogan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Reynolds' motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Hogan may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise on the Order of Business the question of the Ombudsman.  This morning on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; Mr. Byrne announced to the nation that the Ombudsman was being choked out of existence by civil servants.  I would like to say that the blame should be put where it fairly and squarely belongs.  This is a political act by the Government.</P>

      <P>I am simply trying to raise a matter which has caused great concern and outcry throughout the country and some time ago we put on the record our very strong views on that.  I would appeal to all parties here to urge this Government to change their policy on this matter.  Otherwise it will be difficult for us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman has just published his report and perhaps the House should have an opportunity to discuss it at some agreed date.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Order of Business, I have no problem with it today but, in view of the fact that the Finance Bill is on Report Stage in the Dáil, could the Leader of the House indicate when this House is likely to get it and, if we are getting it next week, are we likely to sit on Tuesday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask Senator Lanigan if, in view of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, and the widespread concern about the role of the Ombudsman and the interest which this House has already taken in this position, he will take Item No. 45?</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, Senator Manning did not take notice of my telling him that he was not in order. Now, I am putting you in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be perfectly in order.  I am simply proposing that we take Item No. 45, which is a motion which states: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the special supplementary report to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the Office of the Ombudsman&rdquo; in the names of myself and Senator Joe O'Toole.  I feel it would adequately reflect the concern of the House if the Leader of the House was gracious enough to take it this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters, a Chathaoirligh.  One concerns the Finance Bill.  I understand it is coming to this House next week.  I would like clarification from the Leader of the House on when it is proposed to take Second Stage and then Committee and Report Stages.  I understood that perhaps we would be doing both next week.  Usually it has been the practice to take Second Stage one week and then Committee Stage and subsequent Stages the following week.  I would be concerned if there was any departure from what is the usual practice in order to allow Members to reflect on the Bill and make the fullest possible contribution on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be obstreperous, but I support the call of Senator Manning concerning the extraordinarily worrying situation which has developed in the Office of the Ombudsman.  There was one very telling headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today which stated: &ldquo;&lsquo;Stop Killing my Service&rsquo; says the Ombudsman.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The present Government when in Opposition agreed to set up the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but I want to see the fullest possible debate on this service of the Ombudsman which is a valuable bastion of democracy.  I want to see that debated in this House as speedily as possible with all-party support and approval. I would also like to make reference to the worrying and disturbing situation which has arisen concerning the Kilkenny Design Workshop, where there is confusion, uncertainty and dismay.  Newspaper reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refer to Item No. 45 on the Order Paper.  This motion is down in the names of Senator Norris and myself.  I am supporting his call and, indeed, the call from various other Members of this House this morning that we should debate that item today.  I recall for the Leader of the House that during a Private Members' Motion on the Ombudsman some months back, and afterwards, the Leader of the House gave us a commitment that we would deal with the report of the Ombudsman when it came out.  We have now before us both the special supplementary report and the annual report.  I ask the Leader of the <Col N="961" /> House to carry on and do what he promised to do at that time, being now in a leadership position here.  I would ask him now to support the call for the taking of Item No. 45 today.  I propose as an amendment to the Order of Business that we take Item No. 45 first this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if he has any information as to why the members of the restaurant staff of this House have seemingly been ordered to desist from entering the House through the main entrances and to enter through the side entrances.  That sounds like a return to the tradesmen's entrances of the Victorian era.  I would like to know the reason for this and I would hope that the decision, if this information is correct, will be reversed.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if he can confirm when Item No. 61 will be taken and if in that context he would take the opportunity to condemn the appalling savagery which has been meted out to unfortunate swans and I means this in the most serious manner &mdash; on the Dublin waterways culminating in the savagery yesterday when a male cob protecting the signet and the eggs in the nest was, according to a newspaper report, deliberately driven over by two drunken drivers.  This caused enormous distress to local residents in the Lucan area who had been feeding and caring for the swans.  I ask the Leader of the House if in the context of Item No. 61 he would perhaps take the opportunity to express this House's total condemnation of such appalling savagery contrary to our nature and the interest of our wildlife?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment to the Order of Business put down by my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that Item No. 45, which relates to the Office of the Ombudsman, should be taken.  The words you used, a Chathaoirleach, when speaking to Senator Loughrey just now, are very relevant.  You told Senator Loughrey that the sort of thing he was proposing brings the House into disrepute.  It is very important that, when the Leader of the House makes a promise that something like this will be debated, we do have a debate on it.  Guarantees of debates must hold some water and he must be held to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What brings this House into disrepute is not discussing relevant, immediate, topical matters such as the Ombudsman, Anglo-Irish relations and the Middle East.  Our real problem is that we will become irrelevant if we continually refuse to debate issues like the Ombudsman today or tomorrow when they suddenly become relevant and of public interest.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider this seriously and not just <Col N="963" /> dismiss it as inconvenient for him today, as he has done with other debates of extremely topical importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for intervening: I usually do not intervene, but every day here of late Independent Senators are asking us to take this motion or that in their names.  We decided a long time ago in this House that motions of that kind would be taken in their turn in Private Members' time every Wednesday evening.  They know this very well.  Their turn will be in two weeks' time and they can put in their motion on that occasion. It is very unfair that they are upsetting rules which all parties here agreed to.  If they want motions of that kind brought forward there are other ways in which that can be done.  Certainly this House will not break the rules we have made in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, to correct the record, we have an agreement that all-party and agreed motions will be taken at various times.  We have a number of examples of that, for example, the one on the Constitution.  We had a commitment that the Ombudsman's report would be taken and therefore we feel it is quite within the agreed position that there should be an all-party position taken on the Ombudsman's report.  When that was not put forward the only way we could get around to discussing it here this morning was to propose a motion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change in the Order of Business this morning. The Order of Business is as I have set out.  Item No. 45 can be taken, as Senator Willie Ryan said, as the next motion by Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole if they so wish when their turn comes.  They want to have their cake and eat it.  They have motions on various things down on the Order Paper which they want brought forward while also having their own Private Members' time as well.  The report of the Ombudsman is not yet on the Order Paper.  If it is placed on the Order <Col N="964" /> Paper we can then discuss when it will be taken.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill will be taken on three days of next week.  As against what Senator Bulbulia said, the Finance Bill has always been taken in one week in this House.  There is no change from the usual practice.  We will take Second Stage on Tuesday and all Stages will be completed by Thursday evening, irrespective of at what time on Thursday evening.  The business for next week will include Item No. 61.  That debate can take place between Second Stage and Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford's comments are not a matter about which we in this House can do anything.  They are a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I agree with the sentiments he expressed but, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about that.  It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and for those who order the administration of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These are the only items that are of relevance to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House agree to take a motion on the report of the Ombudsman on the first sitting day next week?  If he would give a commitment on that it would meet our concerns at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week there is the very important business of the Finance Bill coming before the House.  I cannot give a commitment that we will address ourselves to the report of the Ombudsman next week.  The report of the Ombudsman will be debated here at an early stage.  There is urgent Government business and the Finance Bill has to be got through next week.  By agreement over the past number of weeks Item No. 61 is the item to be taken during this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to express my grave concern at the misleading information which the Leader of the House gave us.  In response to my question as to when we would take the Finance Bill, and my indication that in the past it has been taken over a two-week period, the Leader of the House gave a solemn assurance that, in fact, the Finance Bill was taken in this House over a period of one week.  I have had an opportunity to check the dates.  In 1986, Second Stage was taken on 14 and 15 May.  Committee Stage and remaining Stages were taken on 20 and 21 May.  In 1987, Second Stage was taken on 24 and 25 June and the Committee Stage and remaining Stages were taken on 2 July.  I merely asked that the precedent, which I had a recollection of, should be observed this year, as in earlier years.  The Leader of the House misled the House, probably inadvertently.  In view of the information I have given I ask him to order that Second Stage only of the Finance Bill will be dealt with next week and that Committee Stage and remaining Stages will be taken the following week, The Finance Bill is major legislation.</P>

      <P>The Order in question was made by the Government on 12 April 1988 under sections 4 and 5 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1952.  It provides for the confirmation of a new agreement with respect to veterinary surgeons concluded with the United Kingdom Government on 11 April 1988.  This new Veterinary Surgeons Agreement, which is set out in the First Schedule to the present Order, terminates as from 31 May 1988 the Anglo-Irish Veterinary Agreement of 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main effect of the new agreement is to terminate the long-standing interdependence of the Irish and UK Veterinary Councils embodied in Irish legislation. This derives from the position when the Irish Veterinary Register was set up under the Veterinary Surgeons Act <Col N="968" /> of 1931.  At that time &mdash; and up to the early fifties when our universities commenced awarding veterinary degrees &mdash; the only basis for registration of veterinary surgeons in this country was the UK diploma MRCVS.  Hence it was necessary to have bilateral arrangements providing for dual registration of Irish veterinary surgeons on both Irish and UK registers.</P>
    <P>The advantages of this for our veterinary surgeons was that they had automatic entitlement to MRCVS registration and could set up practice in the UK.  In return it was necessary to accord to the UK Council rights to be represented on committees of inquiry set up by the Irish Council in disciplinary cases, to inspect veterinary training operations in Ireland, and in other aspects of the control of the profession.</P>
    <P>Following on the implementation of EEC Directives 78/1026 and 78/1027 which guarantee the rights of establishment of veterinary surgeons throughout the Community, Irish registered practitioners may now freely set up practice not alone in the UK but also in other member states.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the UK authorities indicated that the special relationship with the profession in Ireland should be reviewed as they considered that the automatic entitlement to membership of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons as applied under the 1972 Agreement to Irish veterinary surgeons on graduation would now be discriminatory <i>vis-à-vis</i> the nationals of other member states whose entitlement would be based on the Community Directives.  From our point of view, the termination of the agreement would mean that the UK authority would not longer have a role in oversight of Irish veterinary training institutions or representation on disciplinary committees set up by the Irish Council. The requirement for Irish representation on the UK Council would also cease.</P>
    <P>In the subsequent negotiation of the new agreement the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Irish Veterinary Council worked in close consultation. <Col N="969" /> The position of veterinary surgeons currently practising in Ireland with MRCVS as their sole qualification is safeguarded by the provision for continued membership of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons of those holding it on 31 May 1988.  Also, the termination of the 1972 agreement was deferred over six years to allow ample time for those students to qualify who had embarked on their veterinary training on the understanding that they would be entitled to MRCVS on completion of their course. The terms of the new agreement, therefore, have the full concurrence of the Irish Veterinary Council.</P>
    <P>I should here like to record the excellent co-operation which existed between the veterinary professions in Ireland and the UK under the previous Veterinary Agreement.  I have no doubt that this long-standing, harmonious relationship will continue under the new agreement.</P>
    <P>Apart from the confirmation of the new agreement, the Order provides for the reconstitution of the Irish Veterinary Council.  This is necessary in order to eliminate the statutory provisions which have hitherto operated for the election of Irish representatives to sit on the UK Council.  The opportunity is also being taken to enlarge the Irish Council and to provide for lay membership for the first time, in line with the current practice in relation to doctors and dentists.</P>
    <P>The grounds for enlarging the council from 14 to 17 members are that there has been a substantial increase &mdash; from 1,200 to 1,700 &mdash; in membership of the profession since 1972 &mdash; when the size of the present council was fixed &mdash; leading to an increased volume of work for the council and its various sub-committees.  In these circumstances, the Government were satisfied that the membership of the council needed to be enlarged both in the interests of its efficient operation and to facilitate the introduction of lay representation.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I think it would be helpful to explain to the House that for legal reasons, it has been necessary to reproduce in the Order the existing provisions already in operation in regard to <Col N="970" /> procedure and rules of elections to the council.  This arises from the fact that the scope of Orders which can be made under the 1952 legislation does not include the amendment of previous Orders.  Accordingly, aside from the provisions at Article 3 for the confirmation of the agreement and for the reconstitution and enlargement of the Veterinary Council at Article 5, the remaining provisions of the Order make no change of any significance in the statutory position that has applied up to now except those which are directly consequential on the termination of the 1972 agreement.</P>
    <P>I trust, therefore, that the House will readily accord its confirmation of the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House readily agrees to the confirmation of the Order.  In doing so, may I put it on record that the relationship between the Irish Veterinary Council and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has been excellent down through the years?  In Ireland, often times, the term &ldquo;royal&rdquo; almost immediately brings visions of a type of England we are not supposed to like.  Very often in many spheres of life, this has been the reaction to the word &ldquo;royal&rdquo;.  It is good to record that, in this instance as in many other instances many of us are not aware &mdash; for example, in the automobile association &mdash; there has been on-going co-operation since the foundation of the State in many walks of life between both sides of the Channel. The coming into being of this State did not alter the good relationships that existed prior to that.  It is a matter of record that relations between the Irish Veterinary Council and the Royal Colleges of Veterinary Surgeons have been excellent in the past.  It is the sincere hope of the Irish Veterinary Council, and I am sure the Minister's Department and all Members of this House, that those good relationships will continue, and it is anticipated that they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has outlined in his general statement, heretofore veterinary surgeons qualifying in Ireland automatically became members of the Royal College <Col N="971" /> of Veterinary Surgeons by simply signing a document.  The fact that that has been altered is not an indication that the RCVS want to discontinue the practice whereby Irish vets automatically qualified for membership.  That is not the intention.  It is simply the case that, under existing European legislation, were the relationship between Ireland and England to continue, the UK authorities could be accused of being favourably biased towards Ireland.  It is nice to know that in other circumstances they were favourably biased towards Ireland and would like to continue to be so, were it is not for the fact they could be accused of showing that bias in, 1992 when the spirit of a united Europe will come into being. It is only right that this should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Order confirms the changes that are consequential on the new agreement. Another consequential change is because of the fact that heretofore &mdash; which is ironic, members of the Royal College had to sit on any disciplinary committee set up to examine the professional conduct of a veterinary surgeon in Ireland.  I am sure very few people were aware of that. My view point is that any internal disciplinary question that may arise with regard to veterinary surgeons in Ireland should be dealt with by their colleagues in Ireland.  The Order also brings that change about.  That is not to say there was any resistance to the situation that existed heretofore.  The new agreement was signed by representatives from both sides in London.</P>
    <P>The Order is making the changes which are necessary to do that.</P>
    <P>Lest the veterinary surgeons who will be qualifying may be apprehensive that the doors in the UK are closed to them, in fact not only are the doors in the UK remaining open, but the doors in all the other member states will be wide open to them.  I have little more to say other than to put on record the good relationships that have existed in the past between the Irish Veterinary Council and their counterparts across the water and to express the wish that they will continue <Col N="972" /> and, indeed, the anticipation that they will continue.  I would like to say to the young veterinary surgeons who are qualifying that the doors of all the European States are now open to them, so their horizons will be much wider than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The other changes which are taking place are the enlargement of the Veterinary Council and the inclusion of ministerial representatives on that council.  I understand the membership of the council is to be enlarged from 14 to 17.  Heretofore the council was comprised of 14 members, 12 being elected from among the veterinary surgeons by internal election, one appointed by the Minister and one appointed by the universities.  There will now be 12 elected members and five appointed members; three members appointed by the Minister, of whom at least two shall not be veterinary surgeons; and two to be appointed by the universities, one of whom shall be a registered veterinary surgeon.  The enlarged council reflects the increased membership of the profession.  It will also ensure that the Minister's and the Department's views can be made more clearly known to the council and, in turn, that the elected council members may have their views made known to the Minister. I have nothing further to say, without repeating what I have said, except that the making of the Order has the full support of the Fine Gael Party.  It has been totally supported by the Veterinary Council who would like the Order to be confirmed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am in agreement with this Order which has to be made to ensure the implementation of the EC directive guaranteeing the rights of veterinary surgeons throughout the Community, which means that Irish registered practitioners may now freely set up in practice not only in the United Kingdom but also in other member states which, I think, is an advantage to the Irish veterinary profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the good relations to which Sentor Loughrey referred between the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons <Col N="973" /> and the Irish Veterinary Council will continue and the Order will not in any way interfere with the good relations that exist.  It will probably enhance the relations.  It was necessary also to enlarge the Irish Veterinary Council to reflect the increase in the number of veterinary surgeons.  Their number has increased from 1,200 in 1972 to 1,700 and they are giving a great service to the farming community.  They are on call day and night and are kept very busy.  With the demands on veterinary surgeons I can see this number increasing in the future.</P>
    <P>The new council shall consist of 12 members elected by the veterinary surgeons and five appointed members, two by the universities and three by the Minister. For the first time this will allow lay members to be appointed to the council and I welcome this.  As it is the first time laymen will be represented on the council I wonder should they have greater representation. I am referring to members of the agricultural community.  The Minister will appoint three members.  I assume one will be a vet and I suppose there will be a member of his Department.  That would only leave only one to represent farming interests, which is very little. The farming interests and the agricultural industry should have a good say on the Veterinary Council because the vets are servicing the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Order and hope that we will continue to get good service from the veterinary surgeons.  I hope the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the UK and the Irish Veterinary Council will continue to have an excellent relationship. It also gives our newly qualified veterinary surgeons an opportunity to gain experience in other member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be recognised generally but this morning we are making a little bit of history.  The Veterinary Surgeons Order, 1988, writes another chapter in the history of veterinary surgery in this country and deals with their qualifications and their status internationally. Somebody who read the Order this morning said jocosely that we should write a children's manual on these issues so that <Col N="974" /> the ordinary people could understand all the gobbledegook in statutory instruments. I just wish to put my view on the subject in context as I have some knowledge of it from my background in the industry.</P>
      <P>I worked originally with the first Irish veterinary surgeon who qualified in Ireland, the late Mr. Allen Baker of Lismacue, Bansha, County Tipperary.  I wish to put on the record of this House that he was the first Irishman to be considered eligible to qualify in Ireland and he was awarded a gold medal in veterinary medicine in 1904.  I owe it to his memory to put that on record.  Extraordinarily enough, his examiners were English qualified because the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons considered at that time that nobody was sufficiently qualified in Ireland to be able to confer a degree on somebody in this country.</P>
      <P>This was the beginning of the association between the vets who qualified in Ireland, but yet were recognised in Europe as members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons had a status but the Irish colleges at that time were not accepted by the British as having the correct status.  We moved from that position and eventually the Irish colleges produced lecturers and professors in veterinary medicine who were capable in their own right of carrying out examinations of Irish students and conferring the degree of BA and MVB on them which automatically entitled them to registration with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  The RCVS conferred that status on them because of the history of that faculty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veterinary medicine is accepted by everybody as being one of the most difficult professions to qualify in.  There is a much wider range of arts involved in veterinary medicine than a GP or any other ordinary medic would have.  It is extraordinary that this qualification was recognised in Europe.  Indeed the new European Directives will now ensure that Irish qualified veterinary surgeons will have access to practise within the Community and will not be dependent on the <Col N="975" /> added qualification, given by consent, of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. It is also important to note that the qualifications of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and of the Irish colleges are not accepted in the US although I am confident that the standards of both are superior to anything the American colleges have ever delivered on their campuses.  It has always been obligatory for veterinary surgeons who emigrated, or left home for additional experience in practice, to go through the process of sitting a further exam in America. If they moved from State to State, they had to sit additional examinations under the federal system in America.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Irish Veterinary Council have been in close dialogue and agreement with the Department on this issue. For the first time we are now striking out on our own.  In the past we have produced some of the top veterinarians not alone in Europe but in the world.  I would like to put it on record that it was an Irish veterinary surgeon who diagnosed the clostridial disease which is now typed worldwide as Salmonella Dublin because it was identified in the laboratories in Dublin.  A clostridial disease of a specific kind and type was identified. That is an indication of the quality of the veterinary scientists we have.</P>
    <P>Dr. Brendan Farrelly of the Irish Veterinary College has a specific interest in equine matters and is considered to be one of the foremost veterinary surgeons in the world in the diagnosis and identification of the dreaded equine virus disease of rhinopneumonitis.  This is one of the diseases that causes widespread abortion in the bloodstock industry.  He was one person who was capable of identifying it clinically and in the laboratory afterwards by cultures and the media process.</P>
    <P>We have a very proud record of veterinary surgeons who qualified here but were automatically granted MRCVS status.  Could the Minister confirm that everybody who qualifies after the termination date of May 1988 and those sitting their exams to qualify next year will also <Col N="976" /> have an automatic entitlement to MRCVS status?  Would the Minister tell me the future designation of veterinary surgeons who qualify in Ireland under this new agreement?  What designation will vets be entitled to have after their names so that there will be no confusion in the future as to the status of the qualifying veterinary surgeon?  It is important that the public should become familiar with the designation because everybody accepts the MRCVS as being the be all and end all.  Even people who have the BA and MVB, which are similar qualifications, still add the other to their names.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious for information about the additional nominees to the Veterinary Council the Minister will appoint under this Order.  What type of nonqualified people will sit on this council? Whose interest will they represent?  Will they represent the Department's attitude? Will they represent the consumer who has a vested interest in all matters veterinary and in the use of veterinary medicines, hormones, antibiotics and other products in the treatment of animals for human consumption?  Will they be represented on the Veterinary Council? Will the farming organisations who at times are considered, at least by the consumer, to have a contrary role be represented?</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have been vociferous in their arguments that they have been responsible in their attitude to the use of drugs and medicines in animals for human consumption.  As the Minister knows, we dealt with the Abattoirs Bill which sets the standard for killing and the production of meat for human consumption. Perhaps the Minister might consider the role these non-veterinarians will play on the council.  Perhaps he would consider when nominating people that both sides should be represented, but certainly the consumer should be represented.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the farming organisations would like to have representation on this council.  Because there will be a change of emphasis with the increased numbers on the council, it is appropriate <Col N="977" /> that the other interests should be represented. It might remove some of the problems people have about the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and other medicines in the treatment of animals. Everybody has a responsibility in this area, particularly when animals are sick and need treatment.  Those animals certainly should not be destroyed for human consumption for a statutory period after the introduction of some of the drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>With those few comments I welcome this Order.  It is a confirmation that, because of our membership of the Community, the Single European Act and all the other things that will happen between now and 1992, many of the old requirements will be done away with.  Ireland, in her own right, is achieving a status that we all welcome.  This additional status means that people who qualify will be recognised as being suitably and adequately qualified to practise in any of the EC member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Senators for their very positive response to this Order.  To have legal effect the Order has to be approved by this House and also by the Dáil under sections 4 and 5 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1952.  This is required to be done as soon as possible but, at any rate, before 31 May of this year.  I want to express my appreciation to the Senators for their response to this Order and to endorse what has been said about the veterinary profession.  We owe a great deal to the veterinary profession, the scientists, the laboratory people and the practitioners in the field.  There are some quite outstanding people in that profession, as Senator Ferris said.  Additionally, we have a very proud record in this area, particularly in relation to a number of diseases which are rampant in parts of Europe and which we have succeeded in keeping out of this country.  I would like to put on record my appreciation of the profession for their quite outstanding work in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points have been raised <Col N="978" /> by Senators.  Senator Ferris raised the question of graduates.  This year is the last year graduates will be entitled to use the MRCVS status.  They will also have the designation MVB.  In all future years vets who qualify will carry the MVB designation. Students were made aware of this well in advance.  I think Senator Ferris said the status of MVB is acknowledged worldwide.  A number of Senators referred to the question of lay representation. The position here is that the consumers in particular are entitled to representation.  I will bear in mind what Senator Ferris said in relation to representation by lay people on this council and in particular in relation to drugs, antibiotics etc.  Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the level of antibiotics, about the level of hormones and their use.  Consumers as well as agricultural people and farmers deserve to have representation on the new council.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely talked about the two lay representatives and said that one may very well be from the Department. It need not necessarily be the case that one of those will have to be a Department representative.  I assume that the veterinary profession within the Department will be available to contest elected members' seats but, at any rate, the two lay members are entitled to come from the various consumer interests.  I think that covers the general queries that were raised.  As I said, it is important to get the measure through this House and also through the Dáil before 31 May so there is not much time left.</P>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Loughrey said about the tremendous relations that have existed between the members of the veterinary profession in the UK and our veterinary profession.  There was a great degree of goodwill and a great degree of good work done in this professional body and in a number of others.  It is a pity that good work and goodwill did not extend to political as well as professional organisations. They had a very expansive and open-minded attitude to this matter and wanted to do their best for the industry and the organisation they represent.  As I said, perhaps it is a pity that that goodwill <Col N="979" /> and generosity did not extend to a wider field.  With those few comments I want to thank Senators for their contributions.  I commend this Order to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an order is made under section 3 (1) and an appeal against the order is not brought, or the order is upheld in the Supreme Court, and where the Board is satisfied that it would not be proper, having regard to the Acts to make an Adoption Order in favour of the persons in whose favour the order is made, the Board with the consent of the Court may, if it sees fit, make an Adoption Order in relation to the child to whom the order under section 3 (1) relates, in favour of such other persons as the Board, having regard to the Acts, sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have introduced these amendments because a number of people who deal with children are concerned about the processes contained in the Bill.  Of course we all welcome the Bill.  We welcome the fact that we have finally got around to the later Stages of it.  We look forward to the Bill being implemented and, I hope, to its being successfully implemented without any constitutional problems because it is an extremely important Bill. All we want to do is contribute to making the Bill successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made to me with some vigour that all of the procedures which the Bill lays down, necessary and proper procedures given the circumstances envisaged, have been met. On the rare occasions when, all those <Col N="981" /> procedures having been fulfilled, for some reason the couple for whom the adoption order is being made cannot take on the responsibility of adopting the child, or for some reason the authorities satisfy a court that that cannot be done, should it always be necessary to go back over the entirety of that procedure again? If a court is satisfied that the child is not going to be looked after by his or her natural parents, taking into account the circumstances as outlined in the Bill, should we have to insist in every circircumstance that the whole procedure should be repeated again and again?</P>
    <P>This Bill is not at its final Stage in the Oireachtas so the precise nature of the wording of my amendment is not critical. The Minister has many devices open to him and should think about this issue in the other House.  What I want to talk about here is not necessarily the detail of the proposal I make here but whether it should always be absolutely insisted upon that the detailed procedures should be gone through, even in the exceptional and obviously rare circumstances where some hitch develops at a very late stage. For instance, it would be particularly difficult on the natural parents and the child if they have already gone through one traumatic court investigation to have to go through the same procedure again. There are humanitarian reasons for believing that it should not be necessary to do so again and again.</P>
    <P>The nature and intent of my amendment is to avoid having repetitious and painful detailed proceedings carried through on the rare occasions when, perhaps, something fails to materialise at the end of this long process.  I move the amendment to take into account the rare occasions when the procedures do not work out in detail and to avoid great pain and great suffering.  While it is quite true to say that the interests of the child must be paramount, that does not for one second deny the possibility that there may well be conflicts and that there may well be parents who will feel aggrieved at the end of these procedures and feel that in injustice has been done to them.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely that the parents of 90 <Col N="982" /> per cent of the children who will benefit from this legislation will probably have abandoned them but it is also likely and possible that there will be occasions when there is a contest and when very difficult and painful procedures have to be gone through.  If, at the end of those difficult and painful procedures, the whole matter fails to be completed because of some circumstance or other, for instance, the accidental death of the adoptive parents, it should be possible to by-pass the unnecessary repetition of all these painful procedures.  I invite the Minister to explain to the House why, in principle at least, some sort of a procedure similar to what I propose should not be introduced. If he is prepared to concede anything, he should think about introducing an amendment in the other House to avoid unnecessary suffering both by the children and the natural parents.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I would like to second the amendment.  I agree very much with what Senator Ryan has said.  I recall the debate on the amendment earlier on during this discussion when my distinguished colleague, Senator Robinson, spoke on this amendment and, again very much in the spirit of what Senator Ryan has said, spoke about the principle of the Bill, although she had some difficulty with the precise wording.  I am sure that the Minister's advisers will consult the record and see what Senator Robinson said on that occasion.  It may very well be that some accommodation can be made in the light of the principles that Senator Ryan has illuminated for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it what he is talking about is a very compassionate thing.  He wishes to limit the delays which have a very human impact on the adoptive family and also possibly on the child.  I would say to the Minister that I understand that limbo has been virtually abolished as a theological concept.  What I understand Senator Ryan to be attempting to do in this amendment is to limit limbo under the Adoption Acts.  I am <Col N="983" /> sure the Minister will consider this because it is a Bill that has been widely welcomed.  It is an attempt by the Government to face a very important issue that affects families.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps with the indulgence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, allow myself one small comment about the importance of this Bill.  The Minister will be aware that we have had occasional spats on the Order of Business which have been very widely reported.  I remember the last time this Bill was discussed there was very significant reporting of light-hearted events but when a few of us sat here throughout the day putting down amendments and attempting to address the family, which is an important Irish concept, there was no member of the press present and no reports existed.  This was drawn to the attention of the House.  It is rather a pity that this very important debate should be neglected in this way.  I hope the Minister will not take from that that we in the Chamber take the view that the bill is unimportant.  We regard it as very important and we welcome its positive provisions.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak briefly on this matter.  Our objective in contributing to this debate is to try to ensure that as much as possible that is feasible is written into the Bill and that as many as possible of this group of children who have been neglected for so long will find suitable homes subsequent to the passing of this legislation.  I support Senator Ryan but I am not quite sure what kind of circumstance he is talking about.  I would probably be a little bit cautious about jumping over from one set of prospective adoptive parents, those who make the application and go through the court procedure, to another.  According to the conditions laid down there would have to be 12 months of fostering by any adoptive parents and I am not sure how this would be coped with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Senator's objective of reducing time and bureaucracy and the limbo situation but I am not quite <Col N="984" /> sure exactly what kind of rare circumstances he envisages.  Perhaps he is thinking along the lines of Senator O'Toole's amendment on Committee Stage in which he referred to a couple who wanted to adopt a child but the marriage broke up before the final papers were signed.  The amendment by Senator O'Toole was discussed and I think it was withdrawn.  The woman in the case we are speaking of now is no longer eligible to adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the points made by the Senators I do not intend to accept this amendment, mainly for the reasons outlined during Committee Stage of the debate here.  The amendment envisages a situation where between the time the High Court authorises the Adoption Board to make an adoption order and the time the board sits to make the order some problem arises in relation to the proposed adopters that is so serious that the board would find itself unable to make the order.  What Senators Ryan and Norris are suggesting is that in such a case it would be possible for another couple to apply to adopt by making a special short-cut application to the High Court. I doubt that such a situation would arise in practice and in fact it has never arisen in the case of the broadly similar procedure which exists under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974.  However, even if such a remote possibility were to become a reality is seems that the short circuit procedure proposed in the amendment would neither be practicable nor desirable from the child's point of view.  It must be borne in mind that the child involved will have lived with the first couple for at least 12 months and possibly much longer.  He will have bonded with them and it might be some considerable time before he could develop emotional ties with a different couple to such an extent that he could be successfully adopted.  I appreciate the Senators' concern that the child should have a permanent stable environment in which to grow up but I feel that his proposal might not be in the best interests of the child or <Col N="985" /> the adopters in the long term.  I think it would be far better if the Bill were to be left unchanged at this point and if the child were to live with the second couple for a year or more.  This would allow the child an opportunity to settle into his new home and would give some time to all concerned to assess whether his adoption by the second couple would be in his best interests.  If at that stage adoption seemed to be appropriate the second couple could make a fresh application to the High Court.  However, this need not unduly delay matters as the court would have the benefit of its previous consideration of the decision of the child and the natural parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What persuades me more than the Minister's eloquence is the reference to section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974, and the fact that problems have not arisen there.  The pure practicality of that argument is what impresses me.  I still believe that in the interests of the natural parents, and indeed of the child, the Minister should at least think about whether what I suggest is possible.  I accept that it is necessary, and I accept the reasoning behind the necessity, for the child to have lived with the adoptive parents under the circumstances for a reasonable period of time &mdash; 12 months is stated in the Bill &mdash; but it seems quite possible to build that proviso in and not necessitate a return to the courts because of some tragedy or some circumstance such as the Minister envisaged in his reply to Committee Stage about the couple being killed in an accident.  We should try to envisage these circumstances.  Given the fact that the Minister, on the evidence presented, said that these things are unlikely to happen I am not going to start an argument about it, but it is a matter that is worth pursuing.  I sincerely hope that at some stage in the future there will not be a tragedy in which a poor child has to go through court procedures a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not necessarily agree that the fact that the court has investigated the circumstances of the natural parents once will guarantee that it will not feel obliged <Col N="986" /> to go through the whole procedure again. I am not an expert on court procedures but I would have thought that evidence in court would have to be proven on each separate occasion, that they could not simply refer to the previous records but that they would have to go through the whole procedure again.  I am concerned, not necessarily that there should not be a court appearance but that the detailed assessment of people's feelings and people's capacities that was carried out once, and we are satisfied was carried out properly, should not necessarily have to be done again.  I would ask the Minister to think about the issue at some stage during the future progress of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 39 and 40, to insert &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have Senator Robinson's approval to move these amendments.  Again, they relate to an amendment I introduced on Committee Stage.  What has happened is that Senator Robinson with the considerable, to say the least, skills that she has in the area of law has attempted to meet the objective I was seeking to meet but in a way that she felt was consistent with the provisions of the Bill and indeed with the constitutional protections afforded to children and to the family. The substantial amendment is amendment No. 3 which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or, as an alternative to (I), (II) and (III) above &mdash; (IV) where the parents of the child consent to an order being made under section 3 (1) on the basis that they are unable to carry out their duty as parents towards the child and where the Court is satisfied that the parents are properly informed as to the meaning of the consent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an attempt to make provision for <Col N="987" /> adoption of children whose parents are married.  I appeal to all Members of this House to stop using the words legitimate or illegitimate.  The terminology in the law now is children whose parents are married or children whose parents are not married.  We should give an example in this House and stop using words like legitimate and illegitimate.</P>
    <P>For children whose parents are married and who consent to the adoption it seems we should not have to go through all the similar procedures of investigating people's circumstances and so on.  If, for instance, a couple are prepared to consent to an adoption then they are going to have to go into court and prove that they are unfit to be parents.  We should not force people to go through that.  I read the Committee Stage debate in which Senators expressed concern that some people might not understand the consent they were giving.  I read the arguments but I still think that circumstances could be envisaged, and they were envisaged quite well on Committee Stage, where a couple might wish to have a child adopted and might feel that adoption was in the child's best interest.  In that circumstance we should make provision for adoption by consent.  It is, after all, the normal method of adoption where the mother is not married.  I do not know why we cannot envisage a similar form of consent where the parents of a child are married. It would be quite unnecessary to go through all of the rigours of a detailed investigation where the parents are prepared to consent to the adoption.  I do not understand why we cannot allow adoption by consent in the obviously limited circumstances where a married couple approve of their child being adopted for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment that deserves to be taken seriously and deserves to be inserted into the Bill to minimise the pain of some people who will otherwise have to go through particularly painful circumstances. They will be cross-examined and scrutinised in court and have all sorts of things about themselves discussed.  If they wish to have the child adopted they <Col N="988" /> will have to give the worst possible image of themselves to a court in order to ensure that the child will be adopted.  I do not think we should presume that other people are different from ourselves.  If people come to a decision that they wish to have a child adopted it is probably largely because they are concerned about the welfare of the child and where that happens we should allow it to be done. We rely on our courts for many things and we can rely on them not to allow people to be induced or coerced into giving consent.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment.  It is better written, as one would expect from Senator Robinson, than my amendent on Committee Stage.  It incorporates what I envisaged and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I formally second this amendment.  First I wish to set the record straight.  I apologise to the Minister because in seconding Senator Brendan Ryan's previous amendment, amendment No. 1, I referred to the fact that Senator Mary Robinson had given a very illuminating discourse on this, addressing the principle, suggesting rewordings and so on.  I was incorrect.  In fact, it was the amendment we are now discussing that Senator Robinson spoke about at some length.  She has reworded this very carefully.</P>
      <P>I would like to strongly support it because I feel the procedures of investigation for a married couple who wish to allow their child to be adopted could be humiliating and degrading and could subject those parents to unnecessary distress.  I would like to echo strongly what has been said today by Senator Brendan Ryan, and in the previous discussion by Senator Robinson, that it can be an act of compassion, an act of love and an act of generosity on the part of the married parents to allow their child to be given the chance of a better life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the examples that was brought <Col N="989" /> to the attention of the House the last day, which has a certain cogency, was parents who find themselves in receipt of a HIV positive anti-body test.  It would be a responsible act on the part of the parents facing this unfortunate situation that they should make the child of their union available for adoption, an act not of callousness but of love.  The possibility was raised that some financial inducement might be involved in persuading parents to surrender a child for adoption.  I will not rehearse the arguments.  I am sure the Minister's and his advisers will consult the record of the House and see how ably this was disposed of during that debate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to comment on the final phrase: &ldquo;the court is satisfied that the parents are properly informed as to the meaning of the consent&rdquo;.  As a loyal and lawabiding citizen who respects the courts of this country, I am quite happy that the courts are capable of deciding in this case, as they already are empowered in other matters, whether adult citizens of this State are capable of giving consent.  Clearly if the parents are, for example, mentally handicapped &mdash; which was one of the instances given &mdash; the court would be able in its wisdom to decide the capacity of such parents to give consent I am happy to rely on the wisdom and judgment of the courts in this matter.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and refer to the very worthwhile debate we had on this matter on Committee Stage.  It is important that we look at this area and not dismiss it.  Neither should we cloud the issue by saying that people who make a positive decision about adoption are doing it for ulterior motives.  We do not find many unmarried mothers who are given monetary assistance, or tempted by money, to give away their children.  Unmarried mothers are very reluctant to have their children adopted and fewer unmarried mothers are giving up their children for adoption. I do not believe we will see a very large number of married parents wanting to have their children adopted, but where <Col N="990" /> there is a case it should be possible for them to do so.  There is a very strong feeling among the adoption agencies and single parent agencies on this matter, and they were very pleased that an amendment was being tabled at this stage of the debate.  I support this amendment and ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.</P>
      <P>When we discussed it before &mdash; and the Minister of State was here for that debate &mdash; he implied that there was such strong obligations on parents under the Constitution that this move could not even be countenanced.  That is very regrettable and to an extent his reply was rather censorious.  I would like to think that we would have a more open mind about it and that we could consider this case on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the points made by the Senators.  I would agree with Senator Fennell that unmarried mothers or parents of children for adoption would be very sensitive, and that it would be extremely rare that parents would wish to part with their child for a financial consideration, or for many other reasons.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment &mdash; and Senator Fennell did touch on the reason &mdash; for the reason put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden.  What the Senators are suggesting is that it should be possible for parents who feel that they are unable to care for their children to decide that the children should be adopted and that the High Court should accept this decision without question provided only that it is satisfied that the parents understand the implications of what they are doing.</P>
      <P>I would be totally opposed to such a development which I believe could have grave consequences for the stability of the family and the security of children. In any event, I believe it would not be constitutionally possible to enact such legislation.  This belief stems from the guarantees to protect the family and to respect the rights of parents contained in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution speaks of the &ldquo;inalienable right and duty of parents&rdquo;. <Col N="991" /> One of their prime duties is to care for and protect their children.  If they are unable or unfit to care for their children, the Constitution permits the State to supply the place of the parents.  That is the purpose of the present Bill.  However, the Constitution does not allow parents to simply walk away from their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Constitution describes the duty of parents as being inalienable, meaning that which cannot be given away.  Thus, it is not constitutionally possible for parents to surrender their parental duties and place their children for adoption.  In order to introduce such legislation it would be necessary to amend the Articles of the Constitution which relate to the family. This would require a referendum and it would be for the people to decide the question.  My own view is that any such change in the Constitution would not win the support of the majority of the Irish people.  That is not to say that I, or the majority of the Irish people, are indifferent or do not care about children in unhappy families.  On the contrary.  The whole thrust of our child care services is to help and support such families but I, and many others, would need a lot more convincing evidence before accepting that the adoption of children of married parents, with their consent, should be permitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the evidence of the past 20 years, if I have to choose between Senator Robinson and the Minister's advisers as to the constitutionality of something, Senator Robinson's record is good enough for me.  If Senator Robinson assures me that what she has in this amendment is in conformity with the Constitution, then I can only argue from authority on this occasion, and I will accept Senator Robinson's authority. That is the only reply I can give the Minister on the constitutional question.  The author of this amendment is one of the country's most eminent lawyers.  Therefore, I would have to accept that there is a dispute among experts as to whether it is constitutional, and indeed, there is a <Col N="992" /> dispute among experts as to whether this Bill is constitutional.  This is regrettable.</P>
      <P>The court procedures envisaged for parents who would be in the category covered by this amendment would be very peculiar.  The parents will want to have the child adopted, but the court will have to be satisfied about a lot of things. We could have a strange position where parents might not want to keep the children, but the courts might not be satisfied that they had abandoned the children under the meaning of the Bill, and we could have children stuck in a kind of limbo.  It is a peculiar concept of supporting the family to believe that we can coerce parents, who believe they are not able to do the job properly, to be good parents.</P>
      <P>I would have thought the most serious argument against our amendment would be the possibility of the offering of inducements, that is where we would have to rely on the courts to be satisfied that no such problem existed.  The Minister is being excessively rigorous, excessively legalistic and excessively patronising in the idea that we need these constitutional barriers or otherwise we might have a flood of unworthy parents abandoning their children.  My own feeling, for what it is worth, is that there are virtually no married couples in this country who would freely consent to having their children adopted.  I am convinced that there are very few single women who are pregnant who would consent to having their children adopted if they felt that their income, career and position in their families were not threatened by their pregnancy.  I doubt that there are that many what I would call free consents in the area of adoption.  An enormous number of single mothers put children up for adoption for reasons that have very little to do with their own personal circumstances and an awful lot to do with extenal objective circumstances and the way they impact on them.  If we are going to get involved in the question of consent, we are opening up a real can of worms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not something I thought up myself.  It was put to me <Col N="993" /> by people in the child care area as an important concern.  They put it to me that there would be circumstances where parents would wish, for the children's sake and for other reasons, to have a child adopted and that they should not have to go through a court procedure of satisfying the court that they are somehow unfit, unworthy, etc.  One of the extraordinary qualities a parent can have is the ability to make an enormous sacrifice for the sake of a child.  Single mothers do it all the time, and it is possible to envisage married couples making a similar sacrifice.  Therefore, it seems that we are becoming a little inflexible &mdash; although this is not a word I would associate with the present Minister &mdash; in these areas.  I think there is a good case for allowing adoption by consent.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the constitutional argument simply because I have the authority of an eminent constitutional lawyer.  The Minister is, to say the least, being a little unhelpful.  Parents who are married and who want to have their children adopted deserve our support, understanding and the compassion of being allowed to do that by a procedure which we think is fair and reasonable but does not put them through unnecessary pain and suffering. The procedures in the Bill for those parents are unnecessarily painful and difficult. <Col N="994" /> Therefore, I must insist on pressing this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 simply inserts the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, Senator Robinson, being the extremely precise lawyer she is, I am not entirely satisfied that the first amendment is only envisaged because of amendment No. 3 but I am not going to make an issue of it.  Amendment No. 3 is the critical one.  I have a funny feeling that amendment No. 2 might be necessary, even if amendment No. 3 is dropped. I put that to the Minister and his officials.  Perhaps they might think about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 9, after &ldquo;applicants&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, provided that no order under section 3 (1) shall be made solely because of the income and/or living circumstances of the parents of the child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was debated on Committee Stage.  I was not present for the debate and that is why I introduced it again.  I am very grateful to Senator Norris for standing in for me at short notice and without much assistance from me to introduce these amendments and to keep them alive.</P>
      <P>I read the debate on this amendment, which is a very simple amendment, which says that no adoption order shall be made solely because of the income and/or living circumstances of the parents of the child. Because of the way the world is developing, this amendment is becoming more and more necessary.  Twenty years ago when I first got involved in street politics, the idea that poor people were culpable because they were poor, or that poverty was primarily the fault of the individual, was a very unfashionable point of view. The world has shifted quite dramatically since then.  There is an increasing body of opinion in all levels of society, most particularly embodied in the present British Prime Minister, prepared to tell people that essentially if they are poor it is their own fault and that there is no need for anybody who has any gumption, any backbone, etc., to be poor in an opportunistic society of the kind that is developing all over North America and Europe.</P>
      <P>When those sorts of judgments are becoming fashionable, judgments which believe that poverty or consequential poor physical conditions are somehow something that people are responsible for, when we start to blame the poor for their poverty, a view that is taking hold in western society, it is easy to envisage circumstances in the future in which people will be deemed to be unfit and to have failed in their duties to their children because they are poor and because our society will take a view that if these people are poor then it is their own fault.</P>
      <P>I could envisage &mdash; and I say this with complete conviction &mdash; circumstances in which, for instance, a man was made redundant because of an industrial dispute. It could easily be said that that person caused his own poverty, caused the family circumstances which perhaps necessitated a child being put into foster care and, since the person was in his middle forties and was unlikely to be employed again, it could cause a situation in which the neglect, so defined, would continue until the child was 18 years of age.  There is no good reason for not clarifying for the courts the fact that what we mean in this legislation is not just people's income or their housing conditions alone.  Income and housing conditions are, of course, related to how people behave.  Some people will be in very bad housing because of neglect. Some people will be badly off for reasons for which they are personally culpable. The idea that in any circumstances a child should be compulsorily put up for adoption, against the wishes of his or her parents, simply because the parents are poor is one that none of us would like to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the politicians or the Members of this House or the other House who worry me.  It is the perceptions which elevated members of the Judiciary can have &mdash; I will give a simple example of this &mdash; about what it is like to be poor.  I <Col N="997" /> remember Lord Lane, during the Birmingham Six appeal, making little of the discussions among the appellants about how they would get £1 together to pay a train fare.  He could not envisage circumstances in which grown adults would worry about £1 because in his own life he had never been aware of an adult who had to worry about where he or she would get £1 from.  There are problems of perception which have to do with people's life experiences, with their experiences of poverty, with their experiences of limited income, which can result in very subjective judgments about why people are poor.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, to clarify for the courts that what we all envisage in this Bill is not simply poverty or poor living conditions.  It goes much deeper. It has to do with judgments about the characters of the people, judgments about their record in terms of how they looked after their children, given the circumstances they were in.  The income we give an unemployed couple to support a child is the sort of income which, in many cases, leaves the child less than well catered for.  The income we give people to support children is wholly and grossly inadequate.  We should make it perfectly clear to the courts that poverty, of itself, is not sufficient cause for having a child taken from his or her parents and compulsorily adopted.  Neither are physical conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, simply because a travelling family live in appalling conditions that, of itself, would justify their children being taken from them.  Many people in our society now say that the conditions in which our travelling community live are their own fault.  I do not say this.  I am sure the Minister does not and I hope Members of this House do not.  It is an increasingly widely held view &mdash; a product entirely of prejudice &mdash; that travelling families could do better for themselves if they wished, could live in better housing if they wished and could have better living conditions for their children if they wished.  If that sort of perception is abroad it is very easy to see that perception translated into judicial <Col N="998" /> judgments about the living conditions of a travelling family and their children being taken from them and put into adoption simply because they are poor and because they are living on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>I hope this is not what this Bill envisages. It should be made crystal clear in the Bill that that is not what is envisaged by the legislation.  We should not leave any shadow of doubt here.  We do not want any poor person to have his or her child removed from them simply because they are poor or because they live in bad housing.  That is not the intention and it should not be open to that interpretation. The best way to eliminate the possibility of that interpretation is to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to second this amendment.  I strongly support what Senator Brendan Ryan has said.  Having heard him today, I am glad that I appear to have interpreted his intention correctly during the previous debate when I said I felt that the intention of Senator Ryan, in placing this amendment on the Order Paper, was to ensure that there should be no discrimination against citizens of this State on the basis of financial or class background.  This is very important in the light, not just of the Constitution, but of the Constitution illuminated by the noble words of the Proclamation of Easter, 1916, which undertakes and states as an objective to cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite as uncritical an admirer of Pope John Paul II as many of the citizens of this State.  I thought there was a certain ironic level in what he said in Bolivia the other day.  He said, speaking to the poorest nation in South America, that he wished to encourage them to have more children because they should remember that children were guests at life's banquet.  A banquet in Bolivia would be a pretty meagre thing for anybody to issue an invitation to.  We, luckily, on this side of the world, as one of the most advantaged nations, should be thoroughly ashamed if we felt that there was any citizen who should be deprived under our law of any consideration simply <Col N="999" /> by virtue of what we perceive as their retrograde economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>We cannot stress strongly enough that this legislation should not be about creating a situation where the children of poor couples would be more likely to be adopted than any others.  The truth is that we are very likely to see that.  While we may not see it clearly or starkly in the context of income and material possessions, we will see it in the context of the kind of social problems that grow out of poverty, that grow out of too big a family, that grow out of the difficulties parents may have because they do not have enough money.</P>
      <P>If we look at it like that there will be parents who, in the terms of the section dealing with conditions, for physical or moral reasons, have failed in their duty towards the child.  Tracing back along the road we will find that the basic root cause would have been not enough money.  We have a difficulty there and I am not sure how a court could deal with it in the context of the phrasing of the amendment before us.  It might be possible to put an obligation on the health board to examine or establish the circumstances as they find them, to ensure that the provisions of this amendment do not apply.  If we are realistic and we look at the cases of children in care at present who are legitimate and could be adopted, we will find that somewhere along the road, in their parents' lifetime, there was a problem with money.  Unfortunately, we will see the children coming predominantly from one sector of society rather than the other.</P>

      <P>In addressing this amendment I would like to express deep regret that I was not here at an earlier stage when an amendment in my name was moved.  Unfortunately I was held up in court and could not be here.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which was considered to some extent on Committee Stage.  The view taken by those of us who contributed was that there was no problem with the value in that none of us would wish the income or living circumstances of the parents to be a predominant consideration in the matter.  As I read the section, as it stood initially and as now amended, it would not be possible for a court to make an order under section 3 solely or even predominantly because of the income and-or living circumstances of the parents of the child.  That is not what the court is being required to do by section 3 as it stands.  It is extremely important to emphasise the view of the House that that should not be a consideration.</P>
      <P>I cannot support the amendment as such because it addresses a problem that is not there under the section.  The court in deciding to make an order under section 3 has very strict criteria which must be complied with.  It also has to have regard to the rights of all the parties concerned including the constitutional rights of the child and the best interests of the child.  These are mandatory requirements, if I can put it that way, on the court.  Perhaps of more significance is the approach of the adoption board before this Act comes into operation at all because until there has been a favourable decision of the board there will not be an application to the court under section 3.  I would have more concern that the board would at all times have it in mind that the financial and personal circumstances of the parents must not be a consideration in saying: &ldquo;All else considered this is a child for which an adoption order would be made but there are difficulties and therefore it is necessary to apply under this Act to the court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to emphasise that because in the approach of the adoption board there is a concern that adoptive <Col N="1001" /> parents would be suitable adopters.  It is very important that suitability would not lay emphasis on financial criteria or being able to provide a better physical home and surroundings and environment than either the single parent in present circumstances or now the possibility where married parents would have a child placed for adoption.  Although I believe the point is worth emphasising, and I think the value is one that we all share, in my view it would not be possible, as the section stands, for the court in any circumstances to make an order solely or even predominantly because of the income and/or living standards of the people concerned.  That is not the function of the court in relation to making an order and, therefore, I do not think the amendment addresses what would be the jurisdiction of the court.  As I said on Committee Stage I accept the thrust behind it but I cannot support the amendment itself.</P>

      <P>I understand the reasoning behind this amendment.  I do not think the amendment is necessary and indeed this view has been supported by Senator Robinson both here this morning and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Senators Ryan, Norris and Fennell and the House that there is no question of children being taken away from their parents and adopted simply because their income or living conditions are considered inadequate. Section 3 of the Bill sets out the very strict criteria upon which the High Court must consider an application for adoption.  Only where parents have totally failed to carry out their duties towards their children will adoption be considered.  The fact that the parents' income or living conditions are regarded as inadequate would not of itself constitute evidence that the parents had failed in their duty.  On the contrary, in the majority of cases where a family's income or living conditions fall below the norm the parents are not in any way culpable.  I would not see it as necessary to have this amendment accepted.</P>

      <P>It is not often that I find myself on a different side of the argument from Senator Robinson but so be it, I am.  I do not perhaps have the same view of the courts that Senator Robinson has. As I read the parts of section 3 that have to do with the assessment of the parents I keep thinking in particular of members of the travelling community who perhaps settled in a house and then moved back out of the house; many members of the travelling community find living in houses quite inconsistent and incompatible with the way they want to live and tend not to be too enthusiastic about it.  I think of all those who have proposed that the travellers' children should be taken from them.  At least one member of the city council in my own city has publicly called for travellers to have their children taken from them.  We have a not inconsiderable body of something close to racist hostility towards the travelling community.  I am not persuaded that the Bill as it stands is incapable of the interpretation I would be afraid would be put on it.  There is the provision in section 3 (1) (6) that:</P>
      <P>and, if an application under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection is made and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(A)  for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the time of the making of the application, the parents of the child to whom the declaration under section 2 (1) relates, for physical or moral reasons, have failed in their duty towards the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that what you are judging there is that parents have for physical or moral reasons failed in their duty. What are physical and moral reasons? That is a matter, I think of interpretation. My feeling is not that the Minister or his officials or anybody in this House believes that physical or moral reasons mean that people are poor.  My feeling is that public opinion and the opinion generally in our society is more hostile to people who are poor now than it was 20 years ago and I <Col N="1003" /> fear that in ten years' time it will be even more hostile.  We have, for instance, a classic example in one of our newspapers today where the senior economic adviser to the Central Bank has come to the conclusion that a large proportion of unemployment in this country is voluntary. When you have eminent advisers to eminent institutions coming to conclusions like that that voluntary unemployment is effectively voluntary poverty, is effectively personally culpable unemployment, you are then getting involved in judgments about people's character.  If you begin to have a society in which people are blamed for being unemployed then everything is blameworthy.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to the position that it is possible to envisage in the way our society is shifting an interpretation being put on this which is quite different from the intention of this House in which the fact that people are unemployed or are living in a caravan on the side of the road will not be seen as an unfortunate external circumstance which we must not only regret but try to do something about, it will be seen as something for which people are responsible.  When you have an eminent economist working for the Central Bank tell the world that he believes a large proportion of unemployment in this country is voluntary, than it is possible to envisage a lot of things.  When so called experts can come to conclusions like that, how are we to be satisfied that the courts and judges who are products of our society and indeed, by the large, products of a particularly privileged part of our society, will not choose to make an interpretation like that?  If one accepts that people are by and large personally responsible for their own circumstances or their own poverty then everything else about this Bill or about the provisions here could be based on that fact.</P>
    <P>If a judge concludes that people by and large are culpable because they are poor or that their poverty is their own fault then everything else that needs to be done <Col N="1004" /> to satisfy the court about the appropriateness of making an adoption order can follow from that.  I have said frequently that many of us in politics and outside who talk about poverty used to have a position where we held the moral high ground, where being on the side of the poor, being on the side of redistribution, being on the side of those things was regarded as morally acceptable whatever about the practicalities of it.  That is shifting fast.  The whole idea that concern for the less well off and concern for the underprivileged is the most morally acceptable position to have is rapidly becoming redundant.  That is the way the world is shifting.  If our world continues to shift like that then failure for physical or moral reasons in duty towards their children could easily be interpreted as simply being the fact that people are poor.  That is why this amendment is necessary.  It is necessary to clarify something in the light of the way public perception and public opinion is changing. Neither the Judiciary nor politics is immune to the way public thought changes and, therefore, I must move this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wanted to make what I think is a point of clarification to illustrate that I am not starry eyed about the Judiciary in any way and I accept that judges are as influenced by their culture and environment as the rest of us.  If the thrust of the proposer's and Senator Ryan's argument is accepted, I still say that as it stands the amendment &mdash; I want to put this proposition because it might be a matter that could be considered when the Bill goes through the other House because it has been introduced in this House &mdash; would say that no order should be made under section 3(1) solely because of the income and/or living conditions of the parents of the child.  There <Col N="1005" /> is almost a danger that you would say it could be made not solely but significantly whereas if the issue is accepted that there is concern about the meaning of the determination that for physical or moral reasons the parents have failed in their duty, which is a matter the court would have to be satisfied on, then it would be possible to have the essence of the amendment included in a qualification of physical or moral reasons in section 1 (A) so that it could read: &ldquo;... the parents of the child to whom the declaration under section 2 (1) relates, for physical or moral reasons unrelated to the income and/or living circumstances of the parents of the child have failed in their duty towards the child.&rdquo;  That would be a way of encapsulating the concern which I accept is a genuine concern.  It is the amendment I am unhappy with.</P>
      <P>Because we are introducing a new procedure for the court and we are using a new approach of failure for physical or moral reasons, it would not be either unusual or unacceptable to qualify that by saying &ldquo;unrelated to income and/or living circumstances.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister might consider that at a later stage in the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an order is made under section 3 (1) the parents of the child shall be entitled to state their wishes as to the religion of the child and the <Col N="1006" /> Board, as far as is practicable, shall have regard to any such wishes.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am in the peculiar position, and it is not normally my role here to be the defender of religion, but the point has been made to me more than once by people, particularly people who are connected with the denominational adoption agencies, that the parents ought at least to be entitled to express an opinion on the religion of their children.  This is a legal entitlement as distinct from a procedural or administrative entitlement.  I understand that when people are giving consent they are asked the question.  It may reflect my ignorance of adoption law.  If it is my ignorance, what would disturb me is that the people who asked me to do this are people who are involved in processing adoptions and it would suggest that they do not know the adoption law too well. That is the best defence I can offer for myself.</P>
    <P>I do not think the child's religion should be paramount.  I do not think a child should be prevented from being adopted simply because the parents express a wish about his or her religion. It is far more important that the child should be in a caring and loving home.

For those of us who look at it from a detached position, what is most important is that a child should be brought up in a caring, stable, loving home.  We all also accept that the religious denomination of that caring, loving, stable home does not determine <Col N="1007" /> whether it is caring, loving or stable.

      <P>Senator Ryan has had to return to Cork and has asked me to second the amendment which I am happy to do, the amendment being:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an order is made under section 3 (1) the parents of the child shall be entitled to state their wishes as to the religion of the child and the Board, as far as is practicable, shall have regard to any such wishes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan I find it unusual myself to be supporting what may appear to be denominational rights because I am very much in favour of the separation of Church and State about which my distinguished colleague Senator Murphy spoke so eloquently the other evening in an Adjournment debate.  Nevertheless, I do think that it is part of the human and family rights of the parents to be allowed to express some wish.  I take particular interest in the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; because I think it should be a consideration but not necessarily a paramount consideration.  I believe the Minister will agree with me that the paramount interest in all these matters is the interest of the child involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say also that I hope the denominational aspects of adoption legislation will be addressed by the Government.  I do not believe they are sufficiently addressed in this Bill.  It may be, of course, that this is not the correct place to deal with this issue but I would like to feel that no prospective and appropriate adoptive family would be disbarred <Col N="1008" /> from adopting because they belonged to a minority religion, for example, and there was no child who had that particular label available for adoption.  I would also like to feel that the rights of the child were, as in this section, regarded as paramount.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the amendment, to second it, because I think it is a humane and correct procedure and because it carries its limitation &ldquo;as far is practicable&rdquo;. I do believe the parents have a right and entitlement to express an opinion about the fruits of their union and its eventual upbringing and the general ethical framework within which the child should be reared, but I think these should be considered only as far as is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by way of this amendment is an important one which requires careful consideration. Like the proposer, Senator Ryan and indeed Senator Norris, the concern may to some seem to be coming from an unlikely quarter but there is no doubt that the question of the religion of the child, the religion of prospective adopters, has been important in adoption legislation up to now.  Initially, under the 1952 Act, it was not open to parties of a mixed marriage, a mixed religious marriage, to adopt a child.  That was the subject of a constitutional case and the constitutional case was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was found to be unconstitutional under the original section 12 of the Adoption Act.  Subsequently, in the Adoption Act, 1974, a section was inserted to provide a legislative response.  The court had already said it was unconstitutional to exclude from being adopters parties to a mixed marriage but it was decided to put in a section dealing with this in the 1974 Act, that is, section 4 of the Adoption Act, 1974 which provides as follows: &ldquo;An adoption order shall not be made in any case where the applicants, the child and his parents, or, if the child is illegitimate, his mother, are not all of the same religion, unless every person whose consent to the making of the order is required by section 14 of the Principal Act or by section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1964, <Col N="1009" /> knows the religion (if any) of each of the applicants when he gives his consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a legislative response to requiring that the person consenting &mdash; normally the single mother but if the child was subsequently legitimated, it could also be the father and mother or it could in rare circumstances be a guardian of the child &mdash; had to know the religion of the prospective adopters so that in the case of a couple of a mixed marriage, or where there were different religions or no religion, that would be known to the mother placing it and would form part of the consent, part of the agreement to place and the consent to the adoption.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a similar consideration arises in these circumstances, that there should be an analogous provision. It does not seem as though section 4 of the Adoption Act, 1974, applied and I am subject to the Minister's response on that because there is not the same approach.  The court is determining a failure by the parents and determining that it is in the best interest of the child that the adoption order should be made and, therefore, it makes an order authorising the board to make an adoption order in relation to the child.  It does not seem at this stage as though the issue of raising a question relating to the religion of the child, the religion of the applicants or prospective adopters, is dealt with legislatively in this Bill.  In those circumstances, I would be interested in the Minister's response on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question.  With regard to the whole scenario of the religion of the child, religion of the natural parent or parents and religion of the adoptive parents, I would suggest that, if we were to follow the concept that the child who is adopted becomes the child of the adoptive parents in the same way as their own children would be, I would have reservations about dictating to somebody before the adoption saying what religion the child should be brought up in.  It would be unrealistic to think that the child or children of couples who were born into the <Col N="1010" /> family would be reared in a different religion from that of the parents.</P>
      <P>My instinct is to say that when parents adopt a child they adopt it and treat it as if it was of their own family.  Therefore, I have some reservations about the suggestion that the mother, the natural mother, or the parents of the child would say that they wanted the child brought up perhaps in a different religion.  Maybe I am misinterpreting or not getting the whole thrust of this amendment clearly but I would certainly think it should not be a material consideration.  I do not think that religion should be an issue at all.  I think that the consent of the parent to give for adoption and the agreement of the adoptive parents to take the child should be the only issues that should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have sympathy with the idea that the natural parent should have a say in regard to the religious education of the child, I feel that this particular amendment could give rise to difficulty and for this reason I do not propose to accept it.  My main concern is that the amendment could have the effect of drawing the Adoption Board into and requiring it to adjudicate on disputes and disagreements between natural parents and adopters as to the religious education of the child.</P>
      <P>Take the following example.  The natural parents are of religion A but the adopters are of religion B.  The natural parents indicate that they wish the child to be brought up in religion A but the adopters are not prepared to give an undertaking to that effect.  What would or should the Adoption Board do in such a situation? Should it ignore the natural parents' wishes and allow the adopters to raise the child in the adopters' religion or should the board refuse to make an adoption order in favour of the applicants unless they agree to adhere to the natural parents' wishes?  There are no easy answers to these questions.  I feel that it is neither appropriate nor desirable that the Adoption Board should have to address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I might point out that under the existing Adoption Acts the board has no role or function in regard to the religious education of the child.  That should also be the case under this Bill.  Apart altogether from this issue, I am advised that it is not necessary to make specific reference to religion in the Bill.  In the first place, some of the children who stand to benefit from the Bill will be foundlings or abandoned children and, by definition, there will be no parents available to express a view as to the religious upbringing.  In other cases, the child will have been placed by the parents with friends or relatives of their own choosing so that the question of religion will have been settled from the beginning.</P>
    <P>It is likely that in most cases the child will have been placed by the health board.  The foster care regulations provide that a health board shall not foster a child with a person who is not of the same religion as the child unless the child's parents know the religion of that person and give their consent.  In effect, therefore, the parents will have had an opportunity to indicate the religion of the person with whom the child should be placed and the child will have been living in an agreed arrangement for at least 12 months before an order is made by the court.</P>
    <P>Finally, under section 3 (1) the High Court is required to have regard to the constitutional and other rights of all the persons concerned before reaching a decision as to whether to authorise the adoption of the child.  One of the important rights which will fall to be considered in this context is the right to a religious education.  If there are any differences between the natural parents and the proposed adopters with regard to religion, this will have to be taken into account by the court in coming to a decision as to whether adoption is in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>On the specific point raised by Senator Robinson about section 4 of the 1974 Act and whether it will apply in this Bill, my advice is that it will not apply mainly because the parents may not be involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister has confirmed the view which I had expressed that section 4 of the Adoption Act, 1974, would not apply in these circumstances. It does leave a residual concern that when the matter had been dealt with by way of a court case and decided, for valid constitutional reasons, that parties to a mixed marriage must not be discriminated against, it was found appropriate to deal legislatively at that time with the situation and to require that either the single mother, or in the case of a child who had been legitimated possibly the parents, would know of the religion or different religion or lack of religion of the prospective adopters and that would be a factor in making the consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understood the Minister in his reply, he is satisfied that if the child is fostered by a health board the foster care provisions will ensure, in effect, that the child is placed with a prospective adopter or adopters who &mdash; presumably one or both &mdash; would be of the same religion and who would give an undertaking and the health board would be satisfied that the child would be brought up in the religion of that child.  That still leaves a gap; it still leaves a situation where the child had not been placed on foot of a foster care decision.  It seems to be a matter that could be looked at.  My primary concern would be to ensure that <Col N="1013" /> prospective adopters who are of different religions or perhaps one of whom is practising a particular religion and another is not, that they would not find themselves discriminated against because we fail to deal with the matter; in other words, that omission to deal with it in the legislation would not result in a discrimination.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  It would not be appropriate for the Adoption Board to interpose itself and try somehow to scrutinise or supervise afterwards what religion the child was being brought up in or whatever.  It may be that in section 2 dealing with the role of the board there could be some reference to the board satisfying itself at that early stage in the matter in a somewhat analogous terms to section 4 of the 1974 Act. I do not think the Minister's response has wholly dealt with the problem and in those circumstances I hope it is something that might be looked into later by the Minister when the Bill is passing through the other House.</P>

      <P>As I have already said, there are no easy answers to this question. I have also said that in the case of the vast majority of children who are placed under the foster care regulations, religion is taken into account.  I will see if there is a gap there and if something needs to be done about it we will consider it before the Bill comes to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 13 to 15, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Court may, of its own motion or on application to it in that behalf, make an order adding such other persons as it thinks fit as parties to proceedings under subsection (1), and may, in the case of a person added as a party to any such proceedings under this section, make such order as it considers just in respect of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the payment of any costs in relation to the proceedings that are <Col N="1014" /> incurred by the person and are not paid by another party to the proceedings if legal aid in respect of them under any scheme operated by or on behalf of the State for the provision of legal aid has been refused, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the payment by the person of any costs in relation to the proceedings that are incurred by any other party to the proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a point which was raised by Senator Robinson during Committee Stage and I promised to look into it for Report Stage. Senator Robinson was concerned that there was no provision in the Bill for the payment of costs incurred by foster parents if they were made separate parties to an application brought by a health board for an order authorising the adoption of their foster child.  The amendment deals with the situation and with the possibility of costs being incurred by other persons, for example, grandparents who might be added as parties.  It provides that where an application is made to the High Court, whether by the health board or by the foster parents acting independently, and the court decides that some other person should be added as a party to the proceedings, the court may make orders as to the payment of court costs incurred by the person added as a party that are not paid by another party or by the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the decision as to whether other persons should be added as parties to the proceedings is entirely at the discretion of the court, it is proposed that the extent and the manner in which the costs incurred by additional parties will be met will also be at the discretion of the court. I feel that this amendment meets the point raised by Senator Robinson.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having considered the debate on Committee Stage and for coming forward with this amendment.  It does seem to meet the particular point.  I think it is very important because we are devising <Col N="1015" /> quite an elaborate structure &mdash; it has to be an elaborate and difficult structure &mdash; and it would be a concern of all of us to ensure that nobody would be either debarred or feel they had a burden of a risk of legal costs where there was no provision for the court to make an order for costs at discretion.  I am very glad that the Minister has introduced this amendment. It deals with the matter in an appropriate way and I am delighted to support it.</P>

      <P>Since we joined the EC in 1973 it would be fair to say that we have been reasonably well treated as regards the allocation of regional funds. However, the internal distribution of those funds has been neither fair nor equitable.  It can be said that certain areas of the country did fairly well while others were extremely badly treated.  I refer in particular to the north west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that the west in general has been designated as a deprived <Col N="1016" /> area, and has been allocated higher headage and forestry grants than other regions.  However, on closer examination of the facts reveal that larger grants have meant that people have merely kept their heads above water and their lot has not been improved to any appreciable extent. The reason for this is clear.  Lack of political will and bureaucratic centralisation have been the culprits.  EC moneys have been retained in central funds and were doled out, not on the grounds of need and equity, but on the basis of ministerial and political clout.  They were not used to alleviate deprivation but to purchase votes.  This may be unpalatable but it must be said.  However, at least there would appear to be light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government are committed to introducing integrated rural development pilot schemes.  This is not a new development in the EC, as the Community has already funded various IRD schemes in other European areas. The scheme nearest to us and most comparable to our conditions was introduced in West Lothian in Scotland.</P>
    <P>First, we must define integrated rural development.  The main tenets of IRD involve the granting of aid to all structures in a rural community &mdash; agriculture, industry, tourism, infrastructure and services. The key word is &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;.  This will avoid the old piecemeal approach. Decisions on the programme to be followed will come from within the areas themselves.  Decision-making administration will be decentralised leaving the operation of the scheme in the hands of those on the ground.  Co-ordination of policy making will mean that all initiatives will be harmonised, cohesively and mutually re-enforcing.  The key word here is &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo;.  Central to all decisions will be the global problems of the region.  Selectivity of integration will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The question now arises as to which areas will be selected for the pilot scheme.  There is a wide choice and every area will be able to put up a strong case for itself.  I suppose it is inevitable that I <Col N="1017" /> shall make a case for the north west region, or failing that for an entire county, Leitrim.  I know I will be immediately accused of parochialism but if fighting for a county which has been shamefully treated for many years results in my being called parochial then I will gladly accept the tag.  In any case, I am sure the House will see that my case is justified.</P>
    <P>County Leitrim fits into every set of criteria laid down by the EC for inclusion in the Delors Plan.  The county is 93 per cent rural and 7 per cent urban.  Its youth population is being eroded daily because of emigration, as there is no alternative. There is a grave danger that there may not be a new viable generation and we would end up with an almost totally ageing and dependent population.  There are regional disparities within the county also.  The better land, the larger population and the greater number of industries are in the south.  In the north of the county the population is disappearing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>When one contemplates disintegration of an entire county one's first reaction is incomprehension, then disbelief and finally anger.  For those of us who know the situation and are daily confronted with the bald statistics the final stage of anger is not difficult to understand.  Perhaps the most galling fact of all is that the situation can be reversed by a simple act of political will.  Leitrim's population of 27,000 people, the diversity of small scale activity in the county and the fact that there is a disincentive geographically makes it ideal for this scheme, it is small enough to be easily monitored, yet large and diverse enough to be a useful test of the philosophy of integrated development. The county is blessed with wonderful and committed county development team.  Also, almost every parish has a development organisation funded by people who, despite fighting odds, still fight, hope and plan.</P>
    <P>I refer to two recent reports.  The 1987 report of An Foras Talúntais states that: The core problem in rural areas is a high dependence on farming and a lack of non-farm occupational opportunities.  I also refer to the Irish Farmers' Association <Col N="1018" /> report of January 1988 entitled &ldquo;Proposals for Re-assessment and Reforms of Policy on Regional Development&rdquo;.  The report calls for: (1) the establishment of a regional authority; and (2) financial autonomy and direct access to funds. Both of these authoritative and comprehensive reports make an unanswerable case.  My only difference with them would be on the question of scale at this stage.  A region might be a bit unwieldy for a pilot scheme and hence my proposal for an area of manageable proportions and unquestionable need, namely, Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the West Lothian region of Scotland as an example of the IRD at work on a pilot basis.  Reading the interim report on their progress, one is immediately struck by a similarity to the north west and areas like Leitrim. Their aims are: the provision of increased employment by attracting new industry; the encouragement of indigenous potential; the development of tourism industry; the updating of the infrastructure; and the removal of all forms of environmental dereliction, thereby making their area more attractive to tourists and industry. Above all, they will provide an integrated and competent marketing structure for the entire region.  One might easily be talking of an area like County Leitrim.  That is the case I would like to make for the inclusion of Leitrim in a pilot scheme for the integrated development programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Reynolds on the very strong case he has made for the inclusion of County Leitrim in the pilot programme for integrated rural development. It would please me greatly if it were possible to accept his plea for the inclusion of the entire county in the pilot programme but, unfortunately, that is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for the pilot programme were drawn up in consultation with the EC Commission.  One vital criterion which was laid down was the size of the pilot areas which participate in the pilot <Col N="1019" /> programme.  The target population was 5,000, or thereabouts, which for many areas corresponds broadly with administrative rural districts.</P>
    <P>The selection process involved the elimination of major urban areas and their hinterlands.  The programme is genuinely geared to the problems of rural development and the selection process reflected this objective.  That done, the aim of the selection process was to come up with as wide a representative mixture of rural areas as possible.  We were limited in our choice to a relatively small number of areas.  The funding arrangement discussed with the EC was based on around ten such sub-regions.  While some of the areas chosen span the border between two counties, being limited to this number has meant that half the counties of Ireland, with perfectly valid claims for a pilot area, could not be included in this particular programme.  I am extremely pleased, however, that Manorhamilton district in County Leitrim has been included as that county has particular problems so forcefully presented by the Senator.</P>
    <P>The Manorhamilton area is a reasonably good example of the economic and social difficulties that obtain in County Leitrim.  The experiences gained from the operation of the pilot programme in the Manorhamilton area will serve as a very good example for the needs of County <Col N="1020" /> Leitrim as a whole.  It may be reassuring for Senator Reynolds to know that the Government have placed a definitive time limit of two years on this pilot study. It is the intention that the experience gained from this programme be applied on a nationwide basis so that all rural areas can be facilitated to improve their economic and social developments.  I imagine the experience gained in Manorhamilton will be a key input in future developments in the Leitrim area as, indeed, will the experience gained in the other pilot areas that have been selected around the country.</P>
    <P>When the IRD is applicable nationwide, it is obviously intended that the experience gained from the operation of the pilot schemes which have been selected will form the basis for the thrust and for the approach of the application of the integrated rural development programme. In the context of the social and economic difficulties that apply in rural Ireland, the introduction of this programme will be of very considerable benefit. Quite obviously it will take some time to get the co-ordination that will be so necessary for the different groupings to get together.  In time they will, and it will herald a bright future for rural Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 May 1988.</P>
