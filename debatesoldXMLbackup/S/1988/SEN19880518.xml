      <P>On the Order of Business, I do not have a problem with what has been outlined by the Leader of the House, but could I avail of the opportunity to extend the congratulations of this House to Séan Kelly on his magnificent victory in the Tour of Spain. Whereas the business of the House precluded me from being with him in his celebrations in Carrick-on-Suir last night, I was rather disappointed that the Taoiseach did not fly out to meet him in Spain. Is it because he was not a Dub?</P>

      <P>Thug an tréimhse 17 bliana ó bhí an Bhliain Eorpach um Chaomhnú againn athraithe i gcrích ar baol iad don dúlra.  Chiallaigh ár mballraíocht sa Chomhphobal Eorpach gur mhéadaigh go tapaidh ar fhorbairt na talmhaíochta de thoradh dheontais an Chomhphobail i leith draenála i leith úsáid bhreise a bhaint as leasú tacair agus le haghaidh talamh a thabhairt chun míntíreachais, rud nár chuaigh ár dtalamh riascach, ár dtalamh féaraigh ná ár móintigh saor uaidh.  Dúshaothrú ár bportach an toradh a bhí ar an dá ghéirchéim i gcúrsaí fuinnimh.  An méadú mór a tháinig ar an daonra sna seachtóidí chuir sé brú orainn na reigiúin fhiáine &mdash; na háiteanna úd a shíleamar nárbh fhéidir a athrú &mdash; a fhorbairt chun go dtiocfaimís <Col N="1143" /> ar réiteach na bhfadhbanna tionscail, tithíochta agus easpa láithreacha dramhaíle. Polasaí náisiúnta i leith chaomhnú an dúlra agus sin amháin a réiteoidh na fadhbanna sin.</P>
      <P>Go nuige seo is beag má tá forbairt tagaithe ó aird ar bith ar pholasaí dá leithéid.

Is é is cuspóir don cháipéis seo go mbeadh sé ina chéad chéim i dtreo athrú a thabhairt i gcrích.  Táthar ag tnú go spreagfaidh sé polasaí oifigiúil náisiúnta i leith chaomhnú ár n-oidhreachta dúlra agus go mbrostóidh sé chugainn údarás Stáit a bheidh láninniúil ar pholasaí caomhnaithe dá leithéidh a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here today and I would like to thank the Leader of the House, Senator Michael Lanigan, and the Fianna Fáil Whip, Senator Willie Ryan, for treating the discussion on this policy document as a matter of urgency.  I would also like to thank Senator Maurice Manning and all the other Senators who have taken an interest in this document &ldquo;A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland&rdquo;.  It is a very recent publication. The Taoiseach felt it was sufficiently important to launch it himself at the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has been filming the Irish landscape for quite a number of years &mdash; some would say since the end of the last Ice Age but 20 years or so might be a more accurate figure &mdash; I can see the changes in the countryside, step by step, and the gradual destruction of so many beautiful places on this island of ours. Much of what has happened is, undoubtedly, through lack of awareness of nature and of the environment and a single-minded approach towards the treatment of our natural resources.  The most obvious examples of the destruction of the countryside in recent months are those of our polluted rivers and lakes, but there are other less obvious examples.  Take agriculture, which maximises its use of the land for the production of a number of crops, frequently to the detriment of <Col N="1144" /> nature including that of the soil upon which agriculture itself depends.  Likewise, forestry maximises timber productivity to the detriment of whatever other uses that land can have.  These single land use activities have in recent times acquired the potential for even greater impact through the use of chemicals and more sophisticated machinery. If we had had a national policy for nature conservation, much of the destruction we now see would not have taken place. Politically, the environment has always been on the bottom rung of the ladder, the reasons being that the benefits have not always been tangible, the lack of awareness and the single-minded approach to making profit regardless of the consequences.</P>
    <P>Ireland's countryside is very much a man-modified environment.  We should incorporate a policy for nature conservation into all aspects of our activities. If somebody were to ask me to define conservation, my answer would be that it is the wise management of our environment and its natural resources.  Some people might be of the opinion that conservation means feeding peanuts to greenfinches.  Conservation also implies that future generations should not have to pay for our mismanagement.  This is a wide-ranging document.  It is hopefully the beginning of what will be for all the political parties and organisations, a reasonable approach towards incorporating a national conservation strategy into their policies.  The Government must form a single Department, without conflicting interests, to be responsible for all aspects of nature conservation.</P>
    <P>The danger for any conservation body, including a Government agency, is the conflict that may arise when there is a commercial aspect to any of its operations. For example, in the past areas which were listed by the Wildlife Service as habitats of national importance were just taken over by the Forestry Department, and drained.  Indeed, at one stage, listing an area was equal to sounding its death knell, because Forestry seemed to take those areas first as soon as they were listed and then drain them in case they <Col N="1145" /> might be taken over by the Wildlife Service. Areas of blanket bog listed as being of national importance and of great scientific value were given over for private turf development, and funded with both Government and EC money.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants to see an example of that on our doorstep, one has only to go up to the area around the Sally Gap where that is happening at the moment. This is a most important area not alone for its value to those people who might like to just go and look at it, but every college in the county of Dublin uses it as a study area.  The most important priority must be the protection of these habitats which are of special scientific national and European importance.  These areas are not protected under the Wildlife Act. An amendment to the Act is necessary to protect these habitats.</P>
    <P>Conflicts between land use agencies should be resolved and where possible attempts should be made for an integrated approach, for example, forestry, tourism, agriculture and wildlife should work together.  If I mention the scenic areas which are being ruined by afforestation Minister, you will understand what I mean.  Conservation, of course, is not the sole prerogative of Government or of any of its agencies.  It belongs to society as a whole.  It is most important that conservation activities should be engaged in by as many in society as possible, including both private and public sectors.  Where European Community grants and funding are available, every effort should be made to utilise them. Voluntary bodies should be given every encouragement, as they increase public support.  We have a good example in Holland, where Government funding for conservation projects received wide public support.  I feel that this is most important because unless we have the support of the public, we are on to a loser.</P>
    <P>The relevance of conservation needs to be demonstrated.  For example, much of the conservation work being carried out by Government Departments goes largely unnoticed.  Greater public awareness of the valuable activities of members of <Col N="1146" /> the Minister's own Department would be helpful in generating public awareness of the Government's work in relation to the countryside and its wildlife.  There are numerous worthwhile projects emanating from the Minister's Department, which deserve more publicity.  I have given the Department quite a lot of publicity down through the years but I feel that they could generate a lot more publicity for themselves if they were to let the public know what these projects are. Many of them are well worth seeing. Most of the people of Ireland do not really know that these projects are being carried out by the Department.</P>
    <P>This document &ldquo;A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland&rdquo; provides valuable guidelines.  It also makes us aware of the urgent need to conserve what is so valuable in this beautiful country of ours. Putting a policy document together is no big deal.  Third World countries have policy documents.  If they can have policy documents, surely we can have them. This one here &ldquo;Protecting the Environment &mdash; The Conservation Strategy for Victoria&rdquo; has Government support.  It is a simple document.  It is not complicated. The population of Victoria could be compared to the population of Ireland.  I suppose there could be one million or so people in the difference.  This, of course, has Government support.</P>
    <P>The kind of policy document we do not want is this kind of policy document which is &ldquo;The Conservation and Development Programme for the UK&rdquo;, which was a response to the world's conservation strategy publication and was prepared with the advice, co-operation and financial assistance of the World Wildlife Fund, UK Countryside Commission, The Royal Society of Arts, Nature Conservation Council, Countryside Commission for Scotland and the Council for Environment Conservation. It is too unwieldy.  It is a complete turnoff. It does not have Government support. A publication on policy for the environment which was published here in 1980 has never been heard of since.  It was published and that was the end of it. I think that it did not set any firm targets. <Col N="1147" /> It just discussed various issues, but we never heard any more about it.  I do hope the Minister will see his way to putting together a policy based on what we have here, &ldquo;A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants for the hours of work and dedication spent in putting this worthwhile document together.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin arís failte a chur roimh an Aire agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis as ucht teacht anseo, agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leatsa freisin, a Chathaoirligh as ucht éisteacht leis an chaint ar fad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator de Buitléar in congratulating the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants on the production of this document &ldquo;Our National Heritage&rdquo;, which is a policy for major conservation in Ireland. For 17 years, since the European Conservation Year, there have been many changes which posed threats to nature and they are outlined in this document. Accession to the EC has brought about the diversification of agriculture, EC funding for drainage, increased use of fertiliser on land, and land reclamation have all affected our wetlands, our grasslands, our moorlands and other habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the authors of this document is that responses to these threats have been inadequate at a time when there is a public awareness of conservation. There has been a rapidly growing economic crisis which has led to public sector spending cutbacks across the board.  As a result, programmes that might have helped to protect and conserve have been curtailed severely.  The authors in their document suggest that the only way to overcome these problems is by a national policy for national conservation. The document sets out the first steps towards change.  It is hoped that it may encourage the formation of an official national policy on conservation of our national heritage.  The policy document draws on a wide range of expertise <Col N="1148" /> and makes 31 recommendations.  As Senator de Buitléar has said, it is a wide-ranging document.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about two of the recommendations.  One deals with pollution.  Ireland is still widely regarded as being unpolluted.  This perception is under challenge.  The document gives examples of the fish kills in lakes which we experienced last year.  It points out the death of Lough Sheelin. We must be thankful to RTE and the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme some weeks ago when they did an excellent programme on the death of Lough Sheelin. At this time of the year Lough Sheelin was a haven for fishermen with the Mayfly, but that is passed.  The document points out that damage to the environment can be minimised or prevented by good planning, combined with strict enforcement of pollution controls. Unfortunately, pollution in Ireland is haphazard and reflects the lack of public interest in it.  Local authorities are mainly responsible for implementing controls. Now they lack the resources.  Their authority is further compromised by the fact that sometimes they are major polluters themselves.</P>
    <P>The document recommends that the only long-term remedy is to separate enforcement and educational functions from local authorities and to transfer them to an organisation whose major concern is environmental protection.  The document recommends that a single Government Department should be responsible for all aspects of major conservation and environmental protection. This should include pollution control, use of the countryside for recreation and leisure and for two important economic sectors, namely, tourism and fisheries.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation in the document relates to State forests.  The document pays a glowing tribute to the Office of Public Works for the work they have done, from a modest beginning in 1932, in the establishment of a network of national parks.  We all enjoy these as we pass through the countryside.  It is the opinion of the authors of the document that there is urgent need for national <Col N="1149" /> parks' legislation.  The establishment of new parks rests mainly on enabling legislation. New legislation should be framed in such a way as to provide effective protection for nature within national parks.  The authors would like to see the establishment of national parks in Irish law as a distinct category or protected area complementing nature reserves.</P>
    <P>Over the next few years recovery of both tourism and agricultural renewal will depend on conservation.  We must conserve now to underpin our economy in the longer term and to hand on our heritage intact to future generations.  The 31 recommendations in this report are a first step towards that goal.  For that reason I welcome the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am very glad to have the opportunity of making a contribution to this very important aspect of our life in general &mdash; our natural heritage and the conservation problems associated with it.  By and large there is a somewhat ambiguous, even contradictory, attitude towards conservation, whether it deals with the natural or other aspects of our heritage.  On the one hand there is goodwill but, on the other, conservationists are often portrayed as cranks, people with a negative outlook whose main role seems to be hindering or preventing normal development.  Such interpretation is largely due to the fact that people may not be fully acquainted with what conservation is all about.  In short, it is a caring approach to a resource or resources so that it or they can be maintained for utilisation by the community as a whole.  The destruction of a particular glacial feature, for instance, the moraine at Galtrim, County Meath, may provide short term gains and infuse finance into an area, but the same gains could most likely be achieved by exploiting a gravel pit virtually in the next field.  Destruction does not provide long term gains, but a comprehensive approach where all aspects of our natural resources are looked at without discrimination would be an enriching factor in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have an open-minded approach to conservation.  The natural <Col N="1150" /> heritage has many merits.  There is no need for any individual or group to approach any issue or problem associated with it in a confrontational spirit.  Of course, there are problems.  I am sure the Minister is better aware of these than most of us.  In this connection I would &mdash; and it would be very unfair not to &mdash; pay tribute to the Government and to the Minister's Department for what is being achieved and what has been achieved in conservation.  We must try to create a greater awareness for our natural heritage, encompassing as it does botany, geology and zoology.  It stands at the core of the discipline of natural science and provides the primary material for academic study.  It is much wider as it can provide interest and pleasure for everyone and also contribute to our economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>It is in this wider context that I welcome this policy document on our natural heritage by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  The union are deserving of our compliments and thanks for their initiative.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for producing this thought-provoking report, but also something that is aurhoritative, as the personnel involved have first hand information and appreciation of the problems and, as it is clear from the report, a concern for the state and well-being of our natural heritage.  To have this collective opinion on prospects for nature conservation in the Twenty-six Counties is most valuable.  What we have before us is a carefully thought-out document that provides us with sensible and balanced conclusions.  We are fortunate in having, within the various Departments of State, persons of such calibre, concern and commitment.  In discussing our natural heritage I would also like to pay tribute to various voluntary bodies such as An Taisce and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy who have been doing trojan work in this field.  They, too, deserve our thanks and gratitude.</P>
    <P>As Ireland in its present form is the product of many millions of years of evolution and alteration involving natural <Col N="1151" /> but, within comparatively recent times, human agencies, today's landscape is to a large extent an artefact as it has been modified and changed by man over thousands of years.  As Professor Robin Butlin in his book on Ireland has recently put it: &ldquo;The Irish landscape has all the fascination of a well-cut diamond and, like such a diamond, owes much of its interest and individuality to the work of man.&rdquo; From their arrival man and woman manipulated and exploited the natural environment.  At the outset, this consisted of hunting animals and gathering plants for food supply, and soon to follow was forest clearance to facilitate farming practices.  Since then farming, industry and other developments have been constantly trying to maximise the return for investment in every piece of land.</P>
    <P>What is happening today is a continuation of what started as simple beginnings back 10,000 years ago during the mesolithic age but within this century the speed and intensity of change in the countryside in terms of development of the landscape has been greater than at any previous time.  New farming methods, often involving large machinery, bring into use land previously considered as unproductive.  Fertilisers harm wildlife, bogs are being exploited and large scale gravel extraction is taking place but, of course, these works have to continue.  The countryside cannot be sterilised and in comparison with some other European countries the area of our country is fairly large &mdash; 32,000 square miles &mdash; so there should be plenty of space.  Despite this, we should not allow a free-for-all attitude to dominate as this leads to development that brings about unnecessary disfigurement to and the destruction of the natural heritage sites. In my opinion most people consider as desirable a landscape that retains its natural beauty.  As a result there appears to be a growing support for nature conservation. I would like to think that a tide of change seems to be taking place.</P>
    <P>People are also realising that the natural and, in addition to that, the man-made heritage is a resource in its own <Col N="1152" /> right and that we should have a positive approach to it.  It has benefits.  What is required from the point of view of conservation is a balanced approach and not conflicting demands.  I should think that interested parties will discover a lot of common ground.  It is often forgotten that nature is one of the factors that underpin our economy.  It is the beauty stemming from nature that is so attractive to visitors. It is a key factor in the promotion of the tourist industry and in providing interest and variety for the visitors when they arrive.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, all conservationists experience negative responses.  Too often, no matter how good or rational their case, they are considered as cranks, people living in an unreal world who are not tuned in to the practical needs of the community.  Their work is often considered as something irrational and irrelevant.  In this context, the UPTCS report is very timely.  It is not a document that is simply reacting to events.  On the contrary, it is the product of care in preparation and in publication. From the splendid colour photographs alone one cannot fail to be impressed by the nature and range of the material, its diversification and variety, but at the same time we must not be complacent. We must remember that the native Irish population of plants, animals, birds and amphibians is poorer than in many other European countries and, furthermore, out of that relatively small number some, like the giant Irish elk and more recently the wolf, became extinct while at this very moment others are endangered. This small number of native species, coupled with destruction, shows how essential conservation is.  It is, therefore, sad to learn from the report that there is a lower level of environmental awareness in Ireland than in other west European countries.</P>
    <P>The broad theme of the document is positive.  It makes a plea for a better overall appreciation of our natural heritage. This involves the creation of a consciousness among the public and politicians.  In fact, it is an attempt to bring about an attitude leading to creative <Col N="1153" /> conservation, thereby reconciling conservation and development.  It is my opinion that this report is very well structured. Under various headings the document breaks down and reviews the components and, at the end, produces, as Senator Doyle has pointed out already, 31 main recommendations.  Taking the overall picture, it seems rational and sensible to say that a balance between development and conservation must be attained.  To do so it is first necessary to isolate the problems.  If we take one item dealt with in the report, it is clear that there is mismatching in land use and I would agree that the policies should be evalued in order to ensure land suitability.</P>
    <P>We all realise how vital agriculture is to the well-being of the country but some associated developments, such as the building of roads or trackways stretching up the side of mountains seem, to say the least, bizarre.  But in agriculture, as in other matters, changes are inevitable.  At least part of a solution may be found in the designation of environmentally sensitive areas under the EC auspices.</P>
    <P>I understand that already there are plans to designate such areas in parts of the Mourne Mountains in County Down. If that proves successful let us hope that the scheme can be extended to other parts of the country.  What may be more effective is a greater diversification of farming practices.  In some areas it is impossible for straightforward agriculture to provide an adequate return for both the human and financial investment vested in it.  We do tend to classify our lands by using an agricultural criterion or categorisation.  What are often described as poor lands may only be poor for agriculture as they have other potential such as for tree planting and for scenery.  Forestry itself presents problems both with harvesting and renewal.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a very important aspect of the report, the role that education can play in the creation not only of an awareness among the public but also an official awareness.  Indeed a great deal of harm has been done by State agencies and local authorities and there <Col N="1154" /> is no excuse for that.  Therefore, as the report advocates, the greatest co-ordination possible of the activities of diverse bodies and the development of that co-ordination between them is a matter of importance.</P>
    <P>Among other issues raised in the document two are of considerable importance, at least from my point of view.  One of these is the question of organisation, the other the man-made heritage and that is the point that is taken up on page 26 of the report.  From the natural science point of view Ireland, like every other country, is not static but in the process of continuous evolution and, in this, climatic change played a major role.  In this connection it is important to remember that it was just after the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, that Ireland witnessed a biological change of considerable magnitude which led to, and continues to lead to, profound demands on the natural heritage and consequently alters it.</P>
    <P>I, of course, refer to the introduction of a new species and that species is none other than man.  No more was the natural heritage to be autonomous after this event.  Nature now had a competitor and alongside it was developing a man-made heritage.  Human aims and aspirations were providing a challenge and continue to do so for the very good reason that man differs from all the other species in that he has emancipated himself from a pattern imposed by nature.  But every advancement and every requirement endangers nature while, in addition, man's exertions over the centuries have even destroyed many of those features that were the product of his own creation. Nevertheless, there is continuing interplay between the aspirations of man and environing nature.  The man-made heritage is thus an integral part of the valued whole but it is a finite resource that cannot be renewed.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, very pleased to note that the report correctly recognises that there are strong links between both, and cogent arguments can be put forward for maintaining them.  For instance, both the <Col N="1155" /> natural heritage and the man-made heritage constitute an important aspect of our national identity.  Educationally, the heritage is most valuable and what is also of great importance is that it can stimulate local interest and awareness throughout the country as it virtually penetrates into every parish, even into every townland. The heritage provides for leisure and recreational activities and, especially from the point of view of tourism, our heritage offers something special, even unique.</P>
    <P>In our heritage we have something of major commercial and economic value. It may not be possible straightaway to reduce this to a figure on a balance sheet but that does not mean that there are no direct economic advantages as the spinoff from tourism is extensive and not only from the point of view of, say, hotel accommodation.  What is very important from the regional point of view is the fact that heritage can minimise the leakage of income from tourists and maintain spending within local economics.  If we consider heritage as having a commercial component, there is no need for conflict between heritage conservation and utilisation and other developments.  Both are part of a wider development process and, as such, can easily be reconciled.  Should we consider, as the document suggests we might, the possibility of looking at the national and man-made heritage together, then we can return to the problem of organisation.</P>
    <P>The document rightly aims high.  Heritage matters should be the concern of a single Government Department with a Minister.  As the report rightly points out, natural heritage matters are currently the concern and responsibility of about five different Ministers, and if you add archaeology, the number increases further. In short, this is anarchy, something that hinders development and it is probably also &mdash; and this is quite important &mdash; wasteful financially.  I support the view that Government responsibilities need to be reorganised if dynamic programmes for the care and study of the natural and, indeed, the wider man-made heritage are <Col N="1156" /> to be implemented.  To overcome these problems, the view is put forward in the report that there should be a national policy but to do that a new organisation and structure is a prerequisite necessity.</P>
    <P>I hope it is relevant for me to recall that a National Heritage Bill was introduced and debated in this House in 1982. The aim of that Bill was to bring together closely related functions that were being carried out within different Departments and in so doing to produce a much needed separate identity for our heritage, but also to provide room for greater freedom of action as the governing structure envisaged in that Bill consisted of a council that would have both executive and advisory roles.  At least from my point of view, this Bill was a breath of fresh air.  It occasioned hope and expectation.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days I took the opportunity of reading all the Seanad debates from both sides of the House. Each and every contribution was based on a careful analysis of the issues.  Constructive views were put forward and Senators expressed their happiness and delight with the Bill and extended a welcome to it.  For the first time our heritage was elevated to a high plane in Government thinking.  Furthermore, the whole concept was innovative.  It was the product of a new pattern of thinking.  If I may again mention one aspect which is touched on in the report, at least from the archaeological point of view that Heritage Bill of 1982 would have removed the inhibiting attitudes which have their origins in the Ancient Monuments Bill of 1882 and which, believe it or not, still form the basis for all archaeological legislation.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, consider that it is necessary to have new organisational structures, as the report mentioned, but these structures must emanate from fresh thinking and new ideas.  The Heritage Bill to which I have referred brought us to the threshold of a brave new heritage world, but the moment of fulfilment has not yet arrived.  However, hope lives on and expectations are still nursed.</P>
    <P>To achieve this overall national plan we need a further instalment of new ideas <Col N="1157" /> as well as the will and in this connection the UPTCS report is most relevant.  Slow and piecemeal approaches that have hitherto been the practice are unacceptable. The doing of little is worse than the doing of nothing because it may appear that something worthwhile is taking place. Neither is it adequate to transfer heritage functions from one Minister to another. Such chess games or minor reorganisations will do little to improve the situation.  It should be supplanted by a more dynamic approach, an approach that would lead to the establishment of an effective state service which would allow the full potential of our natural and archaeological resources to be exploited. This should not be inhibited on the grounds of bureaucratic or financial expediency.  An integrated structure should emerge which should provide a better working environment in which the talents and commitments of the staff, many with international reputations, could be more fully utilised and realised.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, better value could be provided for the money allocated.  It is hardly necessary to say that funding is and always has been inadequate.  The UPTCS report calls for a minimum investment of £9 million per year on the natural heritage.  I am not in possession of precise figures but, for this current financial year, close to £4 million has been allocated to parks.  If we add to that the funding of the Wildlife Service, the natural history division of the National Museum and inland waterways, we arrive at a figure fairly close to that £9 million. One may ask are we getting full value for this expenditure.  Can we ever get full value for it or, indeed, for any other expenditure until we bring about a rational working structure?  Despite the fact that the natural and man-made heritage of Ireland is not something that one can quantify in monetary terms it is, nevertheless, one of the most valuable resources we possess.  Elements of it are unique and much of it, once damaged or destroyed, can never be replaced.  We may, therefore, ask why should we unnecessarily render ourselves poorer.</P>
    <P>To call for a better overall appreciation <Col N="1158" /> of our heritage seems to be saying the obvious.  I believe that there is a political commitment to do something worthwhile. <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 February reported the Taoiseach as saying during the course of his Ard Fheis address that new approaches are needed for Irish culture. He then went on to say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Until now our effort to guard our national heritage from destruction and to increase public consciousness of it have been unco-ordinated and intermittent. To bring a new coherence to our efforts the Government has decided to set up a National Heritage body which will have responsibility for archaeology, heritage architecture, parks, monuments and other national amenities.</P>
    <P>In this light the Heritage Bill of 1982 must not be allowed to become a historical curiosity, a might have been, something that might be used in the future by a historian of our heritage.  It must, on the other hand, be made a living and working reality so as to provide our natural and archaeological heritages with a secure future and with their well-being guaranteed. If this was brought about, it would be the best tribute that could be paid to this important report.  Beir bua agus beannacht leis an obair.</P>

      <P>It is with pleasure that, on behalf of the Labour Party, I support the motion.  Although our names are missing from the list of Senators who wish to have the House note this report, <i>A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland,</i> our concern and commitment to this area should not be doubted.  We were not, unfortunately, afforded an opportunity to append our signature to lend our support to the motion, possibly because we were not available at the time it was lodged.  I do not want any ambiguity to arise about our total commitment in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has given us great pleasure here this morning to hear two Senators, Senator Eogan and Senator de Buitléar, contributing to this debate and to this whole area in which they are privileged to be involved directly, one as a lecturer and <Col N="1159" /> the other as a communicator.  Jointly and separately they have raised the awareness of the people in Ireland of the tremendous heritage we have here but which is in danger of being ruined or spoilt by some people who do not have the common interest as we, as legislators, have in presenting the case which has been documented adequately and expertly by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  Both my colleagues have done major work in this area and I want to congratulate them on their interest and on the expertise they have brought to this subject.  It would be remiss of me if I did not congratulate the Minister and his Department who, in their own way, have made a major contribution to the preservation of some of our archaeological gems.  Over the years, and at considerable expense, they have painstakingly renovated and preserved some of the best monuments not alone in this country but in Europe and that has been recognised internationally. It is appropriate that the Minister and his Department should be commended for that.</P>
    <P>I was a member of this House when the legislation Senator Eogan referred to was presented.  The Wildlife Act, 1976, was major legislation which was discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas over a long period.  For the first time an effort was made to bring all the species of fauna and flora into the legislative process to make us aware of their importance and to give legislative effect to their preservation. The Water Pollution Bill of 1982, the Litter Bill and other such Bills, which gave legislative responsibility to the local authorities to take action against some of the vested interests who continued to damage our environment, were all very important and assisted us as legislators in making the public aware of what can happen to our beautiful environment.</P>
    <P>This documentation presented by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants is magnificent.  I congratulate them and their financial supporters who helped to sponsor the production of this policy document which is magnificently <Col N="1160" /> illustrated.  It brings vividly to our minds some of the beauties which are in danger. It points out in various sections what pollution can do and what it looks like to the naked eye.  It makes us keenly aware that, if something is not done, as outlined by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, we could be in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the visual impact of these photographs which is tremendous.  It is appropriate that I mention a particular programme shown by RTE 2 on the same night the Eurovision Song Contest was shown on Channel 1.  The latter programme showed interesting parts of Ireland to 600 million viewers throughout the world, but on Channel 2 there was a magnificent projection of Ireland as a whole.  The programme dealt with our authors, poets and the parts of the country they came from.  It was one of the most magnificent presentations I have ever seen on Telefís Éireann and it made me very proud to be Irish and to know we have such beauty surrounding us.</P>
    <P>That, in itself, must make us aware, of the risks to our national environment which industrial and agricultural pollutants are creating.  As we advanced in technology and in intensive farming procedures, there are risks to the environment unless precautions are taken and there is no excuse whatsoever, financial or otherwise, for not taking these precautions. If the farming organisations need assistance to take some of the required preventive measures, the Department of Agriculture and Food should assist them.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for the damage that has been caused by silage effluent and other pollutants which kill fish life in what were some of the most prolific fishing rivers in Europe &mdash; the Suir, the Aherlow, the Blackwater and many other magnificent rivers.  With underground seepage from rain and drains, these additives and pollutants eventually seep into river beds and create tremendous problems. Silage effluent is foremost in everybody's mind because it is considered to be toxic.  Of course, it is not toxic.  Only <Col N="1161" /> when it gets into fresh water where it destroys the oxygen is it toxic.</P>
    <P>Farmers are becoming aware of the feed value of silage effluent which, if it is contained and gathered, can be refed and reprocessed with nutritional benefits to milch cows.  This has been done by research institutes in Ireland, and at ACOT's regional service in Piltown. There is no reason why a nutrient like silage effluent should be allowed to pollute water when it can be reprocessed into the feed chain.  We can make people aware of these benefits, and the Department of Agriculture and Food have a major role to play in this area.  Highlighting particular sections and reminding them of their responsibilities can often result in the section of the industry concerned with these matters over-reacting.</P>
    <P>Industry is also a major pollutant.  I have seen in my own constituency evidence of widespread pollution of the air and the rivers by effluent from industry. The fines imposed for polluting our rivers are very low.  It has taken our county council, who have an administrative role in the protection of the environment, the best part of a year and a half to convince one of the largest and best finance companies of their responsibilities in this area.  Admittedly corrective measures are expensive, but it is technically possible to do something about pollution.  In my view, industry, agriculture and all of us, have a responsibility not to disregard what is recognised internationally as a great asset.</P>
    <P>Experts from other countries come to look at our boglands and speak about them in euphoric terms but most of the Irish just walk by without realising their importance.  Areas like the Burren have species of flowers that are not normally found to this country.  Except perhaps for parts of Wales, the pleasure of walking through an area like that cannot be experienced in any other part of Europe. We do have something to be proud of, but there are areas we have to be concerned about.</P>
    <P>Professionals in the Department and in the trade union movement, who are involved in this area in their everyday <Col N="1162" /> work are setting down recommendations to amend existing legislation and to consolidate Departments.  This would give legislative effect to their recommendations. Rather than just taking note of this excellent report there is a responsibility on the Minister on behalf of the Government to respond positively to the list of recommendations &mdash; reconciling conservation and development, the protection of important areas, species-based conservation, scientific research and information, the Government have set a Department of Science and Technology which could lend themselves to deal with the questions of education and public awareness &mdash; to which my two colleagues make a major contribution daily.  We have international responsibilities in the Council of Europe and the European Communities, who have designated this the year of the Environment.  There is also the question of the human and financial resources which the Government need to make available.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan has compiled from the accounts, an abridged version showing the various allocations of moneys to different Departments.  If one Department were responsible for these matters there would not be conflicting interests in the Department and possibly the amount that is now allocated would be sufficient to do what the Professional and Technical Civil Servants Union feel should be done in this area.  They are asking us as legislators for amending legislation to cover the gaps they have identified in section 10 (1) of their report.</P>
    <P>When we were debating the legislation they referred to, we hoped it covered everything, because it was major and fairly lengthy legislation, but it is obvious from experience that there are gaps which they have identified.  There is no point putting them on record because they are in this report.</P>
    <P>That is what this report is about and we have a responsibility to respond positively. I call on the Government to respond positively by introducing new legislation that will get full support from all sides of this House.  I cannot see it costing the Exchequer anything extra. <Col N="1163" /> The Government should ensure that the gaps in existing legislation are filled and together we can play a role to ensure that our heritage, which we cherish, will be there for our children, our grandchildren and for future generations who have placed on us the responsibility of caring for it.  Because of technological progress we have probably done more damage to our environment in the past 50 years than our predecessors did in many centuries. We have a major responsibility in this area and I hope the Government will respond positively to this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ferris.  It was a great pleasure to be here this morning to listen to the contributions by Senator Éamon de Buitléar and Senator George Eogan, both conservation experts of international repute. I also welcome the Minister and congratulate him and his Department on the great work that is being done with regard to this problem.  My contribution will consist of a few random remarks with regard to this document and to areas covered by it.  It is difficult to make a contribution having first listened to the experts. Senator Ferris always makes a noteworthy contribution in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I deal with this subject I think in terms of poets and poetry because the poets have frozen their perception of the situation for all time.  I am reminded in particular of Patrick Kavanagh, one of our great poets, who wrote about the unchanging corner of a field.  One would have had to be brought up in a rural area to understand the nuances and the importance of that statement.  What Senator Ferris said is perfectly true, there have been more changes made in the last 50 years than in many centuries before that.  Patrick Kavanagh wrote his immortal lines before the full impact of the machine age came upon us, before we were aware of the destruction by the bulldozer, the JCB and the other big machines.  In past ages, little damage could be done in a short space of time with the spade, shovel and by manual <Col N="1164" /> work.  I am not sure what Patrick Kavanagh would have written about the destruction caused by the machine, the bulldozer, or even if he could write a poem about it, but I am sure he would have written about the destruction caused by the machine.</P>
    <P>One area that concerns me is identified very well in the report and that is bogland. It is always important to relate what may be in a document to an actual case &mdash; and I am thinking in terms of bogs around my own area, in particular a bog about six miles from Kells where I worked as a young boy and as a young man.  It was a beautiful scenic area at that time.  It was clean, almost to the point of being sanitised.  In those days if at night someone hid a piece of bread or a sandwich under a footing or a clamp of turf, it would be safely there in the morning, once it was out of the view of the carrion crows.  The area is completely different today.  It is overrun with rats because people in the surrounding areas used it as a dump.  Car wrecks and rubbish were taken there and thrown not into the holes dug for the turf, but along the side of the road and in the drains.  Unfortunately, the county council decided in their wisdom to use part of that area as an official dump and officials of the county council are proud that they made that decision.  I think it was an unfortunate and improper one and bordered on being criminal.  Now the dump has been covered with soil and I suppose the wound is not as ugly as it was.  Nevertheless, I think, it has defaced that area.</P>
    <P>I recall that the bog was considered &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; an environment where people became healthy.  People who worked there were healthy, and even before the pioneering days of Doctor Noel Browne this was so.  People went there for their health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the beauty of the bogland which has been ruined.  It was a healthy environment and at one stage I contemplated making a suggestion that temporary dwellings on stilts should be erected in that beautiful scenic area amid the heather and the forest bushes, to encourage people to avail of the curative environment but unfortunately it has been desecrated with rubbish, car wrecks and the like, and infested with rats and other vermin.  At present it is not a pleasant area.  There is a pious aspiration in regard to bogs in the report, one with which I am in total agreement but there is a practical problem involved because people require fuel &mdash; peat and turf &mdash; and the bog is being exploited for peat and turf.  What is the alternative?  I ask that in the context of what is happening to the particular bog I spoke about.</P>
      <P>During the war years and the Emergency I worked there.  It was an area that gave a lot of employment. It was a very busy area populated by many people at that time.  I believe there are more people working on the bog now than there were during the Emergency.  I was told by one individual who was there last Sunday that there were people working right across the whole stretch of bogland. The reason for that is the machines have moved in.  In my time the turbary rights were exploited; now I understand the machines simply scrape the top of the bogland, and they do as much in a few hours as was done in a whole season years ago, with the result that the fauna and flora and the ecology of the area are disrupted.  I spent two happy weeks in the Burren four years ago.  I admired the beauty of the area and in particular I would like to pay a tribute to the scale model of the Burren in Kilfenora, which is so helpful to people who want to visit particular areas of the Burren.  In passing let me simply suggest that other areas could have what Senator Eogan refers to interpretative centres with scale models to help tourists.  That would be a great help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the fauna and flora in <Col N="1170" /> the Burren and in that particular bogland, I believe &mdash; I am not an expert in this area &mdash; that we had a comparable situation and all of that is being destroyed. I want to focus on to the alternative to this recommendation, which I agree with. What would I say to the people on that particular bog who for £100 or £200 are getting enough fuel to do them for the winter?  Undoubtedly the bogland is being destroyed.  I am sure it will be the same story next year or perhaps there will be an increase in activity.  What will the people of that area do if they do not exploit the bog for fuel?  This in a sense, if I may say so, is a weakness in the report.  Possibly it is not intended that a solution on those lines would be contained in the report and I suppose it is up to the Government and politicians to think in terms of a solution or a substitute for this fuel, but I see a major problem in that area.  We have planning law restrictions which do not apply, generally speaking, in the area of agriculture or in the area of turf cutting.</P>
    <P>Another area which concerns me is reclamation works.  I agree that great damage has been done to the ecology and indeed to the environment.  Senator de Buitléar mentioned that, by reason of his professional work, he saw step by step deterioration over the past 20 years.  Over three times that period almost, I have seen a deterioration and often it was not a step by step progression, but something drastic happening overnight, in a short space of time.  This was particularly true with regard to reclamation and arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I recall when I was a young man fishing along a small stream, a meandering river, a place of beauty.  I had a friend working in England who came back every year and we used to go fishing together on that little river.  He told me that from the time he got the train in London to come back home he was unable to sit down without thinking of the time when he would reach home to throw the line into the river to fish.  We fished many evenings and late into the night, indeed.  I cannot recall if we ever caught a fish, but we enjoyed it all.  That beautiful meandering stream is <Col N="1171" /> still there but unfortunately, due to drainage works and reclamation, it is now more like a canal than a stream.  In passing I want to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for their efforts with regard to spawning beds and with regard to the spillage of soil and deposits of soils.</P>
    <P>Great strides were made in recent years in an effort to satisfy conservationists and those who were concerned with the environment.  In the early years great mistakes were made and we have gaping wounds in some areas but for a considerable period this has been overcome.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to preserve the beauty and the amenity of small streams and rivers that meander along, as drainage works in those areas convert them into virtual canals.</P>
    <P>The wetlands and the lands that have been reclaimed are another problem.  I am aware of enormous reclamation works around my own area.  I know of particular places that grew only rushes and useless grasses &mdash; an area about two miles from Kells called Kilmainham comes to mind &mdash; and in the past few years since the reclamation and the drainage works have been completed, crops of corn have been growing there.  This has been welcomed by individual farmers. Even in my early days before arterial drainage work was done in the area, farmers were striving to reclaim plots of land to increase their income.  The same still holds, but I question whether this is a sensible line to take.  I believe those areas of low lying land had wild life, all of which has been disrupted.  Game shoots took place there.  Indeed in another estate close to Kells, different game birds are bred in captivity and then released.  I know that tourists from America come there by the dozen and pay high fees to be allowed simply to shoot those birds that are released from a tower in that area.  It seems to me to be a questionable sport but, at the same time, it is happening.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The point I would like to make is that bad lands that grew rushes and flaggers and the like lost their wildlife when reclaimed. There are other parts of the world <Col N="1172" /> where they have paid fortunes to create those self-same conditions.  Farmers who have land of that type should be compensated. I believe there could be an income from that type of land.  It is up to the Government to bring forward a policy to compensate farmers, or provide an income for them, for this type of land.  It is true to say that in a sense the EC has the problem of over-production with regard to agriculture, but when we have game, flora and fauna and all the other items that go with that type of environment, it is wrong even from a business point of view to destroy them.  That should be looked at again, and I hope that some policy will be introduced to encourage the farmers to seek advice, or perhaps advice should be provided with regard to what should be done in those cases.  The general inclination of farmers to extend and improve their land could be altered for the benefit of the country and for tourism as well.  I believe the 31 recommendations which are made are very important, but I would say that of all the recommendations the most important one is under education, that is (1) a coherent programme involving both State and voluntary organisations to increase public awareness of nature conservation and to encourage the widespread adoption of a conservation ethic.  This is fundamental to the success of nature conservation.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants for this marvellous report, presented in a very straightforward and readable manner.  I am glad also that the European Communities assisted financially with the production and I would like to pay tribute to the sponsors who are named &mdash; Allied Irish Banks and Prudential Life of Ireland.  They deserve great credit.  It was also mentioned that there were other sponsors and I feel they should have been included as well, because every encouragement should be given to business to help out with regard to the problem we have in this important area.</P>
    <P>With regard to education, as I have said, I believe it is fundamental that we have public awareness in the general sense.  In relation to the boglands, it is <Col N="1173" /> extraordinary to see that we have Dutch people, as the report tells us, coming over here, buying up particular bogs in order to conserve them because they are so important on a world-wide scale.  Our level of awareness is less than in any other country and this extends to other areas as well as conservation.  In the areas of tidyness and keeping the country litterfree, we have a long way to go to catch up with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The report tells us that this lack of awareness presents a major obstacle to all environment protection activities, including nature conservation which, to be effective requires widespread public support and involvement.  The schools can do a lot of work.  I understand from the report that there have been changes in the secondary school curriculum to provide courses at intermediate and leaving certificate level and this is very important. As a matter of fact, the reason that I and my family went to the Burren four years ago was that one of my daughters was doing the intermediate certificate and it included questions dealing with that area.</P>
    <P>Going back to the poets, we are told &ldquo;the child is father of the man&rdquo;.  This is true in many senses.  Adults can be educated through their children in this regard.  I am not too sure that a formal course in primary and secondary schools or third level education establishments is the proper way to do it.  This has not proved effective with regard to the problem of the Irish language.  Perhaps if the subject were introduced in some way apart from examination level it might be more fruitful.  It would be possible for the schools to play a major role in this regard without dealing with the subject to examination level simply by having essays on the subject.  In the old 6th class book of the primary school curriculum we had many lessons on nature and nature conservation. I do not see why the Government could not now at one stroke deal in a satisfactory manner with that problem and make recommendations, or perhaps straightforward arrangements that something of that kind would be included. When the report on the environment by <Col N="1174" /> the Department of the Environment was released in 1980, or shortly after that period, I suggested that it should be circulated to the schools.  The Minister at the time told me that that would be considered. I am not sure what happened subsequently but I suggest that if at all possible this report might be distributed at least to the secondary schools.  I see no reason why it should not be distributed to all the educational establishments, and I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>Obviously this is a subject about which we could go on for a long time but I do not think it would be beneficial to make too long a contribution.  I feel particularly sad with regard to areas in my own county.  I mentioned many times before in this House the beautiful scenic area in Meath, the Ballyhoe area, where we have damsons and fruit trees growing on the side of the road, creating a beautiful scene at the time when trees are in blossom and are in fruit.  Unfortunately, I believe it is not remunerative, but nevertheless those trees have remained around that beautiful lake at Ballyhoe.  But for a number of years &mdash; and indeed I think it has been two years since I was down there &mdash; I thought it unfortunate that the whole area was covered with lime.  A lime quarry is situated right in the middle of that area.  Again it is a reflection on the planning laws that that could happen.  It is unfortunate.  The planning authorities should be more vigilant with regard to those particular areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Eogan when he calls for a balanced approach but, of course, industry must be catered for.  In all those situations, we must be thinking primarily in terms of human beings.  That is important.  The horticultural societies have done great work in creating an awareness in that area.  Perhaps funds could be extended to them, not in a lavish way, but in a modest way, and this would be another way of making progress.</P>
    <P>When I talk about this subject, poetry comes to mind and I note with great sadness from the report that the bittern has now become extinct.  Our great poet from County Meath, Francis Ledwidge, when he wrote about Thomas McDonagh <Col N="1175" /> siad, &ldquo;He shall not hear the bittern cry&rdquo;. Unfortunately nobody in Ireland will hear the bittern cry in the wild sky.  There are other features I could elaborate on, such as land reclamation, the knocking down of walls, the excavation of fences, the removal of piers and gates that were stylised in some area, because the roads were too narrow for the big machines.  I think of the poem, &ldquo;I'm sitting on the stile, Mary&rdquo;.  The stile was a feature of the countryside where I lived, but I do not know if it is used any longer.  I do not notice them, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>It is a wonderful report, but there are one or two aspects that puzzle me.  The report says that people come to see the otter along our rivers.  I have spent as much time along the rivers as anyone in this country, and while I have seen destruction created by the others &mdash; I have seen salmon abandoned after the otter eats a few ounces of the flesh &mdash; I have only seen an otter in the zoo.  I have never seen an otter on the bank.  It puzzles me that people come here to see something I have never seen.</P>
    <P>The report states on page 3:</P>
    <P>A rural landscape in which there is co-operation rather than conflict between agriculture and nature conservation will be one in which crop and livestock pests are controlled by their natural predators in preference to chemical pesticides.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about wild animals but I feel this is a pious hope because during the Emergency years, land was tilled under the compulsory tillage scheme and rabbits destroyed the crops to the extent that they were never harvested.  Without going into the details about myxamatosis and other ways of controlling animals that multiply and proliferate to the extent that they become pests and which are seldom controlled by their natural predators it is necessary to do a certain amount of culling and control.  With the exception of those small issues I want to say that I agree with the report.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  I appeal to the Minister to consider, if at all possible, making arrangements that a <Col N="1176" /> copy of this report be provided for every pupil in our schools.  It would be a good start.  Undoubtedly, it would involve some expense but it would be well worth it and would be money well invested.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. I join with other speakers in expressing my appreciation of and praise for the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants for their contribution to last year's European Year of the Environment by the publication of this document, Our National Heritage &mdash; a Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland in this format.  It portrays our marvellous environment which most of us would like to keep in line with the presentation that our heritage is entitled to.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of representing the Oireachtas at the First World Conference on Ecology and the Environment in Vienna in 1971 or 1972.  Since then I had the opportunity of attending two or three other conferences.  They tended to focus a great deal of attention on the environment and the effect that modern technology and the development of nuclear energy had on our environment.  I and some of my colleagues have put down motion No. 62 on the passing of the European year of the Environment which I hope will be discussed during the year. We will have an opportunity to discuss the ozone layer and other areas which the European Communities are slow to take a decisive action on, compared with other parts of the world, such as the US and Japan.  Our natural heritage is portrayed and assessed in this policy document and I hope it finds its way into every school library.  The recommendations are very clear and concise and follow a definite path that everybody can agree with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was opened this morning by contributions from colleagues who are experts in this field.  It was a great pleasure to listen to them and to appreciate the work that has already been undertaken so successfully by them.  The recent television series included the Slieve <Col N="1177" /> Blooms &mdash; I am being parochial when I mention the Slieve Blooms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Slieve Blooms show up the quality of the environment. I live near the Slieve Blooms and in the late forties or fifties before the advance of auto motor power, I remember cycling 20 miles to see that area which is more or less as Finn MacCool left is so many years ago.  It has not been affected to any great extent by habitation and luckily it has suffered very little from the modern type of pollution by those among us with undeveloped appreciation of their surroundings who are inclined to leave their trademark on outings on Sunday afternoons. We have in the very heart of Ireland a beautiful, natural resource that has been brought to the attention of the entire community in the main by J.I. Fanning from the <i>Midland Tribune</i> whose life's work it has been to highlight the importance of conserving our natural heritage and the environment around us. He has recruited expert assistance from the universities &mdash; I think John Feehan is associated with Trinity College &mdash; and also colleagues from the other universities who together have laid the foundation for attracting public attention. This is very important in relation to conservation.</P>
      <P>My county council attracted the wrath of a couple of semi-State organisations some 50 years ago when we refused them permission to put another transposer for bouncing signals on top of what they said was a wilderness.  They whinged about the cost of putting in so far off the road but we insisted that it would be built in a place where it could not be seen from a public road in our county.  We were accused at that time of adding to public expense but, so far as public representatives are concerned, there is a heavy burden of responsibility on them and on those us who have access to the administration of planning laws to ensure that the environment is passed on to the next generation in the same healthy and beautiful state as we inherited it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> I have been here through the passing of practically all of the important environmental Acts, from the Planning Act of 1963 to the Wildlife Act in the middle of the seventies to the Air Pollution Act, the Water Pollution Act and the Litter Bill and I think that there is great legislation in place but there is very little sign of any of it being implemented. I occasionally call the attention of the officials on our council to blatant breaches of or, perhaps, lack of consideration for the legislation and more often than not we are told that we have not got the money to enforce it, that we cannot police it and have not the wherewithal to put the supervisors or the staff on the ground and that is a pity. Despite that, in the city of Kilkenny, where they have a particularly well developed planning service, they have conserved the beautiful &ldquo;marble city&rdquo; and have I think never allowed neon or plastic signs to be erected.  The ambiance of that city is so much better as a result and I think that leads to there being very little litter in the streets.</P>
    <P>Above all, the residents of the city have obviously a great delight in, a great sense of place, a great sense of home and of belonging to the city which adds to the will to conserve the marvellous buildings there.  This helps to enhance the living conditions and hence the working conditions of the area.  Even in places where there are very successful tidy towns committes, there will be the odd resident perhaps dumping a bag of refuse a mile beyond the village or town boundary.  It is very difficult to understand this and one would like to know where to start. Therefore, I think we have a big educational problem.  We have the legislation but most of it is not being enforced.</P>
    <P>I came across an extraordinary situation within the public service in relation to the Slieve Bloom mountains where one section of a Department of State had a conservation order and employed a ranger to look after wild life and another section of the same Department setting the hunting and shooting rights over the same territory.  Where does one go with that kind of thing?  I <Col N="1179" /> find that absolutely infuriating.  I know it is not very widespread but mistakes like that should not happen.  We must strengthen precautions against that.  A former Minister, Seán Flanagan, I think back in the seventies set the pace in introducing the Wildlife Act and his Department over the years have responded but at the same time they need greater public support and appreciation.</P>
    <P>Nature walk areas where people can walk through and appreciate the environment have been slow to take off.  I remember some years ago, as a partaker in one of the Irish vocational education conferences going through the Kerry Way which is a marvellous means of seeing the beauty of the environment there.  As a result of that we set up one in the Slieve Bloom area from Clonaslee to Birr which is a fairly long walk.  It has not had the benefit of a lot of money expended on it but, nevertheless, the very basics are there and I am glad to see a recommendation in this publication that £9 million a year should be allocated to the environment.  Perhaps we should make more of these beautiful vistas.  In the Slieve Bloom area most of the breathtaking vistas are not visible from the public road.  One must go into the Barrow Basin to see the valleys there.  When the afforestation programme was introduced, of course the foresters at first were not particularly keen on or interested in conserving views and I am glad that that policy has changed in the Wildlife Service. As trees are being felled now we are being left with the views.</P>
    <P>People living in a village or town, no matter how beautiful it is, get used to it and it is no longer a pleasure to them and they do not appreciate it until an outsider tells them about it.  Also, people who really enjoy the beauties of nature are more often than not written off as mildly eccentric.  That is an educational problem. We are fast going into an era where working hours are going to be shorter, when people are, hopefully, going to have more spending power at their disposal with fewer working hours, recreational and leisure facilities are <Col N="1180" /> becoming more important.  Therefore, it is vital that people should be able to afford these facilities and educated to appreciate what nature has given them free but there is a <i>quid-pro-quo</i> here.  It is very important that people who enjoy the outdoor scene should also be very much aware of the responsibility of respecting both the public and private property they use.  My land &mdash; not enough of it, of course, but the little I have &mdash; borders the river Nore for almost a mile. You should not take from that that I have a lot of land, nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I delight in the fact that if I go out to look at my cattle I may see eight or nine hares, rabbits galore and the odd fox &mdash; either early in the morning or at night &mdash; and there are badgers, pheasants and crows and practically everything that flies.  It is far inland and it is splendid to see nature in such a wide variety.  The only thing I miss there is the corncrake because the new silage techniques have eliminated that bird which was so pleasant to hear.  It brings one back to one's childhood but it has become quite scarce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem, however.  You would not know the fishermen who use the banks of the river were there.  There could be a dozen who would walk back and forth.  Senator Fitzsimons was regretting the passing of stiles.  I maintain that stiles are the only means by which you can keep your fence.  You must make it easy for people to have access.  There is never any trouble from the fishing fraternity, but the hunting people who shoot from November until February, certainly do not have the same respect for private or public property and they are likely to leave gates open, trample over fences and they do not give two hoots.  That is one of the problems and one of the reasons why in many areas you see big signs: &ldquo;Poison Laid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Private Property&rdquo; and so on.  If people would appreciate the problems that landowners have in trying to eke out a living and respect property, <Col N="1181" /> there would be no great hassle over its usage.  That is why we need to have a review of the curriculum, even in the national schools.  That whole area of the environment is important enough to be included with civics in the secondary schools also because each generation must be reminded of it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the matter of dumps. We can have a beautiful environment, but we must also provide in that environment the facilities for ordinary living. The local authorities should be able to provide a better system for waste disposal and while it would be nice to think that we could have incinerators and burners, possibly that would affect the atmosphere. There should be greater emphasis on recycling; we have not really concentrated on that.  I notice that in most European cities and towns they have special large containers for green bottles and white bottles so that at least the glass is collected and recycled.  But we have a problem here with dumps, especially with chemical dumps and dumps for dangerous substances.  I am not happy that there should be an official policy of just dumping dangerous substances into old mine-shafts or into the ground where they are liable to affect water courses.  I hope the Department of the Environment will give urgent consideration to that matter.  For the provision of dumps there should be 100 per cent grant aid from the Department because it is the only way we can ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that there should be an acute awareness of the necessity to conserve our natural heritage. It is appropriate that Departments of State should set the guidelines to ensure that there will be a proper balance between the development of the country and the conservation of the environment. If one considers the Air Pollution Act or any of our legislation there is a very fine balance and there is a great onus on planners and public administrators to strike a balance between the provision and maintenance of employment and ensuring that the environment remains as far as possible untarnished.  We can expect some difficulties in the year ahead from the ESB power station at Moneypoint in Clare.  There are monitoring stations right across the country and I hope that assessments and recordings will be made and that the people charged with monitoring the acid rain development will be forthright and honest in publishing their findings.</P>
      <P>Farm development and the involvement of new husbandry practices and techniques are areas where the farming community needs assistance as well as guidance and education.  For many years I have been of the opinion that the system we have of grant-aiding agricultural development is perhaps dated.  I would like to see grants replaced by interest subsidies so that the onus and the pressure would be on people not only to repay but to make their projects work to ensure that there would be a repayment of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interest of the environment I would like to see pressure on the farming community to be mindful of the damage that can be caused to the environment and I believe the Department of Agriculture and Food should examine carefully the possibility of providing 100 per cent grant-aid for the inclusion in each development project of appropriate effluent storage and disposal facilities on farms.  Coupled with that the Department of the Environment or local authorities should have the facility to impose severe penalties, both financial and custodial, <Col N="1183" /> on people who offend against the environment or who do not take the appropriate action.  In fairness, in a society such as ours, through indolence or a lack of appreciation of the damage that can be done people will make mistakes.  A farm spillage may take place in one townland and the harm can manifest itself for miles downstream.  That is something which is difficult for an individual farmer who is endeavouring to collect his silage and is always in a great rush and may be depending on contractors to understand.</P>
    <P>There should be a greater understanding of the problem of the costs. There should be a carrot to encourage people to put in the effluent storage and disposal facilities which represent a very small percentage of the cost of modern farm development.  I am convinced, from my own experience, that there is not sufficient enforcement of the sections in the four main Acts starting with the 1963 Planning Act.  It is one thing to review them, renew them and upgrade them, but if we take the Air Pollution Act, the local authorities say that the Department of the Environment have not provided them with the money either to put in the monitoring facilities or to provide the staff. While that, in itself is a laudable piece of legislation it is not being enforced at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and I very much regret that it was not possible for me to be with him last year, as I was away on official business, when he took over the Clara Bog for conservation purposes on behalf of the Department.  That is a marvellous step in a county where Bord na Móna since the thirties have been the largest industrial employer in the economy of the county. It was a great step for the Department to ensure the preservation for the country as part of our national heritage that portion of raised bog which is nothing to look at if one is living in bogland but, on closer examination, is very important. I acknowledge that some people from mainland Europe played a role in perhaps pricking our conscience to ensure that we would do something about it.  There are <Col N="1184" /> other areas on which we could keep a closer eye.</P>
    <P>In conclusion with regard to the walking ways, whether it is the Wicklow Way, or the Slieve Bloom Way, or the Kerry Way, more funds should be made available for signposting and perhaps erecting signs with suggestions on what strollers or people on vacation might like to look out for.  In the instance of Clara bog there is a small plaque &mdash; I do not know what it cost; not a lot &mdash; which very clearly sets out, as the Office of Public Works have successfully done on practically all of the ancient monuments, a small synopsis of the value to our heritage of the particular area and the kind of fauna and flora people should be looking out for and conscious of.  On the walkways across the country I would like to see that kind of signposting and perhaps the Minister would increase the amount of money available for that.</P>
    <P>May I again compliment the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants on their work in presenting and in producing this document, in heightening our appreciation of the heritage we are lucky to have and also in pointing the finger to the necessity for keeping it pure and pristine as many areas are.  I hope that the Government will accept very fully the recommendations that have been so painstakingly researched and clearly indicated in this document.  To the Minister and indeed to his predecessors who, since the enactment of the Wildlife Act, 1976, have made a contribution to that conservation and that effort we owe great gratitude.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <P>I am calling on the Minister.  Lest there should be any confusion the debate is continuing after the Minister replies.  He has to go for Question Time later on to the Dail and because he has taken a personal interest in it since early morning I want to allow him in. There are at least four other Senators to speak.  In case anybody is worried I am not stopping the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas <Col N="1185" /> orm bheith ar ais sa Seanad agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis na Seanadóirí toisc gur chuir siad an rún tábhachtach seo faoi bhráid an Tí.  Déanaim comhghairdeas freisin le gach aon duine a bhí baint acu sa Stát seirbhís leis an tuarascáil iontach seo.</P>
      <P>I am happy to endorse what many Senators have said about this excellent document published by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants on &ldquo;A Policy for Nature Conservation in Ireland.&rdquo;  This comprehensive publication represents a valuable contribution from some of the people who are most closely involved in the formulation of our strategies for nature conservation in the future.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a fundamental element of our national heritage is our natural heritage of wild fauna and flora and their habitats.  A conscious awareness of the need to conserve and manage that heritage is a relatively recent development.  Increased demands for industrial jobs, better housing and cheaper energy are leading to a variety of pressures on land use which, if they are not controlled, will have irrevocable consequences for the environment.</P>
      <P>Here in Ireland, we have been lucky enough to have escaped the worst excesses of industrial and commercial expansion and uncontrolled land use. Ireland is a small country but is an extremely fortunate one in having within it a very varied and beautiful physical environment.  However, we cannot be complacent and already many scientifically important habitats and ecosystems have been lost through drainage of wetlands, peatland exploration, destruction of hedgerows and clearance of woodlands for agricultural, industrial and urban development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of our conservation policy is to maintain plants and animals in their natural habitat living side by side with people.  The best national park you can have is one where the local people are involved in its maintenance and protection. Our nature reserves are managed by retaining them in their natural form with the minimum of disturbance.  We do <Col N="1186" /> not seek to create areas for visual effect but rather to have living beings, both human and animal, walking together within these areas.</P>
    <P>By accepted definition, of course, conservation comprehends the rational management and regulation of our wild flora and fauna habitats.  This is an ongoing process whereby we maintain our natural environment and use it for recreation, education and general well-being. Environmental protection can march hand in hand with development and most major development projects now include an environmental impact assessment of the effect of the development on the environment.  Planning authorities are paying more and more attention to environmental considerations in their decisions.  I doubt that there is a county in Ireland today which does not give practical demonstration of this new awareness of the importance of nature, be it in the conservation and planting of trees and hedgerows, the development of lakeside amenities, urban parks and the like.</P>
    <P>Pollution is a major threat to our environment and to conservation.  We recognise that progress being made in both agricultural and industrial production can lead to threats to our environment.  The Government have moved rapidly and decisively in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment, the Office of Public Works, the local authorities, the farm development service and the regional fisheries boards in order to identify pollution, pollutants and polluters. The necessary action is being taken to prevent pollution in the future and to eliminate it in the present.  We are very grateful to the farming organisations, the farmers, the industrialists and factory owners for their continued co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and conservation can coexist and indeed many of the plants we seek to conserve would disappear if the farming practices which are responsbile for their being there in the first place were changed.  Conversely, changes in farming practices have resulted in the disappearance from our fields of some <Col N="1187" /> of the more common wild flowers.  The farmer must, however, develop his land to its full potential and we will continue to strive to have some areas set aside for conservation.  There must be a balance in all things and balance is the key here.  We are also seeking to keep a good representative sample of our peatlands and, here again, there must be a reasonable balance between development and conservation.</P>
    <P>In my own Department the creation and maintenance of nature reserves is a priority and also the creation of national parks.  Senators will have seen that the Taoiseach announced recently a new national park in Glendalough and the two nature reserves covering over 2,000 hectares which I created under the Wildlife Act, 1976, will form the nucleus of this park.  These two reserves are good examples of peatlands and woodlands and further reserves will be created as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Since I took office I have created eight new nature reserves among them being Clara bog to which a number of Senators including Senator McDonald referred, a prime example of a raised midland bog. There is also the Glenealo Valley, a blanket bog, and Lough Barra Bog alongside Glenveigh National Park in County Donegal.  Further reserves are being considered at this time.  I also had the privilege of signing the first refuge for fauna order to protect the tern colonies at Lady's Island, County Wexford, and last week we created three other refuges one at Rockabill, County Dublin and the other two in County Kerry.  Rockabill is also a tern site, famous for its roseata terns and made famous in particular by an esteemed Member of this House and film-maker, Senator Éamon de Buitléar, while the other two are the habitats of the natterjack toad which is protected under the Wildlife Act.</P>
    <P>I can readily appreciate the anxiety of professionals and scientists that a reservoir of scientifically valuable sites should be conserved as a network of representative ecosystems in order to maintain stocks of nature, plants and animals. <Col N="1188" /> Apart from the cultural and aesthetic value of the conservation objective, it also has a practical and an economic value in the development of future crops for agriculture, pharmaceutical and industrial needs and essential natural laboratories for students from home and abroad.  Conservation of our natural environment will not, however, be guaranteed either by statutory protection or the action of statutory authorities unless there is broad acceptance by society as a whole of the importance of the issues involved.  The essential task is to convince fully every citizen that the well-being of our natural environment is a fundamental factor to maintain all life.</P>
    <P>My Department have made and continue to make every effort to develop public awareness of environmental issues.  We have had considerable success in recent years in bringing home to people the importance of environmental protection. This can be seen in the level of public interest in environmental matters. The process of developing awareness cannot be hurried.  Public acceptance cannot be pushed on society as a whole. It must be properly nurtured and we will continue to present the facts on environmental protection in a steady and comprehensible manner.</P>
    <P>Through our involvement in the Council of Europe we have been involved with recent initiatives within that organisation aimed at developing a conservation strategy for Europe.  The process is at a very early stage, but we will be monitoring the situation and contributing to its progress fully.  The very basis for conservation strategy is balance and, given our involvement in the broader European society, I think it best that we should proceed on that basis in the future.</P>
    <P>As stated, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants document calls for funding of £9 million per year for nature conservation.  Senator Eogan has shown that State expenditure is very close to that figure.  As far as value for money is concerned, I am happy that the return on this outlay is very good indeed. It is easy to quantify the return for this money in terms of the numbers of nature <Col N="1189" /> reserves and national parks.  However, much of the return has not been and perhaps cannot be quantified.  The benefits generated for in State and out of State tourism are, I am convinced, enormous. This £9 million also pays for services which many members of the public would not be actively aware of but they would see the benefits of them in the maintenance of the general quality of our natural environment.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to purchase for conservation a good representative sample of raised midland bogs and blanket bogs. Our objectives are to retain 10,000 hectares of raised midland bog and 40,000 hectares of blanket bog.  Senators are aware of the Clara Bog Preservation Order and I am pleased to say that the local people of Clara are proposing to set up an interpretative centre in Clara.  My Department will give all the professional help we can to them.  This is an example of State and private enterprise working together and I see this as the way forward for the future in our efforts to conserve that which is most important to our community.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to instil this in our people and in particular in our children who will be the future guardians of our environment.  They will shape their own destinies and the destinies of generations to come by the regard they have for the natural environment.  For that reason, I welcome the emphasis which has been placed on education and public awareness in this policy document.</P>
    <P>There have been a large number of excellent contributions this morning an I will try to refer to them all as briefly as possible.  Senator Éamon de Buitléar opened the debate.  This House is fortunate to have a man of his eminence here to advise and assist us in the field of conservation because he is a man nationally and internationally renowned for his contribution in the area of wildlife preservation. He stated that listing an area often sounded its death knell as the Department of Energy often drained these areas and later planted them.  The past year has been a very exciting one for conservation.  As a Government we have <Col N="1190" /> tried to bring all the conservation interests together.  We have taken the wildlife section of the Department in under the Office of Public Works which we believe is its rightful home.  I want to pay tribute to Senator de Buitléar for the great advice and assistance he has given to my Department and to myself over the past year or so.  We look forward to his advice and guidance in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about national parks and the necessity for national parks legislation.  We have three fully complete national parks in Killarney, Connemara and Glenveagh.  As I already stated last week, the Taoiseach announced the creation of a new national park in County Wicklow to serve the capital city of our country, County Wicklow, country and international visitors to our country.  We also hope to create another national park, as resources permit, and as opportunities permit and our whole policy is one of dedicated, constant monitoring of every situation in land use, in land disposal and in land acquisition.  As opportunities arise, my Department will react in the most positive way possible to preserve that which is best and to try to create national parks where the necessary criteria for the national parks system can be adhered to.</P>
    <P>A move has been made to have all aspects of our natural heritage under the same authority.  The transfer of the wildlife functions to my Department was a step in this direction.  The amalgamation of all aspects is being actively considered. I support the concept of having all aspects of our heritage under the care of one Minister, I would hope under the Office of Public Works, which I believe is the natural home for all conservation, heritage and historical agencies and interests. We are constantly working towards that goal and we have a few other ideas in the pipeline.  We hope that we can amalgamate and bring under the heritage umbrella a number of other agencies and activities which we believe could make an even greater contribution to expediting the achievement of our heritage goals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> Senator Eogan in a very detailed contribution went through the report in meticulous detail.  I am delighted to say that the great work he has been doing in the Knowth area in County Louth and County Meath, in the north eastern part of our country, has been acknowledged by the Government over the past year in that we have created the first European archaeological park in the Boyne Valley to encompass the great archaeological sites of Knowth and Dowth, to encompass Newgrange, a megalithic sites of Knowth and Dowth, to encompass Newgrange, a megalithic tomb of 3500 BC vintage, probably the world's first observatory and probably older than the pyramids themselves. There are many other monuments in this area including Monasterboice and others. It is vitally important that they should be preserved and get both the national and international status they deserve.  I compliment Senator Professor Eogan on the great work he has done in that area and, indeed, this has been internationally acknowledged.  We hope that the creation of this European archaeological park will help not alone to create the resources but also create the interest for the people of Ireland to acknowledge the great heritage resources we have there and for the international world to come and see them for themselves.  Many great visitors to our country, including President Mitterrand, and others who have come to this country have gone to visit Newgrange and that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris in a very detailed contribution covered the report and the heritage activities of my Department and I concur with his compliments regarding the Eurovision Song Contest because that was one of the bright lights of promoting the natural Ireland.  More of that needs to be done in the future.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Senator was not present when the compliments were <Col N="1192" /> being passed.  My staff are working on amendments to the Wildlife Act of 1976. I hope to introduce a Bill in the Oireachtas later on this year.  The amendments are far-reaching and the points on amendments made in the report will be considered in the formulation of the new Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons in a wide-ranging report referred to the destruction of ecology and ethos systems and sites of major importance.  Over the past few years we have been working in the publication of the sites and monuments records.  During the past year we published the sites and monuments records for Counties Galway, Meath and Wexford.  We are proceeding with the research and the compilation of all the various sites and monuments records in all the other counties in a structured organised way in order to identify all our sites and monuments of archaeological, architectural and historic importance.</P>
      <P>As resources become available each of the counties will be considered in a careful, meticulous way.  We want to ensure that this information will be available for educational purposes, tourist purposes and, above all, for conservation purposes.  We have unearthed a large number of extra sites in the new sites and monuments records which we have completed so far in each of the counties. We are very grateful for the co-operation we are receiving from the archaeological departments of the various universities. All arterial drainage works must now undergo an environmental impact assessment prior to the commencement of any arterial drainage scheme.  On that score, I hope Senator Fitzsimons can be assured that no scheme will proceed without an environmental impact assessment being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald highlighted the importance of good conservation policy. He also talked about the importance of good planning policy and he highlighted the positive attitude of Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council in this regard.  We appreciate very much their co-operation and the great example they are showing.  We are fortunate that <Col N="1193" /> in most cases planning officials of the local authorities adopt a very positive approach.  Not alone do we get great co-operation from the planning authorities but we also get tremendous co-operation from ACOT and the farm development services in helping to conserve and protect the various monuments and archaeological and historical sites that we have throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a nature reserve in the Slieve Bloom Mountains which was created by my Department and is under the Office of Public Works.  Senator McDonald referred to the fact that forestry lands are adjoining and that the shooting rights on those lands are in the hands of another Department.  As forestry is controlled by the Department of Energy we could not get involved in their affairs.  They do what they think is necessary in managing the forests and also in letting the shooting rights that exist therein.  We are fortunate in that we get good co-operation from them and we will continue to work with them.  We hope that, as the forestry activities of the Department are to be commercialised into a State-sponsored commercial body, the negotiations which we are having with them at present will lead to the preservation and the transfer of various important sites under the Department to the conservation wing of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment Offaly County Council and Laois County Council who created an environmental national park in the Slieve Bloom Mountains during European Year of the Environment. Work on that park concluded last March.  That is an example of the attitude that should be adopted by various other local authorities throughout the country.  As Irish people, we have a special duty as the custodians of our own nature and above all as the custodians of a great natural heritage &mdash; we are in a unique position in this island to do so &mdash; to protect and conserve our great archaeological sites, our nature reserves, our bog ecological systems and various other sites of historic importance not alone to ourselves but to the people of Europe, as we are part of the enlarged Community. <Col N="1194" /> This is why people like the Dutch and others have a major interest in Ireland. They feel it is incumbent on them to make a contribution to the preservation of European heritage and environment by supporting financially Ireland's policy of conservation of heritage matters.  We are deeply grateful for the co-operation we are getting and for both the physical and financial support they have made available to us, particularly over the past year.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry is one of our most important sources of revenue.  The maintenance of the environment in a healthy state is vital to its future.  I welcome this publication by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants and I wish to pay tribute to everybody involved in its preparation and production.  It is a positive indicator of the great goodwill and active support that exists within the public service for the conservation of our natural heritage.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am sorry that some notice was not given that it was to be taken today but I am glad nonetheless that the experts on the matter, particularly my colleagues, Senators Eogan and de Buitléar, are here to make their knowledge available to the House.  This is the kind of motion to which one cannot but give enthusiastic assent.  I have been reading the document of the UPTCS rather hurriedly.  One of the most important statements in it is that tourism depends on conservation.  This would seem to be, at first sight, a truism but yet it is a truism which, alas, many of our people are not yet finding to be true. Sometime people in public life, newspaper editors and other people &mdash; I do not want to be specific but there are two instances I can think of in recent times &mdash; are so concerned with emigration and depopulation that they sometimes suggest what is indeed an entirely false antithesis between people and places, as it were.</P>
      <P>In today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> there is a reference to the depopulation of west Cork, the area around Goleen in particular, which has no child for Confirmation at present.  The editorial goes on to say that scenery is important but people are more important.  This might be quite a dangerous note to sound because it might well convey that somehow the two things are not connected when, in fact, there is the most integral connection between them and the future of our most beautiful areas does depend on conservation.  The link between employment and conservation must be stated again and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other interesting statements in the document is that the people of Ireland have a very low environmental awareness.  They have, indeed, and also what you might call a low threshold of visual aesthetics which is connected to that.  Their tolerance, for example, of the bungalow blight devastation in many sections of our coastline indicates a low level of architectural and aesthetic values in that visual area.  I think things are improving.  The historical reasons for this <Col N="1196" /> are, I suppose, fairly obvious.  Our rural population in an under-populated area which never experienced an industrial revolution and which took nature for granted, so to speak, sums up the instinctive attitude of people towards their environment and the lack of any conscious concern about what is happening.</P>
    <P>The question is: how can we improve matters further?  I do not speak on this matter with an expert voice, like my colleagues, but as one who is very much an open air person who enjoys the riches that are to be savoured in areas like west Cork, with the splendid hill walking amenities it has to offer.  One is appalled now and then when one sees waste disposal dumped at what seems to be picked out as the most aesthetic point.  The question that strikes me is: why people go to such lengths literally to dump their rubbish, for example, on the slopes of Musheramore Mountains where I was walking last week.  That is an area of total solitude and grandeur and yet there is a whole chain or refuse lacing the flank of the mountain in an area known as St. John's Well.  Why people go to such lengths to dump their refuse raises other questions.  Can they dispose of the garbage otherwise?  Why do they go to such areas of solitude in order to do this?  Are they aware of what they are doing?  I am not sure that we know the answers to these questions or how we can implement the measures against dumping.</P>
    <P>The document prescribed as one of the remedies as the provision of more interpretative sites, as is becoming quite common, the idea being that, if you have a site at a natural amenity explaining its treasures and its natural richness, that would enhance people's awareness of their environment.  We will get an opportunity on another occasion &mdash; I understand on the Forestry Bill which is coming up from the Dáil &mdash; to discuss that aspect of our natural heritage in particular.  All I want to say here is a word of praise for our foresters who seem to go from strength to strength.  They have imaginative views on what can be done to further improve the areas with which they are entrusted.  I am thinking of a visit recently <Col N="1197" /> to Gougane Barra.  I had not seen it for perhaps a year or so.  The improvements there, entirely in keeping with the natural setting, not a single inch wrong, speak volumes for the commitment and the enthusiasm of those who look after our national forests.</P>
    <P>I can say little more on this issue except to support the motion enthusiastically and, indeed, to praise the public spiritedness of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants for producing this splendid document.  It seems to me that it says volumes for the public commitment of people, that they take upon themselves this task and discharge it with such obvious devotion and public spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Senator Murphy has said.  In relation to the comment about the Eurovision Song Contest, I think we could both concur that the content of it leaves a lot to be desired.  In the context of the remarks about the excellent programme and the features of it which related to our environment and to our natural heritage, it is certainly to be praised.</P>

      <P>It was most interesting to listen not only to the Minister of State who has now left &mdash; we are joined by the Minister of State at the Department with responsibility for forestry who is welcome &mdash; but also to the contributions earlier. Like many of my colleagues in the House I always feel somewhat in awe of people who are experts in a particular field. <Col N="1198" /> However the quiet and effective elucidation of matters relating to this motion by our colleagues, Senator de Buitléar and Senator Eogan, was far from intimidating and most informative.  We are all the richer for their contribution in this area.</P>
      <P>I will not go into the great detail that has been covered by so many other speakers in the debate on the report which is before us other than to concur with Senators who have been unanimous on all sides of the House in complimenting the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants on producing an excellent document and a timely one.  It is timely as, indeed, the motion is timely.  I could not help but think, as Senator Murphy was referring to the historical reasons why environmental awareness has such a low priority in this country, that we have come a long way in the 65 or 66 years since the foundation of the State from the predominantly rural peasant population, as Senator Murphy said, who took nature for granted to perhaps a more industrialised and certainly a more urbanised community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this motion gives me an opportunity to comment on a particular hobbyhorse of mine, that is, tidiness.  It continues to amaze and irritate me intensely whenever, either in my home town or throughout the country, I see my fellow citizens show a total disregard for our environment.  I am talking specifically about the disposal of their personal litter, cigarette boxes, crisp bags and lollipops, which are thrown out of car windows and lorry windows with gay abandon.  I cannot understand the mentality of people who continue to indulge in this anti-social practice despite all the efforts down through the years by the State, by local voluntary bodies and by organisations involved in environmental awareness, despite all this concentration of information and encouragement.  Even to this day if any of us were to walk out onto the streets we would find someone somewhere throwing their personal litter on the streets of our towns and villages.  This may fall on deaf ears but, as I have this national forum as a platform, I will add <Col N="1199" /> my small voice to all the other voices calling on our citizens to be more aware of the damage they are doing and to change their mentality in relation to litter on our streets in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In that context I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte who are, in a way, the unsung heroes of the litter problem in this country.  Since the mid-fifties, from the initiation of the National Tidy Towns Competition, they have done Trojan work in encouraging communities to involve themselves in the concept of tidy towns.  Over the past 25 years of its history they have been, in my opinion, the major agency responsible for the enhancement of our towns and villages. Today we have many communities we can be proud of.  Litter is a national problem. It is as anti-social as smoking and as anti-social as doing damage to our natural heritage and amenities.  The sooner the people realise that when criticisms of our uncleanliness and our untidiness in public are made from abroad, in many cases they are valid and justified.</P>
    <P>Finance has been talked about here. The report proposed that a sum of about £9 million a year should be spent to further enhance our environment.  The Minister quite correctly said that Government expenditure in this area is pretty close to that and, indeed, the Government are to be complimented.  However, money is not the answer but rather an attitude of mind, as has been referred to by many other speakers.  For example, in the area of forestry one would hope that on an ongoing basis poor land, land which perhaps might be perceived to have no other function but the growing of trees, might not be planted in such a willy-nilly way in future and that Government agencies will take the appropriate action in advance of such planting to ensure that the land being planted is not in some way being damaged environmentally.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a couple of specific proposals in relation to the motion before us.  In order to engender greater awareness of the importance of conserving our environment the Office of Public Works, in association with the Department of <Col N="1200" /> Education, should explore the possibility of utilising our student population as park rangers along the lines of the American model.  These would be guides who would act and serve at geological and historical sites and, where relevant, wildlife preserves. Time spent on these activities at the locations mentioned could be used as exam credits, irrespective of their subject of study.  In this way a start could be made in this generation so that in future awareness of the importance of our environment would be on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>The American model is an exemplary one.  Indeed, recently the leaders of the US park rangers said that, without the voluntary input throughout the United States, many of their natural reserves would not be manned and protected and would not be available to the general public to be seen, viewed and appreciated. That may not be possible here. Perhaps it requires more finance than resources allow but the thinking behind my proposal is that, unless we start in some generation, and we might as well start now, all of the exhortations of the various agencies to inculcate a love and appreciation of our national heritage will fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the problem of litter.  We have been talking about the litter problem for as long as I can remember and yet we still have that problem. The Minister quite correctly referred to the various statutory instruments that are available to prevent desecration of our natural environment in the area of litter, vandalising of artefacts, or the illegal exportation of artefacts but unless there is a real will on the part of the citizens, no amount of legislation will improve the situation.</P>
    <P>We have a pollution problem in the west that goes back quite a few years. Many of our lakes are suffering, or are in the early process of suffering, from pollution.  The most celebrated of them, of course, is Lough Sheelin but there are many others.  I live in County Leitrim, in the Drumshambo area which is generally referred to as the heart of the Leitrim lake district.  I was very disturbed to learn from the local authority in recent times <Col N="1201" /> that some of our most popular fishing lakes are being threatened with pollution. I might add that this pollution threat is not coming exclusively from the farming population and, in some cases, not at all from farming.  In this context I would like to suggest to the Minister that the anti-pollutant aspects of the revised western package be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Stories abound, especially in my part of the country, of farmers being encouraged to build slurry tanks and silage pits during the heady days of farming in the seventies when we were awash with money from Europe.  Proper anti-pollutant measures were not taken when these buildings were erected.  Perhaps the law was not strong enough at the time, or perhaps the climate of opinion was not such that pollution and anti-pollution measures had the same priority as they have now, but we are reaping the whirlwind. Ten years later, we have woken up belatedly to the damage being done to our rivers and lakes.  Now, sadly, those same farmers are being forced to seek substantial sums of money to up-date their farms upon threat of prosecution from local authorities.  I might add, however, that most local authorities and, indeed, my own local authority in Leitrim have been more than accommodating in their dealings with the farming community. In turn, the farming community in Leitrim have been responsive to the approaches from the local authority to avoid any activities on farms which would cause ultimately pollution of lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>Tourism is our single biggest asset in Counties Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon and the lakeland counties generally.  I referred to this before in the context of a low industrial base historically in those areas.  Our greatest assets are our natural amenities.  It would be tragic, indeed it would have an appalling economic impact on the area I come from if there was a perception that our fishing lakes and rivers were being polluted to the point of the fish population becoming extinct.  It is in that context and because of the application of the revised western package to <Col N="1202" /> areas such as County Leitrim, that I add my voice to the many voices which have been heard in recent weeks since the announcement of the revised western package asking for the anti-pollutant measures in the western package to be implemented.  That would help to alleviate the financial problems farmers are facing in trying to cope with the legislation in the area of pollution and the enhancement of our environment generally.</P>
    <P>I would also like to propose to the Minister, in a sense this perhaps comes within the ambit of the Minister of State with responsibility for foresty, that some form of grant-aid should be devised for householders in both the business as well as the private sector who own thatched houses.  There was a time, even in my own memory, when there were substantially more thatched houses dotting the countryside of Ireland than there are now.  As Senator Murphy said at the beginning of his contribution, perhaps in the context of accepting nature as being God-given and taking it for granted, we also accepted things like thatched houses and cottages as being part of our environment. They were there and we did not think about them, no more than we thought about the farmhouse with the old traditional hob on the fire, the black pot and all the other fine aspects of Irish life which sadly in some cases &mdash; and I am thinking here of the Cathaoirleach's own county &mdash; are conserved in parks as museum pieces and visitors come from afar to see those aspects of Irish life that are no longer part and parcel of everyday living.</P>
    <P>The reason I am bringing up this question of grants for thatched houses is that an Taisce have been pressing for such a policy and I agree with them.  It is a vital part of our natural heritage which is dying out and will very shortly become extinct. The response to that proposal may be: &ldquo;Well, why cannot the householders pay for it themselves?&rdquo; I understand &mdash; and I am not an expert in this field &mdash; that thatching and rethatching can prove quite expensive.  It requires constant maintenance. Indeed the rethatching of roofs <Col N="1203" /> is something that happens on a more regular basis than perhaps we are aware.  If you have a slate roof it is there until a storm knocks the slates off or something else of that nature happens which means having to devote time to it.</P>
    <P>In my home town of Drumshanbo there is one thatched house.  It is a business premises.  It is on the high street and it stands out. What motivated me to mention the thatched houses issue in the context of this motion is that the owners indicated to me recently that, simply because of the cost and the maintenance factors, they were seriously considering putting a slate roof on their house.  In the context of the rumours &mdash; perhaps the Minister can clarify this &mdash; circulating about the possibility of a new national heritage council coming into existence there may be some room for flexibility in that area.</P>
    <P>The question of a national heritage council brings me to my next proposal on which Senator Eogan touched earlier. The Government should consider seriously the re-introduction of the National Heritage Bill which came before this House in 1982, but sadly did not see its passage completed.  It is my understanding, and I rely on my peers in this context, that the National Heritage Bill contains practically all the answers to the problems that are facing us in an environmental context &mdash; I mean answers in the legislative context as distinct from a practical context.  Hopefully, that will come after the provisions of the Bill are put in place.</P>
    <P>One of the major important aspects of the future passage of the National Heritage Bill in its past form is that it would set up a national heritage council.  The membership of the council would be drawn primarily from those personnel who are professionally involved, or who have day to day expertise, in the area of our heritage.  I do not wish to suggest that civil servants are not <i>au fait</i> with their particular brief, but as we are all aware, we are dealing with a subject which covers seven or eight Government <Col N="1204" /> Departments and the resultant bureaucracy that is inherent in that reality.  If there were a national heritage council and the environment were to be brought under the umbrella of one Minister, I have every confidence that the scenario as outlined by Senator Eogan and others could only prove beneficial for the future wellbeing of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I touched briefly on tourism, and I would like to finish on tourism.  We talk about conservation as has been outlined by various speakers and most eloquently and informatively by the Minister, and a great deal has been done by Government Departments over the last few years. Many of the projects which have been taken under the wing of the Office of Public Works, such as the development of national parks, cutaway bogs, blanket bogs, and flora and fauna parks throughout the country, came as a very pleasant surprise to me.  They give the lie to any suggestion that successive Governments in recent years have not given a very important priority to environmental awareness.  That is where the tourism element comes in.  For example, there is a reference in the excellent booklet to which we have been referring, published by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, to geological rock-formations in Sliabh an Iarainn, a mountain which overlooks picturesquely the town of Drumshanbo where I live.  It attracted geologists, both students and graduates, from all over the world as far back as the fifties.</P>
    <P>These people are locally referred to as potholers.  They were looked on by the locals as rather strange people who spent most of their time digging around the mountain, going into caves, sometimes getting lost and having to be bailed out by a local farmer or the local gardaí, but they were tourists.  They were people who visited the area for their speciality.  They stayed in the area for several weeks, they spent their money in the area, and they came back.  When they came back they brought other students and people doing post-graduate work.  My late father encouraged local tourist interests to <Col N="1205" /> develop more information about the geological formations in Sliabh an Iarainn.  I can remember vividly that one lady was so enamoured with the area that one of her last requests was to have her ashes scattered on the mountain, which we did.</P>
    <P>There is a tourist element in the conservation discussion.  It is incumbent on all of us who have the interests of this country at heart that we would encourage more people throughout Ireland to identify what our heritage is and those aspects of our environment that are important to present and to future generations, and that they be encouraged to protect them. The proposal in the booklet that the relevant Department of State should identify the sites in the country is a good one. Whether in practice the resources are there to carry out that major work is another matter, but the proposal should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I could not help but notice in the excellent photographs that accompany the book, that there is one of an endangered species &mdash; the Kerry slug is internationally recognised as a threatened species. The report goes on to say that despite their ecological importance, no invertebrates, as yet, are protected by the Wildlife Act.  Perhaps if the Kerry slug had a reputation for being good at football, it would never be in danger of being extinct.</P>
    <P>I commend the movers of the motion. It is timely not just for the Government to reflect on but for all of us, as Members of this House, to reflect on.  Perhaps we will go out of here renewed and imbued with a real aspiration to ensure that wherever our natural heritage is endangered, we will shout stop and point out that it is not just we, who are here for a short time, who should appreciate the beauty of our countryside, but that we owe it to future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this booklet &ldquo;Our Natural Heritage&rdquo;, published by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  The visual impact of the booklet is top class.  The photographs show the beauty of the countryside first, and in <Col N="1206" /> other cases, the damage done by pollution, litter or cars.  The effect they are having on our countryside strikes one when reading through this booklet, a booklet which should be brought to the notice of the widest possible audience through distribution in schools, local authorities or in any other manner.  I would urge the Minister to make this booklet available to the schools and at least to local authorities so that as many people as possible would become aware and educate themselves so that they will cause less damage to our environment. How do we achieve the desired results articulated in this booklet?  We must have awareness, education and co-operation. If everybody concentrates on their own area &mdash; if a farmer concentrates on keeping his farm free of pollution, if a householder concentrates on keeping the front, side and back of his house free of litter, if every public body concentrate on their own area &mdash; in a very short time our environment would improve by several hundred per cent.</P>
      <P>The booklet deals with many aspects of our environment and raises many questions about our approach to modern machinery, modern farming methods, and so on, which are changing the whole landscape.  Even the development of our bogs has changed the landscape.  Semi-State bodies, such as Bord na Móna, involved in the development of raised bogs in the midlands over the past ten or 15 years, have changed what were several thousands of acres of vegetation, heathers and rare plants, by the process of milled peat production.  As everyone is aware, this process does away with vegetation in the bogs and the whole environment is changed.  At one time, rain was absorbed by the vegetation on the bogs and they were purified.  Now, the rain washes down on a vegetation-free surface of several thousand acres. This has far-reaching effects on smaller rivers, fish stocks and other aspects of our environment.  Those matters should also be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten or 20 years ago people cut turf with a slean in a systematic manner. Maybe that destroyed some bogs, but <Col N="1207" /> now there is new machinery for turf production. These machines can work on mountain bogs which previously were not accessible.  In other words, they produce the sausage-type turf where the machine digs down like a mole and breaks the top surface of the bog.  In areas such as Connemara with which I am familiar, machinery is cutting turf in bogs which up to now were not accessible.  This is having a detrimental effect on the environment. But people should have the right to cut enough turf for their own needs for the winter.</P>
    <P>We must be vigilant of changes in technology. We must balance our desire to protect the environment with the livelihoods of the people in those areas.  For example, in Connemara, serious difficulties have arisen.  Up to now, a sheep farmer with a couple of thousand acres of mountain bog kept 400 or 500 ewes. He left them up the mountain in the winter and brought them down to have their lambs in the spring.  He was lucky if he got on average, three-quarters of a lamb or half a lamb per ewe.  In a bad year he might not sell the lambs and he would let them up the mountain again and they came down as hoggets or wethers the following year when he sold 60 per cent of them.  That system is now changing in areas like Connemara where sheep have become a valuable asset. There is a good livelihood to be made from sheep.  A person with 1,000 or 2,000 acres of mountain land tends to look after his sheep better, and instead of letting them up the mountain in the winter, he now wants to build sheds or feeding units for his sheep on what were 2,000 bleak acres.  How do we measure the rights of that man who wishes to improve his livelihood in his natural environment against the rights of the planning authorities who tell him he cannot build the shed because for hundreds of years a shed was not necessary in that area.  A shed is necessary now because sheep have to be gathered for dosing, shearing, feeding and so on, activities which were not part of the pattern of sheep farming before. In other words, the pattern of farming is <Col N="1208" /> changing the way we have to approach the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>How do we reconcile the protection of the environment with the protection of the rights and livelihood of people who live and farm in that area?  Do we say this area should not be spoiled but should be protected for somebody who passes by once a year in a car or because it is a tourist attraction of the area?  The same problem is developing in other farming areas where intense agricultural reclamation of land has changed the environment. How can we tell a farmer that he should not improve his five, ten or 15 acres of scrub land to bring it into higher production because he would be destroying the environment by doing so?  How do we reconcile those different positions? Those are the questions we must pose.</P>
    <P>How do we reconcile the campaign where farmers have been visited by Department officials who examined their silage pits?  Almost every farmer nowadays makes silage.  This did not happen 15 or 20 years ago.  County Councils and local authorities are now asking farmers to inform the council of their proposals for silage making next year.  Has that farmer to go to great expense to adhere to the conditions now being laid down? How do we reconcile that with the man in a rural area who is trying to make a living and bring up his family in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>The tradition has changed with regard to cattle.  Cattle are now taken off the land in the winter and fed in yards.  Farmers are being told that what they are doing does not meet the councils requirements, but nobody is laying down what the requirements should be.  I know farmers who got estimates of £15,000, £20,000 and £30,000 for putting their yards in order to hold cattle over the winter.  In those circumstances, do you tell those people not to make silage but to make hay which is safe?  I notice in the top left photographs that hay is being made in a typical west of Ireland fashion.  Do we revert to penalising a farmer &mdash; and that is what putting a penalty of £15,000 or £20,000 on a farmer to improve his silage facilities is &mdash; if he cannot do that and <Col N="1209" /> many of them cannot?  Must we penalise him by making him revert to the traditional methods of farming which the Department of Agriculture, ACOT and everybody else have been advocating he must get out of for the past 15 years?  Do we penalise the man who takes the cattle off the land in the winter and tell him he cannot have his cattle in for the winter but must leave them roaming the land doing damage in other directions?  I am raising those problems to see where the line lies between the rights of people and the rights of our environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said there were seven different Departments involved in the protection of the environment.  Perhaps we should have a co-ordination of those Departments, with only one giving advice.  It is not good enough for somebody to come out from one Department and tell a man he cannot continue to work as he has been doing.  There should be a co-ordination of effort.  The man should be advised and helped to meet the requirements of all the Departments.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney &mdash; as well as succeeding in mentioning Drumshambo three or four times &mdash; mentioned the appalling state of some lakes and rivers. He mentioned that rivers in his area were &ldquo;unfishable&rdquo;.  The rivers and lakes in my area are also &ldquo;unfishable&rdquo;, but for a different reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going into the reasoning here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not intend to go into it this evening, but the rivers and lakes in my area are &ldquo;unfishable&rdquo; for reasons the Minister could cure, if he took his head out of the sand and looked at the very serious problem in the west. All our very fishable rivers are &ldquo;unfishable&rdquo; now because of the rod fishing licence.  He introduced and rushed a Bill through this House and the Dáil before Christmas, despite the fact that he gave us assurances that it had the full support of all angling clubs, etc., which turned out not to be the case.  I will not refer to that any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pose those questions to the Minister <Col N="1210" /> of State.  How do we get all the Departments co-ordinated and working together to achieve the ends I believe people, farmers and others, want to improve our environment and to stop pollution, litter, etc?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I would like to thank the Leader of the House and the leaders of the other groups for allowing this discussion to take place today.  It is very timely that we should have such a debate.  I would like to thank Senator de Buitléar and Senator Eogan, in particular, for their very interesting and informative contributions.  Every Senator listened to them with great interest, and I wish them every success during their stay here, which has certainly enhanced the Seanad.  We are also greatly indebted to the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants for producing this document.  It is an excellent document and has the quality necessary in that it makes very strong recommendations on how we should proceed for the future.  The Oireachtas and the policy makers are indebted to them for producing this document at this time.</P>
      <P>As many Senators have said, Ireland has a very beautiful environment, and we have a unique environment in many ways.  It has survived intact for thousands of years and, as I have said already, we have many features which are unique and specific to Ireland.  We have been lucky in many ways in that we have been spared the destruction of the European industrial revolution which took place at the end of last century.  We are also lucky that we have a small population and so the demands on the environment are not as great as they are in other continental European Countries.  That is something we should be aware of and we should exploit to the biggest possible advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest threat to our environment is the lack of awareness of its importance, particularly in this Country.  This awareness of the importance of the environment is found on the Continent and it is only slowly becoming apparent in this country.  This awareness has come at the <Col N="1211" /> eleventh hour.  During the sixties, seventies and early eighties, our environment was exploited.  An environment that has survived intact for thousands of years was suddenly under threat and now, at the eleventh hour, we realise what is happening.  I think we have been saved in the nick of time.  We now must set about the process of creating this awareness of the importance of the environment for all our people and, indeed, for our economic well being, particularly in relation to tourism.  The fragile miracle of our natural environment must be protected. It is very fragile and we have to get across to every man, woman and child just now important that environment is.</P>
    <P>As I have said this is important for a number of reasons in particular in relation to our tourist industry.  The whole area of fishing, walking holidays, hiking holidays and so on, is an area which Ireland is ideally poised to exploit, in particular in relation to the European tourist market.  We have a unique advantage in these areas.  We must be aware of that and do everything possible to develop such holidays.</P>
    <P>Another area which must be addressed &mdash; indeed, several Senators have already mentioned it &mdash; is the conflict between economic development and the environment. The Minister mentioned it in his speech when he said that &ldquo;environment protection can march hand in hand with development&rdquo;.  Senator McCormack went into this in great detail as it affects agriculture.  Many Senators also referred to the need to strike a balance, and that is the most important thing.  We have to strike a balance between the need for economic development and the need to protect our environment.  The achievement of this balance is one of the major issues confronting policy makers and everybody concerned with our environment.</P>
    <P>The balance has to be struck, for example, in relation to forestry, and I welcome the Minister here today. Senator de Buitléar this morning &mdash; unless I am mistaken &mdash; was a bit worried about some of the afforestation taking <Col N="1212" /> place throughout the country.  In that field alone, you can see the conflict between economic development and the protection of our environment.  We have to proceed &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will agree &mdash; with the afforestation of many areas to ensure that we are a good producer of timber while, at the same time, striking a balance to ensure that there are no undue detrimental effects on our environment.</P>
    <P>The issue of bogs has also been raised several times today.  This is where the conflict between economic development and the protection of our environment is apparent.  People need fuel.  The Country needs power to ensure that its economic activity proceeds, and yet our bogs are a great natural heritage which must be protected.  Again, the balance must be struck.  I am sure that balance can be achieved with the co-operation of all people concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack mentioned the balance in relation to agriculture with regard to economic development and the protection of our environment.  The report mentions reclamation and drainage, the effects of fertilisers on our environment and the pollution of our lakes. The intensification of agriculture is proceeding and must proceed if we are to achieve our economic targets.  In relation to agriculture it is apparent that a balance needs to be struck.  It would be a major achievement for policy makers to ensure that economic development proceeds and at the same time that our environment is protected to the greatest possible extent and as far as is practicable.  I was delighted when the Minister said he believed environmental protection can march hand in hand with development.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations have been made in the report.  I was glad to hear that the Minister will take on board, and has already taken on board, many of the suggestions made in the report.  A most interesting suggestion refers to the protection of important areas.  The report also refers to environmentally sensitive areas and suggests that these should be identified and designated.  I suggest that <Col N="1213" /> one area which is environmentally sensitive is the Great Blasket Island of County Kerry with which I am familiar. The Great Blasket Island is famed in folklore, poetry and in literature and is also famed for its terrific wildlife which is present there.  A group down there at the moment called Fundúireacht na mBlascaodaí are doing everything possible to ensure that this environmentally sensitive area is protected and perhaps made into a national park.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Seanad that new legislation is urgently needed in that regard. The titled to the lands on the islands are very much in doubt and are in dispute. This is causing enormous problems for the authorities in protecting the island, its folklore and history.  I suggest that either a specific Bill is needed to tackle the situation found on the Blasket Islands or else a new Bill dealing with many areas similar to the Blasket Islands to ensure that the Government can acquire them for the benefit of the nation.  At the moment that is not possible due to the very technical legal situation which is to be found there.  I suggest that legislation is needed and I call on the Government to give that urgent attention.</P>
    <P>The report also places emphasis on species based conservation.  Again I could refer to the Blasket Islands in this regard. A number of experiments have been taking place there.  The report suggests that voluntary organisations and individuals have also a role to play in protecting our environment.  There are a number of examples to be found in west Kerry where voluntary organisations and individuals have been implementing a conservation programme with specific reference to species based conservation. I know for example, and Senator de Buitléar may be able to correct me if I am wrong, that there is a moth found in the Blasket Islands which is unique to the Blasket Islands.  It cannot be found anywhere else in the world.  If people are not aware of that it could become extinct for one reason or another.  That is just one area of concern and I agree with the report using that example.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that the red deer <Col N="1214" /> which is to be found in Killarney is under threat because it interbreeds with other types of deer.  Experiments have taken place there to ensure that another species which is under threat will be protected. Also to be found in the Blasket Islands is the largest colony in the world of stormy petrels.  The three species I have mentioned are unique to that part of the country. A great deal can be done by voluntary organisations and individuals co-operating together with the authorities to ensure that they are protected.  I agree fully with the recommendation in the report that we need to focus on species based conservation.</P>
    <P>The report also calls for education and public awareness.  That is possibly one of the most important recommendations in the report.  It is important that this document should be made available in all the schools throughout the country and that its recommendations should be given serious consideration because the future of our environment depends on our young people who are possibly more sensitive to the need for the conservation of our environment.  I suggest that this document should be made available in all schools throughout the country and that we draw it to the teachers' attention.</P>
    <P>I have been very heartened in the Millennium Year to find a number of tree planting projects taking place in schools throughout the city.  Thousands and thousands of trees have been planted this year.  This has been undertaken by the local authorities, by voluntary groups and schools throughout the city.  In places where trees tend not to survive, they have been planted and cared for by schoolchildren and are now surviving and cared for by the local people involved.  Dublin Corporation are to be fully congratulated also on their tree planting programme for the Millennium Year in that vast numbers of trees are being planted throughout the city in their parks.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I agree with the last recommendation of the report that the Government should co-ordinate their activities in relation to the environment and that one single Minister should be given responsibility for the various issues <Col N="1215" /> involved in it.  The Minister, Deputy Treacy, referred to this in his speech and said he believed it was a good idea.  Perhaps we could proceed further with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the publication of this report by a sister union, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  It is quite significant that very rarely this part of the work of Irish trade unions becomes public.  The fact that very many of them are spending huge amounts of resources on this kind of work is quite significant. People like Greg Maxwell, Vera Hogan, Paul Doyle, whom I know, and Alan Craig whom I do not know, are very much to be congratulated.  Considering that I am normally in the position of criticising the banks, the banks who sponsored it are also to be praised.  I find much of interest in the report.  When it was first published I wrote a letter of congratulations to the union.  I find much good sense in it and I think every speaker so far today has gone along with the same general idea.</P>
      <P>My own area of specific interest is the area of education.  Listening to Senator Haughey's words and to other Senators there is a very clear recognition and understanding that awareness of the need for a commitment to the environment should begin in the most formative years. Therefore the schools and education generally can have a major impact in that general area.  I must confess that I came through primary and post-primary education barely knowing the names of trees, plants, insects or birds.  I knew the few I needed to know to write an essay.  I did not have a love of nature.  The reason I refer to that is that those were the days of the famous primary certificate when the objective of education was very narrow by virtue of the examinations at the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the new curriculum in 1972 which includes environmental studies changed all that.  I recommend Senators who have not done so before that they should walk into even the most junior classes in primary schools and the <Col N="1216" /> first thing they will notice is the great awareness of nature on the part of the young pupils in those classrooms.  Almost every classroom in the country nowadays has a nature table which changes with the seasons and reflects the changes in nature outside.  At this time of the year, they are watching the tadpoles.  At another time they are collecting conkers or whatever it happens to be and all the time nature is being reflected in the classroom.</P>
    <P>Work which needs to be encouraged and which takes a lot of time in classrooms, but which everybody maintains is very important, is a type of tree census in local areas, that is, to count the number of trees, to name them and to perhaps draw a map of them.  This is valuable work which gives young people a great sense of involvement in their environment, an understanding of the environment and eventually a love of the environment.  I say that because I honestly believe &mdash; and it saddens me &mdash; that we are the dirtiest and environmentally most uncaring nation in Europe.  Of the countries I have been in, I rank ourselves bottom of the league.  We must face up to it.  We have no understanding of the environment.</P>
    <P>I come from the west and because we see so much space around us in the west we do not learn to love the environment and appreciate the need to conserve it. That is changing now because of the changes that are taking place in the education system.  I can assure Senators that this kind of work in the classroom takes a lot of time and energy and one to one work, lots of movements around the room, project work from pupils and it does not happen in large classes.</P>
    <P>I am not going to sing that song today, but everybody must understand that these are precisely the areas referred to as the peripheral areas in the curriculum which suffer in large classes and when there are cutbacks in education.  Everything in this document demands a commitment to funds, and that is one area where it cannot be done.  I want to refer to something Senator Haughey said.  He suggested that this booklet should be available in every school in Ireland.  I <Col N="1217" /> certainly agree completely that there should be a copy in every school in Ireland.  Every primary school where nature study is taught as a subject should have it available to them.  I can guarantee that my own union, INTO, would be quite prepared to subsidise the circulation of this document, were it to be made available.  It would be a valuable resource in primary schools.  It would do a great deal to direct the attention of teachers, pupils and parents to nature and the environment.  I would like to make that offer and make it quite definitely.</P>
    <P>I am trying to cover the areas which have led to an increased awareness of the environment.  The new curriculum in primary schools has at least enabled children to identify trees, leaves, insects, plants etc., and to understand pollution. I find it a joke to listen to Senator Mooney saying children in our schools should be involved in some type of nature watch. They are involved in nature watches. There is not a school in this country where the pupils are not involved and interested in what is happening in nature around them and who do not take a very keen interest in it but, unfortunately, sometimes this interest does not carry over.</P>
    <P>It gladdened me the day before yesterday &mdash; and this refers to what Senator Haughey said about the corporation's tree planting programme &mdash; driving through Ringsend from the east link bridge up towards Sandymount last week to see hundreds of trees planted there and not one of them has been vandalised. That is a step forward.  I remember speaking to the corporation landscaping department five years ago and they said they worked on a basis of 20 per cent only of trees surviving.  It was great to see a couple of hundred trees growing and none damaged.  That really is significant and shows the advance we have made.</P>
    <P>It would be absolutely remiss of us on this side of the House not to put on the record the tremendous work that has been done by individuals.  I want to single out my colleagues, Senator Eogan and Senator Éamon de Buitléar in this area. <Col N="1218" /> Nobody can describe adequately the contribution they have made to the environment and this is something for which the rest of us must be deeply grateful.  It is significant that even in this booklet quite a number of the photographs have been taken by Senator de Buitléar which shows his continuing involvement in that area.  We are greateful for this.</P>
    <P>I want to single out trees.  It is regrettable that we in Ireland have a very poor history having a love for trees.  I was trying to establish where would be a good example of a native Irish forest.  It is quite difficult.  My colleagues tells me that Killarney is probably the best example.  I am very chauvinistic about trees and one of my worst moments was arriving home and finding that the woman with whom I share my home, mortgage and family had planted a Leyandi hedge along the far end of the garden.  I went out immediately and got some silver birch to get the balance right.  I believe we do not have Irish trees.  Cromwell planted the ash tree.  The beautiful ash trees all over the country are the better legacy Cromwell left us.  He planted them for the stockades and so that they could make stocks for guns and the GAA came along later and decided to make camáns out of them. Nowadays we can look at them and love them for what they are.  The planters came and brought sycamore trees from Canada and used them to line the avenues up to the big houses.  That was a fair legacy to be left.</P>
    <P>We have a very poor record of tree planting.  I know there are regulations to stop people from cutting trees without replacing them.  I see it happening all around me.  Trees go and are not replaced.  There should be a major effort to replace all that was lost through the Dutch elm disease over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>You learn more from your own home than you do from many other things.  I was very pleased to see in the kitchen recently &mdash; and it is still there &mdash; a huge chart with a list of planet-friendly aerosols and aerosols which do not cause damage.  This is something that bothers me because I was on to the Department <Col N="1219" /> of the Environment some months ago and I asked about Government policy on chlorofluorocarbons.  I want to explain that the use of aerosols, and such like, increases the level of fluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere leading to damage of the ozone layer, which is happening at present through the use of these materials and through the use of polystyrene substances and so on.</P>
    <P>Every time people go into a fast food junk joint they should insist on having their food handed out to them in cardboard or something else and not in polystyrene. My family always do.  It needs to be brought home to people that every time they use one of these polystyrene containers and every time they press a button on an aerosol can they are damaging the ozone layer.  Damaging the ozone layer means that the strainer, as it were, on the sun's rays is weakened. There is a build up of ultra violet rays which is creating an increase in the world's temperature.  The increase in the world's temperature is killing off huge amounts of wildlife and is having what is referred to as a hothouse or greenhouse effect on our planet and is, in fact, interfering with the life chain.</P>
    <P>What has that got to do with what we are discussing today?  It has got to do with European Conventions which are not referred to specifically but are referred to in passing in the section on international responsibilities in this document.  It saddened me when I rang the Department of the Environment about this matter two months ago to be told that we are a very small country and the impact we would have on this area would mean nothing in world terms.  That is not the right attitude. If these items are causing damage to our environment, they should not be imported.  We have taken a reverse line on things like the canned beer in Europe. I would like us to carry that policy to its logical conclusion and to stop the importation of things like aerosols which are causing damage to the planet.  We are a party to an agreement to cut down on fluorocarbons and we should legislate not <Col N="1220" /> to allow the importation of environmentally damaging containers.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to discuss the natural heritage without discussing section 4. Section 4, as it is used by local authorities, was put there for a very proper reason, to protect the environment.  In many cases it has led to a visual pollution.  I would say as well in reference to na Blascaodaí go bhfuil baint agam féin le Fundúireacht na mBlascaodaí.  Aontaím go mór leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Haughey ar an cheist sin, is é sin go bhfuil níos mó de chultúr agus scríbhneoireacht na hÉireann tagaithe as an míle cearnach sin den Bhlascaod Mór ná mar atá tagaithe as aon mhíle cearnach eile den tír.  Cuireann sé isteach go mór ormsa go bhfuil an chuid sin den oidhreacht á cur ar sale and being used as a little bit of real estate by US real estate agents and being bought and sold just like a plot or a block of Los Angeles or New York.  It saddens me and I find it desperately unpalatable and unacceptable that a great source of culture and writing in this country should be used like that.  I certainly know that the Minister here present would have similar views on that and that his former public relations officer &mdash; who has gone on to higher things this morning &mdash; has a very. clear public interest in the same thing.</P>
    <P>In going through the generality of what is in the natural heritage document I also refer to its value in purely commercial terms, that is, the commercial value of, the tourism industry.  Our natural heritage is all around us.  This is not a sun-drenched island such as we see in publications depicting this country.  It is a lovely island with great beauty.  We do not believe that ourselves.  I know that because I meet people every day of the week who have never seen the Glens of Antrim, the Mountains of Mourne, or have never driven over the Glenshane Pass or around Slea Head or wherever it happens to be.  They just do not know this country.  They know the Canaries better.  I have no objection to people going to the Canaries but I think that people are not committed and do not know the beauty of this country, whether it is walking between two locks on a canal <Col N="1221" /> in the midlands or looking at a birch tree growing in the middle of a bog on its own in the midlands.  There is beauty of different kinds in every part of this country.  We have failed to sell it in that way.  We should abolish depicting sun in advertisements about this country abroad.  The sun should not be allowed in them.</P>
    <P>I got another brochure last week and it made me sick to look at it.  There were four photographs on two pages &mdash; the publication came to every Member last week &mdash; and in every one of them there was a bright shining sun.  That is how we lose people.  We do not need it.  I guarantee that looking down over Baile an Fheirtearaigh on a wet day with the wind blowing against you is as thrilling and as exciting and as satisfactory as walking on a sun-drenched day.  We have failed to sell this and we have also failed to project the fact that our bogs and walks are beautiful, that our forests are beautiful.  We have our national parks. This Government and successive Governments had done tremendous work in this area whether it be in Muckross, or Glenveagh, or wherever it is. You just see the interest of people when they are walking through the forest walks or the wood walks in these areas.</P>
    <P>A discussion on our natural heritage is a great step forward for the House.  I want to refer to a number of the recommendations that have been made.  We need amending legislation to cover the gaps that are there.  I commend this to Government.  This is something we can all agree on and this is the House to bring it into.  Let us consider the report before us.  Give us a bit of time to consider it and let us respond to it.  The cost involved in many of these things is not great.  Social legislation of this type is tremendously important.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the recommendations on international aid.  I am delighted is referred to because we actually have an attitude in Ireland which I think grew up with the black babies long ago, the patronising attitude that you shove money out to the Third World or the developing world and, once it is out <Col N="1222" /> there, you are doing good.  We have not always done good.  Sometimes that money has been very badly used in terms of protecting the environment and some of the projects are very much open to question.  Now that we have adopted a more sophisticated approach we should insist, when we are sending aid to developing the Third World, that that aid is invested and used in a way which is environmentally friendly.  I certainly go along with the recommendation on integrating conservation needs into Irish aid to developing countries.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to talk with any sense of authority on the question of bogs.  When I was young I spent most of my time getting away from them in case I got a job there.  It was hard for me to love bogs but I certainly have learned enough from television to know that they are beautiful indeed.  I have been learning from television.  The Kerry slug was not much loved either in my youth.  It was considered to be a bit of a nuisance.  Now that I have grown up, I know it is important, I am learning that today as well. Another part of my mis-spent youth was spent in that beautiful part of the country.</P>
    <P>Going through the list of photographs I see that one was taken half a mile from where my grandmother was born and an other where my father was born, an other where I used to live and an other where I live now.  As none of those constituencies is of any value to me, I will just say it is a tremendously beautiful publication and very well put together.  It will lead to greater public awareness of our natural heritage.  If it can be circulated it will help us to get our young people to love our country, to learn that we can be proud of it and that we will not countenance to tolerate anything which is damaging to it.  We will work actively towards improving it.  That can only be done by making ourselves aware of it and, as legislators, we have a duty to do this to the ultimate.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the value of the documentation. Again I congratulate the Union of Public and Technical Civil Servants on publishing it and I thank the <Col N="1223" /> Leader of the House for making this time available for the discussion.</P>

This report has stimulated an awareness and interest in conservation.  This House has played a key role in that and we are deeply grateful for it.  If I were to single out any recommendation in the report I think it would be recommendation No. 3 dealing with education and public awareness. I would hope that, in co-operation and in discussion with the Minister and the Department of Education, we might be able to do something in that field in the interest of the present and future generations but, above all, to make young people aware of the tremendous environment and the wonderful heritage we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you will and I will try to be helpful to you as well.  I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph (a), line 19, to delete &ldquo;£5,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In recommendation No. 1 to section 1 on page 7 of the Bill, it is suggested that the figure £5,500 be deleted and substituted by the figure of £6,000.  This is in line with an amendment which we moved in the other House which was not accepted but it still does not remove the principle involved in the recommendation.  We seriously put it forward to the Minister for consideration.  It deals with a specific group of people who now find themselves threatened by the tax net if we do not keep these guidelines or allowances at this level.  These are the kind of people about whom the Minister and most of the Opposition passed favourable comments. We find that this group of people are now coming into the area of the tax net and they are people that we never intended to be seriously considered as taxpayers under the PRSI and PAYE nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have found from experience that people who are included in this category, like single people, widowed persons, or people of certain age groups are now paying quite a considerable amount of income tax.  They are old age pensioners who have other small incomes from their late husband's employment with local authorities, forestry and various other public service jobs and they also have qualified for contributory old age pensions and there are people, to my own personal knowledge, in the high eighties who, unbelievably, are now paying income tax.  These recommendations are an effort to push up the allowances that are applicable to people in that specific category, particularly people in the old age categories.  They just do not understand why this Government or, indeed, any Government have seen fit to tax them on what are in fact pensions that their late husbands had worked hard for and contributed towards all their lives.  They are added to the social welfare income. <Col N="1226" /> Both are bulked together for income tax purposes and these people find themselves paying a considerable amount of income tax out of their other pensions.</P>
    <P>I think the principle of all incomes being considered for tax purposes is fine but there must be exclusions for particular categories.  The Minister in the budget has recognised that there was a special case to be made for these people but we are suggesting that the figures to which he has increased the allowances in the Finance Bill are not at all in accordance with what we consider reasonable. The figures we have suggested here are not unreasonable.  We have not just pulled a figure out of the air, so to speak, and decided to round it up from £5,500 to £6,000 in page 7, paragraph (a) line 19.  That is a specific figure that we feel would just remove the anomaly that has now come into these categories.  I do not think our proposals are unreasonable.  I hope the House will agree with this recommendation and that the Minister will see the argument we are making as reasonable, particularly for the categories that I have described.</P>

      <P>Recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 7 and 8 propose to increase the general exemption limits as set out in the Bill by £500 for married couples and by £250 for single and widowed persons.  Acceptance of these recommendations would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £4.5 million in 1988 and £7.6 million in a full year and would exempt some 10,600 taxpayers from the tax liability.  Recommendations Nos. 3, 5, 9 and 11 propose to increase the age exemption limits as set out in the Bill by £500 for married couples and £250 for single and widowed persons aged 65 years or over but under 75 years.  Acceptance of these recommendations would cost the Exchequer £1.4 million in 1988 and £2.1 million in a full year, while some 4,200 taxpayers would be exempt from tax liability as a result.  Recommendations Nos. 4, 6, 10 and 12 propose to increase the age exemption limits by £500 for married couples and £250 for single and widowed <Col N="1227" /> persons aged 75 years or over.  If these recommendations were to be accepted it would cost the Exchequer £400,000 in 1988 and £600,000 in a full year and approximately 1,200 taxpayers would be removed from tax liability.  The total cost to the Exchequer of recommendations Nos. 1 to 12 combined would be £6.1 million in 1988 and £10.3 million in a full year and a total of 16,000 taxpayers would benefit.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to similar requests in the Dáil, section 1 already provides generous increases in the exemption limits: £200 in the case of a married couple under 75 years of age, or £100 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; £250 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is aged 75 years or over, or £125 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category.  These increases and the associated marginal relief will cost the Exchequer £2.3 million in 1988 and £4.1 million in a full year and will exempt a total of 9,100 persons from liability to income tax.  A further 33,200 will have reduced liability because of the operation of marginal relief as a consequence of the increases.  The increases in the exemption limits provided for in section 1 of the Bill are the most generous that can be afforded at this time especially as other significant reliefs &mdash; the increases in the rate bands and the main personal allowances and the renewal of the PRSI allowance, beyond that promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; are provided for in the Bill and in those circumstances, as I said in the Dáil in reply to similar requests, I cannot accept the recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party recommendations as outlined are laudable in themselves.  I would dearly like to see the kind of increases proposed but it is somewhat disingenuous of the Labour Party to bring forward suggestions such as this, laudable and all as they are, without indicating where the substantial sums which the Minister has said they will cost <Col N="1228" /> will come from.  These increases in allowances have to be financed and the onus is very firmly on The Labour Party to state how the money can be obtained. Are they talking about additional expenditure cuts?  I would think they are.  Are they talking about broadening the tax base?  Have they themselves costed these proposals?  Any suggestions like this coming forward should be more specific. We do not live any longer, I contend, in an age of populist politics and these amendments brought forward without solid backing, sound costing and specific suggestions, fall into the realm of populist politics.  So, while I would like to see these measures introduced, without the background and the context in which I speak I cannot go along with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for responding to our recommendations.  We realise, because we had also done the costings on them, that they would cost about £10 million.  We have no problems whatsoever because they are specific categories of people in which everybody, including Fine Gael, have avowed a special interest.  Indeed, if we talk about populist policies Senator Bulbulia's party published such a populist policy document in the last couple of days with no costings whatsoever.  At least we were being specific in requesting that the allocations would be made to a particular category of people who are certainly disadvantaged at this time and who have already suffered from savage cuts through lack of allocations for funding in the capital programme and in the health estimates and all the others to which Fine Gael have acceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being specific.  We picked out a category of people we feel would and should benefit from recommendations like this.  We accept, of course the figure presented by the Minister of £10.3 million as the cost of conceding this proposal but the Minister has himself confirmed the argument here because he has made some adjustments in the Finance Bill to cater for this category of taxpayer which all of us agree is possibly stretching the whole concept of PAYE to its very limits. <Col N="1229" /> We are now taxing people aged 65 and over and under 75, and then 75 and over and under 80, whose husbands worked all their lives and who now have outside pensions apart from their social welfare pensions.  Of course the concessions have to be funded and, of course, we would suggest that the tax net should be broadened to accommodate this, but is that not what Fine Gael have been suggesting in the last couple of days, that we should broaden the tax net to do this?</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has his own views on this because his party are on record as saying that if you suggest options in a tax programme, you must cost it.  At least we were doing it specifically in the budget.  We were making a recommendation that was ruled out of order because it would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  This was one way in which you could help to fund this kind of desirable social policy in the area of tax. We are also suggesting here a change in the farm tax system which we feel would have brought in additional funds for the Minister.  However, the responsibility for all these matters lies with the Minister and it is our responsibility in the Labour Party &mdash; and no other party will take it from us &mdash; to point out particular areas in this category we feel are disadvantaged and need to be recognised by the Minister of this minority Government and by any other party who might want to support them in Government.  We in the Labour Party are concerned about these categories. We feel that injustices are being done.  We feel they are paying more than their fair share to survive in a system of cuts in areas in which they need assistance and services like health care.</P>
    <P>I have no apology to make to anybody for doing what we consider is our social responsibility to make the Minister aware of the position.  He accepts himself that he has a concern in this area because he increased these limits.  What we are saying is that the increases are not enough for this category.  The Minister has the purse strings: he can decide which other sector can be asked to pay a fair share.  I said in my Second Stage contribution to <Col N="1230" /> this Bill that we are in favour of a programme of re-assessment of what income tax is all about and what tax people are expected to pay to the State.  We find an inability by some people to consider that there anomalies.  We consider there are anomalies, in particular in these categories of disadvantaged people on relatively low incomes.  Unless we keep indexing their allowance bands and increasing their allowances, they will find every other day, with small increases in social welfare and indexed linked increases from their pension funds from county councils and otherwise, that they will be paying more and more tax.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are only 16,000 beneficiaries of this proposal indicates that the number of people is fairly confined but that does not remove the anomaly because among these 16,000 people there are many older people who have made a major contribution to the economic life of this country for well nigh a half century.  We feel, at least, that we have a responsibility to highlight what we consider is the plight of those people. The fact is that 16,000 people pay to the Exchequer £10.3 million &mdash; that is what the Minister has costed these recommendations at and that is the kind of imposition we have made on people in the old age categories.  Why should anybody have to apologise for putting that kind of case to the Minister for Finance in a democracy, in which there is at least a socialist voice that is prepared to state its case unequivocally, in and out of Government, and we continue to do that.</P>

They should be consistent.  The fact is that when they were in Government they gave miserly increases to social welfare recipients.  Not alone did they give miserly amounts but rather than giving them in April and July, as was the tradition with the Fianna Fáil Governments over the years, they put the increases back as far as they could, <Col N="1231" /> to November.  I am making the point that they had their chance to be magnanimous but failed, when in Government.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say in reply to Senator Ferris that nobody asked him to make any apology for putting down this list of recommendations. He is, of course, quite entitled to do so and in principle I would support giving increases to the categories of people he mentioned.  I have found the Labour Party to be very long on analysis but very short on specifics in relation to suggestions and hard information as to where money is to come from.</P>
      <P>I gather from what Senator Ferris has said that the Labour Party are in support of broadening the tax base in order to fund this kind of increases.  I assume he is opposed to further expenditure cuts in order to fund them since his party are opposed, it would appear, to all expenditure cuts.  I would invite Senator Ferris and his party to join with us and other interested parties in sitting on an all-party committee to discuss how there can be meaningful reform of our tax system in order to give these very people the type of increases which these recommendations suggest and, indeed, which I believe they are entitled to.  Senator Ferris should not feel that on my own account or on anybody else's account he must apologise for putting down these amendments.  He certainly should not.</P>

      <P>Nobody should ever apologise for putting down things that would help the community outside and that is why section 1 is doing just what is proposed by the Government in the budget.  We are doing that and doing what we can afford in the context of the budgetary constraints of this year.  We did show our concern and the difficulties of elderly persons are recognised in the tax code by increased exemption, according to the appropriate age allowances. Deputies and Senators know that well. What we have done in this range of allowances is spend the kind of money we have <Col N="1232" /> available in the context of the overall budgetary position.</P>

      <P>I would like to respond to what was said previously by Senator Fallon about the social welfare increases during the terms of the previous Government. I want to put it on the record that the only country in the EC where increases in social welfare stayed ahead of inflation was this country, under Deputy Barry Desmond as Minister for Social Welfare.  So the statement made by Senator Fallon was incorrect.  Regarding apologising or anything else &mdash; we put down our amendments and that is it.  We will pursue them and where money comes from is a matter for the Minister.  Let me make one suggestion, and it will come up later on as we deal with another recommendation. Figures presented by the ICMSA would indicate that £30 million a year is spent on accountants for the processing of returns to the Revenue Commissioners for income tax and a further £10 million of State money is used in the administration of these returns. That is £40 million the Minister could very well look at.</P>

Just because the Minister decides to make a political promise to somebody and then abolish a tax code that was set in place, does not mean it was right.  It was wrong, but the Minister had to fulfil a promise.  We were asked by two speakers &mdash; not by the Minister because I said it was the Minister's responsibility &mdash; where is the money coming from?  We are suggesting a specific amendment which might be of assistance in that area.  We are not being unrealistic.  Our record in and out of Government has proved to be not alone realistic but generous.  We have been blamed for creating a deficit in the balance of payments and extra borrowing. <Col N="1234" /> The vast majority was borrowed by this Government when they were in office.</P>

      <P>The Senator has put her finger on a very important statistic. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> suggested that about £30 million would have been sufficient in tax concessions or reliefs to honour the commitment given by the Government there last year and agreed by the social partners.  Because we were in the position of keeping the budget deficit and the borrowing requirement with reasonable reductions in them for this year, it allowed us to give over £90 million of a concession this year and £152 million in a full year.  We, as a Government, will continue to go along that road.  I have said on numerous occasions and the Taoiseach and many spokespersons and Ministers have said that tax is too high and the contribution the PAYE sector make is enormous. When money becomes available this year it as given in tax reliefs under the various sections as outlined from 1 to 3.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the Minister said on Second Stage, and in moving this recommendation it is important to make these points again, we must address a particular problem which we face and the greatest problem facing the country is a two pronged one, unemployment and emigration.  Yesterday we talked about figures of 256,000 persons on average being unemployed during 1988 and 30,000 people emigrating annually. All of that is quite horrifying in its impact and that is the reason behind the putting down of this substitute recommendation on the part of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>In putting forward this recommendation I would like to summarise the Government's economic policy and we <Col N="1237" /> dealt at length with that in the debate on Second Stage.  If the Exchequer borrowing requirement is reduced to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio this will reduce interest rates and increase business confidence. If this is paralleled by effectual sectoral strategies we will achieve sufficient growth in our economy to solve our problem.  This is fine as far as it goes and credit where credit is due, but Fine Gael believe and I believe that this strategy alone will be insufficient to achieve the growth rates necessary to reduce unemployment and emigration where the figures are absolutely scarifying.</P>
    <P>There is little or no hope of reducing unemployment and cutting emigration unless we achieve continual annual growth rates of in excess of 4 per cent of GNP.  Present policy is not going to achieve this because there are a whole series of road blocks to growth which are now deeply embedded in our economy and which are not to date being tackled by Government.  All our cost factors are higher than our competitors and, in particular, they are higher than those that pertain in the UK and these include wage costs, costs of energy, costs of telecommunications and transport costs.</P>
    <P>We are bringing forward this recommendation and we want written into the Finance Bill of 1988 an introduction of the 25 per cent standard rate and a 40 per cent higher rate to income tax effected in the 1989-90 tax year.  We also want cross-party consensus on the necessity of lower marginal income tax rates as a prerequisite to economic growth.  In the earlier amendment I submitted, I suggested the all-party committee which would examine such a proposal.  We in Fine Gael believe in being absolutely realistic and we can talk, and people have talked, for years about the necessity for reform of our tax system but we have foundered when it has actually come to implement it because it involves very, very harsh choices.  The Commission on Taxation issued a report which put forward all the options before the people.  So, in fact, the homework has been done.  What is lacking is agreement on specifics which <Col N="1238" /> would allow the introduction of meaningful tax reform.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, and I think everybody who has spoken in the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill about our personal taxation said that it is a major block to growth.  It is not so much the overall level of taxation that inhibits growth, it is the fact that people on quite low incomes are on very high marginal rates.  Single persons move to an effective marginal rate of income tax/PRSI of 55.75 per cent on a gross income of about £8,500.  They move to a marginal rate of 65.75 per cent on reaching a gross income of less than £11,500.  In the UK, which is really not so far away and now a very inexpensive flight away, single persons there are taxed at the standard rate of 25 per cent until they reach an income in excess of £19,000 and then they proceed to a higher rate of 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our high marginal income tax rates reduce the work ethic.  They encourage emigration and they militate against the establishment here of overseas industries. I know the Minister supports that opinion.  I am sure he would also agree that these very high marginal rates put serious upward pressure on wages.  The fact that there is now a benign personal tax rate in the UK is adding to our problem. People are being pushed out of this country by adverse economic circumstances and they are going to the UK and are being joined there by people who like what they see there, in the benign personal tax situation.  Therefore, our personal income tax code is a major block to growth.</P>
    <P>Income tax reform is essential to growth and as essential as the stabilisation of the debt.  The Minister has merely tinkered at the margins in relation to the reforms he has introduced in this budget and Finance Bill and we in Fine Gael want to see so much more.  Many countries have attempted to reform taxation. Those that succeeded pursued a package of reforms; those that failed adopted a graduated approach and proceeded incrementally which appears to be the approach being adopted by the Government.  We believe it is an <Col N="1239" /> approach that will not bring about the reforms quickly enough.  The difficulty with the gradual approach is that in all tax reform there are those who win and those who lose.  The winners pay less tax and the losers pay more and most people in this country would feel that there are more losers than winners in our tax situation.</P>
    <P>Where reform is introduced gradually, the losers, and the pressure groups who represent them, identify their losses and they combine with opposition parties and seek to frustrate and prevent implementation of the Government's proposals. If the Government insist on proceeding with the gradual approach we will see massive pressure groups and massive lobbying and weak-kneed politicians who will succumb to that kind of lobbying and so reform will founder and it will not proceed.  If the Minister insists on proceeding in that gradual way the longed for reforms just will not come about in this country and I dread to think what will happen if we do not get the reform of the tax system which is so urgently needed.  The winners in this gradual approach system, those who will pay less tax, perceive the gains as being small and inconsequential and certainly not important enough to encourage them to support Government proposals.  The losers win the political argument and incremental policies to reform tax grind to a halt, but where a package of proposals is presented to the public and where there is a political coalition in favour of reform and where it is strong enough to implement the proposals there is some chance of success.</P>
    <P>This method of proceeding in this area has been successful in the United States and more recently in New Zealand and that is why we, in Fine Gael, are looking for this coalition of interest or consensus politics.  We have seen it succeed in the area of controlling the national debt and of cost containment and there is no reason why it should not succeed in the area of income tax reform.  The Minister on Second Stage said that an all-party committee on tax reform was, at the end <Col N="1240" /> of the day, &ldquo;merely a recipe for fudging and indecision.&rdquo;  It does not have to be like that.  If the Government take democracy seriously, if they take parliament seriously, if they take the status and importance and centrality of all-party committees seriously, then we can have consensus in the area of tax reform, we can have a coalition of interest and we can proceed and we can succeed.  Tax reform is urgent, it is vital and it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to the areas where the package type of approach has been successful, I would like to remind the Minister that in many individual states in the United States, particularly in Massachusetts and California, tax reform packages were underpinned in advance by statutory provision and tax reform not only succeeded in these two states but was rapidly implemented.  I think people in this country are running out of patience and I do not know how long more they will stand for the gradual approach, welcome and all as the improvements are this year.</P>

      <P>I hope you do not think that.  I will conclude by reiterating that we want to see a standard rate of income tax of 25 per cent and a higher rate of 40 per cent.  Our attitude to stabilishing the debt-GNP ratio has established a consensus both nationally and within the Dáil on the question of the debt, even though the debt is still rising, but the debt-GNP ratio is improving.  I would like the Minister to take on board this recommendation. It does not apply to this tax year, it is looking ahead to the next tax year and I am sure it is an objective which Government support.  I feel very strongly that he would very much like to be standing before us as Minister for Finance introducing 25 per cent and 40 per cent rates of taxation.</P>

I am delighted, first of all, that Senator Bulbulia has removed the first amendment which she had suggested, which talked about this committee that has been taken off the board now, as indeed is the 35 per cent that she has talked about and the £5,700.</P>

      <P>The 35 per cent and the taxation committee have gone and we are now talking about the 25 per cent.  That is the one I was looking at with particular interest.  We have to be very serious about what we are doing now.  This is populist politics at its greatest because much as every one of us, on all sides of the House would dearly love to feel that a Minister of Finance, any Minister for Finance, could do this, the costings put on this by the Department of Finance are so spectacular that unless we agree to a massive continuation of cuts, then there is no way that this tab could be taken up except by broadening the tax net and then we should be specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Noonan in the Dáil on this and he was talking about other areas of taxation which might cover this, but he has not been specific.  He dreaded being specific because there are many vested interests out there, which is possibly one of the reasons why he had hoped that you could have an all-party committee dealing with this particular process to get a consensus.  In a minority Government situation, where the Opposition at times will get blamed for everything that is wrong and the Government will take credit for everything that is right, it is appropriate that consensus politics on the right should try to have a sort of all-party get-together where at least the majority view should be in agreement and that they would not necessarily be blaming one another.  It is a difficult task that Fine Gael have taken upon themselves in being constructive as they see it and I am not denying how difficult a task that is.  It is difficult for the electorate to understand what it is about and it is a new era in politics.  Maybe it is a refreshing one too, because at least we <Col N="1243" /> can argue and talk about it, but I want to put by tuppence halfpenny worth on it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was replying on the previous section he said that the social partners said £30 million in hand back would be sufficient and then he was very generous, money came on stream and he was a bit better off and he gave £90 million, and £150 million in another section.  We had the Minister going overboard in what he had actually promised to the social partners.  I doubt if the social partners would agree that that is all they looked for in their arguments, but I accept what the Minister said.  However, here is a commitment in an amendment to the Minister that in future years, in the years 1988-89 and 1989-90, he would commit himself to these figures without costings.  I would not like to remove from him the responsibility as Minister for Finance to make the decision as to how he would fund this proposal.  Whether there is an all-party committee or not is irrelevant. In the final analysis it will be down in the House when there is a vote on the budget and that is how the Government will act in a democracy as always.  But how do I know that if the Minister's commitment to 20,000 jobs this year and over a three-year period is not matched at the request of the social partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why I have reservations about this is that the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> may not necessarily accept in 1989-90 that what the Minister has done this year is going to be sufficient, particularly if he does not deliver on jobs. If he does not deliver on jobs, there could <Col N="1244" /> be a massive demand in the area of tax reform, particularly in the brackets that we have dealt with in a previous section and, indeed, in some of these brackets.</P>
      <P>I would like to know how it could be possible in 1989-90 to do this without rewriting the whole tax code, which perhaps, is what should be done, in one fell swoop of 12 months in an all-party context or otherwise, and still retain credibility with the electorate.  You cannot have it that way unless you agree in principle to massive cuts and we do not agree that there should be further cuts to try to meet this.  Certainly, if there are proposals there to broaden the net to try to meet this, then this kind of amendment would stand up to critical analysis, but at the moment it does not and it is, as Senator Bulbulia has said in her own way, populist politics.  It is the politics of confusion, the politics of throwing it out to the public because it is popular to do so, without the responsibility of how you can actually make any effort to fund it.  I will wait with bated breath to see what the Minister will say on how it could be done and I will accept the Minister's suggestions in this area before we decide whether we will support this amendment or not.</P>

      <P>Let me make this comment and, indeed, I touched on it in my Second Stage speech.  The fact that the Government have had such success in the organising of public finances for 1987 in its own way can bring a problem.  That problem would be &mdash; and it is obvious here this evening &mdash; that the public at large, political commentators, political parties feel that, if you like, the worst days are over, that we can now relax, allow the old ways of indifferent management and so on to continue.  That is far from the truth, unfortunately.  The hard grind must still continue.  I am quite certain the Minister will be able to tell us very quickly what is wrong with this recommendation.  Above all he must spell out to us, as he has done in the past, that we cannot relax that this hard grind must unfortunately continue for some years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the point raised by Senator Bulbulia.  We would all have to admit that it is, as she stated, abundantly clear that our present taxation system is a huge disincentive to employment and is a major contributory factor to emigration.  When we speak of emigrants we speak from time to time of those who are forced to go abroad in search of work because they were unable to find it at home.  There are also those whom we call the voluntary emigrants who go in search&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bradford, come back to the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>These people who leave voluntarily do so to get work in regimes where the tax system is not as penal as it is in this State.  Recently in London, as part of a Fine Gael emigration group, I met with a personnel consultant who made the point to me &mdash; I do not think I am straying too far from our discussion &mdash; that when she comes to Ireland in search of people for her firm she no longer meets people who are unemployed but rather those who are working here in what we would think of as gainful employment.  Because of the huge burden of taxation they are leaving to go to places where the tax regime is not as harsh.  It cannot be argued any longer that our tax system is helping in the creation of wealth or jobs.  A simple feature of our economic policy must surely be the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon referred to the success of the Government's economic policy over the past year and I would have to admit that in many ways it was successful. The tax cuts which have come about as a result of this amount to over £100 million but yet they will not really be evident in terms of jobs created over the next year. If we wish tax reductions to result in extra jobs and to alleviate the plight of people emigrating from this shore, we must talk about radical solutions now.  For the past not just five or six years but ten years, we have been playing around with the taxation system.  It has not worked; it is <Col N="1246" /> not working; and it will not work.  It is time to look for new solutions.</P>
    <P>The recommendation proposed by Senator Bulbulia not only makes common sense but also makes economic sense.  We will have to go down that road now because if we continue with our present policies we will be left with nothing at the end of the line but continuing numbers of young people emigrating from our shores because they see no future and no hope in this country. We will be left with a minimum of 250,000 people out of work, and that is totally unacceptable.  The taxation system is a central part of the problem and it is a central part of the solution.  Our recommendation must be seriously considered because it is worthwhile, and if it is accepted it will produce dramatic results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly do my best to be so relevant.  Although I am one of that persecuted minority of people in this country, those who actually work and are on PAYE at a rate of 58 per cent, and obviously would welcome the spirit of this if it was attainable, my understanding of the Minister's difficulty in this regard is that the national debt is still rising and what is actually coming down is the rate at which that rise is occurring.  We are still in some difficulty.  Although everyone would like to have lower rates of tax, <Col N="1247" /> that is simply not possible to achieve in this quantum leap.  I have some difficulty with this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator Norris I have no difficulty with the recommendation. The problem is that people are leaving the country to find jobs elsewhere. It is emigration out of necessity, as I said yesterday.  A new phenomenon has hit this country in the past year or so.  Skilled and well-trained people are leaving here to find employment in areas where the tax rate is much lower than it is here.  The Minister in his speech yesterday said he is giving tax allowances of £150 million this year.  He said that is not insignificant in view of our economic position.  In 1986 the Government made taxation reductions of over £200 million and it almost went unnoticed.  They gave little or no relief.  The reductions were spread out over all the people who pay income tax and when 5 April arrived people saw little or no relief in their pay packets.  The same will happen with the Minister's reduction in taxation.  We do not need a tax reduction of the kind the Minister is proposing; we need tax reform.</P>
      <P>Our recommendation proposes a different structure in taxation, a reform of the taxation system that is in existence at present.  The Minister said yesterday that he is open-minded about a discussion on this matter.  I regret that he has not agreed to the all-party committee.  Unlike the other party we are not suggesting this in an election manifesto.  We are suggesting it for the agreement of all political parties, especially the three major parties who are committed to reducing the national debt and to consensus.  We have a good reason for asking not just for a tax reduction but tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>To sum up on this recommendation which we will press and which we very firmly believe in, I want to state once again that it is not a proposal for the current year but rather for 1989-90. Everybody agrees that we have a very bad tax system.  It has been universally <Col N="1248" /> agreed that this is the case.  The Minister himself has expressed grave unhappiness with it.  The majority of taxpayers object to it.  Those who can flee from it do so. Many people are forced out because of it.  We want a definite time scale for reform.  It just cannot be pushed off into the far distance.  It has to be finally focused.  There is an urgent requirement for political will and political support for the notion of tax reform.  It is not populist politics, as Senator Ferris has said.  It is not pie in the sky.  There are no hidden resources with which to do this; no crock of gold.  We have to identify resources. The Commission on Taxation did that for us.  In the first report they actually identified and spelt out the different options.  All the information is there. What is required now are political decisions.  We in Fine Gael are open to suggestions on this.  Nothing, but nothing, should be sacrosanct.</P>
      <P>I do not see why we cannot talk about property tax, for instance, even though the Senators on my left in every sense shudder in their shoes at the very mention of the words property tax.  It is something that we should actually put on the table and discuss.  That is the kind of discussion we would like to see taking place within an all-party committee so that concrete and substantial proposals and ones that have political backing can be brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax reform is largly a political matter. All the analyses have been done and endless thinking went into the commissioning of a report.  What we really are talking about &mdash; and I want to be very clear about this &mdash; is taking resources from one area and applying them in another in order to give relief.  Consensus is working in another area.  It has worked over the past 12 months in this House.  I see no reason why it should not work in the area of tax reform and in agreeing to the kinds of proposals which are part and parcel of this Fine Gael recommendation.  We are not just putting it down on the basis of a populist proposal because everybody wants to see reductions; we are putting it down in the context of hard economic choices that will have to be made and <Col N="1249" /> which will hurt in some areas.  We are looking for consensus on it on the basis of an all-party approach and finding the political will to bring about the changes which the people are demanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, and it is relevant here too, there is an air of unreality about this whole debate and particularly this recommendation.  What we are saying here is that not for this year but for next year we commit the Exchequer to a cost of £662 million.  It is all very fine for Senators to get up and say how committed they are to tax reform and tax rates, such as those mentioned in the recommendation, of 25 per cent and 40 per cent.  I want to say at the outset that tax cuts do not necessarily create jobs.  There is no evidence that this is the case.  I am amused, having listened to the debate since we started this evening. Senator Bulbulia mentioned populist politics.  Senator Ferris has already referred to the way he was criticised when he talked about amendments that would cost something like £10 million in tax concesions for particular sectors of the community.  That was described by Senator Bulbulia and Fine Gael as populist politics.  I wonder how would it be best to describe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Senator.  I do not wish to be personal in any way but she did not tell me how we would get the £662 million in respect of this recommendation.  If £10 million as proposed by Labour is populist politics then £662 million must be really pie in the sky politics.  That is the only way I could justifiably describe this proposal which does not include any suggestion as to where the money might be raised.  A <Col N="1250" /> committee to do such work would not, in my view, be of any advantage whatsoever because, as Senator Ferris has rightly said, at the end of the day it is a matter for the Government and they must introduce whatever measures are necessary to provide the resources for services, concessions or reliefs that are given.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind the House that this year we will borrow £1,457 million just to keep going.  As Senator Norris said, the national debt continues to rise, albeit at a much reduced rate.  We hope to have it stabilised in the not too distant future.  That is our aim.  When it is stabilised we just cannot stop there.  We will have to reduce it.  We have to be realistic about all these suggestions.  I am not surprised that these kinds of proposals have emerged.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the present difficulties we are in a position to bring in certain tax reforms in this area, such as those in sections 1 to 3, regarding self-assessment, the extension of PRSI to the self-employed, the corporation tax changes, the incentives for payment of arrears and so on.  There is more reform contained in the budget of this year and in the Finance Bill before the House than there has been for some time.  Because of that, people think that we can just open the gates, but we cannot do that.  We can live only within our resources and even at this stage we are not doing that.  We are borrowing £1,457 million to survive this year. It would be very difficult for anybody even to contemplate accepting this recommendation.  Even if the Government were in a position to provide the resources as Senator Bulbulia said to change the taxation from one sector of the economy to another, or one section of the community to another, that would not reduce our national debt by £1.  The national debt has doubled in the last five years.  Unlike what Senator Ferris said earlier, the fact is that the Coalition partners were responsible for the huge increase in the national debt.  I am not going to get into that area but I can get the facts to show that what I am saying is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> We must continue on the road of reducing the national debt and controlling the public finances.  It is only right to put on record in this House that the success of the Government's approach over the last 14 months has led to sharply reduced interest rates, low and stable prices, better cost competitiveness, a better export and balance of payments position and specific development programmes for individual sectors.  Those were major achievements in 14 months.  Any relaxation at this stage in our determination to sort out the budget and debt problems would have a disastrous effect on confidence and we cannot and will not contemplate that.  If we were to be fair and honest to the public at large and put the full picture before them, as I think we are all entitled to do as politicians and not just the carrot of the 25 per cent and the 40 per cent tax rates &mdash; that means a lot to all of us, as Senator Norris has rightly said, because we pay tax at very high rates &mdash; we must also put the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle talked about how committed they are and how they would press this recommendation but how committed would those same Senators or their party be to the kind of proposals that would be necessary to implement the essence of this recommendation?  Mortgage interest relief would have to go, at a cost of £160 million.  That applies to every person who is buying a house, who went out and borrowed, are now committed to paying for that house and are getting a tax concession for doing so.  Are the Fine Gael Senators committed to telling all those people that their interest relief will be removed?  Secondly, is the relief to those people who have not got medical cards, who provide their own health services through the VHI, to be removed?  That relief costs £48 million.  How committed would the Senators be to that or to the removal of life assurance relief which costs £44 million?  Are we going to tax lump sum payments on retirement which are not taxed at present?  That would save £49 million.  When we add up all those we are not half way to the £662 million. <Col N="1252" /> We would have to consider further measures such as a 15 per cent VAT rate on food and children's clothing which is not there at present.  How committed are people to that?  That is the kind of committment you are going to need if you want to have tax rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent in 1989 and 1990.</P>
    <P>One issue that was raised by Senator Bulbulia is the question of property tax which would have to bring in something in the order of £200 million plus, before we would reach the £662 million which would be the cost of implementing this recommendation.  It is better to put both sides of the coin on the record for all to see so that the public at large will know exactly what is being proposed by any individual politician from any party. When people get up, as they have done in the past, and promise one thing or another for the future, whatever party or individual it might be, the public at large will be in a position to see whether or not it is realistic and how it is going to be paid for.  We cannot give ourselves concessions or reliefs out of borrowings any more.  Those days are gone.</P>
    <P>Tax cuts in the UK were mentioned.  It is no harm to put it on record that they have been funded from privatisation, the selling off of enormous assets belonging to the people and also by huge resources, which are beginning to run out, from North Sea oil.  We do not have either. We have to be realistic when we put forward these sorts of suggestions and compare the situation here with that in other countries.  How did the US, which was mentioned, finance their tax cuts? They did so by borrowing and now they are up to their necks with the twin deficits and they do not know what to do to get out of either one.  We got ourselves into that difficulty over a number of years too. They will have to take a lot of corrective action to pay for these concessions that have been given.  We have to move very cautiously and very carefully as the Government are doing in their taxation proposals and the kind of measures they introduced in this budget.</P>
    <P>Our ambition during the election &mdash; and it is contained in the <i>Programme <Col N="1253" /> for National Recovery</i>, was to have two-thirds of the taxpayers on the standard rate as soon as possible.  This year 63 per cent of taxpayers will be on the standard rate.  That is major progress and we hope to continue in that way.  There is nobody in public life and no taxpayer of the million taxpayers who are out there who would not love to see these two rates apply.  There is no Minister for Finance who will ever pass through this or the other House who would not like to see rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent or even lower, but that will not happen unless we take away reliefs or concessions people already have, or unless we make further huge cuts in expenditure which would amount to taking 39 per cent of this year's social welfare budget.  That is what we are talking about.  It would take almost 40 per cent of the social welfare budget or 58 per cent of the education budget to pay for this tax concession. Nobody is going to be too committed to that.</P>
    <P>We can see the kind of turmoil that would be created by making savings of millions of pounds in certain areas or by the imposition of tax costing millions of pounds.  Yet in one fell swoop this sort of measure is proposed.  I will not say it is populist politics because Senator Bulbulia has denied that even though she said that the proposal of £10 million by the Labour Party is populist politics.  For the foreseeable future it is pie in the sky.</P>

The Minister and his party spent four years in Opposition denying the reality of the debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are now so vigorously going about cutting.  We lost many seats in the last election because of our honesty about the debt.  The Minister finds himself in Government and Minister for Finance because his party exhibited a total lack of honesty and committed what was by any standards the greatest U-turn probably in the history of politics when they found themselves in a minority Government.  Our proposal is an honest one.  It was not prepared without a lot of thought.  We know that it cannot succeed unless we bring about the consensus in he area of tax reform that we have brought about in the area of debt control.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to see the tax rates as outlined in this amendment I do not believe Fianna Fáil will show the necessary courage to take resources from one area and apply them to another &mdash; the kind of hard choices which he so correctly outlined in his reply to this recommendation.  If he does want to see reform, he must accept that the consensus approach which is being advocated by Fine Gael is the only one that has any chance of succeeding.  If we want to have the reform of tax which is so necessary &mdash; taxation rates are killing incentives, are forcing emigration and are causing unemployment &mdash; the only way we can do so is to sit down together, make the hard choices and, if necessary, hang together rather than hang separately which is what the Minister appears to be advocating.</P>

      <P>I would like to make one comment and, that is, to welcome the <Col N="1255" /> Minister's conversion to the Communist ideal, which I approve of heartily, which is: from each according to his means, to each according to his needs.  It is not just a Communist creed; it is a Christian one. I welcome the clear indication the Minister has given that he approves of this and that the kind of swingeing cuts that have been outlined as being necessary &mdash; a 58 per cent cut, he said in the social welfare budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Bang goes my job, exactly. I am quite prepared to admit that that would be serious for me.  This kind of swingeing cut would be resisted by the vast majority of the people, in particular with regard to social welfare.  I am unashamed to say that the abolition of the mortgage interest relief would be regarded with horror by a very large number of people who consider that they have really what amounts, if not in law at least in spirit, to a contractual relationship with the State, having entered into commitments of debt over periods of 20 to 30 years and suddenly finding the ground cut from beneath them.  In particular young married couples setting out in life would find this extremely difficult. I am more and more persuaded by the cogency of the Minister's arguments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to do some research to see what compatibility there is between Christian and Communist teaching and doctrine.  The Minister made one correct statement to the House, one that I fully endorse and agree with.  A reduction in taxation does not necessarily lead to an increase in jobs. The Minister is quite correct in saying that.  I have to say to the Minister that tax reform will lead to an increase in jobs. That is a different issue altogether.  No one is suggesting in the House that we <Col N="1256" /> should borrow extra to fund the lower taxation which is proposed in this recommendation. I want to make that clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister picked on very emotional areas in his reply &mdash; tax, mortgage relief and VHI relief.  I am certain that if we had tax rates as proposed in the recommendation, a large number of people would be receiving mortgage relief and other reliefs and would benefit because of the lower rates of tax.  I have no doubt about that.  What we have asked is that we should look at how we can reform our tax system so as to have rates of the kind which are proposed in this motion.  The Minister said yesterday that he was quite open to suggestions.  I regret that he cannot see his way to having an all-party committee to examine the proposals.  The Government would not have to accept them but there would be a broader range of party support on taxation which could only be of help in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister has had such a complete thumbs down approach to this recommendation, because while I realise that there cannot be U-turns with regard to reducing the national debt and paying interest, and that is something that happened a long time age, we have to be creative about the future.  The present tax code is having a devastating effect on this country, as has been said repeatedly here today and elsewhere.  The approach has to be imaginative.  I would like to think the Minister would not have such a closed mind with regard to getting the opinions of, and an input from, the people in the Oireachtas.  We cannot leave it as it is. We cannot say this is what it is and this is going to stay for the next four or five years.  We have to plan ahead.  There is a great deal of documentation with the Commission on Income Tax Reform. There is a lot of talent, views and opinions within the Oireachtas, and given the consensus that exists in the Dáil, it would be a pity if we did not build on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we know the people would not expect to maintain all the allowances they have with regard to house purchase, mortgage interest, life assurance and so <Col N="1257" /> on.  We should be looking at options &mdash; perhaps a sales tax, and somebody mentioned a property tax.  However, I do not think I would support that.  The options should be spelled out in the kind of all-party committee and we see, and have seen, operating for a number of years in the Oireachtas, without anybody exerting great pressure, or having any great expectations at the start.  Maybe it would have to be taken at a different level in the shorter term; it does not have to be written on tablets of stone.  I think we should be talking about it.  I do not believe it is something that in the present climate should be within the orbit of the Government party alone.  I appeal to the Minister to, perhaps, be a little more open-minded about the proposal because we are going to have to work our way towards lower tax rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the £600 million being sought by Fine Gael could only be found through hard choices and we agreed with him, but when he listed the hard choices he went to the limit.  I was surprised he missed out on the health aspect because I expected all the hospitals would be closed as part of the final solution to our problems.  We have to accept the fact that if we do go out and search for this necessary funding, certain people will be affected.  With our present regime, the tax concessions are almost going unnoticed because they are miniscule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the £160 million being offered by the Minister in this year's Finance Bill and the £600 million we would like to provide to the taxpayer next year, would create major buoyancy in the economy.  I know that is a word that the Minister has forgotten.  Before his overnight conversion last year, &ldquo;buoyancy&rdquo; was a very popular word with his party, as were the words &ldquo;creative economics&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-financing&rdquo;.  Those <Col N="1258" /> words, of course, have now disappeared, but there is still room for some movement in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed some reliefs we have at present and mentioned those which will hit people straightaway.  As of now, people have a great meas for their mortgage interest relief, and one of the reasons they have this meas is that it helps to reduce their present crushing burden of taxation.  It is part of our tax proposals to have some of this mortgage interest relief reduced.  We are not speaking of 10 per cent or 100 per cent; we are not even mentioning it as part of the solution at the moment, but their tax bill would be reduced.  The picture is not as bad as the Minister is trying to paint it.  There are, of course, hundreds of millions of pounds being offered in capital relief.  Much of this money is not doing anything to add to the labour force.  Indeed it is helping to replace men with machinery.  That is something which has to be looked at too, and that is where savings can be made.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that the dreadful options the Minister tries to present are not the only options available. There are many options open to us. Surely we are all responsible enough to be able to discuss them.  I do not think we should throw them out because we have a duty to all taxpayers to look at ways in which their taxation bill can be reduced in a fair and efficient manner and in a way which will result in extra jobs and a better economic future in the long term, a future that will see the national debt decreasing and coming under control. As I mentioned earlier, our proposals are central to this solution because the playing around that has gone on up to now is not working and will not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was astonished when I saw this recommendation because it is possibly one of the most unrealistic proposals I have ever seen put down by any political party since I have been in this House.  I can understand the great benefits of irresponsible Opposition, which all parties have been guilty of in their time, but this extends beyond anything I ever saw proposed by even the Fianna <Col N="1259" /> Fáil Party in their worst periods in Opposition. That is, quite honestly, a fairly deep stark condemnation.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to see Fine Gael who, up to now had been, in fiscal and economic terms, a responsible Opposition in supporting the Government and doing things which nobody liked doing but which were recognised almost generally as necessary, suddenly losing their nerve, breaking ranks and coming out with a proposal like this.  As the Minister said, it is not a runner.</P>
      <P>I would love to see income tax rates down.  Everybody would love to see income tax rates down, but it is a non-runner as those who proposed it know. It is wasting the time of this House, the other House, and of everybody else, to put down proposals like this which they know are not going to come into effect and which they would not bring into effect if they were in Government.  The easy decision is made by Fine Gael, and it is to reduce income tax.  We just reduce income tax and everybody is richer, but the difficult decisions are referred to somebody else &mdash; an all party committee &mdash; which is a sort of crazy, mad, Pontius Pilate tack by the Opposition party.  If they are going to put one side, let us see where it is going to hurt.</P>

      <P>Where is it in the recommendation? There is no mention of it in the recommendation.  That the recommendation says is that it should go to an all-party committee.  One thing I have learned in the seven years I have been in this House is that all-party committees are a reference point for difficult decisions which a party cannot decide on their own because the decisions are unpopular.  We had, and the Fine Gael Party of all parties ought to know, an all-party committee on divorce which was a joke.  That committee was set up specifically to avoid rather than to solve a problem. I suggest that Fine Gael are proposing to set up this all-party committee because they have not, and did <Col N="1260" /> not have the guts, when they were first announced, to actually spell out where these proposals are going to hurt.  I think it is ridiculous, irresponsible and a great pity that this proposal has been put forward at this time.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said because not too many new points were raised in the responses to my remarks.  It is interesting to note that we got some fairly concrete suggestions.  Senator Fennell proposed that we should have a sales tax, but she disagreed with the property tax suggested by Senator Bulbulia.  Maybe if we had time and with the permission of the House, we could get to the stage Senator Ross was talking about where we would have a package balancing at least.  If we were able to do things like that, we would be well advised, as public representatives, in the interest of the present generation and future generations, to do something about our huge national debt and see how we can reduce that before we start giving ourselves concessions or reliefs.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle suggested that we should talk about it.  That is what we have been doing, but the talk has to be realistic.  What we try to do is be realistic about what we are saying.  Senator Bradford raised the question of capital allowances being reduced.  We are already dealing with capital allowances in this Bill.  Senator Doyle described the suggestions I made as the emotional items of taxation.  I am waiting to hear his menu. We had expected that Fine Gael would be giving us some ideas on how this money was to be raised because, in fairness to that party, when they put forward proposals, at least they tried to cost them and say where the money would be found.  There is a new departure here. Senators cannot on the one hand criticise the present Government for what they did in Opposition and on the other justify what they are doing by saying we did it when we were in Opposition.</P>

      <P>This recommendation will give an additional special allowance to people, employees in particular, who pay the higher rate of pay-related, and is along the lines of our previous suggestions.  This is an area in which the small additional allowance could be of considerable importance, in particular to those who pay the higher rates.

      <P>The increase proposed would cost an extra £34.8 million in 1988, and the full year cost would be £58 million.  About 579,000 taxpayers <Col N="1263" /> would have incomes sufficient to benefit in whole or in part from the increase.  It must not be overlooked that the cost of the retention of the allowance at last year's level of £286 as proposed in the Bill is estimated at £50 million in 1988 and £84.3 million in a full year.  Some 592,000 taxpayers benefit, of whom 579,000 will have a reduced tax liability and 13,000 will be relieved of tax altogether. I have said already in relation to other recommendations between sections 1 and 3, that the tax reliefs we have given in this Bill since the budget go beyond those promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and are the maximum that can be afforded at present.  Because of the cost of this recommendation, I have no other option but to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 14a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 27 and 28, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&rdquo;(c) that Farmers under 80 adjusted acres be given the facility of opting for Farm Tax for 1988/89.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Labour Party recommendation emanates primarily from a survey which was carried out on behalf of the ICMSA which indicated that two-thirds of farmers were against taxation on accounts. It was found that when accounts were submitted one in four farmers had no taxable income and that on average farmers were paying £460 a year to accountants. Estimates suggest that £35 million came in from farmer taxation last year. The survey indicated that £30 million was paid to accountants for dealing with the accounts of farmers and it has also been alleged that it costs the State £10 million to process the forms.</P>
      <P>Farm tax would result in no diminution in the income to the State.  It would be easier for the farmer to administer and it does not penalise enterprise.  For example, a farmer who is efficient and gets the best return from his farm of under 80 adjusted acres is not being penalised for that.  It also takes on board the family farm unit where the farmer's wife and some of the children can be involved.  I am asking the Minister to give an option to farmers with under 80 adjusted acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation proposes to add a new subsection to the existing section 5.  I thank the Minister for accepting this new section 5 in the other House, as a commitment was given by a previous Government to people who had paid farm tax, or land tax as it was popularly known as, that they be allowed the option to write off the land tax against their income tax.  I am glad this Government have honoured that commitment because otherwise politicians would come in for contempt from taxpayers in this category.  The new subsection <Col N="1265" /> requests the Minister, for the tax year 1988-89, to consider allowing farmers with 80 adjusted acres or under the facility of opting this year to pay their income tax by way of farm tax or land tax.</P>

      <P>I announced in my budget speech last year that it was the view of the Government that farmers should be taxed in the same manner as other sections of the community, that is, an actual income.  The Government, therefore, decided last year to discontinue the farm tax for 1987 and onwards.  They believe that for equity reasons farmers should be taxed on the same basis as other income tax payers and, in particular, the same as other self-employed traders, and not by reference to special capital value criteria which were the basis for the farm tax.  This is also the view of the main farming organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are recommending that farmers with holdings of under 80 adjusted acres by given the option of either paying income tax like other taxpayers or paying farm tax.  This recommendation could not be accepted.  In the first place, it would be totally unfair to other taxpayers who have no such option as to what system of taxation should apply in their case. Secondly, it could be expected that farmers would in practice choose the option which would maximise the benefit to themselves and minimise the tax charge. A farmer likely to have no income tax <Col N="1266" /> liability because of capital allowances, interest charges or other reasons, would decide for the income tax system.  On the other hand, a farmer likely to have a significant income tax liability would opt for the farm tax system which, on the 1986 basis, would mean a farm tax payment of £700 for a farmer with 70 adjusted acres and £500 for a farmer with 50 adjusted acres.  Thirdly, the administrative arrangements necessary to operate such a dual system would be extremely costly to the Exchequer.  The whole farm tax evaluation process would have to be re-activated and would take at least three years before all holdings between 20 and 80 adjusted acres were valued for farm tax purposes.  At the same time the present arrangements for extending the farm profile system to cover more and more farmers for income tax purposes would have to be continued. For all these reasons I would not accept this recommendation.</P>

One of the reasons he gave was that it would be unfair to other taxpayers who were allowed no such option.  We were looking for a specific option for people who wanted to use this system for this particular year.  We had a genuine reason for doing that.  The ICMSA, a responsible farming organisation, recently suggested that this was a more desirable system of taxation for their members and, as Senator O'Shea said, was certainly not a disincentive to production, and they had geared themselves to opting for the land tax as it was the policy of the last Government, which they had accepted.  Unfortunately, the IFA had other interests because basically they represent the bigger farmers who were in favour of changing to the accounts system and convinced the Minister that he should revert to the accounts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that in legislation which has come from the Government this year, <Col N="1267" /> particularly in the area of social welfare, the Minister is moving towards a system where accounts are the norm that will be used for all determination of farmers' obligations to the State, whether on the new extended PRSI for farmers and self-employed, for health contributions, or otherwise.  The Minister for Social Welfare confirmed that he had profile forms sent out throughout the country and obviously this Government are gearing themselves for the system of tax based on accounts.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting an option for this year only.  I am surprised by the Minister's response that this would be unfair, because other people would not have the option.  This is supposed to be the revolutionary Finance Bill of the century. Certainly the Minister claims he has made more changes than have been made for many years.  The Finance Bill allows the opportunity for self-assessment.  It is a change in taxation policy that people will be allowed to assess themselves for income tax purposes.  Here was an option for the farmer, he would have a norm to use, a multiplication of his adjusted acres by the accepted and determined rate per adjusted acre which the last Government &mdash; which we were in &mdash; decided was a fair system.  All we are asking for is that the Minister would give farmers this option for the year 1988-89.  Many had geared themselves towards this option, many small farmers, in particular, after recovering from two disastrous years were prepared to use this system which, of course, gave the county managers the opportunity to take account of hardship cases and all other requirements that we felt should be written into it.</P>
    <P>I considered that was reasonable.  I considered that it was in line with the new progressive taxation policy of self-assessment and an amnesty for those who behaved themselves between now and September.  Here is an option for a sector who are not the best at keeping accounts and have great difficulty in coming to grips with a system required by the Revenue Commissioners.  We, in the Labour Party, believe that it would not be a cost <Col N="1268" /> on the Exchequer and would certainly ensure that money would flow quickly from farmers, particularly those who are already assessed and investigated.  We know that for farmers who have not been assessed or adjusted, it would be inoperable. We are not suggesting to the Minister that he should do that because administratively that would be an unfair request, but we certainly feel that many farmers in this category should have the option, that is all.  It is an optional extra in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is allowing for the carry over of overpayments on farm tax by farmers into their income tax affairs for 1986-87, that is, assuming they did not have taxable income to absorb it last year or, indeed, the year before.  We welcome very much the fact that he has allowed it to be carried forward into the 1987-88 tax year.  The Minister might keep it in mind that next year many farmers might still not have the taxable income to absorb it and that it should be kept there for the 1988-89 year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We in our party do not disagree with what Senator Ferris said.  It is eminently reasonable that we should make this recommendation because there are many farmers who were geared up for farm tax, especially farmers who had 80 adjusted acres and under, and were to be assessed purely and simply on what was called the land tax.  Senator Ferris has qualified the recommendation by saying he is not applying it to farmers who have not been assessed or whose acreages have not been adjusted.  That is eminently reasonable, and our party have no difficulty in going along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this recommendation so that a number of farmers with 80 adjusted acres and under whose acreages have been adjusted by the land classification office can opt for land tax.  It is a great pity &mdash; we said it last year &mdash; that the land classification office was closed down last year, because <Col N="1269" /> the former Land Commission officers were literally doing nothing for more than a year and yet being paid from State coffers.  They had no work to do and they could easily have been abroad in the field carrying out the land assessment work, not necessarily for taxation purposes.  If there is one thing that needs updating, it is information on the agricultural land of Ireland for a whole lot of reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the recommendation. Moneys were found in this year's and last year's budget to pay officers who had nothing to do.  I am merely saying there was a lot of useful and gainful work for them to do and they were not allowed to do it.  In fact, it took a court case to reinstate them as Land Commission officers.  We support the recommendation and find it eminently reasonable.</P>

      <P>One final point regarding farmers whose land has not yet been assessed.  There was an offer from ICMSA in late 1986 when their members were agreeable to pay the land tax on an arbitrary basis until the land survey was actually carried out.  The spirit of our recommendation is to extend that to all people owning under 80 adjusted acres. I would like to clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on quite some time in relation to farmer taxation and the difficulties between what the PAYE sector and the other sectors of the community, including farmers pay, I had hoped that, when we introduced the changes and the extension of the profile system in the 1987 budget, that would be the end of this argument.  I have listened to farmers and farming organisations for quite some time saying they were prepared to pay their fair share of tax and be taxed on the basis of their income. That system is in operation now.  Therefore, there can be no argument from any section of the community saying that a sector is not paying what it should.  All are now taxed on income.  That is what we had decided we would do and we introduced it last year.  I will not repeat what I said before, and in the debate in the Dáil.  I could not contemplate this for a number of reasons and I have already given them.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that the arrangements for the PRSI, which were referred to by Senator Ferris, are in place and there will be no question of any changes being made as was suggested.  Senator Ferris talked about my statements about the amount of tax reform involved in this legislation, but it was not and would not be the intention of a Minister for Finance in any reform to allow anybody the option to reduce his tax charge, as is being suggested by this amendment.</P>

    <Title>Food Aid to Ethiopia: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann noting with concern the obstacles facing the transportation and distribution of emergency food aid to the starving people in Ethiopia, appeals to all concerned to take the necessary action in order for food aid to be adequately distributed, and calls on the Government to use its good offices to effect a ceasefire between all the forces involved in the conflict in Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this motion, although I am not happy to have to do so.  I am unhappy to do so because even as we debate this motion &mdash; which, by the way, I earnestly hope will receive all-party support &mdash; human beings are starving to death and, I will contend, needlessly starving to death. Whenever a person dies needlessly it is a tragedy but when ten or 12 die needlessly it is an even greater tragedy.  How terrible it is, therefore, that those at risk from famine in Ethiopia are not numbered in dozens, or scores, or hundreds, or thousands, or even hundreds of thousands. The number of people in Ethiopia who very shortly will not have enough to eat is six million.  Do we need another holocaust? It is incumbent upon us not merely to express our concern, we must do something. When we recall the previous famine in that unfortunate land, when we recall the mass transfers of population in Ethiopia and the conflicts that are taking place, with periods of greater or lesser tension in most of the famine stricken regions, when we think of the enormous prestige expenditure recently incurred by the Ethiopian authorities, when we are aware that last year the rainfall in Ethiopia was far below normal and that in some areas it rained even less than during the period preceding the severe drought and famine of 1984 and 1985 and when we know that in these circumstances there is threat of another terrible famine in many parts of Ethiopia, since according to initial estimates there will be a shortage of 950,000 tonnes of cereals and six million people will not have enough to eat, surely we must be not merely moved to pity, we must compelled to take action. We are a small nation but our response on a previous occasion was excellent and we have, to the best of my knowledge, contributed to charities more <i>per capita</i> than any other country and I have no doubt that we can be relied upon to do the same again.  I am sure one of the reasons is that we have a very vivid memory of having our own population decimated by famine when even our closest neighbours stood by and nobody would help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also contributing on another level through the European Community. <Col N="1273" /> The focus of much of the EC development effort is the Lomé Convention.  This is a trade and aid agreement between the EC member states and 66 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, an essential clause of which makes respect for human dignity a condition of long-term paid projects in the Third World.  I understand that in June of this year the EC is considering giving, under the Lomé Convention, 230 million ECUs to Ethiopia. This huge handout, approximately 300 million US dollars, is based on said-to-be-reform of agricultural policies.  I am not against giving these moneys but I am opposed to the giving of these moneys without any controls to ensure that they are spent on famine relief and not on arms.</P>
    <P>Many people have voiced concern that a good proportion of the aid sent to Ethiopia during the last famine period was misappropriated and they fear that this will happen again.  Mr. Tony Baldry, Conservative MP for Banbury in Britain is reported in <i>The London Times</i> of December 17 as saying in the House of Commons in December last that the Ethiopian Government was spending three-quarters of the national wealth on arms and securing a four billion dollar credit from the Soviet Union for more, as well as &ldquo;press-ganging&rdquo; 300,000 young Ethiopians into the armed forces.  It was also reported that on December 6 last year Russian MIG fighters, owned by the Ethiopian Government, bombed civilian targets in Hasmet in northern Eritrea.</P>
    <P>At present in Ethiopia thousands of political prisoners are being held without trial.  Not least of these are the ten members of the former Emperor Haile Selassie's family who have been incarcerated in extreme conditions of squalor and discomfort since the communist revolution of 1974.  Of this mostly female group, whose only crime is their relationship to the former Emperor, the eldest is 76 and may soon become the second to die in custody.  Many African countries who are signatories of the Lomé Convention are rightly concerned that Ethiopia's lack of respect for human rights <Col N="1274" /> and dignity diverts attention from the real issues of long-term aid and development.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Margaret Daly, who is an MEP for Somerset and Dorset in Britain, said in January last year that while acting as co-president of the Lomé Convention's, EC, ACP, Joint Assembly that the Ethiopian ambassador begged her to give his country more time before bringing the issue before public attention.  Why would the ambassador make such a request of Margaret Daly?  Perhaps the answer is to be found in the statement emanating from the British Horn of Africa Council dated 25 February 1988 and kindly forwarded to me by the secretary of that organisation, Mr. Louis Fitzgibbon.  The statement reads, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The most serious cause of trouble not just in Ethiopia but in the whole area is the concentration of Ethiopian resources on military and paramilitary expenditure.  Ethiopia maintains, with some help from Cuba and the Soviet Union, the largest army in the African continent; larger indeed than that of two much richer countries, Nigeria and South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Statement goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Part of these armed forces are engaged in the prosecution of the civil war in Eritrea and Tigre.  It is not for this Council to pronounce upon the merits of either side in these conflicts but we have a right and, I think, a duty to protest at the refusal at the Ethiopian regime to accept the ceasefire to which the Eritrea and Tigre resistance movements have agreed in order to facilitate the passage of food to the famine stricken areas.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in that paragraph refers to Julian Amery, who is the President of the British Horn of Africa Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on Tuesday, April 12, reported that Ethiopian warplanes had dropped napalm on a food distribution centre and an orphanage in a rebel-held town in northern Ethiopia, killing and wounding at least 31 people. The MIG-21 aircraft made the bombing <Col N="1275" /> run on the town of Wukro in Tigre province on Saturday, 9 April.</P>
    <P>Again in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of 17 April this year there is a report, and I quote:</P>
    <P>An Ethiopian Army ground assault, using hundreds of Russian-built tanks backed by squadrons of MIG fighter bombers dropping napalm and nerve gas, is expected to send several hundred thousand refugees trekking to the Sudanese border for food.</P>
    <P>Napalm, as we know is a substance, used expertly in Vietnam which clings to the flesh and burns it.  It is a sad reflection on any Government when they drop this on a place which is handing out food or on an orphanage.  When the EC is planning to send money to a government which is doing this and intent on using nerve gas, I think questions have to be asked about this.</P>
    <P>It is only after several years of pressure from the World Bank, aided more recently by the European Economic Community, that the Ethiopian Government is said to have agreed to liberalise its policy on marketing of food in different regions, to raise prices paid and introduce other incentives to encourage farmers to produce more.  These reforms are viewed as essential by many western donors if there is to be any attempt to remedy the situation of structural food deficit which is ever-worsening in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>Alan Woods, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, estimated on January 5 of this year that famine would be almost unavoidable in two weeks.  That time has long since passed.  He stressed the inflexible nature of the Addis Ababa's Government agricultural policy.  On December 18 Washington announced additional aid of 105,000 tonnes of food, bringing to 250,000 tonnes the total U.S. assistance already pledged to Ethiopia for 1988. Canada promised to supply an extra 20,000 tonnes of food, along with one million Canadian dollars for the purchase of spare parts.  However, to put that in <Col N="1276" /> context I have a little quotation here from the <i>Indian Ocean Newsletter</i> of January 9, 1988.  It says:</P>
    <P>Although it is necessary, the liberalisation of Ethiopia's agricultural policy will not fundamentally resolve the national food deficit problem whose basic cause is civil war which takes up 60 per cent of the State budget.</P>
    <P>The <i>Indian Ocean Newsletter</i> goes on to comment:</P>
    <P>In this respect, neither the Soviet Union nor the West is pressing for a political settlement of the Eritrean conflict.</P>
    <P>We are not the only ones who are concerned about this problem.  I refer to an extract from <i>Hansard</i>, the record of the proceedings of the British House of Commons. In written answers on 11 December 1987 dealing with Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, specifically Ethiopia, Mr. Julian Amery had the following question:</P>
    <P>To ask the Secretary of State of Foreign and Commonwealth affairs if he will call upon the Ethiopian Government, and the resistance movements against which they are fighting, to negotiate a ceasefire so that aid provided by her Majesty's Government should reach the victims of the famine as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Linda Chalker, Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said in a written answer:</P>
    <P>The Twelve issued a statement on 13 November condemning attacks by rebel groups on food aid convoys and urging that no obstacle be put in the way of the transportation of food aid. With our European partners we have repeatedly urged progress towards a peaceful solution of the internal conflicts in Ethiopia.  A ceasefire based on humanitarian considerations would relieve much suffering and assist relief efforts.</P>
    <P>That last sentence of that written reply <Col N="1277" />&mdash; a ceasefire based on humanitarian considerations &mdash; is an important one.  This is a highly significant call for a ceasefire from the British Government and it applies equally to the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia as it does to the resistance movements fighting in different parts of Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a similar call emanating from our own Government here but phased in much stronger and much clearer terms.  What would I like to see happen?  I would like to see the Government welcome the speedy action of the European Commission in response to calls for emergency food aid including transport and relevant infrastructures.  I would like to see the Government call on the Ethiopian authorities to do everything in their power to facilitate the handling and distribution of this emergency aid to ensure that it reaches those really in need.  I would like to see the Government call on the Ethiopian Government to agree to ceasefire with the forces in Tigre and Eritrea in order for food aid to be adequately distributed.  I would like to hear the Government call for the continuation of emergency aid as long as current prevailing conditions persist.</P>
    <P>I wish that our Government would express alarm at reports that forced resettlement and villagisation programmes may be re-introduced and call on the European Commission to obtain assurance that any such programmes will be undertaken on a voluntary basis only, that they will be fully respected and that they will fully respect the human rights of those involved.  I want to hear our Government call on the Ethiopian Government to release, without further delay, those political prisoners and detainees, including members of the family of the former emperor, who have not been charged or tried as required under article 44 of the new Ethiopian Constitution.  I would like to hear our Government call on the European Commission to re-affirm in all their negotiations with the Ethiopian Government that respect for human dignity has been formally recognised by all parties as one <Col N="1278" /> of the essential elements of the EC-ACP relationship and that continuing offences against human rights and unworkable transfer of population policies will bring into question the continuation of longer term aid.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to take this debate up to the Cabinet table and down to the floor of the Lower House.  When the Minister makes a reply I do not want to hear a wishy-washy statement about the Twelve doing all they can.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister will do this, but I would appreciate a reply with a bit of bite to it.  The other statements have already been made.  For example, a reply to the European Parliament about the problem on behalf of the Ten in June 1983 &mdash; as far back as that &mdash; stated that &ldquo;while considering that the Eritrean problem is an internal matter for Ethiopia, the Ten express the hope that a political solution can be found which will bring an end to violence, ensure the observance of human rights and take account of the historic and cultural identity of Eritrea.&rdquo;  More recently, in their statement of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa in July last year, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve &ldquo;urged the governments concerned to take further steps to achieve the peaceful settlement of internal conflicts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed about the depressing state of affairs in Ethiopia.  The Ethiopian Government's human rights record is very poor and their economic policies contribute to the dreadful recurring famine.  There has been no evidence in recent years that either the Ethiopian Government or the other belligerents have been serious in seeking anything other than military solutions to their problems, though the provisions on &ldquo;autonomous regions&rdquo; under the new Constitution may just provide a ray of hope.</P>
    <P>There is so far no sign of a Soviet reluctance to supply Ethiopia's military needs.  In general, policy towards Ethiopia presents us here with a dilemma. We and other donors need to provide humanitarian assistance to the starving without conditions.  We also need to <Col N="1279" /> apply all the pressure we can on the Ethiopian Government to make changes in their economic policies, to improve their agricultural production.  We have to take a strong line in the European Community and maintain momentum.  Let Ireland take the lead in this regard.  Signor Lorenzo Natali, Vice-President of the European Commission, said in December 1987 that &ldquo;the Commission is ready to act in co-ordination, both with other Community institutions as well as with international institutions, in any effort to bring peace inside the Ethiopian borders.&rdquo; He said he was sceptical about the usefulness and the effects of a truce call in civil war regions.  He went on to say, &ldquo;but I certainly will not be in the way if one or more member states want to put forward a proposal for collective action&rdquo;. I hope we will be in the vanguard of that collective action.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of other Senators on this matter.  May I remind all here present that, when we leave this Chamber this evening after this debate, to enjoy dinner in the plush surroundings of the Members' dining room, there will be people not so very far away who at this time have not, and have no hope of getting, sufficient food to even exist at the most basic level.  Those of us who have visited Ethiopia, those of us who have talked with relief workers and those of us who have seen on television the gaunt faces of mothers with eyes bereft of hope and the pitiful figures of babies and children with swollen bellies, cannot but be moved to pity and impelled to action.</P>
    <P>I will finish with a quotation from a 19th century work, &ldquo;The Present Crisis&rdquo; by James Russell Lowell:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once to every man and nation comes a moment to decide,</P>
    <P>In the strife of Truth with Falsehood for the Good or Evil side.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let there be no equivocation on the part of Ireland in this most sad, tragic and imminent matter, I ask that the motion be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the <Col N="1280" /> House too long in seconding this motion. It is a motion that should come before this House.  I do not think anybody who has any concern for people could not but be concerned about the situation not alone in Ethiopia but in Sudan and various other places on the African Continent.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we must look at the history of these countries.  There is not a country on that Continent which was not the victim of colonialism and whether that colonialism came from Belgium, Britain, Holland or Germany, it has to be said that there is not one single country in that Continent which has not suffered under colonial expansionist regimes.  We in this country can talk about the problems of that Continent.  We can ask for solutions to be found because we have never been involved in colonising.  Some people might say we did a certain colonising by virtue of the fact that a number of our priests went out there and tried to change certain people in Africa from their original concept of one God of religion to our God of religion.  Unfortunately some of them failed but some of them did a marvellous job.  The problems facing the people of Ethiopia are not problems that we can resolve by debating them here but we can at least show that we are cognisant of the fact that there is a country which is torn by civil strife and civil war and because of that there are people starving.  Some people might say we should send aid in terms of money or grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the solution to the problem is not as simple as that because when the rains come and when the potential for enormous growth in the area is realised the only cash crop that small farmers have is grain which they sell.  If the country is flooded with grain these people have no cash crop and no way of existing even in good times.  Gorta over the years have had the right attitude towards development in the sub-Sahel in the Ethiopian area.  They provide funds for the people of the area to produce food for themselves.  I would ask people who are sending aid to Ethiopia or to the <Col N="1281" /> African Continent, to think twice before sending products which farmers in the area produce as a cash crop.  Famine can be created if there is too much food coming in from outside so that the indigenous farmers have no cash crop to rely on.</P>
    <P>I would agree totally with the sentiments that have been expressed by Senator Lydon about the civil war and the effects the civil war is having on that area.  The civil war would never have occurred if it were not for the colonial aspirations of the French and the British. We have to go back as far as that to get to the basis of the Eritrean and the Ethiopian problem.</P>
    <P>Whether Russian MIGs or American SAMs are being used does not make any difference.  They are killing people and that is not what we want.  The percentage of GNP, mentioned by Senator Lydon, that is spent on war is unbelievable but it is no greater than the percentage of GNP spent by other countries within the area which do not have famine conditions.</P>
    <P>Haile Selassie's family have been mentioned. I must say that I do not want to go into the amount of money that Haile Selassie's family have milked out of that whole area, not alone Ethiopia.  He was a member of a family which milked the people of the Sudan and the people of Ethiopia for many, many years.  We must consider how we are going to protect the existence of Ethiopia and Sudan.  There is a Bill going through the Dáil at present which will come before the Seanad very shortly, the Forestry Bill.  I was looking at the Brazilian situation where 17,000 square miles per year of Equatorial trees in the South American area are being knocked down and because of that a quarter of the world's oxygen is being lost every year.  Africa has been totally denuded of trees.  Ethiopia was denuded of trees by the colonial powers who went into it.  Originally the people who lived in Ethiopia had a system of farming which was based on cut and burn.  They cut the tops off the bushes and they burnt the rest.  When the waters came, because the roots were left there you had growth and once you had growth you could expect to <Col N="1282" /> have the production of whatever commodity was left.  The colonialists went in. They were European and they decided on a deep farming system.  They cut out the roots and suddenly Ethiopia, like many other places was denuded of the roots, was denuded of bushes, was denuded of trees.  You then had the advent of the famines we see today.  The Sahel area is extending at the rate of 25 miles every six months.  That means that desertification is extending at that rate every six months.  Why?  Because the colonialists denuded the area of the roots which would have held the water.</P>
    <P>There is no way that Ireland can solve the problems of Ethiopia but, having said that, there are a number of organistions, such as Concern, who have to be thanked by the people of the area and also thanked by our own people for their very positive response to famine and other problems in Ethiopia.  There is Gorta which has, with Government subvention, a &ldquo;grow&rdquo; policy.  They give money only to projects which will provide growth in a certain area.  I must say I never thought much of John O'Shea as a journalist.  He was a gossipy journalist.  He would ring you up on a Friday night and ask what the Kilkenny team was going to do on a Saturday and they would not be playing until the Sunday.  John O'Shea and his committee of GOAL have done a tremendous amount of work.  John O'Shea deserves the thanks not only of the Irish people for what he has done on an individual basis, he deserves the thanks of those who have survived the catastrophes of the past ten or 15 years of famine.  As I said, I have no great respect for John O'Shea as a journalist. John O'Shea as a man is somebody who should be in this House fighting the cause of the deprived of the world.  He is somebody for whom I have an enormous respect.  What can we do within the EC?</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Russian MIG fighters.  Mention has been made of foreign involvement.  The Cubans have been mentioned.  There is a delegation from Cuba here in Ireland at present.  I have the greatest respect for what the Cubans did to make certain that they <Col N="1283" /> became an independent island and an independent entity, but they have become involved in the foreign policies or the internal politics of other countries. I am a member of a Cuban friendship group but I always said to them: &ldquo;Stay at home.  Solve your own problems.  Do not get involved with other people's problems&rdquo;. Unfortunately, that is a message Washington has not learned, Cuba has not learned, Moscow has not learned. We in this country perhaps can solve the problems we have.  Having listened to last night's &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme I think there is a prospect of our Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leaders in the North coming together which will not resolve our political problems but at least may prevent unnecessary deaths.  This motion has not been put down as a contentious motion.  It is not a motion that is going to carry any weight unfortunately.  The motion was put down to ask the Government to ensure that the great work that is being done by them will be carried on. Within the EC we have a major voice in non aligned countries.  We are one of the few countries within the EC that has not got a colonial background.  Therefore, we can go into conflicts which other EC countries cannot go into and we can be the honest brokers.  There is no such thing as brokering, unfortunately, within a conflict such as exists in Ethiopia but we can ask, as the motion says, that the transfer of foods to starving people should not be stopped irrespective of the conflicts on a political and military basis within that country.</P>
    <P>People think Africa is a country in which people are dirty, that they have not the same standards of hygiene as we have.  Anybody who has seen the dust from the Sahara in the past couple of weeks will understand the difficulties that are faced daily by people who have to live in that environment.  We got the end of a Saharan storm.  People in the Sahara, The Sahel and the sub-Sahel live through that every day of their lives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey to the relevant people our concern that political <Col N="1284" /> implications, political desires, political aspirations should not inhibit the transfer of food to people who are dying of starvation. I ask the House to agree to this motion and I am delighted that the motion was put down.  It is one that I could get very emotional about, but there is no point in getting emotional as people are dying of starvation not because there is not enough food around but because there is not the political will to distribute the food that is around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this important motion. As the previous speaker has said, the placing of this motion on the Order Paper will not, on its own, make any major difference to the situation in the unhappy country that Ethiopia is.  It will help to raise public awareness, within this country and hopefully within the European Community through the presence there of our Government, of the present difficulties being faced by the people of Ethiopia and of the future difficulties which we see as almost certain to happen if the situation in that country continues as it is at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon, in a most eloquent speech, gave us a very detailed account of the unhappy history of that community and also of the perilous future which it seems to face.  He spoke rightly of the responsibility that not only we and the European Community in general have for it but also USSR.  The Government in Ethiopia are in a sense nothing much more than a puppet regime of the Soviet Union.  We are told, of course, that there is a socialist regime in Ethiopia but that, in fairness, is an insult to the word &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that I would be the last person to defend any sort of socialist policies but the policies being carried out by the Government of Ethiopia are neither democratic nor socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lydon spoke of the total lack of human rights and respect for human rights within that country and he is, of course, totally right.  The result of that lack of respect for human rights is the continual strife which has taken place <Col N="1285" /> within that country for the past number of years and in particular the internal civil war in the provinces of Eritrea, Tigre and Wollo.  If things continue as they have been going in Ethiopia, it will have to be classed as a country of self-destruction and that, indeed, is a great pity.  There was a well-known phrase which people used to describe the situation in Cambodia when they referred to &ldquo;The Killing Fields&rdquo; which was the title of a famous film based on events in that country. When you speak of Ethiopia you could refer to it as &ldquo;The Dying Fields&rdquo; because of its history of famine.</P>
    <P>I suppose our main emphasis here tonight must be to ensure that the dreadful famine of the past number of years in that country, in particular the 1984-85 famine, will never again be repeated.  At present it would appear that there are up to seven million people being threatened by famine.  Over half of these people are living in the Northern Provinces of the country, the provinces of Eritrea, Tigre and Wollo, the provinces hit most severely by the internal strife and civil war within the country.  The liberation movement within these provinces would be considered by the Government of Ethiopia to be fully responsible for this internal strife and the Ethiopian Government would say that the responsibility rests with the liberation movements in those countries to come to an immediate cease fire to allow for a peaceful solution to the problems.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure that if we were in a position to discuss the scenario with people from those liberation movements they, of course, would paint a very different picture.  Unfortunately, it would appear that there are no short term solutions to the civil war within the country and, arising from that, there is now a grave difficulty being faced in regard to the transportation of the food aid which is so badly needed within the country.</P>
    <P>The rebel forces, I believe, have agreed to a cease fire in order to allow food transportation to take place and indeed it is the Government forces there who have not been able to agree to that cease fire.  It is most regrettable that a <Col N="1286" /> cease fire cannot be reached even for a limited period to allow for food transportation. That, as is stated in the motion, must be one of the primary concerns of the European Community when it is trying to ensure a solution to the problem.  There is, I believe, the promise of enough food for the country.  The difficulty is the transportation of that food. It is a pity, when the necessary foodstuffs are available, that we are not in a position to transport that food to the people who need to so badly.  As a result of the strife within the country and as a result of the Ethiopian Government's very shortsighted response to the problem as a result of their fear of outside and foreign interference within the country, they have imposed a ban on all foreign relief workers within the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the outstanding work being done by the GOAL organisation in that country and indeed in many other famine hit countries.  Indeed, there are many other organisations like GOAL who are having n impact in Ethiopia and who are responsible for the saving of many tens of thousands of lives due to their tremendous utilisation of their meagre resources.  It is, therefore, very tragic that the Government of Ethiopia is placing a ban on all these foreign relief workers.  Our Government and the European Community should be calling on the Ethiopian Government to lift this ban immediately and to allow these foreign relief workers to continue the great work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Many of the relief workers within the country are risking their own lives by continuing to remain in the country to work for the people.  They are giving a very commendable service and we should be fully supportive of them.  The ban imposed by the Ethiopian Government applies only to foreign relief workers.  It does not apply to local relief workers nor does it apply to teachers, who would be working on long term projects.  That is something which we welcome but the only solution is a complete lifting of the ban on the foreign relief workers.</P>
    <P>The motion is very much tied up with <Col N="1287" /> the impact which the European Community should be having on the situation on Ethiopia.  When you think back to the last famine in Ethiopia, the major famine that came to our notice in 1984 and 1985, we would have to submit that the European Community was slow in reacting to it.  I am sure that all the countries within the European Community acted on their own, and in a very laudable fashion, to it, none more so than this country.  But the overall response of the European Community as a central body was indeed quite poor.  It must be hoped that a response from the European Community to the present situation in Ethiopia will be more forthcoming and will be more effective.</P>
    <P>At present the European Community is distributing food aid through the local agencies and, as I mentioned earlier, these agencies at present are not banned by the Government and this food aid is getting through.  It is unfortunately not getting through as well as it should be due to the transportation difficulties within the country caused by the internal strife and the civil war.  As of now, I believe, many roads in the country are closed and this is causing dreadful difficulties for those people who are involved in the transportation of the food aid.  The areas which are most troubled had, up to a few weeks ago, according to the information I have at present, small stocks of food aid but obviously on a daily basis those stocks are getting smaller and smaller.  It would appear that as of now they are almost totally extinguished.  So those parts of the country without any stocks of food, without any chance of transport access to them, are facing a very frightening future.  Unless the transport situation within the country can be sorted out in the immediate future then we are back again to the spectre of huge numbers of men, women and children dying.  It will blaze across our television screens but unfortunately we will be too late in reacting at that stage.  The European Community has asked for those roads to be re-opened immediately.  I am not sure how much pressure can be exerted by the <Col N="1288" /> European Community but I hope that the maximum possible will be applied.  I also feel that the Soviet Union, who are very good at getting involved in the affairs of countries such as Ethiopia, will do their moral duty in this situation and will insist on the Government of Ethiopia immediately re-opening all these roads and allowing the starving people in the more threatened provinces access to the food which is available.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the difficulties that many countries, such as Ethiopia, are facing at present as a result of outside interference and influence, whether it be from the USSR, the USA, Cuba or other countries.  I would agree with him that the impact these countries are having on the countries of Asia, and, indeed, Central America, are certainly not to the good of these countries. Indeed, they are very detrimental to the cause of these countries and their peoples.  It is tragic that as a result of outside interference in countries such as Ethiopia, you end up with a government within that country who are unable and unwilling to react speedily to problems within their own territories and as a result can cause tens of thousands of their own people to lose their lives.</P>
    <P>It is a tragic situation that powers that consider themselves to be world powers can act so irresponsibly and we, as a small country, have a duty to call on these super-powers, and to ensure that the European Community will call on them, to use all the resources available to them to ensure that famine difficulties and indeed other difficulties in countries such as Ethiopia are ironed out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When you think back to the famine of 1984 and 1985 in Ethiopia, you will recall that at the time there was a difficulty of making sufficient food stocks available to the people when they were required.  The tragic situation being faced in Ethiopia at present is that the food stocks are readily available but cannot be transported.  As the motion states, it is of vital importance as of now to ensure that all obstacles to food transportation are removed and that the civil war within the country, which <Col N="1289" /> is causing such dreadful difficulties, be addressed by the powers within the country and be solved.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we, in this House, are sufficiently aware of the internal situation in Ethiopia to pass judgment on either side.  At a time when the rebel movement, if you wish to call it that, is willing to allow a limited ceasefire to ensure that food transportation is possible, the Ethiopian Government have a duty to reciprocate that arrangment.  I hope this motion, limited as its effects may be, will in some way help to highlight the situation within this country and within the European Community.  Like the two previous speakers, I appeal to the Government to use their maximum influence at European level to ensure that there is a European response to the problems of this troubled country and that the people of Ethiopia will face a better future than the despondency and despair they have been used to for far too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I commend Senator Lydon for his initiative in placing this motion before us.  As Senator Lanigan correctly said, perhaps in our contributions we may not be able to do anything practical to alleviate the problems and suffering of the people of the Sub-Saharan district, but at least we will be voicing our concern in the national Legislature.</P>
      <P>I would like to approach the problem a little bit differently from the other speakers who have been talking about acting in concert with our colleagues in the EC.  We in Ireland have had for some considerable time the high moral ground in relation to Third World aid.  We are not and never have been a colonial power.  We have a history which is similar to that of many of the countries in Africa that are experiencing famine.  We have a tradition going back over many centuries of sending our sons and daughters abroad to spread the light of the faith and also to give sustenance where such sustenance is needed.  I would like to see Ireland taking a stronger stand on matters that affect the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy, perhaps, to talk in terms of <Col N="1290" /> supplying more and more food aid or technical expertise in these countries. The motion seems to suggest that, if food was getting through regularly and normally, at least it would be helping the suffering people of Ethiopia and other countries.  However, I think the answer lies more in helping the economies of the African Continent to develop a certain degree of self-sufficiency.  Senator Lydon said that 60 per cent of the gross national product of Ethiopia is being spent on arms.  That is not unusual on the African Continent.  If European countries, in particular some of our neighbours like France who have a long tradition of arms selling, were to link such policies to economic self-sufficiency, we might see a beginning of the end of the spiral of poverty which has affected many of these countries in the post-colonial era.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I would see Ireland initiating specific policies and fighting for those policies at EC level. More and more of the produce of African countries could be purchased by the first and the new world&mdash;the first world being Europe &mdash; and in that way these debt ridden African countries who suffer crippling debt burdens as a result of the huge interest rates which are imposed on them by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, could see some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>For example an Irish initiative might be to try to reduce the debt burden or perhaps eliminate it in some countries, particularly where it is seen that those countries could respond positively.  They could be given a clean sheet and they could start to rebuild their economies. They are the long term answers to the problem of Third World poverty.  I do not believe the answers lie in food aid or technical expertise alone.  They are short term measures.  A fundamental policy shift is needed and, as I have said, we have the high moral ground on that. Unfortunately we are &mdash; and I have often said this in another context &mdash; part of a colonial club in Europe and old traditions and habits die hard.  We have shown ourselves to be resolute at international fora <Col N="1291" /> where the interests of Third World countries have come up for discussion and where human rights have been an issue. Ireland has a very proud record in that regard and, in the context of this motion, that is the way we should be going.</P>
    <P>I would also like to support the call from Senator Lydon that the Irish Government should add their voice to the other voices within the EC and outside it who have expressed concern to the Ethiopian Government at the incarceration &mdash; that is the only word one can use &mdash; of members of the former Ethiopian Royal Family of Haile Selassie. I fully accept what Senator Lanigan said about the legacy that Haile Selassie left to his people, a legacy of abject poverty and ignorance.  In no way would I wish, in calling for the release of his family members, to condone his record. He was the longest ever living monarch in our memory.  His sister and two of her offspring were imprisoned eight years ago and they have been languishing in jail in Ethiopia without trial and without any charges brought against them.  They are no threat to the Ethiopian State.  They are apolitical.  They were caught up in the coup that took place at the time and were an unfortunate by-product of that coup.</P>
    <P>I believe on a humanitarian level that, if we in Ireland &mdash; I am one of those who shouted loudly about the human rights and humanitarian aspect of some of our citizens in other jurisdictions &mdash; can justifiably raise their case, how much more justifiable is it to raise the case of people who cannot fend for themselves and have nobody to turn to?  Ireland would not be criticised for taking an initiative on that. I echo Senator Lydon's call that the Irish Government should come out publicly and call for the release or the charging and bringing to trial of the members of the Haile Selassie family.</P>
    <P>I also endorse the call for a ceasefire in Ethiopia.  It is interesting when one looks at the problem in Ethiopia in relation to food transportation to note that the position and conditions in Ethiopia are not unique to the African sub-Continent. A similar situation has <Col N="1292" /> developed in Sudan where Irish relief workers are operating at great threat to their lives and where a civil war is in progress.  Tributes have been paid rightly to the relief workers from this country who are operating in the Third World, specifically John O'Shea and his GOAL team who are doing magnificent work. John and his team are working in several countries, as has been pointed out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps for those of us here at home who think only of the heroism of that fine body of Irish people and of the contribution they are making as if it were just another job and as if we just admired the vocational aspect of it, an incident which happened in Sudan last weekend will bring home to us the serious dangers our Irish relief workers are facing in Africa.  An innocent family who returned to do more good work, to help people less fortunate than themselves, found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, in the Acropole Hotel in Khartoum where a bomb was placed as a result of the internal civil strife in Sudan.  A husband, wife and two small children, an entire family were wiped out. It was all the more ironic that they had travelled to Khartoum to get directions as to where they should go to continue their humantarian work.</P>
    <P>That could have happened to an Irish citizen.  As I said, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  That points out the serious threat to life that is experienced daily by Irish workers operating in the Third World.  In sympathising with and in remembering, as both Senator Lanigan and Senator Bradford have said, the suffering being faced daily by the victims of famine, we should also spare a thought for those who are trying to alleviate their sufferings and who could also be caught up in the internal strife going on in those countries.</P>
    <P>While the position in the Sudan differs from that in Ethiopia, in that the reasons for the civil strife in Sudan are largely religious and the Ethiopian problem is largely political and concerns autonomy and independence, the reality is that in both countries important relief aid and important work is being held up as a <Col N="1293" /> result of militarism.  It is important that we utilise whatever means we have at our disposal to rectify that position.  In the context of the motion, this is an ideal way to highlight our opposition to, rather than just concern about, the continuing civil strife in countries which need to get on with the business of living and of rebuilding and restructuring their economies without the threat of militarism.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the beginning of my contribution, Ireland has a very significant role to play here.  We can never be accused of taking one side or the other. We can never be accused of having a vested interest.  Sadly, many of our European colleagues have not got as clean a sheet.  Motions such as this help the Government to reflect on the very widespread feelings of concern that is felt and to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>I could not sit down without putting on record my disappointment, and I know it is a disappointment shared by the Government, that in the present economic climate the level of overseas development aid cannot be greater.  I hope that this is only a temporary setback in a proud tradition that has been continued by successive Governments in Ireland to give as much of our gross national product as is possible to help those less fortunate than ourselves.  I do not agree with those who have criticised the Government's budgetary allocation in this area.  In the present economic climate the amount given is a fair and honest indication of the genuine commitment the Government have to continuing overseas development aid.  I hope that this is only a minor aberration and that as the economy improves the allocation to overseas development aid will improve.</P>
    <P>Finally, although it may not be worded as such in this motion, what we are really talking about here is respect for human rights.  We are talking about a government having respect for their citizens, for a fundamental basic right to live, to be safe, to have a roof over one's head, to have food in one's stomach and also to have a job.  They are basic rights.  They are basic to living.  This Government and this country can continue to take the high <Col N="1294" /> moral ground and can continue to put forward what is a moral argument.  Those rights must be respected.  When we, working in tandem with our colleagues in the EC, are in a position to contribute money we should do so.  We should say to Governments that are abusing human rights: &ldquo;Thus far do you go and no further; if you continue to allow your people to live in fear and ignorance, famine and pestilence, then we will stop aid.&rdquo;  We will tell them that we are not prepared to give any more aid until they respect the basic human rights enjoyed by the rest of us living in the more affluent and more fortunate parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I heartily endorse all that has been put forward in this motion.  I hope that it will have a beneficial effect and that it will help the Government in their deliberations in relation to the Third World generally but specifically to the African sub-continent. At least we, in this House, will feel that we have justifiably put forward an issue that is reflecting a genuinely held concern by the citizens of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I would like to pay tribute to and congratulate Senator Donal Lydon who brought this matter to our attention.  I would also like to congratulate the many good relief workers who have left the comfort of their homes and families to go out to play their part in trying to alleviate the distress there.  Of course, it is a tradition of this country to be helpful to others.  It is many years ago since John Boyle-O'Reilly wrote: &ldquo;War battered dogs are we, gnawing a naked bone, fighting in every land and crying for every cause but our own.&rdquo;  We have learned to fight our own cause since that quotation was written but we are still fighting the cause of others.  We are appealing now to the Government to take strong action and to do everything in their power to fight that cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is terrible that there is food available but we cannot get it to the countries in need.  Human beings are deliberately stopping the transport of food which <Col N="1295" /> would save lives, desperation and poverty. We are told that the most cruel form of death of all is death from starvation. It is a terrible thing and it is probably not new.  As Burns once wrote &mdash; and I am sure you have read it &mdash;&ldquo;Man's inhumanity to man makes countless millions mourn&rdquo;.  Certainly it is man's inhumanity to man that is the cause of all this great suffering in Ethiopia today.  We should do everything in our power to alleviate that suffering.  We should try to educate people to realise that as they live, so also should other human beings.  If they were taught that, many more people would be happy in this world today.  People are starving to death while there are billions of tonnes of food in cold storage in the western world.  If we could only release that food to those people what a great advantage it would be.  It is terrible to realise that food that is lying there rotting could save so many lives.</P>
    <P>The real problem is war.  As we know from our history books, there is nothing as bad or as severe as civil war and it is a civil war that is causing all this trouble. Pope Pius X once said that nothing can be lost in peace, everything is lost in war. That is as true today as when it was first spoken.  It is difficult to know how to avoid civil war.  All our voices, small as they may be, can help.  Small snowflakes fall and at first one does not take much heed of them because they are very small but eventually they build up into huge snow drifts that can stop the world from moving.  If enough of us keep talking and keep passing on the message, our little efforts will keep the wheels of progress moving, slowly perhaps, but moving and eventually we will break the grip of turmoil and the grip of those people who are in power and who, with the stroke of a pen or with just a kindly word, could alleviate so much of the suffering people are enduring today.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak on this motion without being repetitive.  As has been said by previous speakers, we must all make every effort possible.  I know the Government are doing what they can but perhaps they could do more if they pulled <Col N="1296" /> out all the stops?  Even if that was done, are we powerful enough in this big world? We are like the mainspring in a watch.  It may not be the biggest part but it is a very important part because if it stops, everything stops.  We can contribute to the power of the mainspring and we can continue to make our voice heard.  We can encourage our workers who are in those countries.  They keep us informed about what is happening.  Together we can alleviate that terrible suffering in Ethiopia.  That must be done.  Some way must be devised to ensure that the food that is available can reach those people. We must ensure by some manner or means that transport is allowed through. It is terrifying to see on television pictures of children trying to suck their mothers' milk and the mothers, in many cases, are dying on the roadside.</P>
    <P>The disastrous situation in Ethiopia is created by other human beings.  If it was some misfortune or if it was something that could not be put right you could understand it.  This is something that could be put right if we could only get the goodwill and assistance of people in high places.  We must try to work through diplomatic channels in whatever way possible to let the Government of Ethiopia know that Ireland and the world condemn them for the way they are letting people starve to death.  They are the culprits.  They are doing that deliberately. It is not something they are doing unconsciously; nor is it something that is happening by accident.  They are deliberately ensuring that those people have to suffer in the way they are suffering.</P>
    <P>Our Government are doing, and have done, everything they can.  This year, unfortunately, the Government cannot give as much from the national purse to those people as they have given in the past but that is a very short term process. In a year or two, when we get our finances in order, we will certainly give more money to overseas development aid.  I know the ordinary people of Ireland are supporting GOAL, GORTA and the other organisations more unselfishly than ever before.  They are continuing to give voluntarily.  We must ensure that all that <Col N="1297" /> aid reaches the starving people and that it is not being ripped off somewhere along the way by agents, or other people who are trying to hold it for expenses of one kind or another.  That is part of the transport problem.  We must ensure that the money, the pounds given by old age pensioners and the tenpenny pieces given by children, are not syphoned off by some get-rich-quick merchants who claim expenses of their own.</P>
    <P>We have been told, rightly or wrongly &mdash; if people want to contradict me outside this House they are free to do so &mdash; that only a fraction of the money collected by those organisations finds its way to the people in need.  We are also told that much of the food we send out is taken up by unscrupulous dealers on the far side and is not given out freely but sold.  Those are irregularities we must work on.  Those people are criminals just as the people in their Government are.  We cannot all be out there and be part of the workforce who are giving their time and energy to those people.  All of us at home, as we did in the past, help the missionaries and the relief workers.  We organise functions and we support them in as generous a way as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a school in Ireland &mdash; great credit is due to our teaching profession in that regard &mdash; which does not in some way run functions or collect, as I said, the tenpenny pieces and send them on.  Many people &mdash; shopkeepers, post offices, workers, etc. &mdash; have little glass jars or money boxes in which old age pensioners and many others put money which is sent to the people in need.  That is done voluntarily.  Those people are playing a very important part in the whole conveyer belt system we are keeping moving to alleviate the distress and the hardship the people of Ethiopia are suffering.</P>
    <P>We must always strive to keep up that good work and to continue in our efforts to help those people.  We must not in any way be faint-hearted or weak about it. We must never say we have done enough. We must always say we have still more to do.  Every life saved is very important and every human suffering that can be <Col N="1298" /> avoided should be avoided.  We in the health boards try to alleviate the pain and suffering of our own people here at home. We help disabled people and many others.  We should also do what we can for the people in Ethiopia who need food. No doubt they need medical treatment as well.</P>
    <P>As we know, starvation of the body affects the whole system and because of that medicine is needed.  Many medical men and great people, nuns, missionaries and priests, are going out to those countries and risking their lives and limbs.  We must continue at home to keep collecting money and working to help them.  As I said, like the small snowflakes, every word we speak will help to encourage, promote and push others to continue in this regard.  I know we are pushing a well-oiled machine when we are pushing the Government because we know that they and everyone in this country have always been thinking of the poor and the needy, not alone in Ireland but in the whole world.  We are all doing our bit and we must continue to do so.  We should continue to give the Government every encouragement.  We are behind them. We cannot talk to the people in power but the Government have the diplomatic channels to reach them.  Just as our constituents ask us to speak on their behalf to a Minister, our Ministers can talk on our behalf.  They record what we say here.  We are speaking for all the people of Ireland because everyone is in agreement on this matter.  We are giving the Government all the encouragement and the help we can.  We want them to continue giving aid &mdash; I know they will do so &mdash; which will in some way alleviate the terrible misfortune from which the poor people of Ethiopia are suffering.</P>
