      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to block the bid for Irish Distillers.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to retain the school transport service to Tullaroan national school, County Kilkenny, as operated for the school year 1987-88.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katherine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the several changes in the international patent scene, the need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate how this will affect the workings of the Patents Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross, Hogan and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. <Col N="2562" /> Senators Hogan and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On what I believe is the last day of this present session, I must record my disappointment at the Government side's refusal to debate their own motion No. 3.  I notice with some amusement that it has become almost a top of the pops.  However maybe there is a bright side to this.  Can the Leader of the House inform us &mdash; most of us are in the dark about it &mdash; what precisely is the significant and beneficial progress which is expected in the North, to which the Taoiseach has referred in Australia?  Perhaps Senator Lanigan knows this but I certainly do not know it.  Is this another piece of cynical arm-chancing which passes for Fianna Fáil Northern policy?</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Murphy has said with regard to the disappointment experienced by all sections of the House that Item No. 3, despite the <Col N="2563" /> undertakings given by the Leader of the House, will not be given time today.  This is a most important matter.  I regret that the Seanad has been deprived of this opportunity to discuss something that has been on the Order Paper for many weeks and about which continuous commitments were given.  I would also like to ask the Leader of the House to note that on the Order Paper Item No. 46 has once again materialised.  That is a very important item which deals with attempts to amend planning legislation.  It appears, unfortunately, that we may not have time to discuss this or a similar item before the close of this parliamentary session but I would ask the Leader of the House respectfully to consider giving time to this and implementing it in some way.  I would remind him that this is the content of a letter by his Leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and that over the coming months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the reticence of the Leader of the House and the Government in talking about the summer recess.  The first I heard about us going into summer recess was from Senator Murphy just now and I hope it is not true, but maybe it is.  None of us has been officially informed that we are supposed to go into recess this evening. Maybe the Leader of the House, when replying, would first of all tell us if it is true that we intend to go into recess for the summer this evening.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I support what Senator Murphy said about Item No. 3, I am absolutely sick and tired of going through the motions of bringing it up time and time again.  I would be quite happy if we sat an extra day or two days next week to discuss this matter if there is a problem about time and if we are going into recess.</P>
      <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business, that we take Item No. 3 today as the final item on the Order of Business.  I do not know what time the Leader of the House expects that we will finish but I do not mind what time we finish.  If he gives us an assurance that we will discuss this matter next week, tomorrow, or at some time in the very near future, I will withdraw the amendment but if he does not, I will press it.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this Bill is to give legal backing to <Col N="2568" /> the recommendations of the Task Force on Multi-Storey Buildings that the owners of certain multi-storey buildings, of five or more storeys, should have them appraised by a competent person, to establish their resistance to structural damage in the event of a direct accident to the building.</P>
      <P>I might briefly remind Senators of the background to the Bill.  You will recall the gas explosions in multi-storey buildings last year, including the tragedy in Raglan House.  The engineering firm, Cremer and Warner, were asked to report on the explosions.  Following receipt of the report the Government established a task force to consider if there were problems related to potentially vulnerable buildings and to make recommendations for action.  The task force's report has been published and copies have been presented to both Houses.</P>
      <P>The report included a number of recommendations dealing with both structural and gas safety.  Appropriate action on implementing these recommendations is being undertaken by my Department and by the Department of Energy.  One of the central findings in the report was that there was no cause for general concern about the stock of multi-storey buildings in relation to vulnerability to disproportionate collapse &mdash; that is collapse which would be out of proportion to the magnitude of the accident caused to the building.  That central finding is most re-assuring.</P>
      <P>The report identified certain forms of construction of multi-storey buildings and considered it prudent that the owners of such buildings should have them appraised to determine their robustness. It gave guidelines on how this appraisal might be carried out and, if the robustness of any particular building is in doubt, it recommended actions that should be taken to minimise the risk of accidental damage to that building.  In making this recommendation the task force recognised that structural upgrading of an existing building is seldom economically viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular buildings identified in <Col N="2569" /> the report as needing appraisal are those of five stories or more that are constructed using precast concrete floors together with either precast concrete frames, or precast concrete panels, or masonry walls.</P>
    <P>The Government considered that statutory requirements to appraise these buildings and to take any necessary action were needed to reassure both the users of such buildings and the public in general. The Bill now before the House and which has been passed by the Dáil reflects a response to that need.  It requires the owners of all buildings of five or more storeys, which were built since 1950, to have their buildings appraised by a competent person and to submit certificates of appraisal to the local authority.  It is highly unlikely, according to technical advice, that any of the buildings in question was built before 1960 but in order to be certain of including all buildings of concern it was felt that a 1950 datum would provide an adequate margin of safety.</P>
    <P>Much engineering evidence points to five storey buildings as requiring technical consideration of a different order from that for buildings of four storeys or less.  The task force in recommending the apprisal of buildings of five storey and upwards reflected that evidence, as does the Bill.  Committee Stage is the appropriate place to discuss these points in detail and, if necessary, they can be teased out there.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill requires each local authority to prepare and maintain a register of all buildings of five storeys or more constructed since 1950 in its area.  The local authority will notify the owner of each building, in these categories, completed before the legislation comes into effect of the need to submit a certificate relating to the structural appraisal of the building.  Provision is made in section 4, to which I will refer later, for the certification of multi-storey buildings completed after the legislation comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the certificates which must be submitted by owners.  Provision is made to enable a person who <Col N="2570" /> has been served with a notice by a local authority, but is not an owner, to make a declaration to that effect.  He will not then have to submit a certificate.  The form of the certificates will be prescribed by regulations to be made by me following the enactment of the legislation and different certificates can be provided depending on the circumstances of the building.</P>
    <P>Every building of five storeys or more built since 1950 must have a certificate submitted for it.  If the building is not one of the construction forms identified by the task force as requiring appraisal, the certificate will confirm that fact and nothing further will be required with regard to that building.  In other cases the Bill provides that if the building is constructed in accordance with the codes of practice and standards that take account of disproportionate collapse, or if its level of robustness is comparable with that of those buildings, then this will be written on the certificate and no further action will be required in these cases.</P>
    <P>If a building's robustness is in doubt it may be out of the question on cost grounds, even if it is technically possible, to structurally enhance that building. This was recognised by the task force and, as an alternative, they recommended a list of actions to be taken, in so far as they are reasonable in any particular case, to minimise the risk of accidental damage to such a building and thereby enhance its safety.  There is a list of actions in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  Section 3 (2) (c) provides for certificates in these cases.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Third Schedule, there may be some confusion about the question of banning the use or storage of gas cylinders and I want to make it clear that this Bill does not impose a ban.  What it does is make provision, where a building is not adequately robust, for a ban on cylinders if, in the opinion of the competent person, the robustness of the building requires it.  This is only one of a series of actions that might have to be taken and a list of such actions is in the <Col N="2571" /> Third Schedule to the Bill.  Of course, which, if any, of these actions would be taken in any particular case where a building is not adequately robust would be a matter for the owner and his adviser. All certificates must be signed by a competent person who is defined in section 1 of the Bill as a chartered engineer with experience related to either structures or gas depending on what is being appraised and the actions being taken.</P>
    <P>In the case of a multi-storey building completed after the commencement of the Act the owner will be required, without notification from the local authority, to submit the necessary certificate before the building or any part of it can be occupied; this is provided for in section 4. The need for a certificate where a local authority own a multi-storey building in their own area is dealt with in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that where action has been taken to minimise the risk of accidental damage to a building, such action cannot be changed or reversed without a new certificate being submitted to the local authority.  It will be a serious offence to breach this provision with a maximum penalty of a fine of £10,000 and/or three years in prison.  This provision will provide protection for users of such buildings and the general public while, at the same time, giving a degree of flexibility to an owner who may wish, because of altered circumstances, to make changes.  Provision for rights of entry of an owner and his agent in the cases of multi-owner or multi-occupancy buildings after due notice is catered for in section 7.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections cover the usual legislative provisions for interpretation, service of notices, power to require information from occupiers of a building as to the owner, the making of regulations, offences and penalties.  In view of the possible implications, it is proposed to make certain offences, including the giving of an untrue certificate, indictable offences if done knowingly, with maximum penalties of a £10,000 fine or a jail sentence of up to three years, or <Col N="2572" /> both.  Other offences are subject to a maximum penalty of £1,000.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil the question was raised as to whether the particular paper in which a section 8(4) notice is to be published should be confined to national or provincial papers, the view put to me being that, as worded, the subsection could give rise to abuses similar to those allegedly committed in relation to planning notices, by publication in a newspaper that is not widely in circulation.  I have considered this matter carefully.</P>
    <P>Here I must point out that the notice under this Bill is fundamentally different from that under planning legislation. First and foremost it is to be inserted by the local authority in an effort to locate an owner and this places it in an entirely different category from that of an applicant for planning permission; secondly, the notice will be used only if an owner of a multi-storey building is not known or cannot be located.  This provision is likely to be invoked rarely, if at all.  It would be surprising to find a modern multi-storey building whose owner could not be located relatively easily, and even if his identity was obscure, tenants not knowing to whom they paid their rent would be odd in the extreme.  In all the circumstances I see nothing to be gained by a more detailed specification of &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; and this view is supported by legal advice taken on the question.</P>
    <P>On publication of the task force report my Department placed advertisements in the national papers advising owners of the recommendations in the report and the need for appraisal of certain buildings. Local authorities were also advised and asked to begin work on setting up their registers of multi-storey buildings. The important thing at this stage is to ensure that the buildings in question are appraised and I know that many owners will wish to have this done as rapidly as possible.  In fact, I understand that many buildings have already been appraised.  I will be asking local authorities to notify individual owners as soon as possible of the requirements under the Bill and my Department will be issuing appropriate <Col N="2573" /> guidance documentation to the local authorities in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that implementation of the provisions in this Bill will give a greater level of reassurance to the public about the safety of multi-storey buildings. Therefore I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate natural gas explosion at Raglan House in my area has been a major reason for this Bill which is before the House today.  Since that explosion there have been three major reports; one by Cremer and Warner, one by VEG and one by the task force on multi-storey buildings, with extensive recommendations in relation to gas safety.  The explosion at Raglan House was caused by the ignition of gas which had accumulated in flat 1 of Raglan House.  The evidence clearly points to a gas escape from a fractured gas service main pipe supplying gas to Raglan House.  The gas escaping from the service pipe saturated much of the ground because the clay surface and tarmac areas above prevented venting of the gas to the atmosphere.  The gas accumulated in the voids underneath the building and at some stage it was ignited.  As a result an explosion took place, with the tragic loss of two lives.  I was on the site 15 minutes after the explosion happened.  Looking at the building, it was the fear of everyone present that a number of lives had been lost.  Fortunately, it was a bank holiday weekend and most of the flats were unoccupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cremer and Warner report aimed dozens of recommendations at four organisations most closely involved for one reason or another with the Raglan House explosion.  They were New Dublin Gas, Dublin Corporation, the Government and Holland Lansdowne, the developers of the apartment complex of which Raglan House was part.  I am pleased to note that every multi-storey block of flats which has a gas supply has been examined. When the Minister is replying, he might be good enough to inform the House if the recommendation in relation to the flat complex at Ballsbridge &mdash; that <Col N="2574" /> Holland Lansdowne should either ventilate or fill in the voids under remaining apartment blocks in the flat complex so as to prevent gas accumulating as it did at Raglan House &mdash; has been complied with.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation was that Dublin Corporation should examine the adequacy of their procedure for approving building plans and inspection sites during construction.  The Cremer and Warner report made the comment that Dublin Corporation failed to notice that the building constructed by Holland Lansdowne did not correspond to the details on the application for by-law approval and they agreed that they inspected Raglan House only at the foundation stage and never subsequently.</P>
    <P>The Cremer and Warner report is a good one and is most welcome.  It brings together the many diverse aspects of the explosion and the damage therefrom. The only criticism I would like to make of that report is that it states that the collapse of the building at Raglan House following the first explosion could be likened to the collapse of a house of cards.  To the lay person, this would call to mind a structure that would fall completely as soon as a restraining hand is removed or in the slightest puff of wind. It would cause fears that would be unnecessarily distressing to the residents of multi-storey flat complexes.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to the task force required them to identify multi-storey buildings liable to progressive collapse and to give advice on remedial measures necessary to prevent this occurence.  They considered that disproportionate collapse is a more meaningful term than progressive collapse in the context of the response of multi-storey buildings to accidental damage.  It appears, from the terms of reference of the task force, that they should try to identify each individual multi-storey building which was liable to progressive collapse, in addition to providing guidance on remedial measures. While it was considered at the outset that this would be a large and time-consuming <Col N="2575" /> exercise, the task force felt that they should nevertheless attempt to do it.</P>
    <P>An advertisement was placed in four daily newspapers inviting owners or designers of buildings to complete a questionnaire which was available on request from the secretary of the task force.  The local authority were requested to complete questionnaires in respect of multi-storey buildings within their functional area and the various public sector organisations were asked to complete questionnaires in relation to buildings owned or leased by them.  While local authorities promptly responded with a list of buildings of five storeys or more, they did not generally have the details of individual structures.</P>
    <P>The response from owners and designers was disappointing.  While a number of responses were complete in all aspects, a large proportion were lacking in detail of the structure or the codes to which they were designed and constructed.  The task force was then of the view that they were not in a position to determine the vulnerability to disproportionate collapse of individual buildings.  They found no grounds for general concern in relation to the stock of multi-storey buildings and this comment is very welcome.</P>

      <P>The task force considered it more satisfactory that the owners of multi-storey buildings of five storeys or more have their buildings appraised by a competent person to determine that the buildings are sufficiently robust to resist disproportionate collapse.  The particular buildings identified by the task force as needing appraisal are those of five storeys or more that are constructed using pre-cast concrete floors, together with either pre-cast concrete frames or pre-cast concrete panels or masonry walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House today gives statutory backing to the recommendations of the task force that owners of buildings deemed in need of examination should have to submit a certificate <Col N="2576" /> showing an appraisal and, where necessary, that remedial works have been done.  For this reason, I welcome the measure before the House because a number of management committees of multi-storey buildings have been awaiting this legislation in order to carry out the appraisals as required.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement now on local authorities to keep a register of multi-storey buildings of five storeys or more in their functional area and to notify owners of each such building completed before the legislation comes into effect of the need to submit a certificate relating to structural appraisal of the building.  All certificates must be signed by a competent person and this is defined in the Bill as a chartered engineer with experience relating to either structures or gas, depending on what had been appraised and what action is being taken.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that there are frequent references in the Cremer and Warner report to accidents such as Raglan House, indicating that they believe that a natural gas explosion is not the only way in which a multi-storey building could be so damaged as to collapse. An explosion caused by bottled gas, or even a very heavy impact, could conceivably bring about the same result. One of the management committees of multi-storey buildings in my area rang me yesterday in relation to the legislation and informed me that they were banning bottled gas from their complex until it had been appraised.  The realisation that structural damage can be caused other than by gas explosion places a heavy responsibility on the Government, Dublin Corporation and apartment developers and builders to comply with the recommendations of experts in the construction of buildings.</P>
    <P>I have received &mdash; as I am sure all Members of the House have &mdash; correspondence from the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland in relation to the Bill.  They have taken a very responsible stand in this area and have set up a committee to examine the evidence available and to advise on the <Col N="2577" /> implications of the situation.  They were of the view &mdash; this is the main thrust of their recommendations &mdash; that all buildings are at an unacceptable risk level until the safety of the gas supply is dealt with and brought up to international standards of safety.  We all agree with that.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the Cremer and Warner report being implemented in full. I raised this matter on the Adjournment on Wednesday, 7 March and I will quote from that because it is very relevant.  In the Official Report, at column 2026, the Minister for Energy said:</P>
    <P>Gas safety is a subject which I have been extremely conscious of since taking office and I appointed a technical officer of my Department to closely monitor, on an ongoing basis, the implementation by Dublin Gas of the various recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that overall, excellent progress has been made by Dublin Gas and I am confident that sustained vigilance and commitment will see further improvements.  I would like to pay a particular tribute to the staff of Dublin Gas who responded very positively to the new gas initiatives.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report is now over 95 per cent complete. I want to emphasise that to Senator Doyle.  I recognise his particular constituency interest in this matter in view of the tragedy that took place in his constituency but I want to emphasise to him that in the period since the Cremer and Warner report recommendations were made 95 per cent of them have been implemented.</P>
    <P>There are two reports &mdash; the Cremer and Warner report making recommendations to the Minister for Energy and the task force which is the basis of the Bill before the House making recommendations to the Minister for the Environment.  The task force makes 30 recommendations in all and the association of consulting engineers are not slow in reminding us that 29 of these recommendations relate to gas.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2578" /> The report of the task force on multi-storey buildings which was prepared for the Minister for the Environment contains 30 recommendations directed at Dublin Gas in addition to those which are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  I am delighted to be able to say that Dublin Gas recommendations are almost 50 per cent complete and all of them will be completed within the anticipated three year schedule.  I can also inform the House that the Government have now approved the circulation of the Bill by the Minister for the Environment on multi-storey buildings.</P>
    <P>That question was raised by me and the Bill is now before the House.</P>
    <P>Ninety-five per cent of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report have been fulfilled and up to 2 March 50 per cent of the recommendations of the task force were implemented according to the Minister. I should like to know the present situation in relation to the 30 recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We all share the view of the association of consulting engineers in relation to gas safety but I disagree with them on some other points in their memorandum. They state in paragraph 5 that the proposed legislation will cause unwarranted concern and distress to owners and occupiers of multi-storey buildings, particularly apartment buildings.  It would also result in unwarranted expenditure of money in an ineffective way by the owners of apartments or other multi-storey buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2579" /> I live in an area where there are many multi-storey buildings.  If one were to do an examination one would find that the majority of multi-storey buildings are in the south-east part of the city.  I have had representations from a number of management committees asking when this legislation would come before the House because they were anxious to carry out the appraisal to ensure that buildings are completely safe.  They welcome this legislation as I do.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of a certificate which has to be drafted for a building. The Minister might be able to indicate how individuals in a block of flats which has been appraised and passed can obtain a certificate because it would be advantageous to them.  It would become part of their title and if they sold their flats it would be encouraging to new buyers to see that the flat had been appraised.  I also want to talk about the cost of the appraisal of a flat complex.  Yesterday, I heard of a 30 unit flat complex and the cost of its appraisal was between £3,000 and £4,500, which works out at about £150 per unit.  That is not excessive for having one's house examined and guaranteed free from structural faults.</P>
    <P>When I was a Member of the other House I spoke on Second Stage of the Building Controls Bill which has not yet reached Committee Stage.  I am pleased to note from the task force report that the Minister for the Environment recently put down a motion seeking to restore the Building Controls Bill to the Order Paper.  The only effective conclusion to the measures we are discussing today is that the recommendations of the task force that the Building Controls Bill would be enacted as soon as possible so that the building regulations and an effective buildings control system can be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area to which I could contribute at some length without transgressing the rules of the House on Second Stage.  I have no new insight and I cannot say anything that has <Col N="2580" /> not already been said so I will confine my contribution to a few general remarks.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Doyle I warmly welcome the Bill.  It is very important even though it relates to very few areas.  Senator Doyle stated that there are many multi-storey buildings in his constituency.  In my area I cannot think of any and this would apply to many other Members, too.  The Minister did not give us any idea about numbers, whether we are talking of dozens or hundreds, but it is not a relatively large number anyway.  At the same time it is an important Bill.</P>
      <P>In design, the primary purpose is the functional aspect and then we have the aesthetic aspect.  The functional aspect pertains to the usage of the building, or whatever is being designed, and the aesthetic aspect pertains to the emotional stimulus or the reaction of the beholder. Overriding all this is the safety aspect. Safety is the most important aspect in any design.  I notice, for example, that car doors have sharp corners and in the home tables with sharp corners are a danger to children.  In these cases safety is not given the importance it deserves.  In the design of a domestic building there is an unwritten rule that, for example, every room would have two exits &mdash; the door into the corridor and the window, in case of fire when it would be necessary to make a fast exit.  With regard to domestic buildings, I have noticed recently a few instances where the Department of the Environment inspectors seem to close their eyes to the fact that windows could not be opened to enable people to use them as an escape exit in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are concerned about the safety aspect of apartments.  I am quite sure the people who live in and visit those apartments, as well as the general public, will warmly welcome this Bill.  I am sure representations have been made to the Minister for the Environment over the years to bring this legislation forward. While I welcome the Bill, I have some misgivings with regard to certification.  I have listened carefully to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State replying to debates and I am <Col N="2581" /> convinced by what they have had to say. I will go into this in more detail later.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Doyle, I hope that the Building Control Bill will come before that House soon.  One of my ambitions is that I will be a Member of this House when that Bill comes before us, because since I have come into the Seanad I have looked forward to its introduction.  Since the early seventies we have had draft building regulations, now we have the proposed regulations, and the guidance manual, a very comprehensive book which is very helpful to anybody involved in the design of buildings.  I can see no reason why the Building Control Bill has not become law before this.  I realise it will involve very serious discussions, and expense for the people involved in certification.  To build up a library which would include all the regulations and criteria involved in the proposed building regulations, would be very costly on its own, but at present there is a lacuna in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a great weakness in the planning laws.  While we have fairly comprehensive planning legislation, there is no machinery for overseeing that the works are carried out in accordance with planning applications.  At present, the only method whereby certification for planning permissions executed are provided, is when people sell property and a certificate of compliance has to be provided. Very often there is a difficulty in this area.  This is unacceptable.  Planning legislation should provide a means to ensure that the work has been carried out in compliance with the planning permissions and-or conditions.  For that reason, and from the point of view that it would be a great improvement with regard to buildings and structures, I hope the Building Control Bill will come before this House in the near future.  That Bill would be very comprehensive and would include far more than this Bill.  Section (e) of the proposed building regulations deals with structural strength and stability. With regard to its inclusion of codes and standards, it is far more comprehensive than Schedule I of this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to gas and the problem it created &mdash; I realise that this Bill was <Col N="2582" /> introduced because of the tragedies at Raglan House and other places.  Gas, to some extent, is covered in the building regulations &mdash; section (r) deals with flues, chimneys, fireplaces and hearths.  While this Bill deals strictly with one use of gas, the building control regulations could cover this to a far greater extent.</P>
    <P>I have been involved with structural engineers for a considerable time and I have no doubt our engineers have a degree of competence which cannot be equalled in any other country.  I say this in the knowledge that our engineers have not always got the credit they deserve.  I recall the early sixties when a stand was erected at Croke Park and British consultants were brought in to design it.  At that time I was engaged by the Office of Public Works and discussed this fact with one of the highly qualified engineers there.  I said that perhaps we did not have engineers with the expertise necessary for that kind of design.  He told me that any first year engineering student who had gone to university would have been competent to do that design.  Perhaps he exaggerated somewhat but I have no doubt that Irish engineers would have been competent to do it.  Then, and since, I have felt rather sore that the Gaelic Athletic Association had not employed an Irish engineer to do the design.  Perhaps Irish engineers were employed in the consultancy. I am not sure about that.  What I am saying is we have a very high level of expertise.  From my knowledge of the theory of structures and architecture, that branch of engineering is used to a very limited extent.  In that area I feel we are not dealing with what I could call pure science; but we are certainly dealing with a very exact science.  I would like to go into that area in some detail but I feel this is not the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I would state very broadly that in structural engineering, as in many other branch, we are dealing in a precise science; stresses, wind pressures, soil mechanics, loading etc.  are taken into consideration before the design is completed. In working out the design, safety is a considerable factor.  With regard to the safety factor, if a figure of four is <Col N="2583" /> taken, it is not that four times the amount of steel required is included in a building but that the steel is only stressed to a quarter of its capacity.  In that kind of situation there is a good factor of safety. This applies in general.</P>
    <P>I feel it would not be possible no matter what factor of safety is taken, to plan for a bomb or a gas explosion which is what we are thinking of when we speak of an explosion.  I have seen one situation where, when designing a reinforced concrete jetty, a three-quarter inch steel bar snapped when it was lifted.  Obviously that did not conform to the general standard although I must say that overall any product which is produced under very strict supervision does meet the criteria.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that engineering is not a pure science is that the stresses arrived at for the different materials are determined empirically, that is, through tests and experience.  By and large, these conform to a pattern.  The only item on this earth that does not conform to a pattern is the animal, particularly the human animal.  By and large materials do conform.</P>
    <P>In regard to providing certificates, in my day-to-day work I provide certificates for banks, institutions and individuals quite frequently.  There is always a problem with regard to a certificate.  I can see problems with regard to the kind of certification required under this Bill.  I have no doubt that engineers are competent to provide such certification and I am not sure that they have to be chartered engineers.  I am quite sure any engineer would do so, and I hesitate to say qualified engineer because I have known quite a few men who do not have any formal qualifications and who are very competent in this area.</P>
    <P>These apartments would have been designed by a structural engineer; tests would have been carried out during the construction of the building, including what are called slump tests to determine the consistency of the concrete and cube tests to determine the compressive strength of the concrete.  All these would be recorded and tabulated.  It happens <Col N="2584" /> on occasions that the slump test might indicate that the consistency might not be uniform over a period.  The compression test, which is carried out on a small cube, is done after the concrete is poured for maybe three days &mdash; it may be up to 28 days &mdash; so that even if that turns out to be unacceptable the concrete is already set in position.  Nevertheless the engineer in charge has the recordings and he is able to assess the situation and he is confident that everything is in order.</P>
    <P>With regard to the buildings that may be in question the engineer who designed the building will be available.  Perhaps he will have his notes and records.  I am sure that in that situation there will not be much of a problem.  There may be instances, where the engineer has emigrated, or he may be no longer with us and another engineer will have to provide the certification.  In that situation I would see a problem.</P>
    <P>I would see a problem also with regard to some of the standards and codes of practice which are included in Schedule I because works which were completed, let us say, before 1980 would not necessarily conform to a standard drawn up a year or two later.  A simple example would be where somebody with a single storey house might want to include a second storey.  The question then arises as to whether the foundations are structurally sufficient to carry a second storey. Of course, looking at it logically it would seem that if they are strong enough to carry a second storey they were over-designed in the first instance.  As I have stated previously this is invariably the situation; buildings are over-designed and there is a very high factor of safety.</P>
    <P>In the situation where the original engineer is not available and someone else has to do the work and the original notes and recordings are not available, then a reappraisal has to be carried out. I am not sure that even if it were possible to examine the building in great detail that I would be happy to write out a certificate in some situations.  I could recall many instances of that kind of situation but I do not think it would help the House.  I ask the Minister to accept <Col N="2585" /> that this is a serious problem.  Even if I carry out some investigation or trials on a house or its foundations I can only certify that in the places I examined everything is in order but there may very well be other areas which would not be in order.</P>
    <P>By and large, if a building shows no structural cracks or major structural problems it is clear that it is unlikely that there is anything seriously wrong with it. We are talking here about progressive collapse.  If one prop is taken away or damaged for some reason the building will collapse progressively.</P>
    <P>I recall that the Building Control Bill contains a section which would enable the Minister to make regulations for a relaxation of the controls in certain circumstances. In other words, if everything is not as it should be, obviously the Minister or the Department could come to their own conclusions.  I am not sure if such a provision is contained in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister might advise us if such a provision is contained in the Bill when replying.  That is the position, as I see it, with regard to certification.  There is a difficulty and, as I have said, I was not unmoved by the Minister's reply when that matter was raised.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Doyle, I received representations from the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland.  As I am sure the Minister also received very detailed representations from them there is no point in quoting from those representations to the House.  It is worth stating, however, as is mentioned in Item 10, that the ACEI point out that their members stand to benefit financially from the introduction of the proposed legislation as it would be the members of that association who would in the main carry out the required professional appraisals of buildings.  Therefore, the introduction of the legislation is in their interests and they have made a very good case.</P>
    <P>This is a topic on which it would be possible to speak for a long time.  In regard to the arbitrary height of five storeys, I am aware that it was the task force who made that recommendation.  The <Col N="2586" /> Minister might not tie himself to five storeys and, indeed, in my view three storeys would be more appropriate.  In regard to the date of 1950, again this is an arbitrary date.  The Minister stated that 1960 would probably be a more appropriate date but that ten years period leaves us well on the safe side.  In regard to certification by competent persons it would seem that one would not have to be an engineer to certify that a building stands five storeys or more in height and again this is a matter which I am sure the Minister will deal with when replying.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I warmly welcome the legislation.  Its enactment will help to reassure many people.  They have many problems with regard to the structural aspects of high rise buildings in the UK.  I recall that they use high alumina cement there but we do not have that problem.  In regard to the engineering profession, I am not too sure, for example, if engineers would have details on prestressed and prefabricated members, or if such details would be recorded.  It is possible to reinforce buildings using prestressed members and post tension members and as I have said, it is possible to go into considerable detail on this matter but I do not think this would be of any help to the House or help to improve the legislation.</P>
    <P>I simply want to say that this is important legislation and that many people will be very happy that this legislation is being dealt with and is passing through the House.  I hope the Minister will deal with the questions I have raised when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot give a welcome to this legislation.  I express my sympathy to the Minister of State who I know is a decent and forthright man for I am sure it must be of some embarrassment to him that he is placed in the position of introducing legislation which certainly appears to carry an implication of political or Civil Service camouflage.  I have to say that because it seems quite extraordinary, and I am surprised that my valued and distinguished colleague, Senator Doyle, did not underline this <Col N="2587" /> more, that of the recommendations of the task force no less than 29 out of 30 dealt with the nature of the gas supply, and only one with the nature of the buildings affected.  The response of the Government seems directed principally at this less significant element of the construction of buildings.  This is absolutely to be deplored.</P>
      <P>We hear the engineering profession warmly praised, and rightly praised in my opinion, because we have a very fine tradition in the engineering profession.  It is remarkable in the light of this to note the ease with which those on both sides of the House appear to dismiss the findings of Cumann Innealtóirí na hÉireann, the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland.  Senator Fitzsimons pointed out that it was this body who, in section 10 of their report, indicated that they would benefit financially from the provisions of this Bill but he omitted to give the context in which this statement was made which was, that despite the fact that they stood to benefit financially from this Bill, they still completely dissociated themselves from its provisions and they are the most senior body, technically speaking and professionally speaking, dealing in this area.</P>
      <P>The first item of this press statement as opposed to the final item which Senator Fitzsimons read states that &ldquo;The Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland believes that the proposed legislation regarding multi-storey buildings is ill conceived, inappropriate and not in the best interests of the public&rdquo; and this despite the fact that they stand to benefit financially from it.  There is clearly a crux here and a very interesting one.  It is one I believe that it is the absolute obligation of this House to examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back we will see that this Bill emerged from a tragic occurrence on 1 January 1987 when there was an explosion in a block of flats in Ballsbridge.  I do not intend to rehearse the whole history, although this is gone into in the very extensive report produced by Cremer and Warner which has already been referred to and which consists of <Col N="2588" /> two sections, the main report and the technical appendices, Part B.  There is a subsequent third report which deals with the tragic coincidence that there was a further gas explosion in Dolphin House during the hearing of the inquiry.  This occurred at 3 p.m. on the afternoon of 25 February of that year.</P>
    <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to some highly unusual things and I would like to get an explanation.  I would, of course, have to place on the record that I do not hold the present Minister personally or morally responsible, but I do believe that he is caught in an unsavoury situation.  If I look, for example, at the terms of reference under which Cremer and Warner Limited operated, they give some interesting information in their introductory material. They say:</P>
    <P>On 2nd January 1987 the Minister for Energy appointed Cremer and Warner Limited (CWL) to undertake an independent investigation of the explosion at Raglan House.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that it was the Minister for Energy who called for the report. Why?  The reason seems to be perfectly clear because the principal source of danger lay not in the building but in the nature of gas supply and also the work practices of Dublin Gas.  This was understood right at the beginning.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that the principal reason for concern by the public was this matter of gas supply and that this concern could not possibly be allayed by this Bill, however well intentioned it was. The Minister concluded his remarks by saying he is confident that the provisions of this Bill will bring a greater level of reassurance to the public about the safety of multi-storey buildings.  I do not believe it will reassure the public because the question at issue is not multi-storey buildings, we are not dealing with Ronan Point, we are dealing with a quite different situation.  We are dealing, in particular, with the nature of the gas supply. Until the last few years, as the Minister and the House know, the town gas supply <Col N="2589" /> for the city of Dublin consisted of gas derived from coal, in other words, it was a bituminous gas with bituminous tarry deposits forming on the lining of the walls of the pipes which effectively helped to seal the pipes.  When the changeover was made to natural gas, no provision was made to replace this tarry element that had the effect of sealing the pipes.</P>
    <P>Natural gas not only does not contain this bituminous element but actually operates as a cleaning agent and so the defects in ageing pipes were very clearly exposed and subject to risk and that, I believe, is the reason 29 out of 30 recommendations concern the nature of the gas supply.  It is clearly an inadequate response on the part of the Government to produce legislation that deals with the supposed defects of multi-storey buildings in a re-active situation, dragging up, for example, things like Ronan Point and placing it in the context of a debate where we have heard of the wonderful qualities of Irish engineers.  They themselves state that all buildings are at an unacceptable risk until the level of safety in the gas supply is dealt with and brought up to international standards of safety and when they say &mdash; this is really an important point:</P>
    <P>There is no case in Ireland where a building is known to have suffered disproportionate damage following an accident.  This includes the case of Raglan House.  A building designed to the most modern structural design codes (or indeed certified as required under the proposed legislation) could not be relied on to resist a gas explosion of the severity of the one that occurred in Raglan House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell me, in the light of that comment, precisely why I should be reassured because I live near the top of a five-storey building that has lasted somewhat shakily, I suppose, from the 18th century.  I have gas, to my great grief I may say.  I changed from oil fired central heating to gas central heating and I rue the day, but why should I be reassured when what is stated here by the senior professional technical body with <Col N="2590" /> an interest in this area is to the effect that certifying, examining, scrutinising, providing certificates &mdash; even if they only cost £150 per unit &mdash; would not affect the situation?  A building that was properly, legitimately certified under this legislation would still collapse if affected by a similar explosive force so why should I be reassured?  I do not at all feel reassured and I doubt very much if the Irish public, who are a whit more intelligent than they are sometimes given credit for, will be reassured either.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that we have had a forewarning of this situation.  It occurred also in Clonmel, County Tipperary, where there was a change in the nature of the gas supply and Dublin Gas Company were perfectly well aware, they were advised prior to the accident, of this probable outcome.  They decided on economic grounds not to alter the chemical composition of the gas they were supplying and that is a particular principal scandal that the Minister for Energy, who is the man who commissioned this report, should be dealing with and should be addressing.  Why is it that in response to these reports we have legislation introduced from the Department of the Environment? It looks to me &mdash; and, of course, I am a very naive person and it takes a lot to make me feel cynical &mdash; as if somebody somewhere is trying to shift a nasty little keg of worms out of his or her box and into somebody else's.  That is what I believe.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Cremer and Warner investigation were:</P>
    <P>1.  To investigate and determine the cause of the explosion(s) which occurred on 1st January 1987 at Raglan House, Serpentine Avenue, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>2.  To examine the Dublin Gas Company codes of practice both as to standards and implementation in relation to the investigation of suspected gas leaks.</P>
    <P>3.  To comment on the manner in which these codes were complied with <Col N="2591" /> at relevant times in relation to Raglan House.</P>
    <P>4.  To assess all other relevant issues including features of the design of the building which may have a bearing on the safety of gas usage.</P>
    <P>5.  The report should detail the findings, draw conclusions and make recommendations on how such incidents might be avoided in future, and should be with the Minister for Energy by 23 January 1987.</P>
    <P>Then you get the following rather interesting remark:</P>
    <P>Given these wide terms of reference CWL in agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE), restricted their examination to matters relating to Raglan House, or similar types of multi-storey buildings and occupancy.</P>
    <P>Why?  They were asked to investigate four things and in the fifth section they were given the framework under which their conclusions could be provided and they went instantly for one element in section 4.  Were they given direction to do this?  Was the specific intention to divert from the principal cause to something that I might describe really as more the political effect?  That seems to me to have been happening here in this case and that is why I am so concerned about this.</P>
    <P>The summary of the conclusions of Cremer and Warner gives a history of the building and a history of the explosion that occurred.  There were two explosions, the first caused the collapse of four flats above flat 1, leaving the rear flats mainly intact but poorly supported. There was a subsequent second small explosion about 20 minutes later in the void under flat 2, as a result of the ignition of natural gas and air which had accumulated in the void beneath the ground floor and then just before midday the rear flats of Raglan House collapsed.  The collapse of the building, following the first explosion, can be likened to a collapse of a &ldquo;house of cards&rdquo;, i.e. &lsquo;&rsquo;progressive <Col N="2592" /> collapse&rdquo;.  There was no frame or other system to support the upper part of the building when a particular structural member failed.</P>
    <P>I put this together with what the Association of Consulting Engineers say. A comparison or parallel from this evidence with anything like Ronan Point is inappropriate because of the conclusion reached here, that the gas explosion was of such magnitude that no building could have withstood it so that the progressive collapse was caused not by a design fault, but by the nature und volume of the explosion itself aided and abetted by a very poor level of work practice by the employees of Dublin Gas.  In view of the seriousness with which we must all take the loss of human life, this has got to be placed on the record.  It does not give me any great pleasure to do so, but it must be done.</P>
    <P>Cremer and Warner say they examined absolutely everything.  I am not going to read the list into the record but the Minister and the House will be aware of that. I am sure Senators interested in participating in the debate will have read the very extensive and technical reports on that incident.  Cremer and Warner tested for every possibility and they were drawn, inevitably, to the conclusion that there was very probably a specific problem involved in Raglan House.  In their report they refer to the backfilling of a ditch containing a pipe.  They say:</P>
    <P>The evidence clearly points to a gas escape from a fracture in a 100 mm diameter cast iron service pipe supplying natural gas to Raglan House being the cause.</P>
    <P>One has to ask if this would have occurred to the same magnitude of intensity if the gas used had been the gas used at the time when the supply was laid in the first place, that is coal derived town gas, rather than natural gas.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>This pipe was poorly laid and back filled, with the ground below providing little support to the gas service above. CWL discount the theory that the pipe <Col N="2593" /> failed as a result of movement of heavy vehicles over the pipe after the explosion, as it is inconsistent with the overall evidence.</P>
    <P>The report went into some technical detail which I will omit and then stated:</P>
    <P>There was evidence of a gas escape in the area of Raglan and Clyde Houses for several days before the explosion. On the 24th December 1986 a strong smell of gas was noted by many people outside Raglan House and reported to the Dublin Gas Company.  DGC personnel measured 20 per cent gas in the gravel outside Flat 1 in Raglan House, excavated a small hole outside Flat 1 and drilled holes (commonly known as &lsquo;barholes&rsquo;) in the car park and driveway. This allowed the gas to vent, but the source of the leak was not identified and no check was made for gas inside flat 1.</P>
    <P>On the 28th December, gas was for the first time smelt inside the Raglan House flats.  On the 29th December, First Management, the managing agents for the owners, reported the leak to DGC, who state that there is no record of any call being received.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the attention of Cremer and Warner was directed by the Minister for Energy to certain areas of investigation. I am referring to the practices of the gas company.  The report continues.</P>
    <P>He checked the excavation and barholes made on the 24th December and obtained a reading of 20 per cent of the Lower Explosive Limit.  No checks were made inside Raglan House (where the smell of gas had been detected).</P>
    <P>The conclusion is highly significant:</P>
    <P>At Raglan House, on both visits, DGC personnel did not adhere to DGC standing instructions on the procedures necessary to investigate effectively a reported gas escape.  The actions undertaken were directed more at alleviating the symptoms than identification of the source of the leak.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2594" /> That is a very serious criticism and it has nothing whatever to do with the kind of provisions which the Government consider an appropriate response.  Basically what they are saying is that somebody in Raglan House complained of a smell of gas, that they were concerned about their safety and the Dublin Gas Company sent out somebody with an air freshener.  That does not reassure me and I very much doubt that it would reassure anybody else.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The DGC leak investigation practices carried out leave much to be desired, and are contrary to the written procedures and the training received. Some other practices, e.g. the widespread practice of backfilling temporary repairs, should be discontinued, except in very exceptional circumstances, since it endangers public safety.</P>
    <P>The main issues highlighted by CWL on the Raglan House investigation are: (a) the need to tighten up DGC procedures, practices and management control; and (b) the need to establish effective control over the design of multi-storey buildings to prevent progressive collapse if an accident occurs.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House again to the fact that item No.1 deals with the need to tighten up procedures. Despite the fact that they have been given a clear instruction to keep their noses out of these areas and to deflect public attention onto this chimera about multi-storey buildings, nevertheless, even given these terms of reference, Cremer and Warner return to this notion that there is a serious problem with regard to the Dublin Gas Company procedures and also the nature of the gas supply involved.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the report are that the Dublin Gas Company should:</P>
    <P>Issue revised leak investigation procedures, which were prepared for the Raglan House explosion, and ensure all relevant DGC personnel are trained in their use.  Develop an annual safety <Col N="2595" /> action plan, setting priorities and target dates, with clear management accountability.</P>
    <P>Another five or six recommendations are listed.  The Minister, who is always well briefed, may have the answer to those questions and he may be able to give specific concrete reassurances to the House to amplify the vague umbrella of the reassurance given to Senator Doyle when he, in a very public spirited way, raised this issue on the Adjournment, and was given the bland assurance that 50 per cent of these recommendations were being implemented currently.  I would like to know which 50 per cent, which practices, chapter and verse, in regard to those matters.  We are talking about the safety, the lives and well-being of citizens many of whom in the city of Dublin use the domestic gas supply.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that in Part B &mdash; Technical Appendices, Cremer and Warner return to what seems to have been the direct cause of the specific explosion when they refer to the discovery of an earlier trench, containing very loose backfill material, which intersects the 100 mm (4&rdquo;) service pipe trench at the location of the fracture, and runs east of the intersection towards the now collapsed corner of Raglan House, is particularly significant.</P>
    <P>To continue briefly this line of investigation I should like to state that it is worthy of notice that dealing with the report on the investigation of the explosion at Dolphin House, Rialto, on 25 February 1987 the concluding paragraph of this summary states:</P>
    <P>At Dolphin House, the service pipe-laying was inadequate and contrary to good industrial practice.  A connection was made by a contractor's crew, (but under DGC supervision) with the piping &ldquo;live&rdquo; thereby allowing the gas to escape to the atmosphere and enter the flats.  This was unnecessary, as fittings were available in the DGC stores which permitted the service to be pressure tested and connected to the &ldquo;live&rdquo; main with hardly any escape of <Col N="2596" /> gas to the atmosphere.  This adds further weight to the CWL conclusions and recommendations concerning DGC working practices and supervision; these being detailed in full in the Raglan House Report, Part A.</P>
    <P>I have read quotations from the latter into the record.  I should like to consider in some further detail the briefing documents supplied to Senators by Cumann Innealtóirí na hÉireann, the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland.  I believe that if we accept, as has been said in the House, that they are the professionally competent body, it behoves us to listen to what they have to say. Otherwise there is absoutely no point in their existence.  In their statement they indicate that, as the senior professional body, in the aftermath of the Raglan House explosion they took the very responsible step of instituting two committees, one dealing with the aspect of gas supply and the other considering the implications for structural design of buildings.  It is important to note the order of priority, first dealing with the nature of the gas supply and, secondly, with the buildings.</P>
    <P>The Association of Consulting Engineers say that they are surprised at the continued general lack of appreciation of the significance of the findings of these committees.  A study of the report of the committee of nine engineering experts who considered structural safety of multi-storey buildings clearly shows that all of the aspects of the Raglan House incident that had been and continue to be highlighted as being causes for general concern were either misrepresented or misunderstood.  They wish to assure the general public that there is very little cause for concern with regard to the structural safety of these buildings.  That is very important.  If they are right and there is not a great deal to worry about and even if the most stringent application of this legislation proposed by the Minister were in force, the Raglan House incident still would not be avoided.  It would still have exactly the same results. The Minister recognises in his speech that <Col N="2597" /> the structural upgrading of an existing building is seldom economically viable. What is the point in having examinations which have no practical effect other than requiring an upgrading which the Minister himself regards as economically not viable.  It seems to be quite absurd.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about safety.  I do not want it to be thought that I am not so concerned but I believe that our attention is being deflected from the real source of anxiety which is the gas.  In addition to this there is a real cause for concern by the owners of apartments in these sorts of blocks, a very practical, down to earth, mundane one.  In the light of this kind of diversion of interests from the real source of anxiety, that is the gas, to some kind of inflated notion of the dangers of apartment blocks &mdash; most apartment blocks are at least five storeys high and there is going to be a serious impact on the resale value of these premises. While this legislation does virtually nothing to improve the physical capacity of a building other than keeping a register &mdash; the Minister knows as well as I do that paper and ink will not keep a building standing for very long &mdash; there is very little that is practical in this legislation. People will be worried that the property they live in will be devalued.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of the consulting engineers' statement, which I take very seriously, states that the proposed legislation will cause unwarranted concern and distress to owners and occupiers of multi-storey buildings, particularly apartment buildings.  It says that it will also result in unwarranted expenditure of money in an ineffective way by the owners of apartments and other multi-storey buildings who have not been shown to be responsible in any way for a problem that exists.  These are responsible professional people who stand to benefit by this waste of money.  I would like to salute them because it is remarkably altruistic for a professional body to say: &ldquo;Do not create a situation in which you are throwing money at us and it is not going to have any impact&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The vets in this country have been creaming off millions of pounds in a totally <Col N="2598" /> futile TB eradication scheme.  They have no such conscience in this area.  The engineers, I am glad to say do appear to have.  Property values will probably be seriously affected and many of the specified buildings may not be insurable not because there is reason to consider them structurally inadequate but because they do not comply with the terms of the proposed legislation.  This is another crux that I would like the Minister to deal with in his reply.  He acknowledges with great clarity and honesty, as I would expect from him, that some of the recommendations of the task force cannot be implemented in ordinary commercial terms because they are not economically viable, given the life span of these buildings and given the occupancy, the turnover and the income from them.  The result of this is that the people inside these buildings will not be able to get insurance.  That is a nice little nest egg for some retired couple to face up to. Paragraph 6 states:</P>
    <P>The report of the Government task force and other reports of similar stature have clearly identified the defective gas network as the primary danger and main risk for building collapse.  The arbitrary structural appraisal requirements in the proposed legislation for buildings of a particular height, type and age range as a legally acceptable alternative to ensuring that the gas supply system is safe is fundamentally illogical.</P>
    <P>That is the main burden of what I have been trying to say here this morning.  We are responding to a related series of what could have been really major urban disasters and yet according to the Association of Consulting Engineers in Ireland we are not addressing the problem at all.  They make an irrefutable point when they say that the arbitary requirement regarding structure as a legally acceptable alternative to ensuring that the gas supply system is safe is illogical.  I could perhaps use stronger words than that: I would be tempted, if it was not unparliamentary, to say dishonest, but of <Col N="2599" /> course I could not possibly allow myself this freedom, so I will not say that.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 says that a distinguished committee of experts, a joint committee of engineering institutions, JCEI, comprised of engineers with experience in the design of multi-storey buildings and drawn from the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland examined the evidence relating to building structures in the official report of the Raglan House incident.  This committee concluded that there is no evidence that any general problem exists regarding the structural resistance of buildings to explosion or other accident.  What are we doing with this legislation?  We have heard this morning that the Government side in particular are aching to be off with their buckets and spades.  Why are we staying here discussing this if it does not actually address the problem?  It seems to be a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The report of the JCEI Committee is the most authoritative technical analysis of the problem.  The JCEI provided the Government task force at their request, with specialist advice on multi-storey buildings necessary for the task force to carry out their work.  In other words they are the source of the technical information which we are expected to implement in this Bill, while the people who provided the information disagree with it.  I will come back to that again because it is so fascinating.  These are the people who provide the information and give the authoritative evidence, who specifically and clearly direct the attention of the Government and the public away from the notion that there is a structural design problem and towards the problem of the nature of the gas supply and so on.  They provide the following welcome to the Minister.  They say that the proposed legislation is ill-conceived, inappropriate and not in the best interests of the public.  The Minister blandly states that everybody is going to be reassured and we are all going to welcome the Bill and he commends it to the House.  I am <Col N="2600" /> afraid his blandishments, even in the familiar ancestral accents of Laois-Offaly, will not wash with me.</P>
    <P>In the latest report of the proposed legislation the JCEI have reiterated their finding that the main cause of concern is the gas network and that there is no evidence of a general problem in relation to mutli-storey buildings and accidental damage.  The committee state explicitly that the proposed legislation is inappropriate. Item No. 9 states that there is obviously a need to upgrade the gas supply system to ensure it meets internationally accepted standards of safety. The ACEI welcome the Minister's reassurance in this regard that the upgrading of the gas system is well in hand.  That is the problem and I must say that it causes me very considerable anxiety and concern that there should have been this illogical splitting of responsibilities, this illogical diversion of the attention of the legislators and the general public away from what has been clearly demonstrated to be the principle cause of the difficulty and towards something that bears very little direct or clear scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that far from welcoming this Bill in the light of what I have placed on the record of the House today, I sincerely hope that it will be voted to blazes away out of this House to where it belongs, in the bin, and that the Government will stand reproved in this House today for not having taken seriously the best advice they got and for not having addressed what is the principal problem underlying this whole situation. I will be very interested to find out if there are further and more authoritive views.  I am not clear where they would come from with regard to the question of structural design faults which the Minister has been bewitched into getting involved with, I think very inappropriately in the circumstances.  I hope that I will be in the House to hear the Minister's reply and I would ask him to excuse me for any apparent discourtesy if I am not here because I have been engaged to give a lecture in Cork later today.  I hope to be back to the House before I go away to hear part at least of <Col N="2601" /> what the Minister has got to say and I thank him for his patient endurance in resisting what must have been a strong temptation to interrupt some of the pretty blunt remarks I had to make.  I know that he would be aware that they are not intended personally and that I exculpate him from any blame in this matter but I do think that it is a matter for blame.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for regret that legislation, which in the opinion of so many competent people is inappropriate and dodges and fudges the problem, should have been inflicted upon this particular Minister.  I sincerely hope that there will be a vote on this and I hope that there will be an opportunity to register disapproval for these tactics which are, in football, known as kicking for touch.  This is the clearest example of kicking for touch that I have seen in the 18 months that I have been a Member of this House.</P>

      <P>I will be brief in my contribution.  Senators Doyle, Fitzsimons and Norris have dealt with the issue very extensively and have raised the major points that need to be raised.  I would like to take up Senator Norris' point about the Government Senators heading off with their buckets and spades on holidays.  I can assure him that as soon as we walk out the door here this evening, the real work as public representatives is only beginning.  It is fine for him to go down to Cork and give a lecture there or stroll over to Trinity College and give a lecture there but we will be working extremely hard for the next couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has been brought forward as a result of the tragic explosion at Raglan House on 1 January 1987.  That was indeed a horrific explosion. <Col N="2602" /> However, I should like to congratulate the Government on their swift action in dealing with the problems which became apparent last year.  As a result of that explosion they immediately set about setting up the Task Force on Multi-Storey Buildings.  The swift action by the Minister is very much welcomed.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the Government on bringing forward this legislation in such a short time following the explosion and the difficulties which emerged during the year.  This is a sign that the Government are responsive to the needs of the people and will bring forward legislation as quickly as possible when a problem arises.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in this country for a number of reasons.  We have had no major disasters in relation to multi-storey buildings.  We have known of horrific disasters in other countries but this country has been spared such disasters. As a people we are not inclined to live in high rise buildings; we are more accustomed to living a different sort of lifestyle. This is good.  However, times are changing and no doubt multi-storey buildings will become more popular in the coming years and so the bringing forward of this legislation is welcome to deal with any situation which may arise in the future in relation to multi-storey buildings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that one of the central findings in the report was that there was no cause for general concern about the stock of multi-storey buildings in relation to vulnerability, to disproportionate collapse. We do not have that many high rise buildings but we are dealing with the situation as it is and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The measures which are being introduced here today in the Seanad are welcome and timely.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the whole area of natural gas.  This was dealt with extensively by Senator Norris.  I know that the local authority here in Dublin have switched over to natural gas in relation to a number of their buildings and projects.  Most of their flat complexes are now heated by natural gas.  This was <Col N="2603" /> a recent decision by the local authority and it did cause much concern in a number of flat complexes.  I was involved in discussions in relation to a flat complex out in Coolock &mdash; Cromcastle Court.  The tenants there were extremely concerned about the switch over to natural gas but the local authority dealt with those fears in a very sympathetic and efficient way, organised several meetings and discussions and so forth with all the interested parties.  The system there is working very satisfactorily.  However, we must be always vigilant in relation to natural gas.  Every safety measure which can be introduced should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech that a number of recommendations of the task force have been made in relation to gas safety.  The Minister said that these measures are being implemented slowly but surely by his Department and by the Department of Energy.  I very much welcome this and perhaps later in the debate &mdash; perhaps at the end of the Second Stage or Committee Stage &mdash; the Minister might mention some of the recommendations in relation to gas and how these are being implemented.  I think Senator Norris would appreciate that, too.</P>
    <P>I hope the House does not think that I have taken leave of my senses when I raise the next point, that is, in relation to earthquakes.  Two or three years ago, the east coast did, in fact, experience an earthquake, from Louth down to Wicklow. It was an earthquake which was reported in the headlines in the major newspapers and it registered between three and five on the Richter Scale.  By international standards, it was not a major earthquake but it was certainly something new to this country.  At the time it was said that such earthquakes would occur here perhaps every 50 years. It is to be noted that there is actually a fault in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland which can cause earthquakes, particularly on the east coast, so I am sure that there is no need for alarm in this regard.  It is interesting to note that the tenants living at the top <Col N="2604" /> of these flat complexes in Dublin were quite concerned at the time.  The earthquake occurred at about 8 o'clock one morning.  I remember it very well.  I noted that the coat-hangers in the wardrobe in my room were all rattling and that a press door also started rattling.  Obviously we do not have to worry about another such incident for 50 years.  It is interesting to note that there was no major structural damage to any of our buildings, so obviously they were fairly well built despite the reasonably strong earthquake.  It is good to know that our buildings are fairly secure and are structurally sound.  I am sure the Bill will deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I would also like to raise another point in relation to gas and that is, the whole area of natural infill.  A flat complex in Offington Manor in Sutton was built on natural infil.  This is causing serious problems in that natural gas from the infill is being manufactured and is causing distress to the residents and possible dangers. There is also a housing estate in Ringsend which was built on natural infill and perhaps Senator Doyle would clarify that.  This is something we should keep in mind.  It is a new problem that has emerged particularly in Offington Manor in Sutton.  Perhaps new guidelines are necessary in relation to the building on natural infill, on rubbish and so forth. Perhaps new guidelines should be brought forward to ensure that no dangers are created by the construction of buildings on these waste infill sites.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals mainly with the robustness of buildings.  In Dublin we have a number of flat complexes which come within the terms of the Bill and they are in very poor condition.  I am not suggesting in any way that the robustness of the buildings is open to question, but they are in poor condition.  I would like to congratulate the Department of the Environment on the refurbishment programmes which they are implementing throughout the country to bring buildings up to a suitable standard for people to live in.  I noticed in the newspapers this morning &mdash; and I do not know if the Minister will be able to confirm it or deny it &mdash; that substantial sums of money may <Col N="2605" /> now be made available to Ballymun.  This is to be welcomed.  A task force in Ballymun have come up with a number of recommendations to improve their flat complex.  I am sure the Government will now look seriously at it with a view to incorporating Ballymun in their refurbishment programmes for the future.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation on the refurbishment programme which they are carrying out at Darndale on the north side of Dublin.  I know it may not be relevant to this Bill but, as we are dealing with the flat complexes, I would like to mention at this stage that it is welcomed very much by the tenants.  It is an extremely expensive business because it costs £18,000 to refurbish one house but it is to be welcomed.  I congratulate the Department and I hope that they will continue to develop these refurbishment programmes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the swiftness of the action which the Government have taken to deal with this situation.  I hope that the recommendations of the task force on multi-storey buildings will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>While this Bill is commendable it is too narrow in focus.  It does not go far enough in trying to deal with the problems encountered in the multi-storey buildings which came to our attention principally because of the tragic circumstances of the gas explosion in Raglan House which occurred on 1 January 1987.  It was this explosion which triggered off the fear, worry and the reaction to natural gas.  The Government of the day commissioned a group of renowned international engineers based in the UK, Cremer and Warner Limited, whose credentials in the area of gas handling and gas conveyancing are second to none, to carry out a survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their terms of reference were as follows: to investigate and determine the cause of the explosion which occurred on 1 January 1987; to examine the Dublin Gas codes of practice both as to standards and implementation in relation to the investigation of suspected gas leaks; to <Col N="2606" /> comment on the manner in which those codes were compiled with at relevant times in relation to Raglan House; to assess all other relevant issues including features of the design of the building which may have a bearing on the safety of gas usage and the report to detail the findings, draw conclusions and make recommendations on how such incidents might be avoided in the future.  Given these wide terms of reference, Cremer and Warner, in agreement with the Department of Energy, restricted their examination to matters relating to Raglan House or similar types of multi-storey buildings.</P>
    <P>The main issues highlighted by them on concluding their report were as follows: (1) the need to tighten up Dublin Gas procedures, practices and management control and (2) the need to establish effective control over the design of multi-storey buildings to prevent progressive collapse if an accident did occur.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin Gas it is stated in the report that the Dublin Gas Company management had accepted inferior practices over many years, also that urgent action was required to improve standards of supervision and working practices. Under the heading of multi-storey buildings, the report stated that &ldquo;the design of Raglan House being subject to &lsquo;progressive collapse&rsquo; in the event of accidental damage contributed to loss of life.&rdquo;  It also stated that a number of other apartment blocks may be susceptible to progressive collapse in the event of accidental damage.  It then recommended that the Government set up a task force as a matter of urgency, charged with the duty of identifying all susceptible multi-storey buildings including offices, flats, hotels etc. liable to progressive collapse. The task force was set up and the findings were made known to the Government, most of which are now incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Like all other public representatives I, too, received correspondence from the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland.  I am certainly confused by their approach to this Bill.  I would have thought that they would welcome any <Col N="2607" /> measure which would make any building a safer place to live in, even if that measure went only part of the way to what was required.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a major difference of opinion between what the Association of Consulting Engineers are saying in relation to multi-storey buildings and what is contained in the Cremer and Warner report.  I will quote from a report in the construction industry newspaper, <i>Construction and Property News</i> dated 22 June 1988.  The heading was &ldquo;Multi-storey Building Bill, it's inappropriate &mdash; say Engineers&rdquo;.  The article went on to state:</P>
    <P>The Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland wish to assure the public in general and apartment owners in particular that there is no evidence of a general problem in respect of robustness or stability in multi-storey buildings in this country.</P>
    <P>The Association believes that the proposed legislation ... is ill-conceived, inappropriate and not in the best interest of the public.</P>
    <P>The Cremer and Warner report, section 11.1.2 under the heading of &ldquo;Building Collapse&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>The ignition of natural gas in Flat 1 produced an explosion of unusually high overpressure, which caused the load-bearing walls and floor to be displaced sufficiently for the floor slabs of the first floor to collapse.  The upper storeys of Raglan House then collapsed like a &lsquo;house of cards&rsquo;, i.e. progressive collapse.  There was no frame or other system to support the upper part of the building when the load-bearing walls failed.  There was no continuity between the floor slabs and the load-bearing walls.</P>
    <P>A framed, or similar, construction would have allowed panels to blow outwards and also, probably, prevent floor slabs being dislodged and falling onto occupants.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious section of that report.  Having seen that, the engineers <Col N="2608" /> went on to state again in the same newspaper: <i>Construction and Property News</i> of 22 June 1988 that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;buildings are designed to limit the risk that disproportionate damage will be caused as a result of an accident. There is no case in Ireland where a building is known to have suffered disproportionate damage following an accident.  This includes Raglan House. A building designed to the most modern structural design codes (or indeed certified as required under the proposed legislation) could not be relied upon to resist a gas explosion of the severity of the one that occurred in Raglan House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In my opinion that last statement is hypothetical and certainly should not be associated with the design and construction of Raglan House which again is coded under section 11.3.2 in the Cremer and Warner report which states, under the heading &ldquo;Building Design and Construction &mdash; Raglan House&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>At the time Ballsbridge Court was built (1976), there were no statutory requirements for buildings of five storeys or more to be designed to prevent &ldquo;progressive collapse&rdquo;.  None exists today.  There are only proposed regulations. However, the lessons of Ronan Point in the UK were known, and by 1973, amendments of the relevant British Standard codes of Practice has been made.  The amendments clearly drew attention to the problem of &lsquo;progressive collapse&rsquo;.  The Consulting Engineers to the Developer certified that the structure would be designed in accordance with the most recent editions of the appropriate codes.</P>
    <P>Further, the Institution of Engineers of Ireland (IEI) had published reports on Accidental Damage to Buildings in 1972 and 1974, giving detailed recommendations for design to prevent accidental damage.  These should have been known to practising civil structural engineers and architects.</P>
    <P>CWL conclude that the structural arrangement of Raglan House paid <Col N="2609" /> scant attention, to the state of the art as it should have been known by all chartered structural engineers in 1976. However, CWL would note that Raglan House is no exception, it appears to be one of several buildings of five, or more, storeys which were built in Dublin without regard to the possibility of progressive or disproportionate collapse.  These buildings need to be identified urgently and measures taken to minimise accidents which could cause damage and progressive collapse.</P>
    <P>CWL conclude that the application to construct Raglan House was not fully in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Dublin Corporation.  The Developer and Architects submitted insufficient information to describe the building, and some information was incorrect and apparently misleading. In particular, the specification submitted inferred that there would be a precast frame with reinforced concrete columns, beams and floor units.  In practice no frame was provided.</P>
    <P>After that statement about the construction of Raglan House, once more we have a further conflict of opinion as Item No. 7 of the Association of Engineers of Ireland correspondence states:</P>
    <P>A distinguished committee of experts (The Joint Committee of the Engineering Institutions &mdash; the JCEI) comprised of engineers with expertise in the design of multi-storey buildings and drawn from the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland examined the evidence relating to building structure in the official report on the Raglan House Incident. This committee concluded that there is no evidence that any general problem exists regarding the structural resistance of buildings to explosion or other accidents.</P>
    <P>That section of the chapter has been quoted by Senator Norris but it is very difficult for somebody as a legislator, or <Col N="2610" /> indeed as a lay person, to read what I have just read from the Cremer and Warner report in relation to the inferior design and the reasons for the collapse of Raglan House and then try to correlate it with a guarantee from the Association of Engineers of Ireland stating the direct opposite.  It makes it very difficult for a legislator to decide what is the accurate account.</P>
    <P>One would go on giving conflicting views from different reports and associations but at the end of the day the facts are that an explosion took place in Raglan House on 1 January 1987 and the apartments collapsed like the house of cards, leading to injury and loss of life.  In order to ensure that we will never again have a repeat of such a tragedy I welcome the Bill or any other measure that will give peace of mind to people living or working in high-rise buildings day or night. Section 1 of the Bill specifically states that buildings of five storeys or more and buildings constructed after 1950 are to be included in the Bill.  I ask the Minister, why five storey buildings and why 1950?</P>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks that the Bill was too narrow in focus.  If we stick to the above section we can deal with only a limited number of buildings.  There are many buildings in every city in Ireland which could be described as in bad shape and questions could be asked as to their safety.  There is a need to extend the scope of the Bill.  If issues of public safety are at the heart of this Bill's concern, then we should not set artificial parameters or limits in terms of life or of the height of a building.  Why did the Minister exempt buildings built before 1950?  Had he more confidence in the design teams, construction companies, developers, etc. in the pre-1950 era or had it something to do with the nature of the construction at that time?  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will satisfy my curiosity.</P>
    <P>As we do not have a huge number of multi-storey buildings I would have thought that the Bill would be designed to cover all multi-storey buildings in this country.  In every city there are areas which are known as flatland where very large houses are converted into many <Col N="2611" /> flats.  It would be very difficult to get out of one of these houses in the event of an explosion.  Why are buildings of this nature being excluded from the Bill?  A three-storey building over a basement would be equivalent to a four-storey building and with return to the back could be regarded as being equivalent even to a five-storey building.  Many of these houses would have the possible defects and dangers of any five-storey building. This area should be looked at more closely.</P>
    <P>I agree with section 2 of the Bill which requires each local authority to prepare and maintain a register of all buildings of five storeys or more.  It is very important for someone working or living in or purchasing such a building to know that a certificate has been issued that the building is subject to the procedures and tolerances of normal building practices and constructed in accordance with the appropriate code of practice and standards. In order to achieve this it is important to have a properly maintained register of all multi-storey buildings of five storeys or more.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the requirement to submit further certificates where the building has been altered subsequent to issuing the original certificate.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that provision when replying.  How does he see it operating? In my view it will amount to an enormous workload for local authorities. I agree with the intent, but is it workable? This provision will provide protection for users of such buildings and the general public and, at the same time will provide flexibility for owners who, for different reasons, might want to change the use and function of the buildings.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to the buildings owned by local authorities within their functional area.  There are many buildings in Dublin which would come under these regulations.  The ones that instantly come to mind are the Ballymun flats because they are five storeys or more.  Who will be responsible for checking Dublin Corporation to see that these standards are properly complied with?  There should be <Col N="2612" /> some form of independent checking on local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill but it must be seen as one drawn up as an emergency measure arising out of the tragic events of Raglan House and, as I said, it is much too narrow in focus.  The root cause of that tragedy was the major gas explosion and I am pleased that there have been many improvements in that area in the past two years.  We received a categorical assurance in this House from the Minister for Energy that that was the case.  The report of the Government task force made over 30 recommendations relating to the gas supply system.  There was obviously a need to upgrade that system to meet internationally accepted standards and safety. Again, I welcome the Minister's assurance that the upgrading of the system is well in hand and ahead of schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members of the House who contributed to this debate which was most interesting.  I would like to refer now in detail to some of the matters raised. Senator Doyle raised the matter of the recommendations in relation to gas.  All 29 recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report are now completed.  I must put on record our appreciation of the work of New Dublin Gas.  I would not like anybody to think they are not competent to deal with the situation; they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, also, that the ten short term VEG recommendations on network safety are 90 per cent complete and the remainder are expected to be completed very soon.  The other eight medium and longer term VEG recommendations continue to progress within the required three year time frame.  The 30 task force recommendations which relate to the Dublin Gas network and procedural improvements are now 60 per cent complete. The second survey of the entire 2,600 km network is now completed and a third survey of the network is planned for the second half of 1988.  A survey of <Col N="2613" /> 120,000 services in the network is well in hand for completion by next year.</P>
    <P>Special attention has been given to gas safety in multi-storey buildings, all of which are being surveyed inside and outside, and the necessary repairs to be carried out.  A survey of all apartments has been completed.  Nearly all mains in close proximity to buildings have been surveyed, as well as bridge crossings and main network valve locations.  A second survey of all other public buildings has started a follow-up to the survey undertaken for the task force in mid-1987.  The frequency of all these surveys has exceeded the requirements of the report and Dublin Gas have now established a solid data base on the condition of the network which will be continually improved with time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy assures me he is confident that a proper safety framework is now in place for gas distribution. It must, of course, be remembered that not all of the responsibility for the safe management of natural gas or other fuels rests with the supplier of the fuel.  The consumer has an important role to play by way of ensuring that fuels are used safely and that appliances are properly maintained.  A major responsibility lies with those who are responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of buildings, to ensure that these buildings avoid any risk from the use of natural gas or other fuels.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle mentioned that there were different ways in which an accident might occur in a multi-storey building.  I am glad he has drawn attention to this point.  I am concerned also that this problem should not be seen as one solely related to natural gas.  The Bill has made provision for the different types of accident that may arise and the Third Schedule lists the type of remedial measures that may have to be taken.  Of course, these actions only relate to a building that is not considered sufficiently robust to resist the impact of an accident without disproportionate collapse.  I believe that most buildings will be found, on appraisal, to be well built and adequately robust.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2614" /> Senator Doyle also asked how tenants of an apartment block would be provided with a certificate.  The Bill has taken account of this problem by the way in which the owner of a building is defined. In most of these buildings there will be a management company to look after the area of the building and its surrounds. Each of the occupants is normally a member of the management company and it is intended that the local authorities will serve notice under section 2 of the Bill on the management company.  They will then be responsible to arrange for submission of the necessary certificate.  I am sure Senators will agree this is better than asking each tenant individually to arrange for a submission of a certificate.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised a number of matters. The task force set up by the Government represented a wide range of interests and expertise and their recommendations must be implemented.  The task force found no cause for concern in relation to the stock of multi-storey buildings in general.  They did consider that owners of certain multi-storey buildings would be prudent to have their buildings appraised by a competent person in the context of resistance to accidental damage.  In the interest of public reassurance and of the safety of the public and users alike, the Government consider that it is necessary to ensure that all multi-storey buildings of five or more storeys which were built since 1950 are appraised in the context of resistance to accidental damage.  Hence the reason for the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said that if it is the engineer involved with the design and construction of the building who is employed to do the appraisal, he should have no problem in providing a certificate in this case.  If it is some other engineer, he will have to carry out an appraisal, perhaps opening all floor joists and checking the construction.  An engineer with the experience specified in the Bill will be able to provide the appropriate certificate.  The Bill provides for a number of different types of certificate, giving a number of options to the owner and his engineer.  It will be a matter for <Col N="2615" /> them to decide which certificate to use. If the owner does not want disturbance of the building by opening the joists etc., if this is necessary for a certificate under sections 3 (2) (a) or 3 (2) (b), he can decide instead to go for a certificate under section 3 (2) (c) and carry out whatever actions are necessary, taking account of those in the Third Schedule of the Bill. The problems with appraisal do not arise for these certificates.</P>
    <P>I am confident that our engineers are very competent and capable of looking after all this.  I have complete faith in our Irish engineers.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of responsibility for gas.  There is overall a responsibility on owners, tenants and occupiers to see that all pipes leading into the house or building should be in a safe condition.  Any repairs that may be needed from time to time are the responsibility of all concerned.  Senator Norris said that in this legislation we were kicking to touch.  There is no kicking to touch with me; there never was.  I will give as much information as I possibly can, because this is a serious matter and there is a grave responsibility on all of us to see that these new regulations are seen to work in the best interests of all concerned. That is the reason we have brought this Bill before both Houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Haughey mentioned the problem of gas arising in infill sites.  I am glad to inform the Senator that my Department have already asked local authorities to identify all these and other sites that might pose a threat if built upon.  In so far as control is concerned, I have asked my officials to consider what changes are needed in the proposed building regulations to ensure that gas problems will not arise in any buildings on or near such sites.  I assure the Senator that appropriate changes to the building regulations will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned the remedial works to many estates.  Last year I had £7 million to do this work.  This year I have £10 million and it is our aim, if money is made available, to get around <Col N="2616" /> all of these and see that they are in excellent condition again.  That is the aim of the Minister and myself.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher asked me to explain section 5.  The report of Cremer and Warner on the explosion at Raglan House recommended that the task force investigating multi-storey buildings should initially concentrate on buildings of five or more storeys, and, depending on the findings, consider buildings of four or more storeys.  The task force recommendations for appraisal referred only to the buildings of five storeys or more.  I want to give an explanation of this.  For instance, if a certificate is issued in connection with a building but the gas is disconnected from that building, another certificate has to be issued when the gas is restored to the building.  This is important, it involves competency and efficiency and the occupiers will know that a certificate has been issued complying with all the regulations.  If you get a certificate on the building, it must apply also to the gas that is reconnected.  For instance, if there is a disconnection &mdash; and many may be concerned about this &mdash; another certificate will have to be issued before the gas can be reconnected and the occupants or tenants may be notified of that accordingly.  I want to make that very clear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>All the buildings that have been investigated are in reasonably good condition. When the Bill goes through we will be making the necessary regulations and <Col N="2617" /> they will be issued to all local authorities and corporations.  It will then be a matter for them to ensure that, under the terms of the Bill, all these regulations are carried out and are seen to be carried out.  I must point out and explain this, because there might be a wrong interpretation of Senator Norris's remarks.  I would not like to see anybody not treated kindly; he may not have intended that.  Dublin Gas have co-operated in full.  We expect that co-operation and they have co-operated accordingly, and great credit must go to them and to all the staff involved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is an onus on owners, occupiers, local authorities, all the authorities concerned, and especially the tenants, to obey the regulations because we have seen the consequences in our own homes where gas, even in a single-storey house, was left on.  The rules must be obeyed by all.</P>

The Association of Consulting Engineers made a very reasonable request that the words &ldquo;specified buildings&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;designated buildings&rdquo;.

It would be much clearer if the Bill had the words <Col N="2618" />&ldquo;designated buildings&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing that change on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to certificates, a certificate is granted to the management committee, as the Minister said in his Second Stage speech.

      <P>On Second Stage, I mentioned the independent checking of local authorities.  This is a case where you have an engineer within the local authority <Col N="2619" /> system checking local authority buildings. Would it not be more advisable to have independent outside engineers checking local authority properties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with multi-storey buildings which are owned by a local authority situated in their own functional area, and clarifies that a certificate will have to be obtained in the same way for multi-storey buildings in general.  If a local authority own a multi-storey building situated in some other local authority's functional area, they will be treated in the same way as any other owner.</P>
      <P>This section is included because the requirement to have a certificate prepared under section 3 only arises when the owner receives a notification under section 2.  It makes no sense to require a local authority to notify themselves of their requirements, and section 6 in effect imposes the duty of obtaining a certificate without a notice being served in any case where the local authority own a building in their functional area.</P>
      <P>Another question may be asked: will a local authority be treated differently from any other owner?  I think that is what the Senator would like to know. Under the Bill, the local authority will be treated in exactly the same way as every other owner with the single exception that they will not have notified themselves that a certificate is required.  That would be unnecessary.  The local authorities will have to get certificates signed by a competent person, as indicated in the legislation, for any of the specified buildings they own in their own functional areas, just like any other owner. That explains the position.  They must get a certificate from a competent person.</P>

      <P>This section sets out the works that have to be carried out.  On Second Stage I asked the Minister about the flat complex at Ballsbridge and whether the vents had been closed off or if ventilators had been installed in the flat complex at Ballsbridge since then since this is one of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very important because there can be defects in buildings which allow gas to accumulate and it is very important when buildings are being appraised that such defects are discovered. If the flat complex at Raglan Road had not that defect, the gas might not have been able to seep in.  Equally, if there had been ventilation the gas would have been able to get out.  There is a real purpose in having the Bill, even though this has been questioned this morning by another Senator.  I see a real importance in having a Bill that will examine the structure of buildings.  The Minister might be good enough to answer my question about Raglan House.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 192:</P>
    <P>In page 108, before section 129, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;129.&mdash;(1)  If any person while a director or other officer or a member of a committee of management or trustee of any company acts in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person knowing that such other person is disqualified or that, in giving the directions or instruction, he is acting in contravention of any provision of this Part he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) he shall be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order from date of such conviction if he was not, or was not deemed to be, subject to such an order on that date.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment it <Col N="2622" /> to make three changes to section 129, and again, rather than making the changes piecemeal we propose to replace the section altogether by a completely new one.</P>
      <P>The first change is a practical one.  We would propose to omit any reference at all in the section to receivers and liquidators since it is hard to see how either of these two officers could be acting under the directions or instructions of a disqualified person.  Receivers and liquidators are very much their own people, as it were, and do not normally take directions or instructions from outsiders.</P>
      <P>The second change would be to substitute &ldquo;or&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the present text at page 108 line 37.  The intention here is to include within the scope of the section a person who acts under the instructions of another person knowing that the other person is a person to whom section 117, which we dealt with yesterday, applies. The simple reference in the present text will disqualify a person who does not achieve this.</P>
      <P>The third change is to add a new and second subsection to section 129 itself. This is to fill a gap which is currently left open by the section as it how stands. At present if a person acts under the direction of a disqualified person, the only sanction for doing so is conviction of a criminal offence.  However, to be consistent with the rest of Chapter 3 of Part VII, we think that such a person ought also to be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order from the date of conviction under section 129.  That really is what subsection (2) of the amendment does.</P>

      <P>Government Amendment No. 193:</P>
      <P>In page 109, before section 132, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2623" /> 132.&mdash;Where a court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) makes a disqualification order;</P>
    <P>(b) grants or varies relief under section 125 (9); or</P>
    <P>(c) convicts a person of an offence&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) which has the effect of his being deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, or</P>
    <P>(ii) under section 126 (1) or 129,</P>
    <P>a prescribed officer of the court shall cause the registrar of companies to be furnished with prescribed particulars of the order, relief or conviction at such time and in such form and manner as may be prescribed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains the information to be supplied by the court to the register of companies and the circumstances in which that is necessary. Our amendment to that is by way of section 132.  We found a number of technical problems with the section and again amendment No. 193, which is this one, takes the approach of solving these problems by replacing the entire section rather than by trying to make some piecemeal amendments to it.</P>
      <P>The first problem is with subsection (1).  That subsection, which Senators can see there, currently overlooks the fact that, as well as making a disqualification order under section 125, a court can also make such an order under section 126 (4) where a person restricted by section 117 contravenes such restriction.  However, rather than fix the problem by inserting a reference to section 126 in section 132 (1) (a) it would be preferable to extend the definition of a disqualification order which is in section 124 to cover not just orders made under section 125 but orders made under section 126 (4).  We have already made this change by virtue of amendment No. 179 which was to section 124.  Paragraph (a) of the new section 132 accordingly makes no reference to the section under which an order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2624" /> The second problem here arises under the present section 132 (1) (b).  The amendment would add two further cases to those listed in the section, cases on which a prescribed officer of the court must send certain prescribed particulars of offences and so on to the Registrar of Companies.  The first of the extra cases would be the case of a person convicted of an offence under section 126 (1), in other words, while disqualified.  The registrar and thereby the public would be interested in seeing such information. The second case would be the case of a person convicted, under section 129, of the offence of acting under the directions of a disqualified person.  In such an event the registrar should also be told, of course.</P>
    <P>The third problem arises under the section 132 (2) which allows the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of subsection (1), but the matters on which he would make the regulations are items which are prescribed in subsection (1), and under section 31 of the Bill &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations. Section 132 (2) appears to be unnecessary, therefore, and this amendment would delete it.</P>
    <P>To summarise, there are technical problems with the workings of section 132 as it is presently worded and the new version I am proposing by means of this amendment would tidy up the position and solve those problems.</P>

      <Col N="2625" /> SECTION 133.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 196:</P>
    <P>In page 109, to delete lines 35 to 44, and in page 110, to delete lines 1 to 6, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;183.&mdash;(1)  Subject to subsection (2), if any person being an undischarged bankrupt acts as officer liquidator or examiner of, or directly or indirectly takes part or is concerned in the promotion, formation or management of, any company except with the leave of the court, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) he shall be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order from the date of such conviction if he was not, or was not deemed to be, subject to such an order on that date.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person shall not be guilty of an offence under this section if he was, at the commencement of section 133 of the Companies Act, 1988, acting as officer, liquidator or examiner of, or taking part or concerned in the management of, that company, and has continuously so acted, taken part or been concerned since that date, and the bankruptcy was prior to that date.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section &ldquo;company&rdquo; includes a company incorporated outside the State which has an established place of business within the State.&rdquo;&rsquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 133, basically, prohibits undischarged bankrupts from acting as directors or other officers of companies.  As Senators are aware, it already pertains to directors and we are extending it to cover other officers and other functions of such people.</P>
      <P>Again, there are a number of problems with it as we see it and amendment No. 196 takes the approach of solving the problems by replacing the entire 1963 Act insertion rather than by making several piecemeal amendments to the existing text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2626" /> The first change we are proposing is to subsection (1) of the existing version of section 133 here and it would be to substitute the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; for &ldquo;director&rdquo; in the second line.  This is to tie in with the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 124. That section defines &ldquo;officer&rdquo; as including any director, shadow director, secretary or auditor of the company.  An undischarged bankrupt should not be entitled to act in any of these other capacities any more than he should be allowed to act as a director specifically. In addition, substituting &ldquo;officer&rdquo; for &ldquo;director&rdquo; means that we no longer have to mention &ldquo;auditors&rdquo; specifically in this section.</P>
    <P>The second change I propose is to add a new subsection (2) to the existing text of section 133.  While section 1 makes it an offence for an undischarged bankrupt to act as a director or auditor and so on a person convicted of an offence under this section really ought, in addition, be subject to a disqualification order, under Part VII of the Bill, and that is what subsection (2) of the new section seeks to do.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (3) of the amendment corresponds to subsection (2) of the current version of section 133 and makes certain amendments to the existing text.  Section 183 (2) of the 1963 Act was a transitional provision which &ldquo;disapplied&rdquo;, as it were, the section to existing bankrupts.  The problem is that we have not carried over this saving provision to cover the new category of people now provided for in section 133, in other words, officers, liquidators and so on.  Therefore paragraph (3) of the amendment would rectify this problem by expanding the saving provisions accordingly.  At the same time we would take the opportunity to shorten the wording of the subsection somewhat while still preserving its basic meaning.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (4) of the amendment corresponds to subsection (3) of the current version of section 133 but again it amends the existing text.  It is unnecessary to specify here that &ldquo;company&rdquo; includes an unregistered company for the purposes of section 133 of the Bill since &ldquo;company&rdquo; is already defined in section 124 to include <Col N="2627" /> companies which may be wound up under Part X of the 1963 Act.  Since an unregistered company is one of the entities which can be wound up under Part X of the 1963 Act, the new subsection (4) would remove the anomaly by deleting the reference to unregistered companies in the present section 133 (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A thought struck me last night, after concluding one section of this Bill, in regard to the definitions.  The Minister has outlined, for instance, that he is deleting the reference to &ldquo;unregistered company&rdquo; in this section because such a reference is unnecessary as it is included in the definition of company in an earlier section of the Bill.  In discussing Part VII of the Bill we referred to a definition given in Part II, on page 26. Part VII makes it clear and indicates that the definition relates to companies outlined under Part VII.  I am not asking a specific question on that matter but I would like to know whether there is a danger that a definition in one section could be translated into an interpretation of another section and, therefore, lead to confusion at the end of the day?  I certainly see the sense behind what the Minister has said.  As the definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; includes &ldquo;unregistered company&rdquo; it would appear to be unnecessary to insert a reference to it here.  It appears to be the convention to give at the beginning of each Part of the legislation an interpretation or definition relating to the application of that particular Part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one other query on this section and that relates to the definition of an undischarged bankrupt?  Perhaps, it is defined somewhere in the Bill but can the Minister of State tell me if the reference relates to an undischarged bankrupt in this jurisdiction or could it be in another jurisdiction, given that the section refers to companies operating outside the State?  Is there a difficulty given that a person might well be an undischarged bankrupt in, say, the UK while involved with a company which might have an associate company or part of its operation <Col N="2628" /> based in the UK?  I am wondering how that reference fits in with this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Senator's first question about the definitions, the definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; is contained in section 124, which as the Seantor has rightly said, is in the same Part.  Therefore, in this case there is no difficulty.  On the more general question, as I understand it, the normal procedure is to outline at the beginning of each Part the definition which would relate to that Part of the legislation.  The Bill, as drafted, is broken down into Parts and Chapters within the Parts.  Often definitions, if needed are outlined at the beginning of a Part.  In the absence of definitions in any Part definitions contained in other Parts of the Bill would apply unless it was stated in the Bill that they would apply only to a specific Part of the Bill.  If it is a more general definition and it is not stated that it specifically applies to a specific Part of the Bill it would apply throughout the Bill.  That would be the general position, but in regard to the specific section we are discussing it is quite clear that section 124 which is within Part VII of the Bill covers it.  On the question about the jurisdiction, all I can say to the Senator is that the intention in drafting this Part would apply to those adjudged bankrupts by the Irish courts within the jurisdiction.  I would need to look very closely at bankruptcy law, not company law, to see whether the phrase &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; might be taken to extend beyond the boundaries, or whether there might be some consequential recognition of internationally adjudged bankrupts.  We may have an agreement whereby we recognise foreign bankruptcy decisions but I will have to check that matter.  The intention is that it will apply to the Irish courts.  If I find, having looked at that, that it does not make that clear, then we will make it clear.</P>

Just lying in bed last night &mdash; I have most uninteresting dreams &mdash; the thought <Col N="2629" /> struck me as we had been discussing &mdash; I am using this just to illustrate the question &mdash; a shadow director and I had asked why we were deleting certain words from the text and the Minister quite rightly pointed out that those words in the text were explained in a previous section in page 27.  In page 27 it refers back to Part II of that section and says: &ldquo;for the purposes of this Part.&rdquo;  Earlier on in the section it also says: &ldquo;in this Part&rdquo;.  We are only talking about words here which, as the Minister says may well prove to be unnecessary, but they may prove to be necessary if it comes down to a smart lawyer in a court in two years saying: &ldquo;well, look, in the interpretation of a particular person or office, it is only described in Part III for the purposes of Part III and therefore it does not translate to Part VII&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward drafting amendment and it <Col N="2630" /> simply corrects a wrong reference in the text.  Section 134 substitutes a new section 315 for the existing section 315 of the 1963 Act.  It adds to the various categories of persons who will be disqualified from appointment as a receiver of a company. Yesterday we dealt with those people who could not act as liquidators of a company.  What we are doing now is putting in somewhat similar clauses for those people who cannot act as receivers of companies.  While all this is general background, I would repeat that amendment No. 197 simply corrects a wrong reference in the text of the subsection as published.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 198:</P>
      <P>In page 110, between lines 39 and 40, to insert in section 315 of the Principal Act proposed to be inserted by the section, a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  This section shall not apply to a receiver appointed before the commencement of section 134 of the Companies Act, 1988.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When section 134 comes into force there probably will be some receivers in place who will be caught by the provisions of the section. The question is, whether such receivers should be forced to resign when the section comes into effect as they would be under subsection (2) of the section as is presently drafted.  Our initial reaction was that perhaps they should, but having looked at it again I feel that the greater good could be served by permitting existing receivers to actually see their assignment through before the section bites.</P>

      <P>Again, I have difficulties in interpreting the amendment. The new subsection 4 says: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to a receiver appointed before the commencement of section 134 of the Companies Act, 1988&rdquo;.  My interpretation of that is that none of the people listed in the section shall be qualified for <Col N="2631" /> appointment as receiver of the property of a company except if they happened to be appointed before the section came into operation.  It would appear that they would be excluded from the provisions of (a), (b), (c) and (d) not only for the purposes of continuing the receivership on which they were occupied but for future receiverships.  I think that what was meant was that receivers who are engaged in an operation would continue, but as regards the future there is an error in the text.</P>

      <P>This section will amend section 316 of the 1963 Act by adding a number of parties who will have the power to seek a court direction in respect of the performance or otherwise by the receiver of his functions.  The parties who may now seek a direction in addition to the receiver would be an officer, member, creditor, liquidator or contributory of a company.  That is the general thrust of section 135.  As a general principle, it is in everyone's interest that when a receiver is appointed to a company he should discharge his duties as expeditiously as possible.  At the same time in doing so he should not in any way deny interested parties their legitimate rights.  Essentially it comes down to a <Col N="2633" /> question of balancing the rights of the different interests.  Amendment No. 201 would insert two further and distinct new subsections in section 316 of the 1963 Act.  However, the underlying aim of both new subsections is the same, it is to reduce the scope for devious, vexatious or frivolous applications to the court under the section.  There is a need to satisfy the court that the matter should be examined.</P>
      <P>The new subsection 1 (a) is self-explanatory. An applicant who goes to court wanting directions to be given to the receiver should, in the first instance, establish his standing before the court by showing that his interests are being, or are likely to be, affected by the receiver's action or proposed actions.  As in so many situations, different parties have different ideas as to how problems should be tackled.  This subsection will enable any of the specified parties to seek a court direction where they are convinced that what the receiver is doing, or failing to do, is in some way or other prejudicing their position.</P>
      <P>Because a creditor is any person who is owed money by a company the scope for devious, vexatious or frivolous applications by such parties, the subject of a receivership is particularly great.  This could be all the more so given that in many receiverships unsecured creditors may not realise all of the debts they are owed.  Accordingly, creditors could be particularly prone to making frivolous applications.  As I have already mentioned it would not be in anyone's interest to have a receivership continually interrupted by court actions.  To do so, could mean that the assets could be dissipated while the hearing was awaited.  For instance, the receiver would have to continue to pay rent, rates, and perhaps, also pay for the security of premises.  All the costs could dissipate the assets of the company.  Hence the provision that applicants must establish their standing before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) is identical to an amendment which we have already introduced to section 119 of the Bill.  It will <Col N="2634" /> introduce a qualifying threshold before creditors may make an application to the court under section 316 of the 1963 Act. In this particular instance an application may not be made by one or more creditors unless there is a minimum aggregate of £10,000 owed to them. Amendment No. 119 is consequential on amendment No. 201 and would just simply change the singular of subsection to the plural.</P>

      <P>I am interested in amendment No. 201 which the Minister has referred to.  I must say that I welcome his decision to disallow applications that would be frivolous, vexatious or just simply moved by the worst motives.  To insist that evidence be presented is an important provision so far as I am concerned. I would like to get a clear explanation of what the terminology &ldquo;unfairly prejudiced&rdquo; means.  Can this be interpreted to mean something that would be in the worst interests of the applicant or is there a tighter legal meaning to it? What is meant by saying that the applicant must provide evidence that his or her action or omission could lead to the applicant being unfairly prejudiced?  I do not quite understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a legal definition that I can find of the word &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo;, other than what that word is commonly understood to mean and which courts are used to dealing with. The actions of a receiver will always prejudice somebody, either in a positive or a negative way.  The key word here is, &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo;.  Evidence will have to be presented that what is being proposed by the receiver, or what the receiver is not doing which he or she should be doing, would put the applicant into an unfair position, would lead to him being unfairly prejudiced in the common meaning of the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  That is what is meant by the amendment.  I cannot be more helpful than to say what the word &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; is a word the courts are used to handling.</P>

      <P>That is very helpful. What we are actually saying is that if <Col N="2635" /> somebody thinks that a decision, action or a proposal by a receiver is unfair to his or her interests they may ask the court to make a judgment on the rights and wrongs of the issue.  In other words, the court would be asked to decide on the basis of the evidence presented, and the case argued, if the action was unfair.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 200:</P>
      <P>In page 111, between lines 16 and 17, to insert a new subparagraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) an employee of the company or a trade union representing employees in the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under this section any of a number of persons can decide to apply to a court for directions related to any matter that the receiver is engaged in at the time, or any decision or proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The receiver himself or herself may look for advice or guidance from the court, or an officer of the company &mdash; we have interpreted and defined &ldquo;an officer&rdquo;<i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash; or a member of the company, a creditor of the company, which might in some cases include members of the workforce if they were owed redundancy money or had not been paid their full salary, or a liquidator of the company. I made the point last night that we tend to forget about that group.  We talk about the owners and the suppliers, but the workers in a company have invested not just their money but their future and, perhaps, put in a lot of effort in the past in the company.  I do not think I was graphic enough about this last night.  I met a man once who worked in a hotel since he was 14 years of age but at the age of 60 when he was near retirement the hotel changed hands and he was sacked. When he walked into the hotel he was asked where he was going by the new employees and employers.  That man felt shattered by that experience.  He had given his life's blood to this hotel but could not claim any ownership or share in it.  He certainly had a commitment to <Col N="2636" /> the hotel.  That is an example of how every employee has a commitment to the company.</P>
    <P>The employee can sell his or her labour, his or her skill, his or her technique, art or craft and get paid at the end of the week but that is not the end of the story.  It is not just simply a case of balancing the books every week and saying, <i>Ce n'en fait rien</i> at the end. People also have a commitment to their company.  Those who work in an industry will have a concern for the industry, and, perhaps, for the future generations of worker in his or her town, city or area and for the development of the industry. A tradition builds up.  The old story is that in many places the line between the ambiance of work and ambiance of leisure becomes very blurred indeed.  The more companies have associated activities like leisure, sport, support, insurance, health insurance or various other perks tied to their employment the more blurred that distinction becomes.</P>
    <P>We have now looked at people who have an interest in the way the company is being wound down.  A company could be wound down in such a way that a certain part of it might be transferred to the workers as a going concern, not, perhaps, the whole lot of it.  But a slimmed down version of various aspects of it.  The workers who were involved in that part of the industry would have a serious and a very important vested interest in seeing that the operation they took over would continue.  That part of the company could be sold as a going concern without loss to the creditors or anybody. The receiver may sell the fittings, the machinery or the building which would mean that the company could not be sold as a going concern.  In other words, not only would be it wound down but more people would be out of employment.  The position of those workers, who would have little chance of further employment would be worsened by the decision at that stage of the creditors.  Workers should be permitted to go to a court and point out that the receiver intended to sell off some property on which there was a small operation, let us say a printing operation, <Col N="2637" /> which they would be prepared to buy as a going concern, to organise a loan, to fund it and to pay for it.  I am just trying to describe a few scenarios: the receiver is not interested because it is easier for him or her to sell in bits and pieces, to allow in the auctioneer and get the market value available at the time, to dispose of it in that way and liquidate the assets.  For that reason the former employee of a company, or whatever would be the terminology to describe him at this particular time, would certainly have a real interest in this area and it becomes more appropriate, given the fail safe procedure and the additional conditions the Minister has just added with amendment No. 201.  It now means it cannot be used for frivolous reasons.  In making the application, the employee would have to say &ldquo;look, I am not just trying to get my own back here on the receiver&rdquo;.  What we are saying here is that there should be some sort of <i>prima facie</i> evidence presented and that in making the case, the receiver should not take this decision or should not put into operation this particular proposal.  The person seeking the guidance of the court, or in the words of the Bill &ldquo;seeking direction from the court&rdquo; should also present his evidence.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am saying that it is not just the creditors, members and officers or the receiver who might apply but also people who are and who may still be the employees depending on the way in which the company is being wound down &mdash; if it has stopped trading it is one situation if it is still trading it is a different matter.  I would put that to the Minister in the narrow context of the Bill and perhaps go a little further as well.  I know the Minister dislikes the next part of my argument.  I am going to put two further cases here.</P>
    <P>The first is that in many instances if such an application were to be successful, it could provide continuing employment in an area or in a location or workplace. It just might be the reason for providing continuing or further employment &mdash; restricted employment but nevertheless jobs in the area.  Everybody in this House <Col N="2638" /> is committed &mdash; the Government are committed &mdash; to creating job opportunities and not to closing off the areas in which jobs might be created.  That would be another reason why I would ask the Minister to look sympathetically on my proposal.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that in this and similar legislation either for the workplace, factories or anywhere else, cognisance should be taken of the legitimate interests of the workers.  At present because of frustration or otherwise, because of lack of local domestic or other remedy, workers resort to sit-ins, demonstrations, protest marches and strike actions because there is no other way of processing a grievance or complaint.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, it would be appropriate to include among the people who can apply to the court for direction about a proposed action or any such proposal by the receiver the employees of former employees of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware by now, section 135 of the Bill substitutes a new subsection (1) in section 316 of the 1963 Act to permit a number of extra parties to go to court and seek a direction in relation to the performance or otherwise &mdash; lack of performance perhaps &mdash; of the receiver's duties.  In addition to the receiver, we will now be adding officers, members, creditors, liquidators and contributories to the companies concerned.  It is important to keep in our minds precisely what section 135 is trying to do.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator O'Toole's amendment, in general the intention underlying this particular section in giving the power to seek court directions to other parties was welcomed but a note of caution was sounded by some parties pointing out that this could be used as a means of delaying a receiver carrying out his functions. Senator O'Toole's amendment proposes to give the right to seek these court directions to two other specific groups, employees and the trade union representing employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of trade unions, as I said yesterday, I appreciate the sentiments <Col N="2639" /> underlying what Senator O'Toole is trying to achieve.  As in similar amendments by the Senator, I do not think that the Companies Bill is the appropriate place in which to make provisions for the position of representative groups, representatives of employees or representatives of employers.  There is no way in which it can be said that a trade union has been directly affected by the activities of a receiver.  Clearly the members of the trade union who are employees of the company may be affected and in the case of insolvency they will very often be badly affected. The employees would normally have the right to seek a court direction and undoubtedly they would use this right where it was considered appropriate for them.</P>
    <P>On a slightly technical point, I would point out that all the parties that are being given the right in this section to seek a court direction in relation to the performance or otherwise of the functions of a receiver have a direct financial interest in the outcome of his activities. To permit the trade union to become involved in the process would mean giving a right to a party who did not or who were not actually owed any money by the company.  I could see a problem arising in a company where there was a number of trade unions involved, if the Senator's amendments were accepted each of them could seek direction in relation to their members.  They would not be limited by the requirement of being owed £10,000 as provided by amendment No. 201.  In addition, there may be some employees who are not members of any trade union.  Accordingly, to give all these parties the right could substantially increase the number of cases where court directions could be sought.</P>
    <P>As in the case of amendment No. 187 which we discussed, I would not be prepared to include a trade union as a party under section 135.  I appreciate the Senator's sentiments in this regard but for the reasons I have given I could not <Col N="2640" /> agree to include trade unions at this particular point.</P>
    <P>However, where employees were not actually creditors of the company concerned, the same consideration and arguments as were made by Senator O'Toole yesterday in relation to amendment No. 187 to section 125(5), would apply.  In that case, I undertook to think about the effect of adding employees specifically to the parties who could apply to the court for a disqualification order.  I am not so sure that the same reasoning applies here because in section 125 we were talking about employees having specific information about a director which might lead them to seek a disqualification order against that particular director.  In section 135, on the other hand, we are not talking about the disqualification of anybody but rather about the way a receiver in a company carries out its functions.</P>
    <P>While some thought is needed here, I am nevertheless prepared to tell the Seanad that I will consider whether the same right should be given to employees specifically to seek court directions as are being given to other parties under the section.  In doing so I would also have to take account of the fact that there is &mdash; unlike section 125 &mdash; no requirement in section 135 that an applicant may be required to provide security for all or some of the costs of the application.  It might be necessary to have a look at this requirement to the section.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to include trade unions for the reasons I have given but I am certainly prepared to think about and consider how we might find a role for the employee in the regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response was heartening and encouraging. Not all the people there, the receiver being the obvious person, have a direct financial interest.  In that sense they do not all quite fall into the same category.  A receiver might go to court and seek a direction in an effort to make a decision, and the same could apply to employees.  Obviously it would not be a financial decision.  A receiver would always know that he would be charged <Col N="2641" /> to get the best possible financial return out of his operation, to get as much money built up or assets liquidated to get the best deal possible for the creditors and other people who are owned money.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point raised by the Minister that perhaps before doing this not only should evidence be presented but there should always be money in terms of part of the costs put up front or guaranteed.  The last thing I want in any of the amendments I am proposing is to create a situation where the receiver would be hampered in doing his or her work and I would not encourage anything that would do that.  The Minister suggested what could happen if a number of trade unions were involved.  I have no doubt that that could happen as a result of my proposal and I accept, therefore that there might be a better way of dealing with it.  Similarly, every creditor of £10,000 or more could also do the same should he or she wish to do so.  I do not think it is a very strong argument against my proposed amendment.  The key words here are &ldquo;unfairly prejudiced&rdquo;.  If people feel they are unfairly prejudiced by a decision the only place they can go to appeal, countermand, restrict, change or whatever the proposal by the receiver is the court to seek a direction there.  They want the court to say that the applicant is right; it would not be proper to sell off that part of the factory or works just now; it is in operation; it is working; it is creating employment and there is a certain income from it.  It is almost like an injunction.  We are talking about the balance of opportunity.  A judge would look at the factors on both sides and make the decision on balance.  With whom does the balance of opportunity weigh?  With whom does it lie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section we debated last night had to do with the disqualification of a director and was, therefore, quite different from this matter.  I accept that, of course. Last night the Minister indicated that when he had examined the ramifications he would be favourably disposed towards accepting the amendment on Report Stage.  I would like to hear from the Minister that he would be favourably disposed <Col N="2642" /> on this occasion provided that it does not affect any other part of the Bill adversely. If that were the case the last thing I would want to do is to damage what I think is going to be fairly historical legislation. This will strengthen the legislation because it gives more security to companies. We must look at the commitment of the workers to the company.  They have committed their future and probably their past.  It is not just selling their art, craft, sweat or labour.  It is a commitment to their employment in the future.  Therefore, it would be right to consider them persons of importance in their own right here and that, acting in the best interests of continuing in employment of the company, they would seek an application.  I ask the Minister to consider that favourably for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record that I disagree with his viewpoint on the trade unions.  I will not go into that again because I do not want to delay the business of the House.  I do not think his interpretation of it is right, but that is only a point of view and makes no change in the legislation.  I am quite happy to deal with &ldquo;employee&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; if that gives the rights to the worker in the workplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator, as he suggested, is prepared to submit an amendment for Report Stage dealing with the employee aspect of it, I will certainly give it as favourable consideration as possible and see whether it is workable.  I think that would be very helpful and perhaps the right way to do it.  We need to watch one aspect carefully. In the case of a creditor of the company the £10,000 barrier is there, as it were. In the case of an employee if just one employee happens to take a vexatious approach to something that might be an area of difficulty for which I have no immediate answer.  The creditor has this £10,000 barrier around his neck before he can move.  If I can get a somewhat similar approach on the employee case and to make sure that it is serious, that is what we would be looking for in the <Col N="2643" /> Senator's amendment when he submits it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point. The easy way would be to use a trade union because a trade union who have to convince a national executive to take a decision and go to court will not be prepared to run the case for a vexatious reason for one disgruntled employee. That would be the best fail safe.  Perhaps as a different approach in this section from the former one and not just to cover the costs, a certain amount of money could be lodged with the court which might be forfeit in the case of the application not being successful.</P>
      <P>In terms of the workings of this section, what time schedule are we talking about to make this operate?  For example, a bunch of creditors could decide today they want to move on a decision or proposal by the receiver.  Obviously, time is of the essence on these occasions.  How does one push it so that very quickly the court gets the opportunity to hear what is going on?  How quickly is a court case set up?  Are the receiver's hands tied for a period of time?  What are the workings?</P>

Our understanding is that there will be a speedy, peremptory kind of approach not unlike the injunction system.  I am not saying it is similar because I have not got that information, but I gather the spirit of it would be in that area.  It is a matter for the High Court to have its rules in regard to how it would do that.</P>

      <P>That is critical because <Col N="2644" /> an application could pervert that.  Somebody could say: &ldquo;A decision has to be taken in the next 48 hours and, therefore, we will lodge an application and so delay it&rdquo;.  The decision is of no value after that. It is essential that there should be a very speedy model for dealing in the court with applications under this section.  I do not know how that is to be done.  It might be worth while to consider providing that a decision would have to be taken within a certain time with a court hearing.  Is it possible in legislation to put a time limit on the hearing, that the hearing has to be held within a certain period of days?  A delay could confound that whole section. My grandfather always said delays are dangerous.</P>

The rules of the High Court will have to take care of the way the section is interepreted.  All I can say is that our understanding is that it would be dealt with very speedily, overnight if necessary.  These are the kinds of rules that the High Court will be seeking to put in place.  That is my understanding of the High Court's approach to this matter. That is as far as I can legally go.</P>

      <P>Let me make a final comment on the matter.  With all those rules put into operation, the more I listen to this discussion, the more I think it would be in the Minister's interest to use &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;employee&rdquo; because before trade unions could move on such things they would have to have their own decision-making process in operation.  There are fail-safe procedures all the way.  It just means getting through structures and getting decisions taken, rather than having a hothead move on an issue, and having a decision taken in the calm, clear light of day.  I certainly welcome the Minister's comment that he will give favourable consideration to the inclusion of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in this section or Report Stage.  I promise him I will have an appropriate amendment for Report <Col N="2645" /> Stage.  I wish to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with section 136 which deals with the duty of receivers selling property to get the best price that is reasonably obtainable. A number of Senators were concerned about this general area yesterday.  What section 136 does is to ensure that a receiver who is selling property gets the best price that can reasonably be got for the property &mdash; property in its broadest <Col N="2646" /> sense.  Incidentally, that is already the common law position.  What we are doing here now is trying to put that into statute.</P>
      <P>It has been strongly represented to us that subsection (1) of the section as drafted could cause difficulty and some uncertainty for receivers and, having looked again at the matter, I agree there is a certain merit in the arguments that were advanced.  In the circumstances, I have brought forward this amendment to overcome the difficulties.  The difficulty with the section as we have it here is that receivers will be required to get the best price for every single item they sell regardless of whether they sell company assets as a whole or whether they sell them one at a time piecemeal.  On some occasions the best outcome for all concerned is the sale of a company as a going concern, or the sale of all stock in one particular unit.  It is obvious that this approach, which might in many circumstances be the best and most desirable one, might not of itself involve a best price for every single nut and bolt sold. It is important to clear that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the receiver has a number of options in relation to how he will deal with company assets.  He can, for example, dispose of them as a going concern, or he can sell them piecemeal.  For example, he can sell them by public auction, or he can sell them by private treaty or whatever way he wishes.  It is a question of his judgment as to the best outcome. Because of the onus which would be placed on receivers by section 136 as drafted here, it is likely that to protect themselves receivers might shy away from disposing of company assets on a going concern basis and, to be on the safe side and protect themselves, they might dispose of everything by auction.  This would avoid their being accused of selling premises, particular stock or certain raw materials at an undervalue, an accusation that has been voiced in the past, in fact, as recently as yesterday in this House. As Senators are aware, when a company goes into receivership every effort should be made to ensure that the company is able to continue in operation.  This is particularly important as far as the <Col N="2647" /> employees are concerned.  However, it would also be in the interests of all creditors.</P>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, the intention behind this amendment which I am putting forward now is to ensure that receivers are not placed in a position where they feel that in order to protect themselves they would have to dispose of all assets by way of auction.  I want to take them out of that position.  That would very often be the least desirable option and in many cases it is perhaps the last resort.  This would clear up that situation.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that it will be very difficult to interpret this section, that a receiver of a company who sells any of their property should exercise all reasonable care to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property at the time of sale.  Is this just to get at people who might be selling off to their friends, or doing a deal with somebody? I am not quite clear why that is written into the Bill.  It is in a sense tautologous. He is sent in with a very clear direction, that direction being to liquidate the company &mdash; perhaps not to liquidate the company, but to create for the creditors the greatest value in assets.  Is it that we are afraid here of the side deal?  I am not quite clear about this.  I thought we all understood what a receiver was going to do under all the legislation so far, that he would go in and see just how much he could get out of the place.  What was wrong with what is there?  Why is this necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there was nothing there really, other than the general common law position.  I do not know that there are that many cases agreed under that.  There is a general common law position that says that you should get the best price, but there was no specific legislation making it a duty for a receiver to get the best possible price he can get <Col N="2648" /> for the assets of a company.  It is important &mdash; this was voiced here yesterday in regard to liquidators &mdash; because very often there is a pretty hasty move by liquidators and receivers to move in on Monday and flog the lot on Tuesday.  I want to make absolutely certain that the prime motivation in looking at an asset is that you get the best possible price that is reasonably available for it at the time, that you take the correct way of going about doing that.</P>
      <P>You have to remember also who appoints receivers.  They tend to be appointed by debenture holders so, for example, a bank or a financial institution by and large, will appoint the receiver. Unlike the liquidator, the receiver goes in to do a specific job, not of managing or wrapping up the company but of getting out what his appointer has in the company.  Very often a financial institution will appoint a receiver to go in to look after their particular loan, to sell whatever assets are necessary to cover that loan and then to get out, or pass the company on to a liquidator.  That is a slightly different view.</P>
      <P>A receiver could be appointed for a very small amount of money and could quickly sell a substantial number of assets which would easily cover the case and then his work would be done.  There is a temptation for receivers to dispose quickly and easily of assets because even at greatly under-valued prices these would probably still cover the loan but would not perhaps leave much for anybody else.  I am not saying that receivers behave unscrupulously in this regard but that, given the nature of their appointment, there is a great danger and a great temptation if they are sent in, particularly by an institution to get the money by disposing of the assets as quickly as possible. This makes it clear that there is a duty on them, not just to look after the person who appointed them, but to look after the greater interest of getting the best price for the asset.</P>

      <P>My confusion arose from the fact that I did not realise this was a new section, an insertion to the <Col N="2649" /> Principal Act.  I thought it was a change. I understand what the Minister is saying. It considerably strengthens the legislation and it is amazing it was not there before. I would use far stronger words to describe it.  I have no doubt that receivers will go in there to sort out the people who sent them in and once they have those people sorted out the rest can look after themselves. This is an important addition which strengthens the legislation considerably.</P>

      <P>This area is very contentious. There is a feeling that very often the receiver will move in and dispose of the assets of the company as quickly as possible and move on to the next receivership. I welcome this section whereby the receiver is responsible for getting the best possible price available for the assets of the company.  In the UK there is a requirement whereby if a liquidator or receiver moves in he has to hold a licence. I wonder if a liquidator in this country should be a licence holder or be attached to a body who will monitor his activities as a member of that body.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that there are penalties if it is proved that the liquidator or the receiver has sold off assets below the market value.  The penalties do not compensate the owner of the factory where a penalty is a fine which would be paid to the State or a term of imprisonment.  If it is proved that a receiver or a liquidator does not carry out his duty and if there is collusion where he has been acting in a fraudulent way, should the liquidator or the receiver to held personally liable for the consequences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interesting and well though out points from the Senator pose a number of difficulties in regard to the licence for the liquidator and the question of registration.  While a liquidator does not have to be an accountant, the bulk of receivers in the past few years have been members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants or other institutes.  A lawyer may also become a liquidator.  I see the point the Senator is getting at but it is not necessary at this <Col N="2650" /> stage.  The main requirement for a liquidator and a receiver is their independence and that they meet the criteria laid down in the Act.  Supervising them by means of legislation is much more likely to be successful than trying to establish another institute of liquidators or another registration body which would have to be regulated.  It is better that we lay the onus on the individual receiver and liquidator under legislation.  After this legislation goes through both Houses and comes into law there will be a very strong body of legislation governing the activities of receivers and liquidators, the strongest we can put in place.</P>
      <P>Under section 139 the court may, on cause shown, remove a receiver and appoint another receiver.  That is only an example.  There are a lot of stipulations about liquidators and receivers who may act, who may not act and so on.  This is a major reform of company law and it lays a lot of new onuses on liquidators and receivers and generally tightens the whole business of liquidations and receiverships. I know what the Senator is getting at but that is probably enough for the moment.  The main protection the public, the company and the creditors have is this new legislation which is very strong.  Irish companies and the public will only discover how much bite is in this legislation when they start to operate it. It is a very tough regime and anyone who becomes a director, liquidator or officer or goes into business will find that they will have no option but to carry on their business in an honest and straightforward fashion.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on whether the fines are sufficient or whether the liquidator should be held responsible?  I agree with the Minister that most receivers are professional men such as accountants or solicitors but it is believed that when a receiver is put in by the main creditor his prime task is to recover the moneys owed to the main creditor.  Very often a manager of a company feels aggrieved because, although the receiver may be a solicitor or an accountant, the company owner does not <Col N="2651" /> feel that the receiver is fully qualified to dispose of assets of a very technical nature.  Should there be an onus on such a receiver to take professional advice when disposing of such assets?</P>

      <P>If it is proved that a receiver was not operating properly, that there was collusion between the receiver and a company director, and if he disposes of the assets below their cost, should he be held personally responsible? Very often, when a receiver is appointed, a solicitor or an accountant, the owner of the business may feel that he is not technically qualified to dispose of the assets.  Should there be an onus on the receiver to take professional advice to ensure that he knows what he is selling and that he gets a fair market price for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A receiver would normally get technical advice, perhaps from an auctioneer or somebody like that, if he was disposing of straightforward property assets.  If they were very technical <Col N="2652" /> assets, like machinery or technologically based assets, I imagine any sensible receiver would get necessary advice.  That would be a legitimate expense in his receivership and in the liquidation.  I do not think it is necessary to lay that down because, once we lay down that the receiver must get the best possible price, if he does not do that and does not take the professional advice he needs, he is acting contrary to the legislation and the penalties are there to deal with that.  It is better to put the onus on him or her to get the best possible price.  That implies that they get whatever advice or information they need.  I would advise receivers to get the best possible technical advice, but now that we have put it in legislation that they have to get the best possible price, they would be very foolhardy not to cover themselves by getting the best possible advice.  They will probably get that advice more and more often from now on.</P>
      <P>With regard to personal liability, I do not think it would be wise to make the receiver personally liable, because if the receiver does not comply with this legislation, he can be sued for breach of trust, or breach of duty, under section 136 of the Bill.  That is probably enough.  It would be going too far to make an individual liquidator or receiver personally liable for the debts of a company.  After all, it is not his or her company.  They are there to perform a service.  If they do not perform that service properly and they are in any way in breach of duty, they can be sued or removed from office.  They can either be removed or sued, and that is probably enough, given the fact that we put new onus on liquidators and receivers.</P>

      <P>Many companies have been put into receivership, very often good companies.  Companies that had contracts with larger companies have been put into receivership, even though they had assets, when their largest debtor went into liquidation.  If the banks are the largest creditors they may move on this. However we will deal with this in the next section.  The company can come under <Col N="2653" /> the scrutiny of the court.  If a company which might have survived is put into receivership, and if the receiver disposes of the assets way below the market value, that is not much consolation to the owner of that company.</P>

      <P>We are adjourning <i>sine die</i>.  It has been the custom when the House goes into recess for the Leader of the House to say a few words.  He had intended doing so at 5 p.m. this evening which is the time we had agreed to adjourn.  In his absence I want to take this opportunity of thanking everyone in this House for the help they have given us in this session.</P>
      <P>We have achieved a lot since we came back here last January.  Today is our 50th sitting day and that is an all-time record for this House.  When it is compared with 63 days in the other House it is a very good performance which cannot be ridiculed by politicians in the other House and others who are not Members of either House.</P>
      <P>We passed no less than 35 Bills in that period.  Two of the Bills deserve special mention, the Insurance Bill and the Companies Bill which has not yet been finalised and will take another few days, but it was one of the most major Bills that ever came into this House.  It was a long and tedious Bill and on Committee Stage each section was teased out word by word.  Nine Bills were initiated in this House.  In addition, we had 14 Private Members' motions and quite a lot of other business such as all-party motions, etc.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to thank the Opposition for the manner in which they helped us here to get through that business. Were it not for the help and cooperation of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Independent Senators it would not have been possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank the Clerk of the <Col N="2655" /> Seanad here, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, and his very able assistant, and the ladies across the way who sat here patiently all through our sittings.  I want to pay a special tribute and thanks to the press for their help here.  We did not get all the publicity in the papers that this House warranted but I know it was not the fault of the people who are sitting here every day.  I am quite sure they reported everything that happened here to their papers but others higher up than they, I suppose, thought that it was not worth publishing.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank each and every one.  I am sorry if I have left anyone out.  I hope that when we all come back here again we will be ready to take on the rest of the business we have to do this year.</P>

      <P>It is fitting at the conclusion of a session to pay tribute to the many people who have assisted in the working of the House.  In her absence I would like to express the thanks of the Fine Gael group to the Cathaoirleach, Tras Honan, who exhibited her usual style during the course of the session.  I would also like to thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and those other Members of the House who assisted you in your functions.  You bring a certain gravitas, if I might say so, to the work of the House.  My thanks are due to the Whips, and here I would pause for a moment to say that probably the most significant event for Fine Gael Senators, and I expect for all Members of the House, was the loss of Senator Jackie Daly during the course of the year.  We mourn his passing and we miss his cheerful friendly presence.  I would like to thank Senator Cregan, our Whip, who has very ably succeeded Jackie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to Senator Willie Ryan who has liaised very effectively with the Fine Gael Whip.  I pay tribute, too, to the Clerk of the Seanad, Kieran Coughlan, to his Assistant Clerk, Deirdre Lane, and to Josie Briody who provides a very effective and efficient back-up service.  Our thanks also are due to the press who are unfailing in their attendance in the House.  I have an <Col N="2656" /> impression that the affairs of this House received better press coverage in the past year than they have for some time and our thanks are due to the members of the press who have assisted in that process. I would also thank the Editor of Debates and the staff who have been unfailing and diligent in their work.  Also, our thanks are due to the ushers and the staff of the House generally.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that the organisation of the work of the House was at all times as effective or as efficient as we would like it to be.  A case can be made for clearer lines of communication.  It would minimise a certain frustration which is felt from time to time.  I know nothing goes on oiled wheels and nothing can be like clockwork but I do think that perhaps there could be a degree of improvement in the lines of communication.  Sometimes the exchanges have departed from what is the normal political cut and thrust and have deteriorated from a certain banter which enlivens political debate in any event and perhaps a certain analysis of why this has happened would not be amiss.</P>
    <P>All in all, it has been a useful session. The expertise of this House has been availed of.  If I were to single out any area where I feel a sense of disappointment it is the fact that we did not manage to have a debate in recent weeks on the Northern Ireland issue which is continuing to fester, which is bringing tragedy, sadness and tremendous instability to the northern part of our country and is having a certain backwash here in the South as well.  We have, in particular, Members of this House who have experience, insight and very strong views who have been clamouring for a debate on this.</P>
    <P>The Whip on the Fianna Fáil side, the acting Leader of the House, has said that the number of sitting has been recorded at 50.  I would prefer to judge the performance of this House on the quality rather than the quantity.  I think I have done so and have said I feel that, as usual, the quality of debate was high.  We have had some good Private Members' motions, some good motions on the <Col N="2657" /> Adjournment and all in all a workmanlike and satisfactory session.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, my thanks to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">

      <P>I should like to join with the Fianna Fáil Whip, Senator Ryan in thanking the official reporters, the media and especially the staff of the House, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Miss Josie Briody and Miss Deirdre Lane for their help during the session.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is worthwhile looking back at what has been done.  I would prefer at this point to do so in a positive way.  This has been a fairly intense session, a lot of business has been put through.  Certainly we, on this side, would argue that other business might have been taken and should have been dealt with.  Nevertheless, it is important to record that debates took place on such issues as the Enniskillen tragedy and the position in South Africa, with the extension of birthday greetings to Nelson Mandela. What I consider to be a milestone, a historic all-party debate on AIDS took place in this House as did an all-party debate on the Constitution.  These debates were important both for the status of the House and in terms of creating a forum in which to discuss issues which are perhaps not normally dealt with.  Similarly, the debate last week on the shooting down of the Iranian jet was very important while also being topical. I know I said this yesterday but I mention those debates particularly to make the case for topicality.  It is important that the House responds quickly to such issues.</P>
      <P>Probably the most important point about the House that needs to be made is that it does not pose a threat to the Government, it was never intended that it would pose a threat to the Government of the day.  It should never be looked on in that way and it should never be looked on as being other than an extension to the process of legislation and Government. For that reason, I would always appeal to the Government Party, whoever they might be, to look on the House in that way, as a place where items of importance can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2658" /> It is important to refer to what I would call the green field legislation, in other words, legislation initiated in this House <i>de novo</i>, in particular, the Adoption Bill and the Companies Bill.  I would point out for those people who wish to know that the number of changes made in the Companies Bill in this House is equal to the number of changes made in all the legislation that has passed through the other House.  It is worthwhile putting that fact on the record.  This is the only House in which legislation can be properly teased out, developed and strengthened in a non-threatening manner.  I make that point not just to underline the efficacy of the House itself but also by way of a request to the Fianna Fáil Whip that in drawing up the agenda and programme of work for the new session he would stress upon Ministers the importance of introducing legislation in this House. Certainly those members of the Government who would wish to have their legislation given due consideration and teasing out should introduce it in this House.  I believe that legislation introduced here &mdash; I have checked this with the Ministers who dealt with it &mdash; was certainly improved.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to make reference to what I consider to be a very important debate.  That was the debate on nuclear disarmament and the proposals for the nuclear industry across channel.  That led the way to something extremely important.  Finally, I would like, despite whatever rows there may have been during the course of the session, to thank the Government Whip, Senator Ryan, for his unfailing courtesy at all times even in the midst of rows.  I would like to put that fact on the record, so that I can all the more easily have rows with him in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the last few words of Senator O'Toole in that certainly we on the Independent benches have had nothing but courtesy from and civilised dialogue with the Government despite the fact that we have had many disagreements as we will no doubt have in the future also.  I would like also to pay <Col N="2659" /> tribute to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the dignified way in which you carried out you duties, to the clerk, his assistant, the press and to everybody involved in the management and administration of this House.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think it is wrong that we should just sit here this evening and, just because it is the end of the session, indulge in some sort of nice cosy congratulations.  It would be wrong to allow ourselves to pass over the warts and the difficulties we have had and will have and not to say that maybe we should do something about them in the future.</P>
      <P>There are dreadful flaws in the management of this House.  I congratulate the Government for introducing such Bills as the Companies Bill and the Insurance Bill and for the changes that were made in those Bills following their examination. That is a tribute to this House.  However, let us not be dishonest about it: some of the organisation and administration of this House has been simply chaotic.  I hope that in the furture this will be avoided.</P>
      <P>We only have to take this afternoon. It was appalling that at 3 p.m. we did not know how long to adjourn for, should it be for two or three minutes, maybe half an hour or an hour, and eventually we settled for an hour because nobody knew whether a Minister was available or at what time we were going to adjourn. That is not satisfactory.  It is also not satisfactory that we are told for the first time officially today that the House, possibly, is going into recess.  It would be far more sensible for the Government to tell us what their intentions are before we go into recess this evening.  It would be far more sensible to have some sort of organisation in the order of this House so as to avoid chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise several other things while I am at it.  The first thing I would point out is that we never sit, unless it suits the Government, on Mondays or Fridays.  There is an enormous amount of unfinished business.  There are some 50 items listed on the Order Paper but we only sit on Mondays and Fridays <Col N="2660" /> when the Government have something urgent to discuss or possibly when we are going into recess.  When we are in a hurry to go on our holidays, we can sit on Fridays but not at any other time.  That is not good enough, we should be able to sit on Mondays and Fridays.</P>
    <P>There are Private Members' Bills about hanging, nuclear disarmament and so on, on the Order Paper.  These are matters of vital public importance which we have not been given time to discuss, yet we can rush other items through. Today and on several other occasions we have had an hour to spare &mdash; out of the air they suddenly appear &mdash; and either last week or the week before last, and this I deplore the Government decided to guillotine a Bill of great public importance. That was disgraceful behaviour, all because the Government had not got the business organised and wanted to curtail business.  Yet, there are times when not enough business is ordered or when Ministers are not available.  I deplore that as well.</P>
    <P>There are other relevant subjects which have been ignored by the Government. I deplore the Leader of the House giving several pledges to this House that we will debate Anglo-Irish relations and I deplore once again the fact that he has seen fit not to have a debate on Anglo-Irish relations because this does damage to the Seanad itself.  If we cannot discuss relevant matters or if the Leader of the House does not trust his own backbenchers to discuss relevant matters, then the Seanad is brought down and that, too, is something I deplore.</P>

      <P>I am about to pay tribute to the Government.  While this session in some ways has been constructive in that there has been detailed examination of Bills, it has been damaged by the fact that we have not been allowed to discuss relevant matters simply because it would be a little uncomfortable to do so at the time.  I would like to see more relevant <Col N="2661" /> matters discussed and less chaos in the routine and organisation of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh and, indeed, the Cathaoirleach, in her absence, for the very effective and, I believe, fair way in which business has been conducted in this House throughout the session.  I would like to thank the Clerk, Kieran, the Assistant Clerk, Deirdre, and Josie for all the help and co-operation the Labour group received from them throughout the year and, indeed, for their very fine contribution towards the running of the House.  To the reporting staff and to the press our thanks are also due.  Senator Bulbulia referred to Senator Daly and on behalf of the Labour group I join with her in saying that we very much lament the passing of the late Senator Jack Daly, a most affable man, a true democrat who was absolutely committed to the best operations of this House.</P>
      <P>The Government are to be complimented on the amount of legislation that was presented in this House. However, it did strike me during the year that possibly we should be looking at the idea of having one House as an executive body and the other as a legislature.  Many Bills do not get sufficient time in the Dáil at present, whereas time can be devoted to them in this House.  Senator Ross referred to the fact that a Bill was guillotined here.  That is a regrettable course. I hope it does not happen again.  In general, in terms of teasing out details and improving legislation, this House made a very important contribution in this session. Go raibh mhaith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Proposed Takeover of Irish Distillers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House of the 20 minutes I have, I intend to give in this order Senators O'Toole, Murphy, Cregan and O'Shea two minutes each.</P>
      <P>I propose this motion with some relish and, indeed, some surprise because as an unapologetic promoter of free trade and free competition I felt that instinctively I would be on the other side of this bid. Indeed, when this bid was made I felt that way.  Having looked in detail at what is going on behind this Irish Distillers bid, who is behind it and what their possible intentions are and the potential damage that they can do to this country, I believe that this is a classic case for the Minister to use the power which he has under the 1978 Monopolies and Mergers Act.</P>
      <P>This bid infringes &mdash; if ever there is a classic case of infringement &mdash; the doctrine of fair trading and fair competition for which this power was put in.  I understand the Minister's position and I do not want to anticipate his reply.  I know the matter is now before the Fair Trade Commission and I know that that puts the Minister in a slightly awkward situation to pronounce or to express an opinion on it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand the Minister must understand my situation because this is the last time I can actually raise it.  The Seanad will be in recess when the Fair Trade Commission reports on 5 August and probably for a while after that when the Minister makes his decision.  The timing of it is slightly unfortunate.  As <Col N="2663" /> much as anything else I want the Minister to hear what we have to say at this stage rather than get a reply from him which kicks for touch &mdash; which I expect will actually happen.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to say to the Minister about the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission is that, whatever recommendations are made, and perhaps the recommendations will be to block the bid, the Minister should consider whether he can enforce them.  If the Minister decides to allow the bid with certain stipulations as recommended by the Fair Trade Commission, the one criterion and the most important one is whether he can actually enforce the stipulations he makes himself.  Let us make no bones about it.  Probably many of the decisions made after that time, if the bid goes through, will be made outside the jurisdiction of this country and of course his writ does not run there.  That is the most important thing the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>The bidders' case for Irish Distillers rests on one principal fact alone and that is that Irish Distillers have been a sleepy company, with a bad profit record and have not performed particularly well. That is something which, by implication, the Irish Distillers company themselves admit in their document and in their statements.  They say quite simply that they have got to change and have recently changed their marketing techniques. They admit implicitly that all has not been well in the past with Irish Distillers but they also say, and I believe them and I think others should look at the statements and what they have said beforehand, that the future for Irish Distillers, with their new marketing programme, is a rosy one and this should be examined before any decision is made.</P>
    <P>I think it carries great credibility but the bidders have made a very clever commercial move.  In fact, it is very similar to another bid for Abbey, another Irish company, by French Kier not so long ago.  When the bidders see a company which is about to take off, they say to themselves: &ldquo;Right, we had better nip it <Col N="2664" /> in the bud before it shows the sort of profits which would be out of our reach&rdquo;. It is my belief, and I think it is the belief now of many institutions around the city of Dublin who hold the shares in Irish Distillers, that Irish Distillers was about to take off and that this, while being a great commercial decision by the bidders, is an opportunist bid and, as a result, we should look at it in a different light.  That does not offend the rules of commerce but it should be realised that Irish Distillers are on their own now.  There is a very great probability that Irish Distillers, its products and its exports would take off this time.</P>
    <P>I hold absolutely no brief for the defence which says quite simply: we must keep Irish whiskey Irish, &ldquo;Keep the spirit Irish&rdquo; as the slogan goes.  That does not wash with me and it is not a good argument. However, there are good arguments about Irish employment, about Irish consumers and about Irish shareholders. They have got to be looked at in a non-nationalistic but in a highly sensible way because 1992 does not mean that we become slaves to British and European industry.  The Act is there particularly to protect us from that.</P>
    <P>What the bidding company has done, and it is something which the Minister must look at when he is looking at the bid, is that it has created a camouflage. It states in the film which many of us went to see in Buswells, and in its document, that GC &amp; C is an Irish company.  I think it should be put on record, that what it has done is to create a company and put Irish directors on board and make it look Irish, but that company as anybody who looks into it in any detail at all, is fully owned by British companies and will be fully controlled by British companies in the future if this take-over goes through.</P>
    <P>Why would they have to disguise this? Why have they gone to such enormous efforts to disguise the fact that they are a British company?  It is simply and solely to convince the Minister and politicians that they are an Irish company and not a British company.  In the offer document which GC &amp; C Brands, as they call themselves, which is a shell company, have <Col N="2665" /> issued they try to establish their strong Irish roots, as they call them; in 26 lines they mention the words &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; 17 times.  It is vitally important to them to prove their <i>bona fides</i> of being Irish.  They are not Irish.  That should be established.  Whether it is relevant or not I do not know but it is relevant in one way in that the considerations of Guinness and Allied-Lyons and Grand Met. who are the parent companies, will not be for the Irish workers, they will not be for the Irish consumer and they certainly will not be for the Irish shareholders because if this bid is allowed to go through there will not be any Irish shareholders any more.  It will be a fully owned company from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look at the fact that the profits of this company, if there are profits, and if there are increased profits, will also be in the hands of overseas companies.  The profits will be repatriated like it or not.  The profits will go back one way or the other to Allied-Lyons and Grand Met. and to Guinness.  It is undeniable that that is the case and it is also undeniable that while that may be good commercial stuff for the people involved in buying the company it is patently against the national interest that this should happen.  That is why this clause is in and that is why the Minister should consider exercising it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a couple of points about Guinness and about the promises in the document.  GC &amp; C will say that it is not, of course, their intention to play ducks and drakes with the Irish whiskey industry, that the fact that Guinness own 49.6 per cent of C and C which is making the bid, and the fact that they have a dominance in Scotch brands will be irrelevant because they will say, and they say in this offer document, that Guinness, in fact, will have no say in the day-to-day running of Irish Distillers when and if it is taken over.  I find that difficult to believe.  I would remind the House of one thing, that in this document which I hold here, the offer for Irish Distillers, they declare, &ldquo;we intend that the bottling of Jameson for the US market, currently <Col N="2666" /> being carried out in the US, will be returned to Ireland.&rdquo;  One noble intention to convince us to allow this through.</P>
    <P>The document also states, &ldquo;it is important to emphasise that Irish Distillers' products will continue to be produced at the Midleton and Bushmills distilleries and that all key business activities will continue to be located in Ireland&rdquo;.  That is a noble intention but I would remind the Minister and the House that the promises made in that document are not worth the paper they are written on.  I will have to remind the House when saying this that they can take all the promises in the world in this document but I ask Members to remember the controversial bid which Guinness made before for Bells and which Guinness won. What is considered by many to be the prime reason why Guinness eventually won that bid and took over Bells was because they promised they would move their headquarters from London to Scotland. To my mind that was the telling decisive factor in that take-over bid. Guinness's headquarters remains in London to this day and that promise was forgotten about the moment that the votes were counted.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I ask anybody who reads this document to discount the promises in it, to look at it in the cold light of day, and to look at the potential damage that can be done. It is absurd for Guinness who have three members on the board of C &amp; C and to whom this will cost approximately £50 million, if not more because it values Irish Distillers at £200 million &mdash; on value rule of thumb it will cost Guinness £50 million &mdash; to say that Guinness will have no input into this, that Guinness will be a sleeping partner.  No company worth its salt could possibly put £50 million into an operation of this sort and say, &ldquo;Get on with it, all right it is fine if it helps Scotch Whisky here but it does not matter&rdquo;.  There will be an obvious conflict of interest if this bid goes through and Guinness is the prime example of where that conflict will lie.</P>
    <P>Whereas it would be absolutely correct in certain circumstances to allow take-over bids to go through, it is utterly wrong <Col N="2667" /> that the Minister should not use his power where indigenous industry is involved, where the Fianna Fáil manifesto itself, in fact, promised to protect indigenous industry and where, in fact, there is a confusion.  There is a confusion about being modernistic about 1992 which is about free trade and fair trade and is not about unfair trade and about conflicts of interest.  I believe this is the classic case. The Minister should not be embarrassed, he should not be shy and he should not be coy about using his power in this case. Simply, 1992 is not about allowing monopolies to come in and damage Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take my two minutes.  In supporting Senator Ross I should like to put it on record that a company which controls 60 per cent of the Scotch market is a threat, and not a support, to Irish industry.  Such is the nature of the firm which is bidding for Irish Distillers.  This move, were it to go through, would be regressive rather than progressive.  What we are looking at here, and what we are discussing, is the future of hundreds of jobs, the future of some historic labels and bands which are, in a sense, export earners and foreign currency earners.  It seems to me that companies that produce Paddy, Bushmills and other brands are part of what we are in a very real sense.  In discussing this take-over bid today we are discussing the jobs of future generations.  I believe we do not have a right to sell the jobs of future generations.  That would be the inevitable consequence of this take-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to put on record my abhorrence of the role played so far by the financial institutions such as Irish Life which, being State owned, should act in the national interest.  That company has been quick enough to test the market, to sell shares but has not issued a word of support for Irish Distillers.  I call on those financial institutions who are always talking about creating a climate for investment here, about the need to work and belt-tighten and invest here, not to, like Irish Life, act with unseemly haste, the <Col N="2668" /> haste of the proverbial rats leaving the sinking ship, and put profit before people.  That is unacceptable.  It seems to me that what we are looking here is an attempt to create profits which will go down the plug hole of repatriation if we are not careful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Ross for allowing me to share his time and to point out the specific Cork implications of what is at issue here, indeed more than Cork.  Of the total Irish Distillers workforce 30 per cent is in the Cork and Waterford areas.  A lot of other companies depend on the ancillary supply services to Irish Distillers in the Cork area.  The total number employed by Irish Distillers in the Cork area is 189.  Though the jobs in Midleton itself are not immediately at risk there are no guarantees there.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the employees in Midleton and, indeed, in Irish Distillers as a whole are very much committed to the company.  They have accepted voluntary redundancies in the recent rationalisation and are now very much committed to the company as it is. That commitment is, in part, based on a long tradition of family service in the company.  What is most vulnerable in this context is the substantial plant in the North Mall in Cork, the bottling, distilling and cooperage plant.  It is a matter of common knowledge now that their jobs are on the line.  That is the single most important threat there.</P>
      <P>The alarm bells are ringing in Cork, a city which has suffered grievious body blows in recent years with the closing of Ford, Dunlop and Verolme.  Indeed this is a classic case of what happens when outside interests control native industry. Sunbeam, Ford, Dunlop, Beamish and Crawford all can attribute their troubles to the fact that outside interests have taken over and pay little regard to local interests.  On all those scores, and as someone with a particular commitment to the Cork area and, I may say, as someone who is an apologetic, old-fashioned economic nationalist, I support Senator Ross's proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Ross for allowing me two minutes.  There is a big worry in Cork. As a publican I am aware that the constant crib of those in the drink trade is about monopolies.  Those in the drink trade in Dublin worry because they cannot get drink from other areas due to the monopoly held by Guinness in that city.  In comparison with other areas, the people in the trade always emphasise that it is wise and good to have other people in competition with them.</P>
      <P>In a monopoly situation it is a big worry that people can come in &mdash; as Senator Murphy has already pointed out &mdash; who have already bought out companies such as Dunlops, Ford and Beamish and Crawfords. Jobs were lost in Beamish and Crawfords because another monopoly company &mdash; an outside company &mdash; bought a particular product that will not be produced or canned any more in the Cork region.  That is a big loss to the Cork area.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out in the one minute I have left that the people who are committed to Irish Distillers and to Cork Distillers are part of a very old tradition in Cork labels, for example, Cork Dry Gin.  This will now only be a label.  It is frightening that a packaging plant that was upgraded at a cost in excess of £2.2 million 18 months ago, where a rationalisation programme has taken place and most important of all, where a profit sharing scheme for the workforce is being strongly pushed by the management of Irish Distillers between the workforce and the management to make sure that the takeover goes ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profits this year for Irish Distillers are 37 per cent.  The company seeking the takeover cannot speak likewise.  The Scottish Whisky company &mdash; since they have been taken over by this particular company &mdash; are at a loss.  The figures show that Bells and Teachers, on the American market, are losing out to the Irish products &mdash; Bushmills and Jameson &mdash; which are selling very well.  That is how the profits arise as the Irish product is out-selling other products.  Baileys is the only Irish product which is produced <Col N="2670" /> by that company that is out-selling Bushmills or Jameson and its sales are on a par with the Russian product, Smirnoff. These companies see that the Irish product is at last coming into its own.  The two products &mdash; Bushmills and Jameson in particular &mdash; are being pushed by Irish Distillers.  People are drinking less of the Scotch whiskys.  There is something in what Senator Ross has said, that the company who are trying to take over, see the light and see that the product that is being made should be kept in Irish hands for the benefit of all of us and in particular for the workers.  The profits made every year go back into the company and that should continue to be the case.  I do not think the takeover would be a wise decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to thank Senator Ross for affording me this opportunity. I have a couple of brief points to make.  It would seem to me that three of the four largest firms involved in the drinks industry in the Community are ganging together to take over an indigenous firm.  The nature of multinationals is that they are beyond any particular national control.  I am very concerned about one small industry in my own area, which is presently part of the distillers group, because the nature of multinationals and the nature of this type of conglomerate is that you close your smaller units and move in to the centre. In general the Labour Party are concerned about the type of rationalisation that would follow the acceptance of a bid such as this, the consequences for jobs, the fact that profits that should be remaining inside the country could be moved out.  I realise that the matter rests with the Fair Trade Commission but there is a more general question here that should be addressed through the Community and which should be pushed forward by our own Government and that is the extent to which multinationals can come together to virtually eliminate opposition and to work the whole business of rationalising, which is about doing away with jobs.  It is about maximising profits and in this instance, we are moving <Col N="2671" /> down a road where it would be against the national interest both in terms of the profits, which would be generated by Irish Distillers, and in terms of the jobs, which from the Labour Party's point of view is the major issue and the major concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, I have been notified by GC and C Brands Limited &mdash; a newly established joint venture company formed by the Cantrell &amp; Cochrane Group Limited and Gilbeys of Ireland Limited &mdash; of their intention to purchase the entire issued ordinary share capital of Irish Distillers Group plc.  Such proposals require detailed examination by me under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  This Act applies to every proposed merger or takeover where the value of the gross assets or the annual takeover of each of two or more of the enterprises involved is less than £5 million or £10 million respectively.  The proposed takeover of Irish Distillers is notifiable under this criterion of the Act and involves detailed consideration of the extent to which the proposed takeover would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or to restrain trade or the provisions of any service to endanger the continuity of supplies or services to effect employment and be compatible with national policy in relation to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination will also seek to establish the extent to which the proposal is in accordance with national policy for regional development and is in harmony with Government policy relating to the rationalisation, in the interests of greater efficiency of operations, in the industry or business concerned.  Any benefits likely to be derived from the proposed takeover, such as research and development, technical efficiency, increased production, efficient distribution of products and access to markets are also being examined.  The interests of shareholders, partners and employees in the enterprises <Col N="2672" /> involved will also be taken into consideration in arriving at my decision as, indeed, will the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the basis of all the information available to me I referred the proposal involving the offer by GC and C Brands Limited for the shares of Irish Distillers to the Fair Trade Commission on 6 July 1988.  I would remind the Seanad that the Commission have been given until 5 August next to furnish their report to me of their investigations into the proposed takeover.  In their report, the Commission must state their opinion as to how the proposal would operate in relation to the common good in respect of the scheduled criteria of the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, the details of which I have already outlined.  Having considered the Commission's report I am empowered to approve the proposal to make an order prohibiting the proposed takeover or to allow it to proceed on the basis of conditions that I may specify in the order.  I fully appreciate the concerns which Senators have expressed to me here today.  I have listened very carefully indeed to each and every speaker and have taken careful note of the points which have been made.  Consideration will be given to these views and to the concerns which have been expressed in the making of the decision.  I wish to assure the House formally that the proposed takeover of Irish Distillers is being given a very full and rigorous examination by me under all the powers available under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  I know Senators understand &mdash; as was pointed out by Senator Ross &mdash; that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter while detailed consideration of the proposal is still underway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply and to say that I understand totally the fact that he cannot go into detail, nor can he give any commitments. I would just ask him to take into account, when the decision is being <Col N="2673" /> made, the very serious points made here today concerning the depth of public opinion &mdash; as I understand it &mdash; and the consumers, but particularly the workers, in Irish Distillers, about this issue and to <Col N="2674" /> weigh those remarks up very carefully before he makes a decision.</P>
