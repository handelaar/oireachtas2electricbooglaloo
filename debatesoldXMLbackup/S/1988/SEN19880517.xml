      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Mulroy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in addition to the existing designated areas, to designate County Louth for higher levels of industrial grants.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Phil Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to recognise the important contribution that Kilkenny Design Workshops have made to industrial and economic development in Ireland and ask the Minister to confirm his support for the continuation of the Kilkenny Design Workshops.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to provide an adequate outreach to the young, unsettled Irish emigrant community in the United Kingdom disadvantaged by recent social security changes there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health the criteria that govern the allocation of lottery funds from his Department and the organisations that benefited in 1988.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take a more positive role in the milk recording scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mulroy, Hogan, Connor, Fennell and Kiely as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Mulroy's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Hogan, Connor, Fennell and Kiely may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 1 only today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say it has been our sombre duty over the past year in this House to express our revulsion at the many atrocities in Northern Ireland? I think it is only appropriate that the House today should express its revulsion at the appalling killings in Belfast over the past weekend.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I am extremely unhappy with the ordering of business, not so much today as over the course of this week.  I believe, as was expressed very strongly by our spokesperson on Finance last week, that there is no need to take the Finance Bill in one week.  That has not been the case in previous years and the only pressure to do so, apparently, is coming from the Department of Finance.  In constitutional terms it is possible for this debate to be continued into next week.  There is a device by which this can be made possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> I am particularly concerned that, as it now stands, only one day will be devoted to Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. Surely everyone knows that Committee Stage is the meat of the Finance Bill and is where most of the serious work is done. Could the Leader of the House agree to take Committee Stage of the Finance Bill next week?  If he does not agree to this, I ask him to agree to sit today for as long as it takes us to finish Second Stage of the Bill and take Committee Stage tomorrow and Thursday.  That would be very much in the interests of all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the Order of Business, I would like to refer to item No. 6 on the Order Paper today.  We have all been very patient with the Leader of the House in our frequent requests to him to have a debate on this item.  The situation in Northern Ireland is now such &mdash; and developments seem to be reasonably positive &mdash; that it would be both appropriate and helpful if this House had an opportunity to debate recent events in Anglo-Irish relations and recent developments in Northern Ireland.  This House has always been positive, constructive and supportive in dealing with questions in this area.  It would be in all our interests if the Leader of the House could agree, if not this week, to give us a definite date for the taking of this motion next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to pick up on Senator Manning's final point I would also like to urge the Leader of the House to take very seriously the demand for a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs and Item No. 6 on the Order Paper.  It has been lying there for months now.  I am getting sick and tired of raising this issue and the need to have it discussed.  Every day on the radio, on television and in the news media there is reference to the need for people to have dialogue and talks on what is happening in the North of Ireland.  If politicians do not talk, people find other ways of expressing whatever feelings they may have.  It is unacceptable that we have allowed this item to sit there for so long without being dealt with.  I appeal to the <Col N="1024" /> Leader of the House to give us a date today for when we can put forward our views on the whole area of Anglo-Irish relations, the difficulties involved in the North of Ireland, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot make a speech on it now.  The point is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely addressing myself to item No. 6 on the Order Paper.  I feel we should take it.  I am not discussing the issue.  I am making a case to the Leader of the House for dealing with the matter.  That is one issue.</P>
      <P>Last week we had a row here which was pushed to a vote on the issue of the report of the Ombudsman.  At that stage the Leader of the House gave an indication that he might be prepared in the future to deal with that report.  The Ombudsman is the last option for people who are the victims of bureaucracy and we intend to keep raising and raising this matter until we get some indication that the report will be discussed in the House. I would like for a third time to ask the Leader of the House to give us some commitment to dealing with the Ombudsman's annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last suggestion. It is appropriate as soon as possible to discuss Northern Ireland affairs under that motion and it is a matter for the Leader of the House to reach agreement with us on taking it.  I would also like to associate myself with the expression of revulsion by Senator Manning about what happened over the weekend.  Going back to the actual Order of Business, as proposed by the Leaders of the House, could I have some clarification because I was not aware that the House was supposed to sit today for as long as was necessary to deal with Second Stage only. As I understood it from the Leader of the House last week, he hopes to have the Finance Bill dealt with in three days. No agreement has been reached on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that we should sit all day and all night to finish Second Stage.  We can sit today until 8.30 p.m., or later or <Col N="1025" /> earlier as the case may be, and if necessary we can sit again tomorrow to complete Second Stage.  Second Stage of the Bill is important and all of us require an opportunity to make our positions clear. Committee Stage is another matter for decision when we arrive at it.  I know the Leader of the House wants to get the Bill finished in three days.  He may not do so. We should not have agreement to sit all night, if necessary, to facilitate everybody on Second Stage.  I would prefer the debate to continue tomorrow and perhaps the Leader of the House would clarify if that is his intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Manning about what happened in Northern Ireland over the weekend.  I do not think any more can be said because we condemn these atrocities week after week after week and our condemnations fall to a large extent on deaf ears.  Having said that, I would like to comment on the chaotic way in which the business of this House is being run.</P>
      <P>It is to me quite incredible that we have had so many pledges of so many debates on so many relevant issues and not one of them has come up or has been allowed. We have been promised a debate on Anglo-Irish relations for months.  We have been promised a debate on the Middle East.  We have been promised a debate on the report of the Ombudsman. None of these has materialised.  The Companies (No. 2) Bill has been lanquishing in this House for over one year now, for a reason which I cannot understand. It came into this House the week before last for a day and a few minutes. The next day it disappeared again.  God knows when it is coming back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, it is quite extraordinary that when the Government want us to sit suddenly on a Tuesday &mdash; this is the first Tuesday sitting for some time &mdash; we sit on a Tuesday to get the Finance Bill through.  The Finance Bill, as we know, can go through next week.  I am in favour of sitting on Tuesdays but let the Leader of the House tell us why we cannot sit next Tuesday and the Tuesday after and <Col N="1026" /> every single Tuesday until the summer recess to discuss those Bills which are clogged up in this House, including the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill.  If necessary we can sit on Mondays and Fridays also.  The reason we do not sit on Mondays and Fridays has something to do with county council meetings.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important and it is being neglected.  I suggest it brings the House into contempt if the Finance Bill is rushed through for some reason when important legislation is delayed.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we can sit every Tuesday from now on to discuss the Companies (No. 2) Bill, the Insurance Bill, Private Members' Bills, if necessary, and have the promised debate on the Middle East, the Anglo-Irish debate and the Ombudsman debate and debate other Bills.  If we can sit today we can sit on Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Senator Lanigan replies to the requests about the tabling of the Finance Bill, our preference would be as stated last week to take Second Stage of the Finance Bill over one week and Committee Stage the following week as has been the practice in the past two years.  However, we are prepared to facilitate the Government to some extent and, as matters stand, it would appear as if Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken on Thursday.  I am concerned lest Committee Stage be in some way rushed.  There are 77 sections to the Finance Bill and six Chapters in all.  Generally speaking &mdash; and successive Ministers for Finance have agreed &mdash; in the Seanad the Finance Bill gets a fine combing and thorough attention, line by line, which it does not receive in the Dáil because they are more preoccupied with the amendments they put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, of course, cannot put down amendments on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  We can put down recommendations and we can discuss these in a reasoned fashion.  The same political heat is not necessarily in the Finance Bill <Col N="1028" /> when it is debated in this House but a more rational objective calm analysis of the different sections does take place.  I believe it is of value and those of us who feel that the Seanad has a value would recognise that in this legislation the Seanad comes into its own.  For that reason I would be very unhappy if the Committee and remaining Stages of the Finance Bill were perhaps taken in a hurried fashion on Thursday when constitutionally the Bill does not have to be signed until 27 May and when time is there to give it the detailed and painstaking examination of which I speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I shall take the question of the Finance Bill first and then deal with other matters.  While it is correct to say that over the past two years the Finance Bill was given two weeks in actual fact it was taken over three days in the two weeks and there will be no difference in the length of time that will be allotted to that Bill this year as against other years.  It was only last year and the year before that that happened.  It may have happened on occasions before that but it was only occasionally.  In the past two years we gave three days and it will be the very same this year.  The Bill has to be signed by the President on 27 May and it has to be passed basically here by Thursday so that a copy of the Bill can be presented to the President on Friday. The constitutional stipulation that the President may sign the Bill not earlier than the fifth and not later than the seventh day after being presented to him comes into effect next Saturday.  Allowing for Friday, 27 May, to be the seventh and last day for the Bill to be signed this just makes the deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the suggestions made by Senator Manning and Senator Bulbulia are concerned, I can guarantee that there will be no rushing of Second Stage or Committee Stage.  Nothing else is of great urgency this week.  We can sit as late as is needed this evening and, if necessary, start off again on Second Stage in the morning and go through.  If Second Stage finishes at some stage tomorrow, since it is a Bill to which we cannot put down <Col N="1029" /> amendments, there is no great reason we should not go immediately into Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>If it is felt necessary to sit until 10 o'clock tonight, I have absolutely no objection to that.  The Whips can meet at about 6 o'clock and decide how long we will sit today.  We can make arrangements in the morning for taking Second Stage and Committee Stage and then arrange for continuance of Committee Stage and Report Stage on Thursday.</P>
    <P>I do not know where to start on what was said by Senator Ross.  He talked about the legislation being held up in this House and in particular he mentioned the Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  Senator Ross would get up in this House and protest if these two Bills were being rushed through either this House or the other House.  Both Bills involve major legislation in areas which have not been amended for many years. As the Senator knows, there are suggestions for over 200 amendments to be made in the Companies (No. 2) Bill at this stage.  In the Insurance Bill the amendments are coming in at a rate of knots.  The people who are concerned in the insurance area, whether it be as insured or insurers, want to see this Bill coming out as strong a Bill as the Houses of the Oireachtas can produce.</P>
    <P>The very same thing applies in the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  We would all like to see certain aspects of company law changed overnight, such as the dreadful directors situation where companies are allowed to fold up and then start up again with rogue directors taking over companies, closing them down and re-opening them.  However, though there are such things as that which have to be addressed and there is an urgency about them, the Oireachtas must equally ensure that when that Bill goes out of the Houses of the Oireachtas it can stand up to the exigencies of business today.</P>
    <P>I reject totally the outburst by Senator Ross.  I am glad he did withdraw the statement he made regarding the Cathaoirleach.  On the question of the days we sit, we will be sitting when the Leader of the House calls the House <Col N="1030" /> together; it may be on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays; it may be on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  I would like to remind Senator Ross and other Senators that this House has sat more often since the first session of this Oireachtas than any other Seanad except one.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the report of the Ombudsman, again I take the points raised.  That report was brought before us last week and immediately there is a hullaballoo because certain people in the media took up certain points that were made by the Ombudsman.  We can discuss those, but I do not think that there is urgency about it that has been expressed here.  Nevertheless, it will be taken when a time can be allotted to it.  It will not be taken this week.</P>
    <P>I accept what has been said about item No. 6 and I will go to the Government and see when that debate can take place. It is not just people on the other side of the House who have an interest in what is happening in the North of Ireland.  I agree with the suggestions that dialogue is necessary.  I agree with what was said by Dr. Eames today at the Synod of the Church of Ireland when he suggested that he was glad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to refer to what has been asked about on the Order of Business.  Dr. Eames said he was glad that the Taoiseach had asked for dialogue between all the parties involved.  That shows that the Taoiseach is as much interested as, if not more than, some of the people who do a lot of shouting about matters relating to the North of Ireland. A number of other points were made by Senator Ross relating to items of importance. The items of importance as suggested by Senator Ross change from week to week and I will not be railroaded in one week to take what is the flavour of the week from the Independent group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as everybody knows, gives statutory effect to the taxation provisions which I announced in the budget on 27 January.  As I promised to do in the course of the corresponding debate last year, I have circulated an up-to-date Explanatory Memorandum with the text of the Bill.  The memorandum contains a detailed description of the provisions of the Bill, taking account of the amendments which were made in the course of its passage through the Dáil.  I hope that this will facilitate the Seanad's discussions on the legislation.</P>
      <P>Before I comment on the main provisions of the Bill I would like to avail of this opportunity to review briefly for this House the Government's overall economic strategy, to summarise recent financial and economic developments and to say something about the Government's approach to the important and topical question of tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> Since the Government came to office they have made clear that policy would be focussed on the closely-related objectives of improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.  The two objectives are inseparable.  The crisis in the public finances which the Government faced on taking office had to be resolved if the economy was to be put right.  We realised that, unless confidence in the Government's ability to manage the public finances could be restored, there would be a bleak outlook for investment and, in turn, for growth and employment, which depend so crucially on investment.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI commentary has highlighted that, for a number of years past, the level of private investment in the country, and especially investment by indigenous business, has not been high enough to support the rates of economic growth we need.  How could this be otherwise, against the background of massive interest rates and the debilitating debt burden that had resulted directly from the crisis in the public finances?</P>
    <P>We are not, therefore, concerned with solving the budgetary and debt problems merely for their own sake, as some kind of a detached or clinical exercise in accountancy.  Tackling these problems is, rather, an essential part of the solution to our overall economic problems.  It is a necessary condition both for protecting living standards in the future, which could have collapsed if the debt problem had been allowed to grow, and for creating the investment and jobs which are so badly needed, given the scale of unemployment and the social and economic pressures that it involves.  Those who try to present a choice between &ldquo;dealing with the budgetary and debt problem&rdquo; and &ldquo;creating growth and employment&rdquo; are presenting a false choice.  They are, in fact, two sides of the same coin.</P>
    <P>This is why the Government are determined to pursue the overall strategy they have laid down from the outset.  This involves action on various fronts &mdash; not just in the area of the public finances &mdash; to create the right conditions in which investment and growth can occur.  As well as the all-important intangible factor of <Col N="1033" /> confidence, to which I have referred, this strategy requires a strengthening of the competitive position of the economy, so as to boost exports, and securing low interest rates, so that business can hope to obtain a realistic return on its investments. In addition, there is a comprehensive programme of development to build up various sectors of the economy and exploit our natural advantages.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that 1987, the first year in which this strategy was put to the test, was a year of considerable economic achievement.  Despite the tough budget, GNP grew by over 4 per cent, one of the best growth rates in the EC.  Industrial production rose by 10 per cent and exports grew by 15 per cent in volume terms.  The current account of the balance of payments moved into surplus for the first time in 20 years and inflation-fell to almost 3 per cent &mdash; its lowest level since the mid sixties.  Interest rates tumbled to their lowest level in ten years.  This was a major turnaround from the situation a year previously.</P>
    <P>I am confident of continuing economic progress in 1988.  Already this year inflation has come down further.  Interest rates have also fallen again.  Exports are growing strongly, and the trade surplus has increased.  Private investment should also advance significantly this year.  There is, in fact, recent evidence from the Confederation of Irish Industry that this is already happening.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year, I expressed the hope that real GNP would again show some positive growth this year.  The indicators to date, although they are still few in number, support our assessment of economic prospects.  Indeed, some economic commentators have become more optimistic in recent months.  I note that the ESRI, which in January anticipated that GNP would simply hold its own in 1988, has marked up its forecast to about 1 per cent, and holds out the hope that we could do better.  The latest unemployment figures also show a move in the right direction.  All this is encouraging but, as I have said, we cannot lose sight of the fact that sustained growth and all-important job-creation depend, above <Col N="1034" /> all, on resolving the basic problems of the economy, particularly those of the public finances.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of 1988 showed that this year's budget targets were firmly on course.  I am glad to be able to report that the latest available information confirms that this is still the case.  I am resolutley determined that there will be no slippage.  By the end of the year we will have reduced Exchequer borrowing by five percentage points of GNP as compared with 1986.  Impressive progress has thus been made towards stabilising the debt burden on the economy.</P>
    <P>As the Central Bank has pointed out in its latest annual report, there is still, however, some considerable way to go. The level of debt, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of national output, will continue to increase in 1988.  We would, therefore, be fooling ourselves if we felt that the borrowing and debt problem could now be relegated to the back burner.</P>
    <P>Determined efforts are still needed to achieve our immediate goal of stabilising national debt as a percentge of GNP. This will represent a watershed and will provide somewhat greater room for manoeuvre in budgetary policy.  But simply to hold the debt stable may not prove an acceptable or tenable goal for the longer term.  This could leave the economy and public finances exposed to external factors, such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates and swings in the economic cycle.  In the long term we must work towards bringing Ireland's debt level back towards the norm in other countries.  It is for these reasons that a sizeable budgetary adjustment will again be needed in 1989, entailing further sizeable expenditure cuts. Expenditure reviews, aimed at achieving these savings, are already in train.</P>
    <P>The success achieved by the Government to date in bringing the public finances under control has prompted renewed interest in the possibilities for tax reform. This is only as it should be: our rates of taxation, especially income tax, are far too high.  They have depressed initiative <Col N="1035" /> and growth in the economy.  Our problems in this regard have been brought into even sharper focus by the income tax reductions that have recently taken place in the UK.</P>
    <P>The tax changes in the Finance Bill represent a significant start on the road to tax reform.  The Bill provides for a major extension of income tax bands, as well as increases in personal allowances and exemptions, which will ensure that every income taxpayer in the country will benefit.  The full year cost of £152 million is hardly insignificant in our circumstances. Concessions on this scale would have been unthinkable a year ago. There is also a major revamping of the corporation tax code, in line with the changes taking place internationally.  We have radically overhauled the collection and assessment arrangements, in the interests of a fairer and more efficient system.  As well as the changes in the Bill there is, of course, the extension this year of the social insurance system to include the self-employed.</P>
    <P>These major changes are being made without interfering with essential progress in reducing the level of Exchequer borrowing.  Reform of the tax system must be achieved without adding to borrowing and debt.  At a time when we are still borrowing nearly £1,500 million simply to pay our way, we cannot vote ourselves large tax reductions without finding the resources elsewhere &mdash; whether by way of additional expenditure cuts, over and above what will be needed anyway to continue progress on the budgetary front, or by a broadening of the tax base.  Any other approach would simply not be credible or feasible.</P>
    <P>The debate on tax reform must, then, be undertaken on the basis of careful costing of proposals and specific suggestions as to how they are to be financed. If people are in favour of eliminating some of the existing reliefs &mdash; such as mortgage interest relief, VHI relief, life assurance relief or exemption of lumpsum retirement amounts &mdash; they should say so.  Equally, specific suggestions for measures to broaden the tax base should <Col N="1036" /> be advanced.  The impact on different sections of the community, especially the least well-off, must also be looked at. This is the only meaningful way to achieve constructive debate on tax reform.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I will welcome such dialogue.  Having made a notable start this year, despite the constraints on us, the Government are determined to achieve further tax reform as quickly as possible.  We have shown that we are prepared to make decisions in this area. Talk of all-party committees on tax reform is, at the end of the day, merely a recipe for fudging and indecision.  The Government have the courage to take the initiative and this they are doing.  I can assure this House again that we will achieve the necessary reforms without any weakening of our targets for the public finances since this is the only way that real, lasting tax reductions can be secured.</P>
    <P>The proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes in the European Community, as part of the completion of the internal market by 1992, will have an important bearing on the restructuring and reform of our own tax system.  The Government have made clear that they are fully committed to the internal market project which should bring significant benefits to the Community.</P>
    <P>We have participated positively in the various EC fora which have been considering the EC Commission's tax proposals to see if an agreed package can be drawn up.  I took part last weekend in the informal meeting of Finance Ministers at which tax harmonisation was a major topic.  Discussions will continue in coming months.</P>
    <P>It has, of course, been necessary for us to count the cost to the Irish Exchequer of the Commission's proposals as they stand and it is necessary to be realistic in terms of what this would amount to.  The figures I have quoted on various occasions &mdash; £470 million in the first year and £350 million annually thereafter &mdash; are realistic and take full account of extra tax buoyancy as well as extra spending power in the economy which would result from lower indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> However desirable lower taxes might be in principle, the loss of revenue on this scale would add to our very serious budgetary problems and cannot be ignored.  I have drawn attention to this in the discussions at the weekend.  There is not just the revenue loss.  Important economic and social consequences are also involved in the major structural changes which would accompany the new rates of indirect taxation.  All of these aspects are being considered.  I will now turn to the principal provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 implement the income tax changes announced in the budget. Senators will be aware that these arose from the Government's commitments under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The changes will, as I have said, cost an estimated £152 million in a full year or £91 million in 1988.  By contrast, reliefs costing just over £30 million in 1988 would have sufficed to fulfil the Government's commitment for this year. On a cumulative cost basis, too, the Government have gone far beyond what was promised in the programme: this year's reliefs will cost more than £400 million over the next three years, compared with the £225 million undertaking given in the programme.</P>
    <P>The PAYE allowance is being increased from £700 to £800, while the 35 per cent rate band is being extended by £1,000, from £4,700 to £5,700 in the case of a single person and by £2,000, from £9,400 to £11,400, in the case of a married couple.  On top of this, the Bill provides for increases in the personal allowances of £50 for a single person and £100 for a married couple, with comparable increases in the widowed, widowed parent and single parent allowances.  I should mention in this context that, following a commitment I gave during the debate on last year's Finance Bill, section 3 provides that widowers taxed under single assessment in the year in which they are bereaved will be put on the same footing as widows in similar circumstances and will be entitled to the <Col N="1038" /> equivalent of the married personal allowance in that year.  Finally, the Bill provides for increases in both general and age exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Other items of importance are dealt with in the remaining sections of Chapter 1.  Section 4 renews the £286 PRSI tax allowance for the current year, while section 5 provides for a special arrangement in regard to crediting farm tax paid in 1986 against income tax over a three year period.  I accepted an Opposition amendment to this effect in the Dáil in order to honour a commitment made by the previous government.  Section 6 abolishes the prohibition on part time directors and employees from participating in the approved share option scheme provisions of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>I would draw Senators' attention also to section 22 of the Bill.  The purpose of this section is to exempt, from tax, payments made under the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, now called the Enterprise Scheme.  Senators will be aware that the aim of the scheme is to assist people on the dole to set up their own businesses.  In the absence of a specific provision to exempt payments under the scheme from tax, the Revenue Commissioners had, in accordance with general and case law, been treating the payments as trading receipts and, therefore, liable to tax.  Following an Appeal Commissioners' ruling on the matter, the tax treatment of scheme payments had been under consideration and I am happy to tell the House that I have decided to exempt them from tax altogether. Section 22 provides accordingly and will apply to payments made since the beginning of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill gives effect to the extension of the deduction at source system for certain fees paid to medical professionals under health insurance policies.  Senators may recall that in my Second Stage speech to this House last year I indicated agreement with the principle that the withholding tax should be applied to payments to medical personnel under health insurance policies with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I pointed out, however, that there was a <Col N="1039" /> problem since the payments were made directly by the VHI to the insured person rather than to the medical professional and I indicated that I would look at the position to see what could be done.</P>
    <P>After consideration of the situation the Government have decided that the withholding tax should be extended to apply to specified payments by all health insurers licensed under the 1957 VHI Act.  To facilitate the operation of the tax section 8 of the Bill provides that the health insurer will be required to pay the balance of the relevant claim &mdash; after deduction of the tax &mdash; direct to the medical professional concerned rather than to the subscriber.  This will overcome the problem which I referred to last year. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill sets out in detail the legislative system for the extension of the withholding tax.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that the measure does not affect the existing rights of subscribers under their health insurance contracts.  The coverage provided under insurance policies will be as before and the only change will now be that the relevant payments to medical professionals will be made directly to the professional involved on behalf of the subscriber.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that medical consultants may feel it necessary to increase their fees because of the new system of deduction.  There would be no justification for any such increase in fees. The new system involves no more than a payment on account in respect of tax due at a later date on the payments in question.  Thus no additional tax liability is imposed on the medical professional who will get credit for tax withheld under this system.</P>
    <P>In the budget, as part of the reforms I referred to earlier, I announced a comprehensive package of inter-related measures to bring about a major and permanent improvement in the tax assessment and collective system.  These changes, which are now being given legislative effect in the Bill, will ensure a <Col N="1040" /> system that will be more efficient and fairer to the generality of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The main changes are set out in Chapter II, comprising sections 9 to 21 of the Bill, and arise from the decision to move towards a system of full self-assessment for corporation tax and for income tax for the self-employed.  The provisions are explained in detail in the relevant sections in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.  In broad terms, the objectives of the new arrangements are to place more responsibility on taxpayers for meeting their own tax obligations, to reduce the levels of estimated tax and to streamline and significantly reduce the number of appeals.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with the positive reaction to the new arrangements which emerged during the Dáil debate on the Bill.  There was general consensus that the new measures represented a significant move in the right direction with benefits for both the Revenue and taxpayers alike.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that while a substantial part of the overall statutory framework for the move to self-assessment is being put in place, the computation of his own tax by the taxpayer himself is not a mandatory requirement at this stage.  The taxpayers concerned will, indeed, be receiving new forms on which they can themselves compute and pay tax, but completion of the form and payment of the tax due on that basis will be a voluntary, non-statutory arrangement for the present.  Nonetheless the provisions in Chapter II represent a major initial step on the road to full self-assessment.</P>
    <P>The move to new return and assessment arrangements is accompanied by two other measures aimed at eliminating tax arrears and improving collection. These are the incentive to clear up arrears of tax, which is provided for in section 72 of the Bill, and the introduction of power for the Revenue Commissioners to attach the financial assets of tax defaulters, which is provided for in section 73.</P>
    <P>The combination of the new arrangements for tax assessment and the introduction of the power enabling the <Col N="1041" /> Revenue Commissioners to attach debts due to tax defaulters, which I will elaborate on shortly, will result in tax defaulters facing a much more hostile climate in the future.  This is only as it should be.  In the changed circumstances, defaulters are being given a once-off incentive to clear their arrears of tax.  The incentive arrangements set out in section 72 provide for the waiving of certain outstanding interest charges and penalties, where the taxpayer brings his total liability to income tax, surtax, corporation profits tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax, PRSI, health contributions, employment levy and income levy up-to-date at any time between 27 January 1988 and 30 September 1988.</P>
    <P>The incentive scheme ends on 30 September 1988 and the power of attachment will come into force on 1 October 1988. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been a huge volume of inquiries in relation to the incentive and I am confident that it will make a very significant contribution to the clearance of arrears this year.</P>
    <P>Section 73 of the Bill gives effect to the power of attachment.  The section provides that, where the Revenue Commissioners believe from information available to them that a third party has an amount of money owed to a tax defaulter, they may direct the third party to pay the amount to them up to the amount of tax due by a defaulter.  The power of attachment will thus provide the Revenue Commissioners with a speedy and cost-effective response to default.  This is essential if the fight against tax default and tax evasion is to achieve success. The power of attachment is available to Revenue authorities in other countries, notably the United States and New Zealand, and its introduction here was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum sets out in detail how the attachment process will operate.  Concern was expressed by some Deputies in the Dáil debate as to the effect the power of attachment would have and it was suggested by some that the proposed power was draconian.  I <Col N="1042" /> would stress to Senators that the proposal is far from draconian.  It is a limited, carefully balanced provision which only applies in a clearly defined set of circumstances. As I have said already, the concept is well established in other countries and it is an essential element in the move towards full self-assessment.  My predecessor pointed out in the January 1987 booklet on self-assessment, and I quote:</P>
    <P>A satisfactory range of enforcement measures must also be available and fully implemented.  This is of paramount importance.  These measures could include a power of attachment to allow for seizure of financial assets.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the range of powers mentioned in the booklet went a good deal further than attachment.  The essential point to bear in mind is that it is the taxpayer himself, by not meeting, and continuing not to meet, his legal obligations &mdash; and thus exploiting most taxpayers who meet their obligations &mdash; who leaves himself open to the use of the provision.</P>
    <P>Section 71 of the Bill deals with the question of poundage fees levied by sheriffs and county registrars in the execution of warrants of tax liability.  In the case of the sheriffs the yield from these poundage fees is used to meet their operating costs.</P>
    <P>The current widespread practice among sheriffs and county registrars is to demand poundage in a letter to the defaulter setting out the amount of debt due and warning of seizure if payment is not made.  In many such cases payment of the debt by the defaulter is accompanied by payment of the poundage to the sheriff or county registrar without the latter ever entering into possession of the defaulter's goods. Doubt has been raised as to whether poundage is legally payable by defaulters in such circumstances.  The purpose of section 71 is to remove this doubt.  This will ensure that sheriffs remain adequately remunerated for their important function which has already given rise to a significant improvement in tax enforcement.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important <Col N="1043" /> incentives in Chapters III and IV of the Bill that will help in our efforts to build up the economy.</P>
    <P>The package of tax relief commonly referred to as &ldquo;Section 23&rdquo;, which had lapsed with effect from end-March 1987, is being reintroduced for a three-year period in sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Bill. The measures will allow the construction expenditure cost incurred after budget day, on providing certain rented residential accommodation, as a set-off against all rental income.  Costs associated with the conversion of certain qualifying property will similarly be relieved. In addition, the cost of refurbishment of substandard property for rental accommodation will qualify for relief against the rental income from that property. These measures will significantly assist the construction industry, and should be seen as a generous and realistic encouragement to that sector, in the current tight budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for the application of a common terminal date to the tax and other incentives for all the designated areas.  Thus the five county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway will now be able to avail of these incentives up until 31 May 1991, as with the other nine recently-announced designated areas.  This also will be of considerable assistance to the construction industry and serve as a further incentive to the urban renewal process.</P>
    <P>Section 30 exempts investments made by pension funds in financial futures and options from income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The measure is intended to help promote the development of these new types of financial transactions within the State.</P>
    <P>Section 41 introduces a new relief which is intended to encourage the repatriation of funds from abroad.  It will allow dividends earned abroad by the subsidiaries of Irish companies to be brought back to this country, free of tax, subject to certain conditions.  The funds will have to be used in an investment plan which is directed towards the maintenance or creation of employment here. <Col N="1044" /> The prior approval of the Minister for Finance will be required for each and every qualifying investment plan under this section.  There is considerable interest in this new relief and I am glad to note that, as a result of it, one major company has already announced that it plans to make new investments at home over the next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures which are designed to assist the development of the International Financial Services Centre being established in the Custom House Docks area and which has major job potential.  The first 24 projects involve definite employment commitments amounting to over 750 jobs. These jobs are new jobs which would not otherwise have been provided.  Indeed, the projects in question would not have been attracted at all to this country or would have been on a much smaller scale without the stimulus of the incentives which we have provided in the docks area.</P>
    <P>Section 36 has three separate aspects. First, it removes the requirement that activities which are to be carried on in due course in the Custom House Docks area should be located in temporary accommodation pending the availability of suitable premises in the area.  The purpose of this requirement was to ensure that companies approved for the Financial Services Centre should move into the area as soon as possible.  Experience has indicated, however, that this aim can be met more satisfactorily by means of an appropriate condition in the certificate of approval.  Secondly, the section extends the special 10 per cent rate of corporation tax in the centre to speculative commodity trading which is essentially financial in nature.  Finally, it brings the investment income of life assurance companies and the income and capital gains of unit trusts located in the centre within the ambit of the 10 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>Section 37 allows a deduction for tax purposes for interest on loans paid by a company in the centre to a non-resident parent company.  Section 38 grants an exemption from withholding taxes on interest payments made by companies in <Col N="1045" /> the centre to lenders outside Ireland.  The section also extends the concession on withholding taxes to companies in the Shannon zone which qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Section 42 provides for the exemption from corporation tax of the profits of the Custom House Docks Development Authority itself.  The reason for this exemption is that the Authority will be required to surrender to the Exchequer all its surplus funds, having retained sufficient funds to allow it to fulfil its statutory self-financing requirement.  The exemption is in line with similar exemptions for the profits of Bord Gáis and the Central Bank, which were also introduced for the reason that their surplus income is surrendered to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Major changes in the corporation tax system are provided for in the Bill.  The principal features are the phased reduction in the first-year accelerated capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings from the present 100 per cent to 50 per cent by 1 April 1989, and a parallel reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 50 per cent to 43 per cent.  These changes, which are provided for in section 33, and Chapter V, are in line with the international trend which has seen the introduction of lower corporation tax rates in tandem with a reduction in the available tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that these changes will bring greater economic efficiency, and equity, to the tax code, and will also play a part in creating employment, particularly in the services sector.  The reduction in capital allowances will not be applied to contracts entered into on or before budget day, to the special building incentives for urban designated areas, to qualifying services activities in Shannon and in the Custom House Docks area, to projects which are being negotiated with, and which will be approved by the industrial development agencies before the end of this year, or to plant or machinery for a hotel or hotel extension where the building contract has been entered into between budget day <Col N="1046" /> and 1 June 1988.  These measures are provided for in section 51.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is a complex section which is concerned with distributions of dividends by companies to their shareholders.  Since 1980 an arrangement called the Primary Fund has applied to such distributions. Under this a company had first to distribute all its dividends from its 10 per cent profits.  With full advance corporation tax in operation, this arrangement is no longer necessary, and the section will allow for dividends to be treated as coming proportionately from the mix of profits in the preceding year. There will be a corresponding mix of tax credits.</P>
    <P>However, in view of various representations made in connection with the section, I introduced certain amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil. These will allow for the postponement of its general application until 6 April 1989 to give companies more time to plan for its introduction, but will also give any company which so wishes the option of applying the new rules from 6 April 1988. In addition, specific difficulties arising out of the payment of interim dividends and related interest on section 84 loans have now been removed.  I have promised also to take another look at the section before next year's Finance Bill to see if it can be further simplified or improved.</P>
    <P>Section 53 gives effect to the levy on pension funds.  At the outset I would like to reiterate that the levy will be a once-off imposition.  Following detailed discussions with representatives of the pensions industry, the basis of implementation has been changed from that originally mentioned in the budget. It will now be charged on an inputed investment yield based on the asset value of pension funds, with a deduction for pension payments made in 1988.  Small self-administered schemes will be exempted as will non-group schemes run by life assurance companies.  The revised provisions will make for simpler administration of the levy and will not affect the target yield to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 64 increases the bank levy from £25 million to £36 million for 1988.  Six <Col N="1047" /> million pounds of the increase is due to the withdrawal of the proposed £10 stamp duty charge on ATM cards.  The bank levy has not been increased since 1983 and bank profits have risen very considerably in that period.  The tax contribution from profits in the banking sector continues to be very small in relation to such profits.  The increase in the levy to £36 million is, therefore, fully justified.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill confirms the budget changes in excise duties.  Part III of the Bill, relating to VAT provisions, confirms the budget day changes and also contains a technical amendment which is a necessary complement to the introduction of the power of attachment.</P>
    <P>The imposition, by section 61, of 5 per cent VAT on electricity has not resulted in any extra burden on domestic consumers because of a simultaneous and equivalent reduction in ESB prices. VAT-registered businesses have actually had the benefit of a reduction in costs since they now pay a lower price for electricity and get their VAT back.</P>
    <P>Section 62 confirms the reduction in farmers' flat-rate VAT addition from 1.7 to 1.4 per cent.  I had signalled my intentions clearly in this regard in 1987 if arrears of unpaid levies were not cleared up satisfactorily.  Unfortunately, the situation did not significantly improve so the reduction in this rate was necessary. I will take another look at the position in the run-up to next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The technical amendment in section 60 is necessary to ensure that legitimate VAT debts do not disappear as a result of attachment.  Many traders are on what is called the &ldquo;cash receipts&rdquo; basis which means that they only account for VAT when they actually receive payment. Where debts due to the defaulting trader are attached, there would be no receipt by him, even though he has made a taxable supply of goods, and technically VAT liability would not arise.  The amendment will prevent such a loophole by deeming the defaulter for VAT purposes to have actually been paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Section 74 applies to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duties the general principle of the Status of Children Act, 1987, namely that relationships between persons are to be determined without regard to whether the parents of any person are or have been married to each other, unless the contrary intention appears.  I am particularly pleased to be able to introduce such a section in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I trust that these comments will assist Senators in their understanding of the main provisions of the Bill, the thinking behind them and their relationship with overall economic and budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>It seems as if the year has passed very quickly and we have come around again to discussing the Finance Bill in the House.  It is always a useful debate and one from which the House derives a great deal of benefit.  At the outset I wish to express my pleasure at seeing the up-to-date Explanatory Memorandum of which the Minister spoke.  As the person who asked the Minister specifically if we could have this last year, and did not have any difficulty in having him understand the reasons why it is helpful, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation.  It simplifies matters greatly.  It is good to think that something is taken to heart and acted upon.  I was certainly gratified to find it in my post this morning.</P>
      <P>I cannot be complimentary in everything I say to the Minister on Second Stage and I know he would not expect that to be the case.  In 1987 we were able to be somewhat charitable in relation to the Finance Bill and the budget because the Bill was prepared with a great deal of haste in view of the political exigencies at the time.  It was presented to the Dáil on 31 March and it was prepared in record time by force of the circumstances I described.</P>

      <P>I was speaking about the hasty manner in which the budget of 1987 and the Finance Bill were put together.  Everybody understood that that was the case and, therefore, our general approach towards them was charitable.  We did not think it was fair to expect them to be creative, innovative or even radical in view of the circumstances of their genesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's budget and the Finance Bill which puts it into effect and which we are discussing here today are the products of ten months's consideration.  Many people hoped that the Finance Bill would bear some stamp of coherent policy and constructive outlook or even, dare I suggest, a degree of imagination.  My party and I <Col N="1050" /> find it dull, unspectacular, largely a figure-juggling exercise and something of a non-event.  This is really because some of the most crucial decisions affecting the economy in 1988 were the spending cuts and, of course, they do not appear in the Finance Bill.  In 1988, £400 million was written out of the economy and that does not feature in this Bill.  It underpins and is the hallmark of Government economy policy.  We cannot forget that when we are discussing the Finance Bill.  I am sure many Senators will return to it time and time again in the context of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister in recent speeches has confirmed that the Taoiseach has asked for a further 10 per cent cut in each Government Department, probably totalling in the region of another £400 million.  These proposals will be before the Government shortly for consideration. While this is primarily a matter for the 1989 budget and Finance Bill I would like to enter a plea that decisions should be made against a background of coherent social as well as fiscal policy.  There is a perception, and I share it, that the emphasis is very much on the fiscal side which, of course, it needs to be and that the social side is to some extent being overlooked, put on the back burner as of less importance.  That cannot be so. The two matters should be dealt with equally.  I would like to see an adherence on the part of Government to some clearly perceived principles of social justice. I would like to hear clear, unequivocal statements from Government about social justice and the importance, necessity and emphasis which they place on that.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> states that the least well-off in our community will not have their position eroded by Government policy and decision making.  Those of us on the ground have firm reason to believe that that kind of statement, while fine-sounding as a statement of intent, is very often in practical application purely aspirational and that the reality as we perceive it, and as those who come to us perceive it, is sadly very different.  On the positive <Col N="1051" /> side I compliement the Minister on holding the line on Government borrowing, bringing it, at 8.2 of GNP, signiicantly lower than what was expected.  He has been generous on the social welfare front but that is only as it should be.  The increase of 11 per cent for the long term unemployed is particularly welcome and is a recognition of the reality of so many people's lives in this country today.</P>
    <P>The income tax reliefs, such as they are, are welcome but they will not be of most benefit to the lower paid, which should be the case.  The Minister has gone some way towards making the system a little bit fairer, but he could have exhibited greater courage and innovation and gone further.  This he did not choose to do in the context of this Finance Bill.  I notice from his speech that there is a promise of greater things to come. Reform of the income tax code is urgent and the Minister has recognised that fact. Other political parties, and my own political party in particular, feel very strongly about that.  Everybody in the country recognises that the income tax code as it stands is disastrous.  Many people are fleeing the country because they do not choose to submit themselves to it.  Others groan and pay up but they will revolt if it is not a subject for meaningful reform soon.  Others, of course, quite simply dodge and evade it.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill which strengthen the hand of the Revenue Commissioners, the sheriffs and the county registrars and seek to eliminate what is a scourge &mdash; tax evasion.</P>
    <P>All in all the Government could have shown more resolution towards reform in the Finance Bill.  For my party this is the major disappointment in the 1988 Bill.  Fine Gael perceive the reform of taxation, and in particular personal taxation, as being just as important as controlling the national debt.  Obviously it will take time and very substantial political and administrative-commitment to bring such a reformed system into being. The first step along the way to this objective must be to reduce the standard rate of tax to 25 per cent and the higher rate <Col N="1052" /> to 40 per cent.  I want the Minister to state in his reply to Second Stage debate on this Bill that he finds this is a reasonable objective and not only that, but that it is imperative that we move as rapidly as possible in this direction.</P>
    <P>There are huge difficulties in the political and economic choices which this kind of progression involves.  Fine Gael have proposed in their policy document, <i>The New Politics,</i> that an all-party committee should be set up to work towards the aim.  Without cross-party agreement, no substantial tax reform can be achieved, just as there could not have been progress on the national debt without consensus and cross-party co-operation. This is a constructive approach.  The Minister referred to it as being a rather fudgy and insubstantial way of going about things.  In actual fact, consensus politics has come of age in this country, or it is beginning to come of age.  Would that it could finally reach maturity if we could set up the kind of all-party committee and all-party approach which Fine Gael are attempting to initiate.  Fine Gael have put out the hand of consensus on tax reform to the Government and to other parties it will be a very sad day for the country if that gesture is spurned.</P>
    <P>There will come a day when that offer will be taken up, just as there came a day when the offer of consensus on the national debt was taken up.  I ask the Minister to think and ponder on what I say very carefully indeed.  In Fine Gael we will continue to press for this and we hope that other parties will desist from being negative in their reactions and using a purely party political response in attempting to cope with what is a very genuine, very necessary and, indeed, very patriotic gesture in seeking to have forward movement in the area of tax reform.  The issue of high taxation and its effect on the personal economies of so many people and on the wider economy in general is so great that it deserves more than a sort of carping, begrudging and negative response from the Government and, indeed, from other parties who choose to spurn the idea.</P>
    <P>While some of the measures which the <Col N="1053" /> Minister has introduced in this Bill continue the significant reform of the tax collection and enforcement system which has been undertaken over the past five years, I welcome the provisions in Chapter II of the Bill.  Self-assessment to tax liability is Fine Gael policy and we are pleased to see the Government take it on board.  In 1986, Deputy John Bruton, then Minister for Finance, invited the International Monetary Fund, as international consultants, to advise on this. My understanding is that this Chapter of the Bill reflects that advice and we support it in principle.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister had said more in his speech about unemployment and emigration. They are lurking in the background and, while he did not dwell specifically on them, I am confident that he is conscious of the 256,000 unemployed &mdash; the average figure in 1988. Another matter of great concern is the 30,000 per annum emigration level which it is estimated will take place over the next three years.  These are stark statistics and they remind us very forcibly indeed of why we need growth in our economy. The Finance Bill, as presented to us, is based on a zero growth rate.  Without growth our problems will continue and they will increase.  The Finance Bill must be measured against a yardstick of what it will do to alter radically the unemployment situation and the haemorrhaging of young people away from this country.  In my view it passes the cost containment test, but it fails in that it does not present any future vision or hope to the hard-pressed taxpayer, the unemployed or the young.  We must improve our economic situation.  High taxation and high pay-related social insurance are an impediment to job creation.  The only way to find the resources to give substantial tax relief is to extend the tax base or to rearrange the system in some way.</P>
    <P>Why are we not looking at options in capital tax?  Why are the Government unwilling to talk about property tax?  We all recognise that, if there is to be tax reform and if people are to sit down and talk about it, either in dialogue as the <Col N="1054" /> Minister says he would prefer, or in an all-party committee which Fine Gael have initiated, we will have to trot out the various options for a meaningful reduction in tax.  No party will make the kind of unpopular decisions necessary. Fine Gael do not oppose the general thrust of Government policies.  They are policies which we devised.  We roundly criticise this Government for a lack of clear objectives and an absence of a well chartered political agenda.  What we see daily coming from this Government is simply and solely cost containment. While that is necessary, we want to see so much more.  The economic consensus may be a temporary expedient, and an essential one, to keep the ship afloat.  I would like to see it taken up in the area of taxation reform and in so many other areas as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak now briefly on some of the things that did not appear in the budget.  There was no tax on alcohol in this budget.  That is, of course, welcomed by the trade and, indeed, by the consumers of so many beverages.  I would like to know, and perhaps the Minister would care to confirm, if this was because he recognises that in the area of drink taxation we are into the law of diminishing returns.  There is already a very high tax rate on alcohol and a general lowering of consumer spending.  Tourist interests are also strongly opposed to increases in alcohol prices.  I assume this is the thinking behind the absence of what has become a usual feature of budgets and Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was first published it included a measure which affected disabled drivers.  It was the proposed transfer of the remission of excise duty and VAT from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, to the Department of Health and <i>ipso facto</i> to the eight regional health boards.  There was an outcry against this and rightly so. To my knowledge nobody had sought any change in this scheme which was working nicely.  It was a harsh and insensitive measure and was quite properly and quite rightly resisted by the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Multiple Sclerosis <Col N="1055" /> Society, which is my nominating body to the Seanad, many organisations which concern themselves with the welfare of the disabled and, of course, the disabled themselves who were most vocal on the matter.  The Minister was compelled to withdraw what I regard as an ill-thought out proposal to change the scheme for disabled drivers.  I welcome the fact that the Minister backed down on that measure. I am sure I speak for all those who would have been directly affected by it when I express appreciation and relief that that proposal was scrapped.</P>
    <P>I do not know who dreamed up the tax on bank cash dispenser cards.  Obviously it was introduced with a view to bringing in revenue but it should never really have gone beyond the first memo stage.  It was a bad idea.  Not only did it amount to a tax on efficiency but it amounted to a charge on customers for withdrawing their own money.  In addition, it resulted in several thousand teenagers, who had been given a bank card and a £3 deposit by their friendly bank, finding themselves in the red before they ever activated their new accounts.  I am glad that wiser counsels have prevailed and that an expedient was found to drop that measure from the Finance Bill.  We could have had great fun debating it in the Seanad and putting down recommendations against it.  As somebody who enjoys debate perhaps it is rather sad that we cannot do so.  Nevertheless I am very pleased indeed that that tax has been politely forgotten and that it will not be a feature of this Finance Bill.  One hopes it will never surface as an idea again because it was nothing short of disastrous.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that there would have been more for tourism in the Finance Bill.  I would like to know where is the long term strategy.  I know £4 million was made available as a special package and that is of course welcomed, but it is somewhat disappointing that, in the context of the Finance Bill, our second major industry, and one in which we see tremendous growth and potential, did not feature for additional support.  There is no great evidence, in the Finance Bill at <Col N="1056" /> least, of a long term strategy for developing tourism.  Announcements to this effect were made during the general election last year.  I think the tourist industry could reasonably have looked to the Finance Bill for more encouragement, greater support and a greater evidence of Government commitment.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that in his reply on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>We consider the tax on investment income of pension funds to be a retrograde step.  People should be encouraged rather than penalised for providing for their retirement.  I recognise that there is some improvement in the Finance Bill on this measure as presented in the budget. The effect of the proposal on different pension funds will vary.  Can the Minister give assurances that no pension fund will be put at risk of insolvency by the implementation of this levy?  What guarantee can he give that this will operate for one year only?  He reiterated, in his speech today, his assurance that this will be so.  I would like more than reiteration. I would like more evidence to the effect that this will merely operate for one year.  Anybody who has studied taxation knows that things have a way of lodging and becoming permanent.  They may initially have been introduced as short term measures to derive revenue but they tend to hang around a long time.  I would like assurances that this will not be the case in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>In general I am not happy about the principle, or indeed the lack of it, underlying this measure because it is discriminatory. It punishes those who have been provident and who have saved. Even allowing for the excluded assets, it still seems to be a measure which breaches a fundamental principle.  It amounts to a clear case of double taxation. As the income from pension funds is already subject to tax, it will result in higher pension contributions.  It will scoop £16.5 million out of private pension funds and it will be exceptionally difficult to collect.  Of course, it will not apply to public servants whose pensions are funded out of Government revenue.  I <Col N="1057" /> think it should follow the bank card tax into oblivion.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the motor industry.  I do so with a certain sadness because our able exponent of the motor industry in the Seanad, Jackie Daly, died some ten days ago.  He always looked forward to the Finance Bill.  He girded his loins, took up the cudgels, armed himself with his SIMI briefing documents, took the Minister on and enjoyed it.  Those of us on this side of the House will have to do justice to that section of the Bill for the industry itself and, of course, for Jackie Daly who would have wanted us to give as good as we got in relation to it.  There is not much joy in the Finance Bill for the motorist or for the society of the Irish motor industry.  I welcome the increase in the benefit in kind relief on company cars proposed in section 22.  The motor car industry is very depresssed at present and any measure which will stimulate demand for new cars is of value.  My colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Michael Noonan, introduced an amendment, the purpose of which was to assess benefit in kind on the engine capacity of company cars rather than on the market cost.  He felt that this would be an even stronger stimulus to car sales.</P>
    <P>The 8p increase on a gallon of petrol is obviously something that one would not welcome.  It is extraordinary that the Minister should treat the spirit which the motorist puts into the fuel tank as less essential than the spirit of drinkers who got away scot free on this occasion.  The budget had the effect of clawing back recent reductions in petrol prices caused by the weakness of the dollar.  It now increases the Exchequer take to a massive 71 per cent of £1.85, on a gallon of premium petrol costing £2.61.  I am interested in unleaded petrol.  It will now have price parity with leaded fuel, whereas heretofore it had been over 4p a gallon more.  In most other European countries, however, unleaded petrol is actually cheaper to buy at the pumps and I would like to see that situation obtaining here.  We have to give incentives towards the purchase of unleaded petrol which is, as we know, environmentally necessary <Col N="1058" /> and important and which we want to see being used more and more.</P>
    <P>The fact that there has been no decrease in the excise duty on new cars is, of course, a major disappointment. The new £6,000 capital allowance represents roughly half the cost of the average company representative's car but it will hardly set the motor industry alight. The Finance Bill, to some limited extent, recognises the difficulties faced by the motor industry.  I welcome some of the measures but I would like to have seen a much greater improvement.</P>
    <P>Turning to Chapter III, sections 24 to 26, the Government's decision to reintroduce the section 23 tax incentive for apartments is welcomed in that it is an attempt to stimulate the building industry which is sorely pressed.  They badly needed a gesture of appeasement, having been led to believe that they could confidently expect a 5 per cent VAT rate and a cash injection of £200 million if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  Last year's Finance Bill gave them no joy whatsoever. I suppose they have to be grateful for small mercies and take what is given to them on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I see certain dangers in the reactivation of section 23 while I welcome it in principle. More and more we have seen suburban locations targeted by developers while dereliction in our cities and towns continues to grow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing Chapter III, sections 24 to 26 and what is known as the section 23 incentive to the <Col N="1059" /> building industry, and I was expressing concern.  It is quite obvious to anyone who is an observer of the building scene that, by and large, suburban areas have been targeted by developers for this kind of department block development.  Large infills have taken place in areas which are familiar to me, like Dublin 6, Dublin 4 and elsewhere in the city.  At the same time, we are seeing massive dereliction in the Dublin city centre; and the same is true of all our cities and towns.  Areas of dereliction in inner cities and towns are crying out for remedial attention.  This measure may not mean that they will receive the attention they deserve.  The development may continue in the suburban areas and the dereliction may remain reminding us all, in a very gap-toothed way, how very ugly so many of our cities and towns have become.  I would have thought that the proposal, as presented, would have been firmly underpinning the Government's urban renewal programme and that the consequences of the reintroduction of this relief would have been to do away with urban blight and dereliction specifically.  An opportunity to do that was missed in this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government have not included an incentive for the restoration of listed buildings.  This I consider to be a glaring omission.  I hope my colleague, Senator David Norris, will be here when we discuss Committee Stage because he waxes lyrical, as only he can, on listed buildings and dereliction in inner cities.  Also, I am concerned that this provision does very little to help the construction industry in rural areas.  It will impact certainly on Dublin and on the major cities, but the people involved in the construction industry in the rural areas, by and large, will remain unaffected by the measure.  As such, it appears that there is a certain inequality about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest disappointment for those in the construction industry will be the failure to reduce the current 10 per cent VAT rate to the promised 5 per cent. Can the Minister indicate that he will <Col N="1060" /> consider such a reduction in the 1989 budget and Finance Bill?  I am sure the industry would be very interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on the matter.  I would like him to indicate what he expects the introduction of the section 23 provision will cost the Exchequer in any given year, and it is important to know for how long he intends to retain it on this occasion.  I think a limit of three years is what is in the Bill, but I would welcome an indication as to whether he thinks that might be extended and it is important to know the cost to the Exchequer.  It would be useful also to have as information how many apartment blocks were built during the duration of the last scheme?  Have we that kind of detail and information?  Is it a fact that about half of these were built in the Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 areas?</P>
    <P>Is the argument I make about the saturation of suburban areas with apartment blocks and the dereliction of inner cities valid?  As somebody who was born and grew up in Sandymount, Dublin, and who spends some time there now, I cannot but notice that every little green area and every garden of any decent size has been turned into an apartment block, and meanwhile we have to look at the ugliness of the inner cities.  While I am on the subject of dereliction, when will the Cabinet introduce a derelict sites Bill which is a long time awaited?  How many pounds worth of new buildings does the Minister expect this measure will introduce?  Does he think it will be eagerly taken up by the construction industry?  What does he think the actual bricks and mortar consequences of it will be on the ground?  I will be very interested to hear him speak.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the 35 per cent withholding tax introduced in the first instance in the 1987 Finance Act.  We did battle on it last year and subsequently.  I have to say it is working very unfairly in certain professions, especially as it affects doctors in the GMS scheme.  In the 1988 Finance Bill, it is proposed to extend it to payments by the VHI.  Fine Gael had an amendment in the Dáil recommending that the VHI and all others offering medical insurance would only have to notify the Revenue Commissioners each month <Col N="1061" /> of the total paid to members to cover medical expenses claimed by medical practitioners, and the names and tax numbers of medical practitioners.  If we have got to do that, this seems the better way.</P>
    <P>In the past, the VHI refused to give that kind of information, but now I understand they are willing to comply. There is a danger, under the scheme as proposed by the Minister, that, as doctors are now going to have to wait for their money and will get it minus 35 per cent, they might look for it straightaway from the patient and the patient, in turn, might have to borrow to meet medical expenses.  That is a situation which I am sure the Minister would not like and I certainly would not wish to countenance. It is also likely that this measure will merely bring about an increase of 35 per cent, or thereabouts, in consultants' fees. That, of course, would be a worry.  It is the oldest trick in the book to pass on any increase to the consumer.  I am sure consultants are no more immune from that kind of attitude than any other group in the country.  That gives cause for concern. Unlike other professions &mdash; lawyers, solicitors, barristers and engineers &mdash; people in the medical profession determine their own fees in the main.  It is often the case that the patient is prepared to pay any price to be cured.  That is something we have to remember in the context of this measure.</P>
    <P>I am interested in knowing whether the Minister's thinking, apart from merely wishing to bring in additional money which he is charged to do as Minister for Finance, was to reduce the disparity between the doctor working in the GMS and the hospital consultant.  I admit there is a certain validity in that argument and in wanting to subject all members of the one profession to the same 35 per cent tax.  As a consequence of this measure, there have been enormous cash flow problems for doctors in the GMS.  The Minister, when introducing this measure in the 1987 Act, allowed for a hardship clause, but I do not see that operating. In response to Dáil questions he indicated that virtually no returns had been made <Col N="1062" /> on foot of the hardship clause.  I have to question why it was put in at all.  Was it merely a sop because there was so much antagonism to this tax at the time, or does it mean anything at all?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the fact that as matters stand there is a contractual agreement &mdash; a private contractual agreement &mdash; between the citizen and the insuring body.  I suppose we can talk about the VHI because they, in the main, are the insuring body who look after the health needs of people in a private health care sector.  Many people in criticism of this measure have felt very unhappy that the Minister's action constitutes an interference in this private contractual arrangement and that it is, to some extent, a subversion of all we understood the VHI's relationship with the patient to be.  There is a certain danger that patient privacy will be interfered with and eroded when third parties get in on the act.  Privacy and confidentiality are a hallmark of medical care in this country, and long may they continue to be so.  I would welcome assurances from the Minister that patient privacy and confidentiality will not be breached by this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation suggested that withholding taxes should be used as widely as possible where it was fair to do so.  However, having had personal experience of the operation of this tax as it affects the doctor in the GMS, and having many close friends and associates who are reeling from it, I can state without fear of contradiction that it is penal, iniquitous and its net effect is to cause great hardship.  I would like the Minister to refer to the absence of refunds on a hardship basis since the scheme was introduced over the past year.  This element, brought in as a sop and to assuage anger and irritation, was fine sounding and compassionate seeming, but its practical application was nil and it was meaningless.  There are many sadder and wiser people who have found that out.  The correspondence columns of the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> and other medical magazines are packed with letters from people who find themselves in an impossible situation as a result of this <Col N="1063" /> measure.  It is interesting that the hardship factor does not enter into the measures proposed in the 1988 Bill.  Does the Minister not feel that consultants will experience hardship?  Is this something he would like to refer to when he replies?</P>
    <P>We support the proposed changes in corporation tax contained in Chapters IV and V.  The trading of reductions in accelerated capital allowances against lower rates of corporation tax is welcome.  I would like to see the day when corporation tax would approximate the standard rate of income tax, and I expect that is something we are working towards. Doubtless, we will have a very full and detailed examination of the different provisions of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.  I look forward with interest to what the Minister will have to say in his reply to Second Stage on the various points I raised and, in particular, I would like him to refer to the fact that, as I and my party see it, there is very little evidence of real vision coming from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Yes, on the cost containment, and the Government must be reminded that they U-turned massively on that, and the reason they are implementing a stringent policy in this area is the consensus in the Dáil.  They have no option but to pursue this course of action even if it means a loss of political credibility.  They had to debrief their backbenchers following their massive U-turn on fiscal policy.  Having been kept to their immediate task by the Opposition parties, I want to know &mdash; and I want the Minister to state clearly &mdash; what hope, in a concrete, real sense, are the Government offering to our young, sick and old and our emigrants?  Aside from fiscal policy and cost containment, that is a yardstick against which the 1988 Finance Bill will be measured.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I welcome the Minister to the House. This is his second appearance, and I hope we will have him here in 1989, 1990 and 1991.  Before making my general observations on the Finance Bill, may I say that I noticed one personal criticism of <Col N="1064" /> the Minister by Senator Bulbulia, on which I would like to comment briefly? She said the Minister backed down on the disabled drivers' scheme.  I do not see it like that.  Long before the Finance Bill was discussed in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he is but I want to give my own observations.  The Minister had made it clear to me that, if agreement could not be reached with the disabled drivers &mdash; he made it quite clear at a packed private meeting &mdash; there would be no change in the scheme.  I am clearing the air because I know the Minister has not backed down on that.</P>
      <P>Most commentators would look on last year as the year the Government took firm control of the economy and began to turn it around after what most people believed was a long period of mismanagement. We are now overcoming the very serious economic difficulties which were steadily destroying all our hopes and our prospects as a nation.  The first crucial steps necessary for national recovery have been very successfully implemented.  They are part of a clear overall strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was designed to secure a return to economic growth and to increase employment in the nineties.</P>
      <P>The 1988 budget &mdash; and this Finance Bill which gives legal effect to the budget &mdash; is a further necessary step along the planned road to recovery.  This year the Government had to follow through and continue the process of restoring order to the national finances and reducing the size of the national debt.  That is seen by most right thinking people as an essential prelude to further future growth.  What has been started very successfully must be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The success in managing the public finances in 1987 has also caused some problems.  There is a feeling among some people in the public eye that the worst days are over, that we can afford to rest on our laurels and go back to the days of indifferent management and lack of direction and control.  If that were to happen it would be tragic because we have come very far along the right road. This was noticeable in the contributions of the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil.  They were suggesting that we can relax now. We all know their proposals to reduce the tax rates would cost millions of pounds.  We cannot give the impression that we can now relax when it comes to dealing with borrowing and our debt problem.  Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.  The harsh reality is that the hard grind must continue.  There is no joy for Government Ministers, Government TDs or for any of us that that is the position.  It is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 or 14 years we have been borrowing quite heavily to improve our health services, our educational and social welfare systems, and we have a highly developed level of public services relating to the national income.  We have brought our social services up to par with those countries which are far wealthier than we are.  I believe the Government are striving to make all public services more economic and efficient by prudent management of resources and to maintain the real value of welfare services for those who need them most.  Everyone concerned should co-operate with what I regard as a very sensible objective, instead of continuing to demand the supply of services at a level we cannot afford in present circumstances.  For example, the result of the control and cutting down of abuse of social welfare payments was apparent last year and brought in an extra £20 million approximately. This helped to provide modest improvements in the budget for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, in the same period we spent about £500 million building new, modern and well-equipped hospitals, and this has been going on for <Col N="1066" /> the past eight or ten years.  These new hospitals were built to replace that would be regarded as old and unsuitable hospitals.  Having spent a vast amount of taxpayers' money on providing these new first-class hospitals, we now find that there is a continuing demand to keep the old ones.  There is a variety of reasons for this for example, people are attached to the hospital where all their children where born.  The reasons are mostly sentimental but we cannot continue along that road.  Of course, much of the debate on the Finance Bill centres on tax and the problems generally associated with tax and tax collection.  The effectiveness of the tax collection system has been impaired over the past number of years because of the extra functions taken on by people in that area.  The Government set up a special task force last year and my information is that the task force were successful.  They were given a target of £10 million and they collected over £14 million.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to a number of new powers in the area of tax collection, the new power of attachment and the incentive of a once-off offer to waive interest and penalties.  That is the amnesty on which I will comment in greater detail later.  The proposal on self-assessment in the Bill is a first step towards a total self-assessment system, which could take up to five years to introduce.  The main purpose of the new arrangements is to place the responsibility on taxpayers for meeting their own tax obligations, to reduce the level of estimated tax and to streamline the appeals procedures.  I believe the self-assessment system must be accompanied by a simpification of the tax code generally because our tax code is quite complicated.  I believe it is almost unfair at times to expect individuals to be able to make returns as they should.</P>
    <P>I know many traders &mdash; and we all know many traders &mdash; who should be able to prepare their own accounts.  They should not have to employ an accountant. Many of them simply cannot afford the overheads involved in consulting an accountant for a service which many of <Col N="1067" /> them would be able to provide for themselves if the code was simple enough. Indeed, this is recommended in the Commission on Taxation report as, indeed, is self-assessment, the power of attachment and other areas of importance in the whole area of tax.  The Minister referred to the blue book, Self-assessment for Income and Corporation Taxes and again the report of the Commission on Taxation made similar recommendations.  As Senator Bulbulia said Deputy Bruton, the then Minister for Finance made this point.  I quote from the blue booklet on self-assessment:</P>
    <P>The present system of tax collection and enforcement is proving increasingly inadequate.  Some key features of the system are now too slow and cumbersome for the volume of cases requiring attention.  There is a perception among a growing number of taxapayers that non-compliance has reached an unacceptable level, that there are considerable delays in the payment of tax and indeed that large amounts of tax remain uncollected.</P>
    <P>The booklet clearly outlines the course to be followed.  Some of the objectives are already in place or implemented.  The point is made that the enforcement measures which must become available when the self-assessment scheme if fully implemented include a surcharge for late filing of returns, which I think is there already, interest charges for late payment of tax and greater use of existing powers, including powers of entry to business premises, the power of attachment to allow for seizure for financial assets and, if necessary, sale of real or personal property and powers for the Revenue to impose penalties.  At first sight those powers appear quite severe.  Some of them are tough measures and, as I said, some of them are already in place at present &mdash; in particular, the exploits of the sheriff have been well noticed throughout the country.  Could the Minister comment on the fear that I and many people have that the power of attachment might become in future a softer option <Col N="1068" /> than the sheriff?  That point has been brought to my attention by a number of people.</P>
    <P>One of the main provisions of the Bill which I regard as extremely important is the amnesty for tax defaulters.  This provision has to be seen as a very useful tool for fighting tax evasion.  It is a once-off incentive to defaulting taxpayers.  My information &mdash; again, I am sure the Minister will comment on this if I ask him &mdash; is that it has been very effective in bringing in taxes, far in excess of what was expected.  Accountants tell me that it is clearly the most effective tax amnesty they have witnessed and is clearly successful. For example, I know a man who was trying to fix up his affairs hurriedly before the end of April.  He paid over a cheque for £90,000 and he told me that if he did not pay that it would cost him another £37,000 for penalties and interest so he was glad to pay up.</P>
    <P>I refer to a point made by the previous speaker about the construction industry. Certainly we all accept that during the past seven or eight years it has been going through a protracted period of great difficulty. It has proved almost impossible to sustain the industry in recent years by major public spending programmes and, with the exception of the road network &mdash; and Athlone has benefited greatly in this area &mdash; the heavy infrastructural demands of the seventies have been satisfied to a large extent.  I believe the construction industry is a barometer of the economy and that a pick-up in the construction industry will depend on a pick-up in the economy as a whole.  Growth in the private sector demand is important also.  It is recognised in the industry that the success of the current economic policies, in particular the fall in interest and mortgage rates, will have a very important and favourable impact on construction in the years ahead.  Of course, Government policies, the decentralisation of the Civil Service, the financial services centre here in Dublin and the urban renewal programme in many towns around Ireland, will also help.  In the context of the Bill the Government have restored what was one of the most <Col N="1069" /> successful incentives in modern times, the section 23 type incentive, and this will help in a very positive way.  This should all be a stimulus to the construction industry as, indeed, will the reduction in stamp duty from 4 per cent to 3 per cent on houses in the £50,000 to £60,000 price range.  The lower rate of corporation tax will be of benefit also.  Hopefully, all the incentives and programmes the Government have introduced will help to revive the construction industry and thus create new jobs.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism by many people, in particular by the Opposition parties, that the budget and the Finance Bill will do very little, if anything, for employment.  I do not think that is fair. It is negative thinking, if you like.  I am a great believer in confidence in the economy. The policies being pursued in this Bill and in the budget and Finance Bill of 1987 have led to an increase in confidence throughout the business community.  This in turn, of course, will bring increased investment and obviously will lead to increased employment.  The pursuit of development opportunities through the economy and the special emphasis this Government have placed on such things as national resources are beginning to have good effect.  Last year's tourism package was an example of how the Government's policies on employment have brought about additional jobs and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to comment on one aspect of job creation which worries me.  Indeed, Senator Ferris referred to it last week on the Insurance Bill. Perhaps it was not &mdash; I am sure he would agree &mdash; the appropriate debate for what he had to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he will say it again in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point I agree with and I am sure all of us would agree with, including the Minister.  The price we are paying for years of economic neglect and <Col N="1070" /> mismanagement is high.  Our unemployment rate is very high, dishearteningly high, although it is dropping.  We have a high level of emigration which I am sure will be referred to in this debate.  I have read the ESRI report and the most worrying aspect is the outflow of profit from the public sector of which only £200 million out of £700 million was invested in this country.  That is wrong and should be corrected.  The rest of the money, £500 million, went abroad.  This is serious and it must be causing concern to the Government.  I know the Minister will comment on that when he is replying.</P>
      <P>The investment of all of this money in our country is an essential part of our recovery programme.  The companies and individuals concerned may argue that money cannot be made in Ireland but I think this is untrue because industry in this country, as we all know, is in receipt of and has been in receipt of very attractive incentives and grants.  The Government are taking tough decisions which are bringing the economy around.  I believe that the profit makers should also do their bit by reinvesting in Ireland, creating jobs and making further profits, thus ensuring that we all benefit.  The tragedy of so many young people going abroad to seek employment is, if you like, a blight on our nation and we must see to it that it stops as quickly as possible. One way of doing that is to keep all our profits here to work for all of us.  I will welcome the Minister's comments when he replies to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could talk about the importance of the Finance Bill for a long time and we will have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.  I am quite certain that the people of Ireland know what must be done and they know what the Government are doing to deal with the critical situation in which we find ourselves.  A majority of our people understand what is required to put the present difficult period behind us.  I believe very strongly that they will support the Government in their efforts, whatever the difficulties may be for them, as long as they are satisfied that the Government have a <Col N="1071" /> clear view of what they are about and will not be deflected by pressure from any quarter.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is important legislation. It will go a long way towards improving the economy in which we live and giving us a better country in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to this House again.  The Minister will remember that it was my contribution on the Appropriations Bill before Christmas that triggered his now well known aggravated response in the House to views that did not necessarily agree with his own.  It was well recorded and well used afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the reason for the Minister's outburst was never recorded by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not provoke him again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be as provocative but I still have worries.  I will be honest and say that the Minister's response was welcomed generally by right wing economists and by people who have that viewpoint and see themselves as being in a privileged category.  They complain about the tax system but they have all the facilities in the world for avoiding the due process of paying tax. They also feel that, in the event of their ever requiring services, they are wealthy enough to provide them for themselves. They are in a privileged position but they have a total disregard for the ordinary people who have a tremendous record of paying their fair share of tax and are the sufferers always in an economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment &mdash; neither did the Labour Party &mdash; that there is not a crisis in our finances to be addressed. When the Labour Party were in Government we played a responsible role in trying to ensure that a balance was struck between the widespread disregard <Col N="1072" /> of the public finances and the services that were required.  The Minister and his colleagues who are now in Cabinet advocated a total disregard for the economic crisis and week after week made continuing demands for additional expenditure in areas that concerned us.  That is the politics of the game.  Now that the position is reversed the Minister has adopted his new role with a magnificence that has not been witnessed in the political arena in this country in the past. The Minister has had a tremendous conversion and has managed to convert some of his colleagues to his way of thinking. The results are there.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the Finance Bill stated that, &ldquo;despite the tough budget, GNP grew by over 4 per cent, one of the best growth rates in the EC. Industrial production rose by 10 per cent and exports grew by 15 per cent in volume terms.  The current account of the balance of payments moved into surplus for the first time in 20 years and inflation fell to almost 3 per cent &mdash; its lowest level since the mid-sixties.  Interests rates tumbled to their lowest level in ten years.  This was a major turnaround from the situation a year previously.&rdquo;  The Minister spoke about confidence and referred to these figures he feels are the result of what this Government have done by way of approaching foreign borrowing and lessening the dependence by the State on borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that will continue this year, but he said: &ldquo;Private investment should also advance significantly this year.&rdquo;  I am suggesting &mdash; and I know the Minister will disagree with me &mdash; that the private sector will never respond to this climate he has created for them.  Our experience in the past has been that the private sector has not responded.  The private sector has only responded to profits and has had no regard whatsoever for the provision of services for the less well off.  That is an unfortunate thing to have to say.  That is the experience we had in the past in and out of Government when we have talked about a real effort to reform the tax system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> In 1973 when we were in Government with Fine Gael we suggested broadening the tax net into other areas in the private sector particularly.  The question of the payment of income tax by farmers was opposed vociferously by Fianna Fáil at the time.  We felt that there was a genuine need for that industry to make its contribution to the Exchequer.  Nobody denied the economic importance of the farming sector.  We were the first to advocate that they should pay something to the Exchequer to help us to run the affairs of this country.  We were also responsible for the concept of a wealth tax which the Minister and his colleagues dropped immediately on assuming office.</P>
    <P>Nowadays other parties talk about the possibility of a wealth tax in a major reveiw of the tax system.  We have always believed that wealthy people should pay their fair share to the State and the Exchequer.  It has been proven that there are people out there creating wealth for themselves by shuffling paper and money throughout the international money markets, creating no employment for anybody in Ireland in the process and making relatively little contribution to the economic life of this country.  Those with land, wealth and property have their responsibilities in the everyday affairs of this country.  We have an abundance of land which is now locked into the EC system and it is forbidden to produce outside certain quotas.  We have a certain amount of expertise.  We have entrepreneurs who succeeded mostly abroad, unfortunately. We have a reasonable number of wealthy people who have the ability to avoid making their contribution.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck in his efforts at self-assessment.  It is a marvellous system if people are honest with themselves, with their neighbours and with their country and recognise their responsibilities in this area.  It would be fantastic if people did not have to be chased by sheriffs or brow-beaten by assessment officers from the Revenue Commissioners who have surrounded the question of income tax with a level of odium that never existed in the past.  This crazy system of having exaggerated <Col N="1074" /> assessments sent out meant that none was taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The assessment always went into the waste-paper basket because people just looked at it with incredulity and said: &ldquo;This could not possibly be my tax obligation to the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If you did not avail of a late appeal system, or appeal the assessment from the Revenue Commissioners, you were in default and whether you owed the amount assessed or not, you finally ended up not only paying it, but paying interest on it.  That is why there are lists as long as a week of people who are in trouble. There are stories about the tax collecting sheriffs, the problems they have had, and how they cleaned out whole businesses. You wonder how the taxpayer allowed himself to get into that situation.  I submit that it results from this extraordinary system of assessment by the Revenue Commissioners.  I say that having listened to people on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Irish are notoriously negligent about completing tax forms.  The amazing thing is that when Irish people talk about taxation, they are talking about somebody else paying tax.  I am defending a section in the community, the PAYE sector, who always paid their share of taxation.  They have paid 90 per cent of the total tax take and continue to do so. They have protested and have marched in the streets of this capital in the process. They have looked not for a lessening of their own share but a sharing of the load by others which no Government have yet had the courage to achieve.  At least Fine Gael have put up an option on how to share this load.  I agree that it has been subjected to critical analysis because it has not been made clear who will pay more so that other sections can pay less.</P>
    <P>It is very popular to say that as many people as possible should pay tax at 25 per cent but, if we are to maintain some level of service for the people, we have to say what other sector should be paying more. That is where the problem lies because that is where the vested interests are.  We should ask the vested interests at the private sector level to pay more whether <Col N="1075" /> by way of property tax, wealth tax, capital gains or whatever.  They do not want to pay more, but they would like to see the working man paying tax, the man who has always paid his fair share, and more than his fair share.  What happens to him as a taxpayer?  He finds that this Minister and this Government, with the acknowledged support and acquiescence of other people, have agreed to cut the services.  It is not stated in the Finance Bill but, because of the tax levels and the cuts introduced by the Minister for Finance, taxpayers in the PAYE net have found that all the services they have contributed towards are being withdrawn. Health, education, social welfare, local authorities, local government services, all the services which affect ordinary people have been curtailed, stopped or withdrawn, but their taxes are still high, higher than they were when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>Last year the PAYE sector alone paid £330 million extra.  It is not a bad score for a Minister who is anxious to ensure that the national debt is reduced.  He has reduced it; he has cut off the services; he has increased taxation on PAYE workers.  Why could he not do it?  A child from second class could do it in those circumstances.  In other words, if you do not have a priority, and if you do not ensure the provision of health services, school services and social welfare services for people who are incapable of working or unable to get work, you can actually cut where you like; you can increase taxes on the people you know cannot escape and you can have the occasional list of the private sector defaulters.  The best of luck to the Minister in his plan for self-assessment. It is worth while giving it a trial.  I will not condemn it, but I will keep my options open on it.  It could be no worse and probably will be better than the present system of the taxman doing an assessment of what other people owe or what he feels they owe in such a way that he actually frightens them.</P>
    <P>The Minister can also do what the Prime Minister in a neighbouring country <Col N="1076" /> has done.  She has keyed everything into the zone of inflation, interest rates, GNP and everything else, and you can forget the other side of the equation.  The answer in most of the economies where this has been done has been that, if you can get all these things right, you should benefit the private sector and stimulate investment but somehow there is a missing factor.  Somehow it has not created employment; it has not increased employment.  There have been some increases in the technological areas but there has been a net increase in Britain, in the North of Ireland and in Ireland, in the unemployment figures.  No matter how we balance our books, if the end result is that we have additional people dependent on those who are producing, our equation can go wrong.  The unemployment figures at present in this country vary from month to month and you can have all sorts of different interpretations of them by all sorts of people, depending on which political party you listen to and depending on which newspaper you read.  The unemployment figures are up and down but generally we all accept that they are too high.</P>
    <P>There is massive emigration from this country.  It is a free country and people should be able to come and go as they like, but we are making a major investment in young people, in their education and in their well-being while they are here.  We should make an effort to ensure that there is a job for them at the end of the road, if at all possible, in their own country where they would be happier and safer than if they have to emigrate by necessity.  Anybody you talk to in any rural town in Ireland can string out names of people who has been customers of theirs or had been companions in clubs and football teams and otherwise, who have gone.  People are beginning to say: &ldquo;There are 25 gone out of town in the past month&rdquo;.  We all know they are not just gone on holidays this time; they have actually emigrated.  That is tragic.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in this Finance Bill that will address this problem and if there is, I apologise, because I have not seen it.  I have looked at it and I have <Col N="1077" /> read it with interest because I had hoped that when the Minister produced his budget this year there would be some major initiative.  A figure of 20,000 jobs was mentioned in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and now the Congress of Trade Unions are becoming quite seriously unhappy about the fact that there is no evidence yet of any of these jobs coming on stream.</P>
    <P>The only improvement we seem to have in job numbers is in the social employment scheme.  It is a great scheme and it gets people off the dole and into the workplace.  So long as it is not used to replace existing workers, it is an excellent scheme.  I compliment all the local authorities throughout the country, including my own, and other community people who use the scheme to try to attack the scourge of this nation in this century, that is, the scourge of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have an argumentative debate with the Minister but I was pleased that he dropped the silly tax that he had on the bank cash dispensing cards. Apart from anything else which was a source of getting money I felt the card system was a move in the right direction in that we could coax people to have their wages paid into banks and that they could withdraw cask in their own time, safely, without transporting cash throughout the country as payrolls which figured in bank robberies to fund other enterprises.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased that the Minister saw the light and ensured that the requirements of the disabled drivers were recognised. Here, the Minister at least sat down and listened to other people's views in this area.  When he comes to design his budget the Minister does so in consultation with the officials of his own Department and the heads of other Departments and with his colleagues in Cabinet but democracy ensures that, between that time and the introduction of the Finance Bill, further views can prevail at times and all of us defend that. If he had to abolish the tax on these bank cards we accept that he did have to get the additional revenue.  I have no qualms of conscience in asking the banking sector to recompense the Minister for the £6 <Col N="1078" /> million he lost as a result.  At least the industry making the profits in this area has been asked to make a contribution and that is how it should be.  Otherwise, we were taxing unfortunate people, in particular young people and working people, on the facility to withdraw their own money.  That to me, was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that one of the errors he made on assuming office was the abolition of the land tax.  I will not let that go because in the long term and in the overall it would have been considered to have been the better type of income tax or tax for farmers.  Any farming organisations we have met in the meantime have agreed that that type of taxation could not be seen to be a disincentive to production.  Land tax was accepted by small farmers as a means of identifying at the beginning of the year what their contributions should be to the State at the end of the year, or by whatever instalments were decided on.  Unfortunately, because of a political promise made during the election, it was decided to abolish it.</P>
    <P>I know there were vested interests in the farming sector who wanted to have it abolished.  Of course there were.  Any time any sector feel a tax that will suddenly hit them they use their considerable influence on a sympathetic, prospective Minister in the hope that he will say: &ldquo;If this is one way of getting additional votes, let us try it.&rdquo;  I was sorry that he went for it; I know he made the same commitment on the DIRT tax but, having examined the figures, he realised that it would have been naïve to have removed the DIRT tax.  He now sees it as a reasonably fair system of direct interest-related tax on unearned income.  For various sectors it can be claimed back.  It removes this anomaly of four bank accounts per head of the population.</P>
    <P>Somebody worked that out as one of the relevant figures, an indication of widespread misuse of facilities having separate deposits in every town and village in Ireland to avoid paying tax on an unearned income.  In any other democracy, it would certainly be considered as <Col N="1079" /> income and should play its role in assisting the State to provide the services I have talked about as being a major Government responsibility.  That is why I object to the process of indiscriminate cuts as they have become infamously known.  It seems to be all right to say that we have to close the hospital here, there or anywhere else, or sack the staff, give them voluntary redundancy, or any of the other options which have been offered simply because we cannot borrow any more.  If it was as simple as that, at least people would have the option.  We do not have the political will to really address the whole system of taxation and the widening of the tax net so that everybody, in particular the special interests I have talked about, could contribute to the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have always said &mdash; and the figures will stand up &mdash; that the PAYE sector are not included in this Bill.  They would dearly love to have had some recognition given to them by the Minister in this Finance Bill.  They could have expected something a little bit better than what he offered them.  The Explanatory Memorandum outlines nominal increases in allowances the Minister has given &mdash; £100 in single allowances, £200 for a married couple.  They are just tokens, if you like, in recognition of the fact that he has not really done anything for them because he would have to address himself to the whole area of tax reform before he could give anything decent.  Things are improving a bit and he wants to be seen to be giving something.</P>
    <P>These increased allowances are certainly not what the trade union movement would have expected, having entered into the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  They certainly will be the subject of a recommendation from our party which the Minister should consider seriously if we are to be constructive in relation to the people who have always paid.  As I said last year in the debate on the Finance Bill in this House, it is like being invited to the wedding when the bride has already gone on the honeymoon. That is one of the difficulties for <Col N="1080" /> the Seanad in discussing the Finance Bill. We have the power to make recommendations only and the Government have sufficient voting power to make sure that they do not have to listen to our recommendations.  It means that whatever we are saying now &mdash; if the Minister has not gone to Europe &mdash; might be considered in the next budget.  If he does go to Europe, I wish him the best of luck, anyway, because I would say he would be capable of doing that job as well as he has done this one &mdash; the best of luck to him.  He is a man after my own heart: he knows what he wants and goes after it when he can.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the taxation of VHI payments.  May I ask one question?  Many doctors are not satisfied with the VHI fee.  It is commonly known that when you go to doctors now, even with VHI cover, they say: &ldquo;VHI will not cover my fee&rdquo;.  They protect themselves immediately by saying: &ldquo;I will be charging you a little more, no matter what the VHI board give you&rdquo;.  Now that the State is making payments directly to the consultants involved of fees accepted and agreed with the VHI board initially what will be the position?  This group of people are not in a category who suffered during all the economic crises we have had, and they have done relatively well.  They complain quite a lot at health board level &mdash; those of them who are represented &mdash; as if they have suffered, but the fact remains that they are one of the privileged groups in society.  They are a very important group and, as Senator Bulbulia rightly said, a group to whom people will literally pay anything to be cured.  I suppose there is a price to be paid for anything and you literally would pay any price if you were going to be cured of some serious illness or disease by the intervention of these people.</P>
    <P>I am now looking for clarification.  If the VHI are paying this money directly to the consultant, is that to be taken as a full and final settlement of the consultant's bill to the customer, to the person having the operation?  If not, and if the consultant feels there is an additional payment due, is the Minister <Col N="1081" /> recommending that the patient might also stop the tax and transmit it to his office?  In other words, should all these payments have this retention tax deducted and claimed back afterwards or held to the credit of the consultants who would argue that they are paying taxes as PAYE persons, generally speaking?</P>
    <P>There is definitely a difference between consultants and their charges and people in the GMS system.  In the GMS system with the arrangements that are in place with the Department of Health, all these doctors produce a tremendously cost-effective service. These arrangements are different for them because they are expected to provide all the capital investment in practice, facilities, equipment, motor cars, reception and telephone facilities.  All of these are included in the price of the GMS agreed figures from which the Minister now deducts tax at the source of payment, disregarding all the other costs which are there.  Or is any allowance made for these other costs that we know are there?  If not, the principle is wrong.</P>
    <P>There should be some acceptance that doctors have to make capital investments in practices where there may be two or three doctors.  Before they get anything now through the GMS service, this tax is stopped at source and no recognition is given &mdash; initially anyway &mdash; to the expenditure involved in putting a practice together.  That is true also of dentists. These are groups of people who have quite a lot of capital investment, unlike a solicitor, who can literally buy a nameplate, stick it over the door, get a chair and a desk and he is off.  Apart from the motor car to drive to the court, that is all his capital outlay.  A medical practitioner, veterinary practitioner, or dentist, must buy a lot of expensive equipment which must be taken into account.  I feel quite sure, as as matter of principle, that the Minister would want to be reminded at least of this requirement.</P>
    <P>I want to touch briefly on the construction industry.  If any industry felt disadvantaged by the arrival of this Government into power, it is the construction industry.  They really and honestly <Col N="1082" /> believed that once Fianna Fáil got back in to office they were made for life. In the past this industry benefited from the generosity of Governments.  They accepted it, they always publicly stated they had it; they voted accordingly in successive elections.  They were generous in their funding of the Minister's party which, I suppose, is to be understood and accepted if they benefited to that extent. They certainly have felt since the present Government got into office this time that the industry has been let down.  Many promises were made to them during election campaigns which were never honoured. The construction industry, even in the area of public construction, has been left out of subsequent Government capital programmes whether they were hospitals, replacement hospitals, new schools, or local authority houses.  The public capital programme has been decimated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the construction industry and their concern.  I am not just representing the views of the industry because they are made available to all Members of the House, irrespective of party affiliation.  I have listened to the ordinary contractor at constituency level. Those people in the past had been reasonably busy particularly with reconstruction grants initiated by the last Government and the new house grants and reconstruction grants which required the applicant to prove that a legitimate builder was being employed and that his VAT and tax payments were in order.  This was a boost to the building industry, especially for the legitimate building industry.  The abolition of those grants has done immense damage to the ordinary, small registered legitimate contractor and his enterprise.  I listen to them on a daily basis admitting that they have to let people go because they have no work for them.</P>
      <P>New house building seems to have slowed down particularly with the announcement by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, of the new house purchase option available to local authority tenants.  It is a great scheme for the local authority tenants and we all welcome it and wait with bated breath for the 1988 valuations which will be put on houses.  Until those valuations are known, we will not know how generous or otherwise this new tenant purchase scheme will be.  It has affected the building industry.  Local authority tenants if at all possible availed of opportunities to better themselves particularly in the area of housing.  The removal of the £5,000 special grant to move from a local authority house into either a secondhand house or a new house was an incentive for activity in the building sector that created employment for building industry workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a widespread belief that the Minister would reduce the VAT rate on the building industry to a level of 10 per cent.  That might have made some contribution to the problem but, unfortunately, it did not happen and, as a result, the building industry is now in a <Col N="1084" /> dilemma and see no light at the end of the tunnel.  They see nothing in this Finance Bill to stimulate employment; no local authority house building programme for the majority of our councils; some money to continue existing starts but very few, if any, new starts.</P>
    <P>There has been an argument by various councils that they have a surplus of houses.  I will accept that if that is so it may mean that one council could afford to wait until next year for a capital allocation but that is not true of all councils who still have long lists of people waiting to be rehoused; people who are entitled to be housed.  Under the 1947 Labourers Cottages Act they are entitled to be considered by the local authority for housing because they are incapable of providing houses for themselves.  I am sure Senator Brendan Ryan will deal with this issue and the whole question of homeless people and people who are in desperate need of having their housing conditions improved.  These are the areas of the construction industry for which because of the capital programme reduction I see no prospect in the future unless something unforeseen happens.</P>
    <P>I hope something will happen because it is an industry that has given a lot of employment in the past and whenever we as public representatives see building activity in any area, we recognise it as a vote of confidence in the area.  We all welcome it no matter what the building is.  Within the planning restrictions as laid down it is good to see things being produced and built whether they are houses, or factories, or whatever.  The State has a major role in the national building programme, both in relation to roads and the production of houses, hospitals and other such public buildings.</P>
    <P>The amnesty offered by the Minister for tax defaulters is a matter that I have dealt with briefly because I know that particular sector have been lackadaisical, to say the least, about how they treated their tax responsibility.  Hopefully, the Minister's initiative will have the desired effect.  If there are people out there who owe money and do not avail of this amnesty by the end of September they <Col N="1085" /> will be subject to considerable tax contributions to the State.  Is it necessary for people to apply in the interim period to be considered?  Is it expected that people will voluntarily apply or will they get a notice from the Revenue Commissioners referring to the announcement and saying: &ldquo;This is your option: do you want to take it?  Yes or no?&rdquo;, or are they expected to contact the revenue officials? Many of these defaulters do not even accept that they owe the money in the first place.  We will have to break down that barrier and if the move gets in money that is due, congratulations to the Minister because that money should have been paid just as PAYE moneys are always paid.</P>
    <P>I have looked with interest at the financial centre the Government are producing on the docks site and I want to congratulate the Taoiseach on his recent efforts in the United States to trigger off further interest in that project which, from what we have been told, was beginning to lag.  Somehow or another there was a lack of interest in spite of the tremendous incentives that obviously were being offered to the financial sector and institutions in this country and outside it.  We would like to have an update on how things are going, whether it is coming on stream as expected and what contribution, apart from the investment in the area, the project will make to the overall economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous reservations about the designation of areas under the urban renewal programme.  I now see that corporations who have made legitimate application to the Minister for the Environment for inclusion in these urban renewal programmes have been put on the back burner.  They have been put on &ldquo;hold&rdquo; and, because of the incentive that is being given to some areas, other areas with legitimate urban renewal to carry out are suffering from the disadvantage of not having been in the favoured few at the beginning.  If I talk about the favoured few I refer to the extension of this scheme to areas that could not to any extent be considered for urban renewal; they are urban development.  To extend a scheme <Col N="1086" /> like that, which was a good scheme, into other areas for urban development was not providing the type of incentive I had hoped this scheme was about.  I would love to see this scheme being used by genuine urban areas, local authorities like those in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, who had specific projects in mind and where a small incentive like this would be a tremendous advantage.  They have to compete with the chosen few who were included in the first bunch and with the additional ones announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was with the Minister recently when meeting one of these applicant local authorities. He indicated that he is now in such a state with the scheme that it is unlikely to be continued.  It has really got out of control, because everybody now wants to get it.  Suddenly you will find that Ireland &mdash; as we are seen in the Community &mdash; will be one designated area and that the whole lot of it needs to be renewed.  A new look is needed at the way we are going, so that the favoured few will not always be the beneficiaries from Finance Bills or from successive Governments, or in any change in the tax structure which is a genuine effort to reorganise the whole tax code, as we understand it.</P>
    <P>The sooner we start off the process of dialogue about this the better.  The problem in Opposition and still almost in Government &mdash; which Fine Gael are &mdash; is that they have to get the agreement of the Government party who like to have control of the reins.  They do not want to have to go back to all-party committees to have discussions about Government policy, but that is what a democracy is about.  When you have a minority Government it is extremely difficult to govern it with any credibility.  When you do come up with what is a popular suggestion about the reduction of the tax bands, the immediate response is from the PAYE sector who would love to feel that there was a hope in the future for a reduction to 25 per cent.  With an educated electorate &mdash; the only way you can now get away with that type of suggestion is to put the total package together.  You <Col N="1087" /> must be able to say: &ldquo;This is where we would get the £500 million or £600 million that will be required to give this recompense to the PAYE sector,&rdquo; which is, as everybody agrees, the over-taxed sector of our community.</P>
    <P>All the demands for changes in the tax code have come from the other sector in the hope that, whatever else might be given, they somehow would be given the opportunity to pay less in the future.  I have never once heard them express concern for the actual worker who had his tax removed from his pay before he ever sees it.  I know the Minister will admit that that sector has been &mdash; to say the least &mdash; generous in the past with all Governments.  Naturally, they had a right to question how the money was spent. They also had a right to ask questions when additional tax was demanded from them, as happened last year.  In spite of that, the Minister curtailed the services to which they felt they were legitimately entitled.  They had paid for them.  Other legislation was brought in which even increased their contributions by way of health levies, health charges and hospital charges, all which have been covered previously under PRSI.</P>
    <P>We have to be honest with people.  We cannot do the three-card trick every day of the week.  The PAYE sector have had about enough of it.  They feel they have made a major contribution.  They feel their services have been decimated because the Minister wants to do something with his balance of payments.  In spite of all our efforts and the Minister's excellent figures he has to admit that we still borrowed more money this year.  I saw a projection from his Department some years ago which showed that it will be about another four years, with our present trends, without any additional borrowing, before the repayments on existing commitments will be down.  That is not just because the Minister did anything great last year or this year, or the fact that this Government took office.</P>
    <P>This is happening because we were all realistic.  We realised that we could not continue borrowing if we could not afford <Col N="1088" /> to pay it back.  There are two ways of doing something.  You can borrow &mdash; which most of us agree is the wrong way of doing it &mdash; or you can continue to give the service and make the sector who have not been contributing to the coffers help to pay for it.  That is the realistic way to do it.  It can be politically unpopular but, if we are being honest with ourselves in reaching a consensus, that is how it should be done.  One way to do it is by at least doing something with the tax code.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation published two reports.  The Minister's predecessor from his party and predecessors from other parties have always pointed to these Commission reports.  It is popular to do that at public meetings.  The reality is that we would be unable to implement any of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation without a tremendous change in our whole attitude to tax and taxation.  What is now exempt would be taxed in the future. Each Minister claims some little credit for little moves made in the tax area. They claim that such a move was mentioned in the report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I accept the warning that the Minister voiced about 1992, the Single European Act and the integrated policy that is being talked about now by everybody.  He is asked every day to explain to us what this will mean.  I suppose he will assure us that, like joining the Community, things will not be any easier for any of us. Nothing will be cheaper than it is now, although various sectors will feel that, with a levelling off of all the taxes across all the boundaries, products that are twice as expensive here in comparison with Britain, Germany or France will all be the same price.  I suppose, knowing the Minister, that he will make sure that his take for the State will be the same. Otherwise, there would be a loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Usually when there is a loss to the Exchequer, the poor suffer most because their services are withdrawn, or the PAYE sector are expected to make up the difference.  Until the Minister convinces me that other sectors will have to <Col N="1089" /> make their contribution to lighten the burden with the changes that will take place, I will fear that the situation will worsen for working people, poor people, people in need of work, and for hospitals, schools and for social welfare beneficiaries. The year 1992 could bring some tremendous changes.  Our experience in the past has been that, when changes take place across the spectrum of taxation, such as border taxation and Customs and Excise levies, usually the people who suffer most are the people in the lower financial categories.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will show some initiative in starting a debate, and also moving in Finance Bills between now and 1992, to take account of what will happen.  The differences he itemised have been of the order of £400 million or £500 million.  Many of us said this would happen.  The Minister suggested in the Referendum debate one of the advantages would be doing away with all of these borders.  They are not really there any more, but they are there from a taxation point of view.  They are there for the traveller and for the tourist.  They are there for the worker and for the emigrants.</P>
    <P>This Government have a major responsibility.  I do not see any evidence of it in the 1988 Finance Bill, except where the Minister refers to it briefly. That is my contribution at Second Stage. I will have some recommendations on Committee Stage, particularly in the area of increasing allowances within the existing bands in the whole area of taxation. I will be debating the various recommendations in further detail with the Minister and I hope I will not be too argumentative in the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill lends itself to detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  On that Stage I propose to go into more detaile so I will be brief in what I have to say on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to focus on the success of the Government's economic strategy to date and to make some comment on the vexed area of taxation.  One of the more encouraging developments in this country at <Col N="1090" /> present is the widespread understanding of the need for control of the public finances.  I do not want to go over the sorry legacy left by the Coalition Government during their four years or so in office.  Suffice to say that when Fianna Fáil took office a little over a year ago there was a crisis in the public finances, as the Minister underlined in his opening remarks.  There were record taxation levels and a record level of national debt. To compound the problems facing the country, the economy was practically at a standstill and confidence, that important ephemeral quality so necessary for economic growth and success, was at a very low ebb and it meant that very little investment was made.  The Government on taking office faced the challenge head on by taking charge of the management of the economy.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry characterised that courage and competence in tackling the issues facing the country.  Confidence is vital for investment and economic growth.</P>
    <P>The necessary cuts have been severe in places but there has been widespread support for the general thrust of Government policy.  Some of the savings effected over the past year have been painful.  Was there any realistic alternative?  Nobody has come up with one.  Senator Ferris referred to infamous cuts but did not offer any realistic alternative to them. The savings or cuts have been distributed across the board but there has been special attention given to the less well off people in the community.  The Fianna Fáil Party have a history of caring and compassion in relation to the disadvantaged and the less well off.  In very difficult circumstances this year, social welfare levels have been more than maintained and better than that for the longer term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The basic question at this point, one year or so after the Government took office, is whether the tough and difficult decisions that have been taken were worth while.  What is there to show for them?  The unequivocal answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the following reasons.  The key yardstick of the level of borrowing has shown <Col N="1091" /> a drop as a consequence of Government control of public expenditure.  Furthermore, the most recently published Exchequer returns in respect of the first quarter of 1988 indicate that the Government are fully on course to achieve the budget targets for this year.  There is also some other encourging news and indicators. Gross national product in 1987, as the Minister pointed out, grew by 4 per cent.  Exports were up by 15 per cent in volume terms and industrial production rose by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The correction of the public finances on the economic front is a pre-requisite to developing further opportunities for job creation and improving services generally. Further proof of the correctness of the Government's approach in budgetary strategy is reflected explicitly in falling interest rates.  Confidence in the domestic economy enabled the Central Bank to cut interest rates, which was followed by a reduction in the inter-bank and associated bank rates.  Inflation and prices are dear to all our hearts.  They are important to everybody.  Our inflation rate is now below the European Community average and the projection of an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent for 1988 is particularly encouraging.</P>
    <P>In addition to the economic measures, at times tough, that have been taken, there are incentives in this Bill for the construction industry.  There are specific incentives for the Custom House development and so forth.  The income tax concessions in the budget, together with lower interest and inflation rates provide the climate for a substantial increase in the volume of private investment. Senator Ferris referred to the profit motive being the dominant consideration for private industry.  He is right.  Why would they be in business otherwise?  If they are profitable they contribute to economic growth and there is then that extra wealth available for distribution.  Through increased wealth, there are more funds available for distribution among the services, like health, social welfare and education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The budgetary strategy has led to tangible, desirable results but impressive as these results are, there is still quite a way to go.  Our export performance is particularly encouraging which underlines the need to sell our goods and services abroad at even keener prices.  There is cut throat competition in the trading of international goods and services and we have to be that bit more competitive and have that edge.  The agreement on pay contained within the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is of central importance to budgetary strategy and in particular to competitiveness, not least because salaries and wages represent 80 per cent of gross national product.  Furthermore, pay represents almost half of Exchequer expenditure.  Vigilance is necessary to ensure that only the pay terms of the agreement are awarded.  We have only to remind ourselves that public service pay for 1986 exceeded the target in the Coaltion Government proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i> by £127 million.  This figure was largely responsible for the massive over-run on the current budget deficit in that year.  The fact that the social partners have committed themselves to the pay agreement and the fact that inflation is now at a low level, together with the significant income tax reliefs in the Finance Bill, should mean that pay levels will remain within the limits agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>As a PAYE taxpayer, in common with others I am concerned about take-home pay.  Whatever about advocating, as I do, staying within the pay limits agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there is the question of taxation and its equity. There is general agreement that the rates of income tax in Ireland are too high, and that they are a source of disincentive.  I should add that the Government have gone a considerable distance in this Finance Bill in respect of income tax. Senator Ferris referred to the very modest changes in tax in the Finance Bill but I would remind him that the undertaking on behalf of the Government in the agreed <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> this year was a tax relief of £30 million.  The Finance Bill <Col N="1093" /> more than trebles that to a figure of £91 million.  He talks about the token sums given by way of relief.  The figures in the Finance Bill in a full year will cost £152 million.  There is nothing token about that.</P>
    <P>The taxation measures in the budget this year will bring 60 per cent of taxpayers on to the standard rate.  The Government target is to bring 66? of taxpayers on to the standard rate, so considerable progress has been made there. It is an impressive achievement to go that far but nobody is denying that there is a long way to go in terms of tax reform.  It is a very urgent problem and will get the undivided attention of the Government in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill for the first time for several years provides a reduction in tax for those on higher rates.  The latest Fine Gael proposals on taxation propose to reduce tax rates to 40 per cent and 25 per cent.  We would all agree with that, but it raises the question of where the money would come from.  It would cost £600 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the begrudging attitude of other parties in relation to their policy proposals on taxation. It would be fair to say that in the Minister's opening address here today, and otherwise, he has been making a plea for realism rather than knocking the proposals for the sake of knocking them. There is a proposal that there should be an all-party committee on taxation but at the end of the day it is the Government's job to make taxation changes and they have the specific responsibility and they are expected by the people who elected them to take on that responsibility and to act on it.  From the action that has been taken in this Finance Bill, an important start has been made and I hope it will be kept up.</P>
    <P>The Government are on the right track but they cannot be deflected from the imperative of continuing to deal with the borrowing and debt problems.  Indeed, the most recent Central Bank report calls for further cuts in Government expenditure. Nobody likes cuts, but in keeping on the essential course in the interests of <Col N="1094" /> the country, further cuts will be necessary. The Government recognise the need to reduce the levels of taxation as quickly as possible, so that initiative and enterprise will get a further boost which is obviously needed.</P>
    <P>I share the view that significant progress is made through the Bill before us in respect of income tax, corporation tax and capital taxation.  Furthermore, the Minister's reforming approach is also evident in tackling the problem of tax evasion, tax collection and enforcement.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record that I congratulate the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, on the courage and competence he has shown in the Finance portfolio.  I would also like to congratulate the Government on the courage and determination they have shown in doing their duty for the country.  This duty continues to require tough and difficult but fair decisions which must be taken in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fallon said that the Government were turning around the economy now after years of mismanagement. I hope he was including the years 1977 to 1981 because that was the real period of mismanagement when the problems were caused.  I am surprised at Senator Hillery ignoring that point and saying that the Government faced a financial crisis.  They did not.  The Government that came into office in 1981 did face a financial crisis.  The proof of that is that before they left Government the Administration of 1977 to 1981 rushed out a document, <i>The Way Forward,</i> to counteract that financial crisis. At that time the proportion of our debt borrowing in relation to gross national product was running at roughly 19 per cent.  I admit that it is down now to roughly 8 per cent, and this year could be down to 6 per cent.  That was the real crisis that faced this country at that time. That is the quagmire out of which we have been trying to pull ourselves ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the ways in which monetary policies influence the real economy is through the impact of interest rates.  The <Col N="1095" /> benefit of lower interest rates for the private and public sectors is very important, but there are other wider issues which must be taken into account. Interest rates must be kept at a level which maintains a flow of savings which are necessary to fund the financial needs of the economy, but at the same time they must be sufficient to protect the exchange rate.  With the mobility of international capital, domestic interest rates have to be kept at the level of interest rates existing abroad.  Interest rate reductions can only hold up if they have been earned through sound monetary policy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has left the House because I read recently in the financial columns of one of our papers that there is now a very good chance that agreement will be found on the free flow of capital between countries that are in the EC.  I understand that this could take place by 6 June next.  I would like to know what safeguards the Minister is seeking for our country and what financial impact this will have on our economy.</P>
    <P>This country has suffered over the last number of years from borrowing, borrowing which has not been well spent.  It has not been well spent for the benefit of the country.  We have indulged in living standards which the economy could not afford.  We must also bear in mind that we had to be build certain social structures over the last number of years due to an increase in population &mdash; schools, houses, etc., but the debt itself has left a very heavy burden in the form of taxation without conferring on the country any other real benefits, such as growth in employment.  Indeed, it has had the opposite effect.  It is undermining growth in employment.  I understand that one-tenth of our national output is required each year to meet the national debt requirements.  While improvements have been made &mdash; and we welcome these improvements &mdash; fiscal correction is not enough in itself.  I agree with the Minister that we are not, therefore, concerned with solving the budgetary and debt problems merely for their own sake, as some <Col N="1096" /> kind of detached or clinical exercise in accounting.  There must be initiatives in many other areas which will enhance employment prospects.  There must be a removal of disincentives, especially in relation to income tax.</P>
    <P>This country is now facing two types of emigration: one, people who emigrate out of necessity to seek employment, and the second, which has occurred over the last year or two, people who have good jobs here, are well paid, but are paying a very high rate of tax.  They see the low rate of tax levied abroad, especially in our neighbouring country, and they emigrate for that reason.  With the skills and education they have received here they are able to find employment in Great Britain at a much lower tax level than exists here. That must be a very expensive burden for the State to bear.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have tax reform. The Minister spoke about making available £152 million in this Finance Bill in order to reduce income tax which is hardly, he said, insignificant in our circumstances. I would like to point out to the House that in 1986 &mdash; probably in more difficult circumstances &mdash; the Government at the time made over £200 million available as a reduction in income tax, but it went unnoticed.  People who received their pay packets on the following 5 April saw little or no reduction in their income tax liability.  This was especially so in the case of single people. I am sure the same will apply here.  There will be a reduction of £152 million, but when that is broken down it will make very little impact.  We said that the tax reform that is necessary is a tax reform of a substantial size.  We did not say that taxation should be reduced by adding to our present borrowing but that it should be sought by widening the tax net and widening the tax base.</P>
    <P>I believe many people now acknowledge that there is a consensus between the three major parties in regard to tackling the national debt.  They accept that.  There is a maturity in politics in this country now that has been lacking for a long time.  People recognise that.  The <Col N="1097" /> national debt and its problems have been taken out of the political arena.  I believe that people wish that tax and tax-related problems could be taken out of the political arena.  That is what we are suggesting in our proposals &mdash; that an all-party committee should be set up to examine the proposals to see where we can widen the tax bases with agreement. The Minister said today he was open to dialogue but that seems strange when he would not consider setting up an all-party committee to examine the possibilities of reducing taxation substantially.  There are ways and methods of doing so and those ways and methods are not election manifestos.  It would have to be done over a period and the tax reductions would have to be so substantial that people would recognise them.  It would have to make a total difference to their weekly pay package.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Finance Bill, has brought back section 23 incentives.  Anything that can be done for the construction industry is to be welcomed. Indeed, the present Administration promised they would do a lot more than they are doing for the construction industry. The development of private accommodation, especially in cities, is to be encouraged.  I would like to see far more incentives being given to attract private rental accommodation to inner city areas, especially the city of Dublin where there are so many acres of dereliction.  A slight change has been made in the incentives for designated areas.  With the exception of the Customs House Docks site, there has not been much of an impact on other incentive areas in Dublin.  I do not know the reason for that.</P>
    <P>These incentives will have to be looked at if we are to have some revival in the city of Dublin.  I ask the Minister to take into consideration again the proposal that the incentive areas in the city of Dublin should have the same financial benefits and incentives as the Custom House Docks site.  It was a mistake to give special benefits to one area and not to others.  Now that the Custom House Docks site has got off the ground, so to speak, the Government should grasp the <Col N="1098" /> nettle and give the same incentives to the other designated areas in Dublin so that they will be developed.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned one matter which I would like to refer to, that is, the internal market.  The harmonisation of indirect taxes in the European Community, as part of the completion of the internal market by 1992, will have serious effects for Ireland.  The Minister referred to this matter in his speech.  I understand that he can seek compensation within the EC for the loss of revenue resulting from the harmonisation of indirect taxes.  It is interesting to note that the West German Minister is proposing that the Commission should exempt food and other essential goods from VAT.  The negotiations that will take place over the next few years on the harmonisation of taxes will be very important to this country because, as the Minister said, it involves £420 million in the first year and £350 million in the second year.  We all wish the Minister well in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The entire market offers great prospects for this country.  It offers great prospects for employment especially in the exporting industries.  I regret that there are no incentives in the Finance Bill towards gearing people to prepare for the internal market.  It is essential that we put that process into action straight away. I believe that this was one of the most attractive issues of the Single European Act.  There will be benefits from the single market and I regret there was not more emphasis on it in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some changes from the initial budget speech which he made.  I am glad that he has removed the proposed tax on bank cards.  This was a very foolish step for the Minister to take because there is a problem with the movement of money in this country at the moment.  Security is a real problem and the bank cards provide a form of security for people who can withdraw money from banks in that way.  Anything that can increase security should be encouraged.  The Minister has somewhat modified the once-off tax on pension funds and has exempted smaller pension <Col N="1099" /> funds, a matter about which I, and I am sure other Senators, received numerous representations.  Very small pension funds would have been seriously affected by that tax if it was allowed to go ahead.  I am glad the Minister had second thoughts and a change of heart on this matter.</P>
    <P>In summary, the last year has been a good year and some progress has been made.  It does not matter which side of the House we are on; we all want to see our country prosper.  We want to see more employment and a better standard of living for our people.  My party leader, in his Tallaght speech, stated clearly where we stand as a party.  As long as the Government's economic policies are directed towards these issues which I have just named, they will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few observations on the Finance Bill.  First as somebody who comes from a rural part of Ireland, from the west, I would like to compliment the Minister for Finance on the tremendous job he is doing for the country.  Indeed, I wonder how many people would be capable of carrying the burden he is carrying today.  That is not a question I would care to answer.  Most people, even those who are not involved in politics, are sufficiently concerned about the future to question our prospects of getting out of real financial difficulties.  The Minister, Deputy MacSharry, has been seen even by those who oppose him politically, as a strong Minister for Finance.  They recognise that this country would not turn the corner financially and would not sustain independence financially if we had not got people of the calibre of Deputy MacSharry.  That is recognised right across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Benefits are still to come from the corrective action that has been taken by the Minister for Finance.  The first benefit will accrue largely to the city of Dublin. Therefore, it is imperative that those of us who represent rural areas should continue to encourage and offer support to him.  There are already signs that the <Col N="1100" /> economy has turned the corner and that the prospects are not as gloomy as they were.  We recognise that financing a small economy like ours is a major operation and that the overheads and the administration in relation to the population are far out of proportion.  We recognised how necessary it was to bring in a redundancy package.  I would like to see that redundancy package extended and multiplied many times to unload our heavy administrative burden.  We should get rid of many of those people who have become complacent.  It is very hard to recognise the necessity for many of our senior civil servants.  It is important that the good work which has begun in removing some of the burden will continue because this is vital.  Rural areas still have to get substantial support for the infrastructure that is so necessary to have equality for those who are living in less favoured areas.</P>
    <P>The financing of local authorities is a major concern because they have not the machinery to raise sufficient finance themselves.  The Minister for Finance will have to continue for a number of years to take very drastic corrective measures. When I drive through the city, from here to Stillorgan and on to Bray and see local authority workers planting flowers, attending to gardens and building cut stone walls and then think of the west and Donegal, I ask myself if I am in the same country at all.  I am not a despondent or a gloomy person.  We have an obligation to encourage the Minister for Finance to continue on course until all areas are provided for equally, from Burtonport to Dún Laoghaire.  That is my simple message today to the Minister for Finance.  He is doing a tremendous job but he has only started.  I sincerely hope that he will be in office long enough to continue to deliver on the marathon task he has undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Government have found it necessary to examine the areas where there is duplication of administration.  They have found it necessary to abolish organisations, some of which I regret very much, such as the County Committees of Agriculture.  They should have been reorganised on a personal basis.  A lot of <Col N="1101" /> ground has to be made up in rural areas and the Minister has overall responsibility for this.  I am glad the duplication of administration has been tackled and that this task will continue because we will only get results and achieve the objective if duplication and waste are eliminated.  The Minister has set the right course.  The Government are 100 per cent on course and the polls show that is so. That automatically brings a reaction from those who are affected.  Everybody admires the Minister for Finance who has been rock solid.</P>
    <P>We also admire the Minister for Justice who stood up to people who wanted up to £42,000 a year.  I had no difficulty in telling the Minister to stand firm because, if he could not get people to work in the prison service for £42,000 a year, I could get him three people to work for the same amount and they would be very happy. People must stand up and say to individual Ministers and to the Government that they have only started their task and that the people living in rural Ireland expect them to continue regardless of whether it is popular or unpopular, regardless of whether they fail and are out-voted or whether they have to have a general election.  I am not out on the streets calling for one.</P>
    <P>There has to be a solid commitment and everybody has to accept and understand that the Government are not going to be deterred and are not going to turn back, that they are on the right course and the only course that can save this country from being totally sold out to somebody else.  It is natural, when you start to dismantle Departments and to make people redundant, that you will have a fight on your hands.  We have been so dependent on the few people who are working in this country at present that we could not have gone much further down the road without taking some corrective measures.</P>
    <P>Over the last year I listened to various people who have easy and simple solutions to our problems.  Everybody said we did not have to do it this way, we did not have to impose rod licences, we did not have to cut back on the teachers and <Col N="1102" /> we did not have to close any hospitals. Everybody has an answer and everybody thinks we could have tackled the problems differently.  The Government have a responsibility and not a very popular responsibility.  We cannot cut back and save without affecting and upsetting some people.</P>
    <P>I am sure that most of us hear very simplistic answers on all affairs programmes. Everything seems so easy when you are looking at the television and you are far removed from the problems. Every weekend we hear from people who have singular minds and attitudes and have simplistic answers about how all the ills of the country can be cured.  It is very amusing.  It is so farfetched that the ordinary people do not believe any of the current affairs programmes that come up with simplistic answers.  Many people, including quite a number of people from this House, appear on television and tell the country that we could tackle the problems in a simpler way, that we should not be taking such harsh measures and that we should be determined in our attitudes.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard somebody say it was a tragedy that we supported industrialists who came into this country because now we find they are leaving the country and taking very substantial amounts of money with them.  I do not think it is unreasonable for major companies that come here and invest money to take out that same money to meet the repayments on the money they borrowed in the first place to come in and set up industries.  If there is a belief that those people are taking out profits at the expense of the worker and that jobs are disappearing, or jobs are not being created, that is a complete misconception. The industrialists who have come here from abroad have done a great job.  They have encouraged Irish people to invest and to get involved in their own businesses and we should continue to support them.  We should not allow it to go unchallenged that people are taking money out of this country.  Industrialists who come here have a good record.  The Government should challenge those who are saying that the money they earn in <Col N="1103" /> this country is going out and that we have not benefited.  That has to be challenged and I suggest that we do so.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the development of the tourist industry.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Government in setting up the task force and the recommendations that were made by it.  The west, particularly County Donegal, has a potential to develop their tourist industry but they have not had a chance.  The west has not had the opportunity to develop in the same way as have the city of Dublin and the south.  At present there are many facilities in this city.  There are many transport services &mdash; Dublin Airport, DART, the ferry services and seven or ten trains a day from here to Cork.  The people of the west are right when they say they are not getting their fair share.  The tourist industry is the one area which can help increase living standards in the west.  I hope the Government will recognise the need for input to tourism development in the west. The area I come from has geographical disadvantages.  We have no train service, no major airports and no major ports.  I hope that, in improving the economy, those areas will be looked at.  We will find jobs for our young people only if we develop the industries which have the potential to be developed.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the tourism industry I want to say to the Minister, and I am totally convinced about this, that he must not turn back on the decision taken by the Government to impose a licence on rod fishing.  There must not be any diversion from the consistent programme of funding the fishing industry. There is a great deal of pollution in our lakes and rivers and it takes money to solve that problem.  Local authorities are faced with crises when rivers are polluted and they get the headlines.  The Government and the local authorities are expected to respond quickly and to provide the necessary money.  If there is no expenditure, no maintanence and no policing of rivers and lakes then the fishing industry is not worth anything to anybody. This is about the only country in <Col N="1104" /> Europe where fishing was free up to now. The people who are taking it on themselves to challenge the Government and who say, even today on the radio, that they would not negotiate until the proposals are withdrawn have to be met fairly and squarely.  The Bill has been introduced and under no circumstances should the Minister withdraw the rod licensing regulation.  I sincerely hope he will not do so.</P>
    <P>It is important for the people in rural Ireland, especially in County Donegal, that the Government stay on course. Only a Government who correct our financial difficulties will have any chance of providing jobs for our young people. In County Donegal about 20,000 young people are hoping to get jobs.  They will have no prospect of work in the future if the corrective measures are not taken by the Government and by those charged with responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have a map, which I have used many times, which refers to the census of population taken in 1981.  The black area along the Border, including County Donegal, shows the level of unemployed which has now reached 46 per cent.  There is nowhere else in this country affected to the same extent.  I have been a public representative in that area for 29 years. I am saying to the Government and to the Minister for Finance to keep on course and to correct the finances of this country.  I hope they will recognise the need to spend money in that area.  I am pleading with the Minister for Finance to recognise the need for economic development in the west, particularly in the Border counties, because if we are ever to get out of the difficulties that are created by the Border, we must have economic development.  I believe the time is right because those difficulties are recognised in Europe and by our Government and a co-ordinated and an integrated development programme for the northwest, and particularly for the Border counties, is our only hope for the region.</P>
    <P>I started by encouraging the Government to eliminate waste and duplication. I have noticed that many people holding <Col N="1105" /> senior jobs whether in a third level college or as a senior official in a Department, want to be involved in outside activities.  They do not want to stay at the work they initially contracted to do.  This practice is spreading like a disease and is reaching serious proportions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue to take corrective measures and will recognise areas where there are vast savings to be made.  Somebody hinted the Minister might be appointed as a Commissioner but I hope he will stay here.  He is recognised as a man with tremendous ability who is likely to be a success in his job. None of us is looking for a by-election or a general election.  Anybody who cannot identify the Government's determination to pursue their policies, regardless of the consequences, would be foolish &mdash; and gambling that the Government will not go to the country.  I am not in the forecasting business, but anybody who forecasts that the Government would not go to the country on an issue would lose his bet. That is my assessment.  I strongly urge the Government to continue the tremendous job they are doing because confidence building is vital.  It must be admitted that confidence needs a lot of building and correcting because the people have lost confidence in themselves and in the future.  Restoring that confidence is a major undertaking.</P>
    <P>We have only begun the task and I hope the Minister will stay long enough to see the benefits that can accrue from the corrective measures he has taken.  We can all blame each other for our financial difficulties, but we were living in different times and in the past we were too kind to each other.  We were all living in Utopia but today we are living in the real world.  I sincerely hope the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, will stay long enough to benefit from his investment in the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had this opportunity to say a few words of support for the Minister because there is a great deal at stake &mdash; the future of many young people, especially the 20,000 in my county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The broader aspects of <Col N="1106" /> the budget have been covered by Senator Bulbulia and Senator Doyle.  As I did last year when I was speaking on the budget, I will confine myself to my brief.  Most of us have specific briefs on which we speak and I speak on agriculture.  In this contribution, I will speak solely about agriculture in the Irish economy and the way, if any, it has been influenced for the better &mdash; I would say for the worse &mdash; by this budget.</P>
      <P>Farm incomes will not grow significantly, if at all, in 1988.  ACOT and AFT agree that the income growth in the farming sector this year could range from zero to 3 per cent if we are lucky with the weather.  Any income, or any growth in income or output, will be the result of factors completely outside the influence of anything the Government have done or are doing, such as good weather.  Even if we were to get a growth rate in income and output of, say, 3 per cent this year, we still would not reach the income levels, in real terms, which farmers enjoyed in 1984.</P>
      <P>The greatest problem facing the industry is the fall in the size of the national beef herd.  Since the introduction of milk quotas in 1984, dairy cow numbers have fallen by 115,000.  The June census showed that they now stand at about 1,527,000.  It is conservatively estimated that with present policies &mdash; which is no policy at all &mdash; the volume of beef production will be 150,000 fewer animals by 1991-92.  That is the figure by which production will have fallen if we continue on the present course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all this has been taking place in the dairy sector, with the direct disastrous effects on cattle numbers, there has been only a very marginal increase in the traditional beef cow herd.  We have had two kinds of cow herds, the dairy sector for milk production which naturally produces calves, and the beef cow herds which were purely for the production of calves alone and had no influence on milk production.  All this represents the most awful threat to this most important sector of the agricultural industry and it is coming at a time when opportunities are being opened up to the beef industry <Col N="1107" /> which have not been there for several years.</P>
    <P>Four years ago, supply was 10 per cent above the level of demand for beef on the Community market.  During those years we had massive intervention and massive downward pressure on prices. This year, because of the fall of beef numbers in Europe, the market has come back to about equilibrium, that is, that the levels of demand and supply are about the same.  Of course, the pressures on intervention and stocks of intervention have been greatly reduced.  I am not quite sure what the figures are but at least they have come down by a factor of four on what they were about two years ago.</P>
    <P>It is now envisaged that beef supplies in the Community will be well below the level of demand for several years to come because the trend is downward.  Since we entered the Community 12 or 14 years ago, hardly ever has this kind of situation pertained.  This will present us with tremendous opportunities if we are there to pick them up.  Now, all we can do is imagine the amount of national income which has been lost because we did not take the opportunity offered to us by this new unique situation.  It is sadder still that in this budget there is not a single measure which will help to rebuild the badly depleted beef stock herd.  If the Government are serious about regaining lost national income in the beef sector, they must, as a matter of urgency, remove the restrictions on grants given towards expanding the beef cow sector.</P>
    <P>At the moment, a farmer or his spouse who has an off-farm income of over £5,200 does not qualify for the beef cow scheme if he or she lives in the less severely handicapped areas.  I might mention that that income ceiling was £6,400, but this Government reduced it to £5,200 last year.  Farmers whose income from an off-farm activity represent anything more than 50 per cent of their total income &mdash; we are talking about all farmers &mdash; do not qualify for the suckler cow premium scheme, another scheme which is there to encourage the expansion of the beef <Col N="1108" /> herd.  Farmers engaged in milk production &mdash; dairy farmers whose cows are there purely for the production of milk &mdash; cannot receive grants for the production of more calves under any of these aforementioned schemes.  Our party would suggest that the Government should remove immediately the restrictions on the receipt of these grants under the cattle headage schemes and the beef cow schemes to farmers with an off-farm income in excess of £5,200.  In effect, we are asking for the abolition of that off-farm income condition and that the restrictions on non full time farmers under the cow suckler premium scheme should be removed also.</P>
    <P>We also propose that a limit of 30 livestock units for headage payments in the more severely handicapped areas should be increased to 45 livestock units, and that the current limit of 28 beef cows, which at present enjoy grant-aid under the beef cow scheme, should be increased to 42 cows.  We also ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to seek an increase in the suckler cow premium scheme which, incidentally, is fully funded by the EC.  We are asking him at the Council of Ministers to seek a concession that would increase the payments out of this scheme from a little over £36 at present to £60 per cow outside the disadvantaged areas. Farmers with a milk quota of less than 30,000 gallons should be made eligible for beef cow grants, their cow numbers and their quota in 1987 should be fixed as the base, and any cows in excess of this number should be able to qualify for beef cow and suckler cow premium schemes.  As I said, I am talking about farmers who have a milk quota of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume all you are saying is related to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I will be more specific on taxation in a moment.  We, in Fine Gael, believe that tax incentives should be used to encourage farmers to replenish this crucially important sector and that the stock relief clause for farmers' income tax should be used as this <Col N="1109" /> incentive.  I will be moving a recommendation on Committee Stage that stock relief for beef or breeding cows should be extended from its present 110 per cent to 125 per cent.  As of now, stock relief cannot be used to create a loss. Very often this means that unused relief is of no benefit to a tax paying farmer since it cannot be carried into the following year or years.  This could often arise on a beef farm where the level of income is one of the lowest among the various farm enterprises relative to the value of stock carried on the farm.  This can be especially significant for a farmer building up a suckler herd since the purchase of breeding stock can predate any profits from that stock by two to three years.  I will also be proposing that unused stock relief can be carried forward for up to three years.</P>
      <P>At the moment the clawback period for stock relief is ten years.  In a business as risky and as low yielding in income as beef production, ten years is a very long period.  I will be proposing on Committee Stage a more appropriate clawback period of seven years &mdash; that is, more appropriate to beef production.  No doubt the Minister will say that all I have proposed here will cost the taxpayer.  I do not deny that, but it will not cost the taxpayer a lot and, in the long term, it will not cost the country anything.  It will be a positive earning for the country.  To make the proper judgment we must look at the other side of the equation.  If by these measures and others we could increase the national herd by 3,000 beef animals by 1992, we would generate £200 million worth of additional exports, we would create 1,000 additional jobs in the beef or meat processing industry, we would create continued viability for at least 25,000 family farms and we would have all the other benefits to the Exchequer, like PAYE, VAT, etc., which are very difficult to put figures on but would be positive benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget that in recent years there has been a very large investment in beef processing.  In the three years from 1983 to 1986, we know of £90 million of capital investment in the beef processing <Col N="1110" /> industry and there were IDA grants amounting to £20 million to back up that investment.  It is little short of madness to stand idly by and allow the sector of the industry that provides the raw materials to the processing sector &mdash; and here we are talking about one of the most pivotal of national raw materials, that is, the beef cattle herd &mdash; to decline with all the ramifications for national disaster that holds, not to mention the nonsense it makes of the massive investment in extra capacity in the processing industry. A lot of that investment is provided by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the mistakes and, indeed, the fumbling of the Minister for Agriculture and Food over the past year and the latter half of 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister did had very serious income implications for <Col N="1111" /> the country.  That is the essence of what we are talking about.  All that is behind us.  The Minister has written it off and said that that initiative &mdash; if you could call it that &mdash; has been a failure.  With that bad experience behind us, we hope the Minister will look at the positive proposals I am putting forward here today &mdash; most of them have been put forward by our spokesperson on agriculture in a very comprehensive document issued some time ago, and they were spoken about in the other House when the Bill was being drafted there.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the pig industry briefly. We cannot, of course, look at the pig industry in relation to the budget because there is nothing in the budget that will help the pig industry.  The pork and bacon industry, like the cattle industry, is in decline.  Government policy over the last three years, under the aegis of the IDA, has expanded the capacity at factory level by one-third &mdash; from a capacity for two million slaughterings in 1984 to a capacity for three million slaughterings now.  As on the bovine front, the production of pigs nationally is down by almost 10 per cent on what it was five years ago, and we have no policies to expand production to fill the additional capacity at factory level.</P>
      <P>There is now on the horizon another problem for production.  What will happen when the supplies of whey dry up, and dry up they will very soon because of the reduction in the production of milk? Whey is a very cheap source of pig feed. Someone recently said that we would need to be very cautious about expanding pig production because of difficult external market conditions, but this is defeatist nonsense.  Look at Holland.  The increased production in the Netherlands last year was greater than the total Irish production, and all this increased product was disposed of on the world and Community markets with good returns to Dutch producers, with no major problem on the wider pork and bacon market in the world or in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the horticultural front, what is being done in the budget, or by way of <Col N="1112" /> Government policies, to expand field vegetable crops?  Nothing.  What is being done to introduce an effective grading scheme for potatoes?  Nothing.  We have An Bord Glas.  Someone said to me the other day that An Bord Glas seem to consist of a series of &ldquo;facilitators&rdquo;.</P>

Listening to you as you go page by page through your notes I am convinced that they were prepared for another Bill, and I am a little bit concerned about that.

      <P>I was talking about An Bord Glas, which I was saying do not seem to have any role in the horticultural industry, bearing in mind that they are funded from State funds provided under the Finance Bill and the budget.  Somebody said to me the other day that An Bord Glas would appear to be comprised of a series of &ldquo;facilitators&rdquo;.  A marvellous word in a way.  These people cannot provide any direct assistance to the horticulture industry, including the vegetable industry.  They have people who facilitate you by telling you there is a fellow in the Department of Industry and Commerce, or in the Department of Agriculture and Food, who can help you, and all he &mdash; the official &mdash; is doing is facilitating you by providing that information. That is where we get that type of animal we call a &ldquo;facilitator&rdquo;.  An Bord Glas should be properly funded.  They should have a dynamic role in the development of a proper horticultural industry.  Until they have, then all the taxation that has gone into An Bord Glas, and all the taxation that is being continuously spent on their existence, is a waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a final point about the recent designation of areas under the EC Structural Fund.  The first payments of <Col N="1114" /> the EC Structural Fund will come into effect this year.  Since some of the payments will come out of taxation here, it is obviously a budgetary matter.  Looking at the 11 areas which have been designated as pilot schemes under the structural fund, I cannot for the life of me understand what sense they make.  Obviously they were put there for some geo-political reason.  The essence of the rural integrated development programmes is to develop, in an integrated way, disadvantaged regions within the Community. That will be done by refunds from the EC through the Structural Fund, and an input of Exchequer taxation from the native country.  We got off completely on the wrong foot because it would appear that for purely political reasons, areas around the coastline, from County Wexford along the south coast, in every county in Connacht except my own, Roscommon, got a pilot area.  There is even a pilot area in the Cooley Peninsula, County Louth.</P>
    <P>Going back to the essential principle and the essence of these schemes, they should be set up on a regional basis with proper regional-integrated programmes and policies for the development of disadvantaged regions, not pockets of parishes strewn in west Mayo, or somewhere between Galway and Clare, or between Meath and Westmeath or Longford and the Cooley Peninsula, and a portion of the coastline of County Wexford, areas that have no relationship with each other.  It would make some sense if the total province of Connacht and the other three counties of Ulster were taken as a region for a pilot scheme. Let us test the scheme there and make the mistakes one has to make in the initiation of these schemes in a region like that.  Only in an area where words &ldquo;regional&rdquo; and &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; would be meaningful, could we see anything meaningful or good coming out of it.  We are going to spend taxpayers money on the setting up of this scheme this year.  I ask the Minister to reconsider what has been done in this fragmented piecemal way for purely constituency political reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I am sorry we had our problems a Chathaoirligh.  If I have one message to give it is that the Minister should take very seriously what I have said about the expansion of the beef herd.  We are storing up problems for ouselves as a result of a decline in the national herd. We have put forward positive proposals that will cost very little taxpayers' money but the effects on the national economy will be enormous.</P>

      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the magnificent work they are doing in getting the public finances on the right road. Interest and mortgage rates are dropping and 12 months ago people would have said it could not be done.  We talk a lot about PAYE worker's taxation but we forget to say that the private sector also pay tax.  The PAYE sector are householders and their mortgage rates have been reduced and the deductions from pay have been reduced with the changes in the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the £4 million given to the special task force on tourism.  In the west tourism is very important.  It was important to get in the experts and start a good tough selling campaign to bring in more tourists and more money to the economy, thus creating more jobs and making better use of the resources we have in abundance such as our golfing and fishing facilities.  It is a pity the people who are opposing the £15 charge on the rod licence would not sit around the table and see sense and realise it is for their own good, for the good of tourism and of the <Col N="1116" /> country.  They should be more patriotic. I appeal to them to look at it in a proper light because tourism is very important to this country.  This Government have made the tourism industry an important portfolio.  Up to this, it had been tagged on to something else.  Tourism was treated like the summer holidays &mdash; to be looked at once a year or now and again &mdash; but the Minister for Finance, the Government and the Minister for Tourism and Transport have made it very important.  They fully realise the job creation potential of tourism and they are doing a wonderful job.  I am delighted they have allocated an extra £4 million on tourism.</P>
    <P>We were told no tax was being collected from certain sectors but when the sheriffs went out we were told they were too severe.  Why should they do it?  They are doing it.  The humane and compassionate Minister for Finance brought in an amnesty and anybody who pays up his taxes and has his books in order by next September will have all the surcharges and interest charges written off. In many cases the interest rates and charges were double and treble what the tax bill was.  Cases went on for many years and assessments were made.  Penalties were imposed on the assessment and not on the real amount due.  I am pleased the Minister was compassionate and gave everybody a fair crack of the whip and a good chance to get their affairs in order. This has brought in a good deal of money and for the first time ever we are getting taxes on a proper basis.  The self-assessment system will be terrific because, when the auditor does the books, he will tell you what to pay and it is up to you to pay that amount instead of having appeals and tax assessments out of all proportion.  This is a real step forward and a great advantage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the charges on cash cards the Government did not do a U-turn but made a very wise change.  The banks put in electronic systems not only for the advantage of the customer but for their own advantage because they are business people.  They also put them in to cut down on staff and working hours <Col N="1117" /> while, at the same time, providing a 24-hour service.  The banks ensured that their institutions were working 24 hours a day with electronic equipment rather than paying staff to do it.  It is right that they should be made to pay and that is what the Minister has done.  He has taken the charge off the customer and put it on to the banker.  It will yield the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Disabled Drivers' Association acted rashly.  They should have talked to the Minister about qualification for a disabled driver's allowance. I am a disabled driver but I do not qualify for an allowance.  Unless your two legs are missing you do not qualify.  A man with one leg does not qualify.  The two legs must be disabled.  That is not fair. There are many dwarfs who can walk but cannot drive a car because of their size and they do not qualify.  The Minister had hoped to bring those people in.  There are many other people with disabilities who need a car.  A colleague of mine who had only half his shoulder had to struggle with an old banger to make a living selling insurance because he did not qualify.  The Minister is trying to make the system work for disabled people because at present only the disabled in the narrowest sense qualify.  That is a pity.  I am told that some people who qualify buy limousines costing huge amounts of money, drive them for two years and sell them and make a profit, while other disabled people cannot qualify.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Disabled Drivers' Association to come back and talk to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  I have worked with the disabled for a number of years and I believe there are many disabled people who should qualify for the disabled driver's allowance who do not qualify and they need it.  A person who has two legs and can walk, with the aid of sticks does not qualify.  A person must be completely disabled from the waist down to qualify for disabled driver's assistance.  I am very disappointed that this was not discussed more fully and I appeal to all concerned to think of the other disabled people in <Col N="1118" /> our midst who cannot qualify because of the present wording of the Act.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to re-enact his legislation and to get those people to talk. Some adopt the attitude that &ldquo;I am all right Jack&rdquo;, and do not think about others.  We must think of our disabled brethren and do something to ensure that those people can gain some advantages from being members of the Disabled Drivers' Association, which will in some way alleviate their handicap.  At present, the Minister with the best will in the world cannot assist them until the system is changed.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased with section 22 of the Bill.  The purpose of this section is to exempt from tax, payments made under the enterprise allowance scheme, now called the enterprise scheme.  In the absence of a specific provision of exempt taxation, this is a great thing because it is designed to try to give people who are on the dole and people who are in low paid jobs an opportunity to start their own business and create employment. There is a lot of good in this Bill.  I have been asked not to spend more than ten minutes speaking in order to give other people a chance to speak.  The Minister and the Government deserve our full congratulations. I wish to reiterate that I feel strongly that the section of the Bill dealing with disabled drivers should be widened to take in many more disabled people who are deserving and worthy of qualifying for some assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, will be brief.  I believe there is a danger of being repetitive in making a speech about the budget or the Finance Bill this year.  Many people have said very similar things to what they said last year, because the Government strategy as it stands this year, in the budget and the Finance Bill, are very similar to the thrust and the direction in which they are going.  The details are different but the overall strategy is moving in the same direction and I would be the first to congratulate the Government on the particularly successful job they have done on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also the first to condemn the <Col N="1119" /> Fianna Fáil election manifesto and the Fianna Fáil policies prior to the last election but luckily those promises have not been fulfilled at this stage.  Some of the wilder spending promises have been held back or withdrawn completely and the Government have embarked upon and are continuing a strategy which has a consensus support from most of the political parties in the Dáil and most of the political parties in this House.  There is undoubtedly a minority who disagree, a vocal minority who disagree with this. The strategy is correct and ought to be receiving the support of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We heard in the Minister's speech a certain amount, as is normal, of self-congratulation on the achievements of the Government during the past year. That is fair political game but when this Government, past Governments and all Governments congratulate themselves on the falls in interest rates, as the Minister did this afternoon, on inflation being down to below 3 per cent, or on a trade surplus and on many other things, we have to remember that these factors are not totally within our power.  We are a small open economy and we are not masters of our on destiny in terms of this economy.</P>
    <P>Inflation is to a large extent imported and, therefore, when it was at 17 to 20 per cent in this country it was not, conversely, completely the fault of the Government in power that inflation was running at that rate.  It was an international problem and it runs as an international problem. Inflation is now down worldwide.  Interest rates have been falling worldwide and we are, of course, as a small open economy, the beneficiary of those interest rates, but we follow.  As interest rates fell this morning in the United Kingdom so they will fall here.  To a certain extent we are certainly the victims of the world economy.  Therefore, the rather extravagant claims, made by both Government and Opposition on criteria like inflation, unemployment and interest rates should be taken with a small pinch of salt because they are not matters for which the <Col N="1120" /> Government should take the full credit or the full blame.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to talk about the details of the Finance Bill because we can discuss them on Committee Stage.  Having said I am in favour of the broad thrust of the Bill, it is important that we should look at the sort of tax regime which we are running in this country.  Whereas the Government are beginning to get the positive support of the business community &mdash; confidence is returning to the economy because they have, with great determination, tackled a very difficult problem &mdash; it is vital that the tax regime is changed and is changed fairly dramatically. I am not talking in terms of the Fine Gael proposals of last week, which I regard as quite unrealistic at this stage, but in terms of a gradual reduction in income tax and in capital gains tax so that the spirit of enterprise can be given its head.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is worth commenting briefly on the Custom House Docks site and the development of the international financial services centre. All people of good will welcome the idea and the proposal involved in the financial services centre.  There is absolutely no doubt that were it to work as its creators hope, it will be of great benefit to this country, but it has come to my notice and to the notice of many other people that there is a certain amount of scepticism &mdash; and we saw this at the chartered accountants' dinner last Saturday when the president made his speech &mdash; about where this scheme is going from here following the initial welcome and the enormous good will which is attached to it.</P>
    <P>We have had fairly few commitments so far and the big American banks and the Japanese corporations are holding back on this, none has announced a major commitment to this project.  One of the principal reasons why the financial services centre is stalled to a certain extent is because of our tax regime.  It is not enough to say that there is a 10 per cent corporation profits tax being applied to this as an incentive to bring them in, which is true &mdash; and there are other incentives being applied to bring them in &mdash;<Col N="1121" /> but there is also a general tax regime in this country which will make it very difficult to get people to work on this project.  The Government must address themselves to how we can persuade people from the financial centres of the world to come and work here when they will be subject to prohibitive income tax rates, capital gains tax rates and exchange control.  For example, in the UK the top rate of income tax was reduced to 40 per cent in the recent budget.  It must be remembered that those people who are working in the financial services industry are extremely highly paid, rightly or wrongly, and for those a salarty of £100,000 is a moderate salary.  You are asking them to come to work in Dublin on an initial reduction in net pay of £18,000, if they are getting the same salary.  What you are going to say to them, in fact, is: &ldquo;If you come here you pay more tax&rdquo;.  I suggest there is going to be a real difficulty unless tax concessions are given to the people working in this centre because they are simply not going to displace themselves from the environments in which they live, London, New York, Hong Kong, Japan and Tokyo, and all those places, for a reduction in salary.  Indeed, they would want to be offered very significant tax incentives to come here on an individual basis and that they are not being offered.</P>
    <P>Those firms which have been looking at this particular project are having serious difficulties initially in coming here simply because they do not think they are going to be able to persuade their best, young executives to come because the actual tax environment here is wrong for them.  It is something which has got to be looked as if the Custom House Docks development is not to go off at half cock or is not to fulfit the expectations which we all hope for it.  Having said that, I wish to comment on one or two very minor points.</P>
    <P>I regard the levy on pension funds, as do others, with a certain amount of cynicism.  We have a promise in the Minister's speech that it is a once-off tax.  This, I think I remember reading in my history books, was the promise made about <Col N="1122" /> income tax when it was introduced, it was the promise made about the bank levy which is being raised this year from £25 million to £36 million.  We have go to be realistic about the fact that if this is a large source of revenue and if it proves successful this tax is possibly here to stay. Once&mdash;off taxes very, very seldom prove to be so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make another plea, as I did last year, about capital gains tax.  I do not think there is any case for the abolition of capital gains tax but there is a case for its reduction from its 60 per cent high point.  This was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 as a result of pressure from those on whom it was dependent in the Dáil, notably The Workers' Party.  From the private conversations at the time I know that the 60 per cent capital gains tax was meant as a temporary expedient and part of the horse trading to get the budget through at the time.  That is perfectly fair and realistic politics, but at this stage the Government should again look at this because a 60 per cent tax deters investment.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no question of the propriety of imposing a capital gains tax on short-term gains &mdash; I do not argue with that for one moment &mdash; but what I have seen in my professional career time and time again is people refusing to invest money in Irish companies and industry because if in the possible event of their making a profit they will have to pay 60 per cent of that in tax immediately.  That is a disincentive to investment and I have seen many people leave money in unproductive areas because they are not inclined to risk the possibility of paying such a high tax by investing it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at capital gains tax and to extend the enlightened attitude which he has shown as regards unpaid taxes in the past, to the black economy in general.  There is an enormous amount of money floating around in the black economy, some of which would find its way back into the Exchequer, first if the tax regime was reformed and, secondly, if a benign and <Col N="1123" /> gradual attitude was taken by the Government towards it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is another milestone in the process of the Government's management of the country's economy.  It is here that the terms and the conditions of the budget are set down and it gives effect to changes and reforms already announced in the budget.  The debate in the Dáil on this year's Finance Bill appeared to be agreeable and constructive and this reflected the general public awareness that times are bad, the national economy is still ailing and, indeed, we have just pulled back from the brink of disaster.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, there has been very little public anger or outrage this time round. It surprised me, indeed, that people are so passive about their situation.  In many instances I feel they have cause to be angry.  Indeed, it could be reflecting their sense of powerlessness and the degree of low morale there is abroad.  People are concerned with the basic need to maintain themselves and their families as they watch their disposable incomes shrinking to ineffective levels.  They are like survivors rescued from a cold sea but travelling in an open rowboat and everyone has to row.  We will, it seems, be in that open row boat for a few more years, clinging on and hoping we are not buffeted by further storms, or that the boat itself does not spring a leak.</P>
      <P>I cannot recall a time of such complete depression and despair as we have at the present.  Many families are devastated by unemployment, particularly unemployment among the young, by redundancies, and having to cope also with the tragedy of emigration, seeing our lovely young boys and girls leaving in groups. Probably one of the most noticeable things of the eighties emigration, is that when a group is split up and one or two leave jobs or leave because they are unemployed, they seem to take with them their general circle of close friends or other relatives.  Many of them leave very reluctantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Sometimes we may believe that emigration is a rather attractive alternative because far-away fields are greener and people have a notion that things are very good in Australia or in London, but it touches me deeply when I speak to young people who like Ireland very much and the social life and living conditions here and they very reluctantly leave to go abroad.  It is very worrying to see the escalation of emigration.  Quite recently I heard one personnel officer, who comes here regularly in the last year to recruit graduates, saying that what is happening is that not only are college graduates going to work in England, but people who are trained, and have had four or five years of training in a financial house or in a corporation here are going.  She said: &ldquo;Do you not realise that in ten years time this country will be a desert, it will merely be a training ground for economies abroad?  Your educated young people will stay until they get training, and then the incentives of low tax and a better income abroad will attract them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a sick society.  Those of us who are in middle age can recall both the deprivation and poverty of the forties and fifties followed by the expansion of the sixties and the greater enterprise and higher employment of the good days of the seventies and we should be asking some probing questions.  How did we get into such a mess?  The politicians and social planners over the past 20 years have ill served the country.  We have an obligation now to realistically deal with the chronic financial state of affairs and to look for workable and honest proposals for the future.</P>
    <P>By all means let us sort out our mess and for God's sake let us do it in a co-operative way.  Let us put all the bills and the cheques upwards on the table.  Others may have been responsible, one or other party in the past, through Houdini-type politics or giveaway election manifestos. The reality is before us and we must deal with it collectively and co-operatively, but not to such an obsessive degree that we ignore the longer term and see only the short term.  The future, when the foreign debt is at management level and <Col N="1125" /> we are in a state of healthy growth, must be planned for now.  Or, will we lose the head again?</P>
    <P>How can this country make sure of steering a steady, buoyant course up to the turn of the century and into the year 2000?  I am not convinced that some elements in Irish political life would not again indulage in the express train spending and cavalier politics of a few short years ago.  We need to agree on proposals on a fired social and economic policy for the next 15 years.  As it is, Fianna Fáil are only making headway now because of the responsible and balanced role played by Fine Gael in Opposition. Deputy Dukes and our party are putting this country, its young people and its resources before party interests.  There is not another Opposition Irish politician who would adopt the leadership role that Deputy Dukes has espoused, and in doing so, given such an honourable lead. We know the reality but so too do other Opposition parties and they have a glorious notion it seems that there is a gold mine under Leinster House and money can continually be mainted.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the tax relief in the budget.  He called it a significant start on the road to reform.  It is costing £152 million but when it is distributed to PAYE workers it will scarcely buy an extra box of matches per person per week.  It is a puny reduction and will not go very far on the way to putting some vitality into the jaded PAYE taxpayer. The staggering tax which is up to 65 per cent of income when PRSI payments are included is reducing people to the leavel of robots.  They have little vitality about their jobs.  Why would they work extra hard?  Why would they do overtime? Although they know the Government are to blame for the level of tax they pay, it is the employer who reaps the results of their apathy and disinterest and production and quality inevitably suffer.</P>
    <P>Our tax load is the greatest single disincentive to wanting to work or wanting to develop and expand.  I do not agree with the Minister when he said that talk of an all-party committee is merely a recipe for fudging and indecision.  An all-party <Col N="1126" /> approach to tax reform is the only way. Fianna Fáil do not have a monopoly on wisdom and neither do the officials who year in, year out, advise on and deal with the nation's finances.  Dialogue about tax can evaporate if it is not part of a structured framework through an all-party organisation or committee.</P>
    <P>In section 8 of the Bill there is a departure from the norm where it deals with VHI payments.  It includes the extension of the deduction from certain fees paid to medical practitioners.  In future the Bill provides that the health insurer will be required to pay the balance of the claims after deduction of the tax direct to the doctor rather than to the subscriber. This may overcome some problems for the Revenue Commissioners but it would be naïve to suggest that it will not create other problems for the insured person. No longer will the consumer pay the doctor's fee directly and be able to negotiate with him or her where the fee charged is in excess of that expected or that covered by the VHI scheme.  There will also be administrative costs in this measure and I regret that the only people to lose will be the individual consumers. I am not happy with this arrangement and I am not happy that it is in the interests of the insured persons.</P>
    <P>Still on the health theme, I would refer to my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, in his Second Stage speech in the Dáil who dealt with old age pensioners.  There was no attempt in this budget to recognise the increasing problem of the old people living alone.  There has been no change in the relative-assistance allowance, no generous move to bring about community care for the old and sick.  As the Government career on, cutting health spending, closing hospitals and clinics, this vulnerable group, the old, who live alone, are most at risk.  Many have no relatives to care for them.  They live alone, often in very lonely country areas and can suffer great deprivation at the end of their days. Deputy Bruton proposed a very sensible solution.  It was a scheme which was recommended at paragraph 353 in a report published by the National Council for the Aged.  Old people who may need <Col N="1127" /> money, he proposed, should be able to negotiate with a life insurance company to get an income during their lifetime and on their death have the insurance company sell the house, take back their money and leave the remainder to be distributed in accordance with the intentions of the deceased person.  It is a realistic proposal and a realistic scheme. It could work and it should be examined and developed.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 22 which exempts from tax payments made under the enterprise allowance scheme.  This assists people on the dole to set up businesses and it is good that this section is to apply to all payments made since the start of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome section 74 which applies to the taxes paid by children or people whose parents were not married to each other.  This provisions at least does away with remaining discriminations against non-marital children.  It is timely too as the Status of Children's Act will come into effect from June 15 next.  This is a cause for celebration and I am glad it is included in legislation at this time.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill has given an opportunity to Senators to express their views on the performance of the Government and their financial and economic strategy over the past year. When one takes into account the background to the financial situation when the Government came into office, where there was a national debt of £26 billion, where we had raging and uncontrolled unemployment, where interests rates were very high and where inflation also, although reasonably under check, was pretty high, the past year has seen the financial situation being managed very carefully by means of a very clear strategy by the Government.  The strategy is that whatever moneys are made available in the budget are the finances which will be available for the running of the country. On that basis we have seen very stringent, careful and fair management of our financial affairs over the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The people in the financial world, the employment world, the PAYE sector and everybody in the country can see that the Government are fully committed to managing our affairs on a very careful and professional basis.  We cannot have a situation whereby Estimates are brought in <i>ad lib</i> when necessary as in the past.  We must be able to manage our affairs.  We have a small financial base in the country.  We have a basically small population and there is no reason with a positive, responsible co-operative effort right across the board we cannot together in the interest of the country manage our financial affairs in a better way.</P>

      <P>Yes, I saw my esteemed colleague on the screen.  I wondered was he being allowed to contribute as a Senator or as a Minister of State.  I want to thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for being in such a liberal mood.  The contributions were of the usual high standard which one comes to expect in this House.  I will try to reply as best I can in the time available to the main points raised.  Points relating to individual sections can, of course, be discussed in greater detail at Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Senators for the most part approve the broad thrust of Government policy a number felt it did not go far enough.  Senator Bulbulia claimed that the Government was concerned only with cost containment and that we lacked any vision or clear strategy to deal with the problems of unemployment and emigration. Senator Ferris also said that <Col N="1129" /> there was nothing in the Finance Bill that would tackle these problems.  I fully agree that the problem of unemployment is the major problem and challenge facing this country.  It is a problem of enormous economic, social and human dimensions. The question is how we can get the growth and investment which will create employment and achieve a lasting reduction in voluntary emigration. Clearly, we will not achieve these aims by throwing money at the problem.  This was tried in the past and failed.  That approach brought us to the dire straits we had reached at the end of 1986.  It caused huge outflows of funds from the economy, pushed up interest rates to horrendous levels, pushed up taxes and undermined confidence in the future of the country.  There was indeed a bleak future for growth and jobs against that background.</P>
    <P>Government strategy to get growth and jobs is laid out clearly in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The various elements for that strategy kinit together.  They are all directed at creating the conditions in which investment will increase and jobs will be created.  As a result of the turnaround achieved since the Government took office many of the conditions needed are now coming right. We have low unstable prices, sharply reduced interest rates, a more competitive economy, improved exports, a surplus in the balance of payments and development plans for incentives and incentives for various sectors.</P>
    <P>The growing confidence did not come about by accident.  It has happened precisely because the Government have taken frim action to control the public finances and have restored credibility in the management of the economy.  This is not just my view: all surveys of business opinion bear it out.  There is a major change for the better in the climate for private investment.  As I have said, private investment is the key to jobs.  I would not be as pessimistic as Senator Ferris as regard the results.  Significant progress has already been made in a short period of time.  The experience of other small countries, such as Denmark, which have <Col N="1130" /> had to undertake severe programmes of fiscal adjustment is that the economy can be turned around in this way.</P>
    <P>I agree, therefore, that it is important to have vision and to hold out hope and encouragement for the young.  The way we were going would not have achieved this.  The young will not thank us if, instead of a clear vision for the future, we revert to the double vision of the past. The Government are determined to stick to the task in hand and to tackle the problems of the public finances and unemployment within the overall startegy laid out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Senator a Bulbulia also referred to the need for a commitment to social equity in dealing with the economic problems of the country.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> this Government stated their commitment to greater social equity and the protection of those who were less well off in our society.  This commitment has been fully honoured. Last year the Government brought forward the annual increase in welfare allowances, from November to July, to protect fully the real value of all welfare payments.  Likewise, from this July a general increase of 3 per cent in both personal and adult dependant rates will ensure that the value of welfare payments is fully protected over the coming 12 months.  Furthermore, those on the lowest welfare payments will benefit from significantly higher increases from July next.  Persons on long term unemployment assistance, for example, will receive an increase equivalent to over 11 per cent on personal rates also from next I want to thank Senators for acknowleding that contribution particularly for those on long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>These increases along with the Government decision to continue equal treatment alleviating payments until the end of 1988 highlight the Government's determination to give particular attention to the needs of the less well off in our society.  The continuation of Jobsearch in 1988 and the recent extensions of the part-time job incentive scheme nationwide <Col N="1131" /> further demonstrate this Government's awareness of the need to adopt flexible measures to meet the challange of continuously changing labour market conditions, to maximise employment opportunity in Ireland.  The job incentive scheme, by providing a basic welfare payment to persons working up to so many hours a week, increases the flexibility of the system of welfare provision and recognises the trend towards part-time employment over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I could not accept the comment made by a number of Senators that the Government did not do much for the PAYE sector and the low paid in particular in the income tax changes.  As I pointed out, the income tax changes will cost an estimated £152 million in the current year.  By any standard this is a generous provision for income tax relief in our current financial circumstances and everyone who pays income tax will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>When one talks about tax concessions of the order of £91 million this year and £152 million in a full year and then looks at the difficulties created by an imposition of tax costing, whether it be £5, £10, £15 or £20 million and all the uproar that can follow such an introduction of tax, one must look at the relief of £152 million in a totally different context.  It is not easy to provide or to find all the millions that would be required but the main point is that what we are doing is honouring the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and our election commitment to bring two-thrids of the taxpayers on to the standard rate which is now nearly achieved.  We have 63 per cent of taxpayers paying at the standard rate this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia asked me for assurances about further reductions in income tax.  What I can say to her is that the Government will do their utmost and are determined to get rates down further as soon as possible.  We have made a useful start and are determined to go further but I will not, and I cannot commit the Government to specific rates at this stage. <Col N="1132" /> There is no point in making such a commitment without saying how the reductions can be financed.  This is what I object to in the Fine Gael approach which reveals the good news now about their planned tax reductions and Leaves it to someone else to worry about how they can be financed.  I am very sceptical, therefore, about suggestions for all-party committees or other such devices to come up with the measures to finance the tax reform package.  The very reluctance of Fine Gael in their proposals to say how they would finance the suggested measures is indicative of the difficulties and the lack of real substances in the so-called reform package.  Our experience shows that it is only if the Government are prepared to take the initiative in putting forward painful adjustment measures that progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before on a few occasions since budget time about tax reform.  I do not recall a budget in recent times that had as many reform measures in it as the budget of 1988, whether it be the tax concessions that have been made to the PAYE sector, the self-assessement, the extensions of PRSI to the self-employed and farmers and corporation tax changes, the incentives for the collection of taxes and the power of attachment &mdash; an enormous package of measures that I have to say were generally welcomed by the public at large and I must say, in general by most spokes-persons here and in the Dáil but one is inclined to forget all that has been done and to go on and say that while something was done this year, you forget about that, take it for granted, it costs nothing, and now that we are making a start, we must go the whole road.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of when I began my public life.  There were not too many telephone calls or telephone systems in rural parts.  When you got a telephone for somebody on a particular road or in a particular half of a parish, every person in the whole parish wanted a telephone &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;.  Everybody knew it was not possible to provide it tomorrow but that is the reality.  If you did not put a telephone into the next parish, there were no <Col N="1133" /> problems.  Perhaps during the term of office of a Coalition Government it is very easy for them after a year or so, because everybody knows they are not going to do anything and, therefore, nobody makes demands on them.  Here we have a Government who, notwithstanding the difficulties that are around and all that we had to do in relation to exercising control in the public finances, are able to do things, even to the extent of tax reform to the tune of £152 million in the first year.  That is a great achievement in a short period, whereas nothing like it was even dreamed of in the four and a half years before that.</P>

      <P>Yes, and perhaps I should have prefaced my remarks by saying that the quality of the Opposition is essential.  You will remain the Opposition because it is essential to have a good Opposition.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia asked what was being done in the Finance Bill for the motor industry.  I would like at this stage to agree with the sentiments she expressed in relation to the late Senator Jackie Daly who was a great man for the motor industry, not only in this House but outside it. In all the discussions we all had with him at different times, he was a lovely man and we will all miss him sadly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase from £4,000 to £6,000 in the capital allowances and the deductions for running expenses for tax purposes are a very significant benefit which took effect from budget day.  The cost of this concession is estimated at £14 million in 1990.  It is very limited this year but it rises to £14 million in 1990 when it has full effect.  I might mention to Senators that the new private car registrations in March showed a dramatic increase both over the previous month and over March 1987.  The unadjusted total was 7,123, a 30 per cent rise over February and a 43 per cent increase over March 1987.  Even allowing for seasonal adjustment, the increase was 27.5 per cent during the month.  The cumulative year-on-year <Col N="1134" /> increase for the first quarter of 1988 is now 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senators also raised the possibility of a change in the present arrangements for the benefit in kind charge on the employee in respect of the private use of a company car provided by his employer. This charge yields at present about £31 million per annum.  I would not favour any reduction in it because of the loss to the Exchequer and because it would be unfair to other motorists who have to pay all the costs and expenses of obtaining and running a private car from their own resources.</P>
    <P>There was quite a lot of discussion about section 23 and the associated reliefs and some detailed points were raised which I think are probably best left for reply on Committee Stage, in regard to numbers and statistics in relation to its previous implementation.  With the Senators approval, we will take these on Committee Stage when perhaps we will be in a better position to have a question and answer session on those points.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia and a number of other Senators talked about the withholding tax deducted at source.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that, while there were some initial difficulties, all valid claims are now paid within a month and most claims are dealt with in a shorter period.  A recent survey in the district dealing with the professionals in the Dublin area showed that approximately 20 items per week relating to withholding tax are received.  The number of items on hands represents about ten days' work.  This suggests a turn-around time of less than two weeks up to 5 April 1988.  A total of £2 million withholding tax has been repaid to Irish residents and a further sum of £50,000 has been set off against outstanding amounts of PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  The above repayments and set-offs involve some 262 cases.  More than one repayment was made in certain cases.  In addition, repayments totalling £390,000 have been made to non-residents.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia made specific reference to the effect of the withholding tax on medical professionals, particularly <Col N="1135" /> doctors.  I have met representatives of the medical profession to discuss the impact of the withholding tax and meetings have also been held at official level.  In my discussions with representatives of the profession I have indicated that I would be prepared to have the working of the system examined in the light of any representative sample of cases which the profession might wish to submit and my Department have made a similar offer.  I repeat this offer now.  If the Senator has specific information about any particular case in which difficulties have arisen in the administration of the legislation, I will have the matter examined on receipt of the necessary details.  Senator Bulbulia was also concerned about patient confidentiality under the new arrangements. I can assure the Senator that the Revenue Commissioners will receive no details as regards the patient who has incurred the treatment for which payment is made. The insurance company will simply deduct 35 per cent from the payments to the professional and remit this to Revenue.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia also raised the question of whether disclosure of payments by the VHI would meet the objective of this legislation.  It would not.  The withholding tax arrangement and disclosure are two completely different operations. The deduction system introduced last year, and now being extended to consultants, ensures that deductions are made on time in an administratively manageable way.  Disclosure, on the other hand, at best provides potentially useful information leaving collection of tax on the basis of it as a completely different matter.  For the information of Senator Ferris, I would like to stress that the patient will remain liable for any uninsured balance of the professional fee and a deduction at source system will not apply to this payment.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia and others also asked if any pension fund will be made insolvent by the levy on pension funds in section 53 of the Bill.  The detailed arrangements for this levy were formulated after discussions were held with representatives <Col N="1136" /> of the pensions fund industry.  These arrangements include the following provisions; a deduction from the amount charged to the level of pensions payments made in 1988; an exemption for the large number of non-group pension schemes run by life assurance companies; an exemption where the net amount chargeable is less than £5,000; and a deduction of any interest received net of retention tax.</P>
    <P>As a result, it is estimated that only about 1,500 of the 25,000 pension funds approved by the Revenue Commissioners will actually pay the levy.  For all these reasons, especially the deduction of pensions paid out, and because the levy is once-off, it is not expected that any pension fund will be made insolvent as a result of the levy.  The recent report from the National Pensions Board on the tax treatment of occupational pension schemes acknowledged that a temporary tax is likely to have a lesser impact on the funds than a major or permanent change in their tax treatment.  As regards the questions raised here and in the other House on the once&mdash;off nature of the tax, the Bill clearly provides that the charge is for the calendar year of 1988 only.</P>
    <P>The other points raised can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The question of the Government's action and its impact on tourism was raised and I would like to make the following comments on this item.  The Government organised the tourism forum last January in order to bring together various toruism interests with a view to generating new ideas for the development of tourism.  Following the forum, the Tourism Task Force was set up and prepared a wide-ranging report.  Implementation of the report's recommendation is being monitored on an ongoing basis.  The opinion that lower access fares were vital in order to boost tourism numbers was expressed by both the forum and the task force.  Progress to date in lowering access cost has been considerable and there are already indications that tourist numbers are rising as <Col N="1137" /> a result.  It is hoped that further developments will be possible which will extend the benefits of lower fares to other routes.</P>
    <P>Changes in the VAT rules governing coaches for tourists use were also recommended and these are under active consideration. We are not just dealing with the short-term problems.  Efforts have already been made to develop a medium-term plan for tourism and work in this field is continuing.  A successful tourism policy must cover a wide variety of areas including transport, the environment, staff and management training, marketing, the development of amenities, etc.  The preparation of a worthwhile plan will take more time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, as Senators will recall, I undertook during our debate here on last year's Finance Bill to consider a recommendation made by Senator David Norris that provision should be made for income tax relief for renovation or reconstruction of listed buildings in designated areas.  The purpose of the Senator's recommendation was to encourage people to come to live in inner city areas and restore buildings of artistic merit in such areas as, indeed, the Senator has done with such distinction.  Senator Norris subsequently met officials of my Department to discuss the matter and they reported to me on the outcome of the meeting.  Naturally, I have considerable sympathy with the Senator's views on this matter and, as I promised the House last year, I have given careful thought to the suggestions he put forward. However, I have to say I am not in a position to make a concession along the lines he proposes.</P>
    <P>There is already very substantial tax-based Exchequer support for housing.  As Senators will be aware, mortgage interest relief which is allowed on the interest on loans taken out for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of the borrower's sole or main residence will cost an estimated £160 million in the current tax year.  In addition, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, provides for relief in respect of the cost of maintenance and repair of buildings which have been determined by the Commissioners of <Col N="1138" /> Public Works to be intrinsically of a significant architectural merit and to which reasonable access is provided to the public.  Finally, section 44 of the Finance Act, 1986, provides for tax relief to owner occupiers in respect of the net cost of construction or refurbishment incurred on houses in designated areas.  This relief, which amounts to 50 per cent of net expenditure spread over ten years, has been extended to 31 May, 1991, in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will agree that these measures represent very substantial Exchequer aid for housing.  While obviously they were not introduced specifically to cater for the circumstances outlined by the Senator in last year's debate, they can be of significant benefit to inner city owners of listed houses.  In view of this and since in our current severe financial difficulties a tax concession for one group of taxpayers can only be granted at the expense of others, I am afraid I cannot agree to the introduction of relief along the lines suggested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>I have come to this conclusion reluctantly. I appreciate Senator Norris's commitment to the renewal of the inner city and I fully realise the good intentions behind his suggestion.  I accept that there can be certain difficulties in applying some of the reliefs which currently exist to listed buildings.  However, I am sure Senators will understand that the current state of the Exchequer finances simply does not allow the introduction of a further tax relief on top of those I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>When Senator Ferris was speaking he also questioned the Government's decision of last year in terminating the reconstruction grants and said how small builders were coming to him every day concerned that they had no work because this grant was abolished.  I have to tell him that as far as we are concerned we have ongoing commitments for payment of reconstruction grants even though they were abolished as and from March last year.  We will pay substantial sums out this year and again next year so there is still a substantial amount of work to be <Col N="1139" /> done.  Every day I meet constitutents of mine and get letters from constituents of all Deputies and Senators asking if they still have the approval.  They say they got it in before 27 March 1987 but because they did not start the work they wonder if they will still get the grant.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, they will.  There is a substantial amount of work still to be done.  Taking all of the other activities that the Government have been involved in, whether it is the decentralisation programme, the Custom House Docks financial services centre or the inner city and urban renewal schemes, I think the Construction Industry Federation admitted quite recently that for the first time in many years, rather than a continuing downturn, there is now an upturn in construction activity. Let us hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered a good many of the points that were made.  I am sure there are others I have omitted but we look forward to the debate on Committee <Col N="1140" /> Stage.  I am sure we will go through it on a case-by-case basis, section by section, and any individual questions that are asked I will do my utmost, as usual, to try to reply to them.  I thank the House.</P>
