      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House why there are no plans either in this House or in the Dáil for a discussion of the Forum Report.  As far as I understood, all parties in this House and in the Dáil had claimed this as a great historic breakthrough.  The Forum Report is not about to be discussed, as far as I can see, in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas and no motion is on the Order Paper for this.  This panacea, this Utopia, which we had presented to us last week is apparently either too good or too bad for the Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss.  I would like the <Col N="1020" /> Acting Leader of the House to tell us whether the Forum Report is too good for the Seanad, or is it that the Seanad is too good for the Forum Report?  It is a very important subject which apparently we are ducking because there are splits in the political parties and I regret enormously that a year's work should have been gone through by all the parties and it has not been brought before either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question asked by Senator Harte, it is intended to take only Second Stage of the Hours of Work Bill to allow people who may want to contribute the opportunity to do so. Therefore just the completion of Second Stage is in question.  The question raised by Senator Ross is very important, but there is a procedure in this House which allows such questions to be dealt with and that is normally by way of a motion. It is the prerogative of a person who wishes to have something discussed to put down a motion to have that done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment continues to be our most serious economic and social problem and every avenue must be explored to try to alleviate this problem.  We have a relatively new and comparatively undeveloped industrial structure in this country, with somewhat limited natural resources and a rapidly increasing labour force, with a level of unemployment which is particularly acute.  It would be unrealistic <Col N="1022" /> to assume that everything will return to normal when the recession is over and that employment will again automatically increase.  Such an assumption would ignore the advances that have taken place in new technology, the decline in many industries which had been regarded as traditional sources of employment, and the increase in the number of young people seeking employment for the first time.</P>
      <P>The most obvious way to improve employment opportunities is to encourage and assist in the setting up of new industries and enterprises.  There are additional, less direct, measures which may be taken, including the introduction of some forms of work sharing.  Various proposals have been put forward for action in such areas as flexible retirement, part-time work, temporary work, shift work, reduction of working hours and restrictions on overtime working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factors giving rise to overtime are fluctuations in demand for products or services.  There may also be a certain amount of overtime working in some enterprises based on tradition and practice over a long period.  Indeed, in some areas of employment overtime in recent years has come to be regarded as a permanent part of working life.  In the present economic climate, with an unacceptably high level of unemployment, the practice of systematic overtime cannot be justified for some, while others particularly many young people, are unable to obtain work.  It is essential to ensure that new jobs should be created rather than have increased overtime working for those fortunate enough to be in employment. The Bill will help to make workers and employers more aware of the need to restrict overtime working to reasonable levels.  This will not alone benefit the individual worker, but will also help towards spreading the amount of work available among more people.  Indeed, the Bill's real strength will be educational. It will ensure that workers who are at present working long hours of overtime over long periods will become accustomed to working more normal hours and that employers will need to look at the other options open to them rather <Col N="1023" /> than automatically resorting to overtime working as a means of dealing with the work load.</P>
    <P>A study of overtime working in Ireland was carried out by University College, Galway, in 1979-80.  Firms were asked for their views on the prospects for recruiting additional full-time employees instead of putting existing staff on overtime.  The results showed that about 20 per cent of overtime could be translated into extra jobs and that if this were achieved, around 12,000 additional jobs would be created in the non-agricultural sector.  A further study carried out by University College, Galway in 1982 confirmed that, despite the recession, specific cases existed across industry where there was scope for increased employment on the basis of reduced overtime.</P>
    <P>The whole area of work sharing and the contribution it can make to employment creation has been under consideration by the EEC for some years.  The Commission is at present preparing a draft Council recommendation aimed at reducing working time and limiting overtime with the objective of reducing unemployment in the Community.  A survey of 20 European countries carried out in 1981 by a Council of Europe study group, showed that almost half of the countries reviewed had already introduced a statutory 40 hour week.  Where legal limits for overtime working were laid down, the trend was towards a limit of ten hours or less per week.  The aim of the Hours of Work Bill, which is to fix the normal working week at 40 hours and to encourage the creation of employment by limiting overtime, is thus in line with current European thinking and initiatives in relation to working hours.</P>
    <P>The existing legislative provisions governing working hours in this country are contained in the Conditions of Employment Acts of the late thirties, which apply only to industrial, shop and hotel workers.  Many of the provisions of this legislation, which allow a normal working week of 48 hours &mdash; 56 hours in the case of hotel workers &mdash; are no longer relevant to current practice.  The normal working week of workers generally has <Col N="1024" /> tended to be fixed by collective agreements at about 40 hours.  The Bill before the House gives statutory recognition to this situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply to all workers except those in firms primarily engaged in the transport of persons or goods, those in essential services, fishermen, residential caretakers and close relatives.  These exceptions are provided for in section 2 of the Bill.  If it becomes apparent that any of these exclusions are not warranted there is provision in this section for having the class of workers concerned brought within the scope of the Bill. Before availing of this provision, however, the Minister is first obliged to consult with representatives of the workers and employers concerned.</P>
    <P>The key provisions of the Bill are contained in section 4, which fixes the normal working week at a maximum of 40 hours or an average of 40 hours where weekly hours vary, and in section 5, which limits the amount of overtime which may be worked to 40 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks or 100 hours in any period of 12 consecutive weeks.</P>
    <P>Some fears have been expressed that the provisions of the Bill before the House could adversely affect the operations of some undertakings.  Employer interests in the food processing business, the hotel and catering industry and others have expressed such fears.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to assure them that the Bill has been designed to ensure that its provisions will not create difficulties for industry where special circumstances such as seasonal variations in working time, exist.  Section 4, for instance, allows working hours to be averaged over 12 months where they vary on a seasonal basis.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 6 provide the necessary flexibility to ensure that the freedom of firms to operate efficiently is not restricted.  Section 3 provides for the making of an order, following approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas, to exclude a class or classes of workers from all the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister will be obliged to consult with the representatives of employers and workers concerned before making such an order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> Section 6 provides for the making of regulations, following consultations with representatives of the workers and employers concerned, permitting the working of additional overtime by a class or classes of workers.  It also provides for the issue to firms of permits to exceed the overtime limits where there is a significant decrease in the number of workers employed in the firm or a significant increase in the volume of work required to be done.  This section in particular should allay the fears of those who consider the Bill too restrictive.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not provide for rates of pay for overtime because I believe that such matters are best settled through our system of free collective bargaining between employers and workers.  The provisions in the Conditions of Employment Acts for the payment of overtime at a minimum rate of time plus 25 per cent for industrial, shop and hotel workers will continue to apply to such workers.  The minimum rates for payment of overtime provided for in employment regulation orders and in registered employment agreements made under the Industrial Relations Acts &mdash; which is time plus 50 per cent, except in the case of agricultural workers, where it is time plus one third &mdash; will also continue to apply. Section 11 of the Bill provides that all workers and employers covered by the Bill may negotiate and give effect to arrangements providing for time off in lieu of payment for overtime.  The 1979 UCG study considered that the establishment of this practice in legislation might provide some impetus towards the wider acceptance and adoption of such a practice in the context of collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 workers who work for more than one employer are restricted in regard to the aggregate of the weekly hours they work to the maximum weekly hours allowed for in one employment. Agreements may be made under the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1977 to vary the maximum weekly working hours permitted for young persons under that Act.  Section 7 provides that such agreements shall not permit the employment <Col N="1026" /> of a young person in excess of 50 hours a week.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has been taken in section 12 of the Bill to repeal section 16 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, which gives the Minister for Labour power, after consultation with representatives of employers and workers concerned, to prohibit the employment of female workers on particular forms of industrial work, or to fix the proportion of female workers employed in such work to other workers so employed.  I consider this to be a discriminatory provision which has no place in modern legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be enforced by inspectors of the Department of Labour, and section 9 provides the necessary powers for the inspectors to do this.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections provide for necessary definitions, penalties for offences, regulations for the keeping of records by employers, and other standard provisions.</P>
    <P>This Bill will, I believe, make a contribution to the creation of additional employment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us seeks to regulate working time and aims to facilitate the expansion of jobs in the economy.  Any measure which tackles unemployment is welcome.  It remains to be seen whether the Bill will meet this objective in practice.  I hope it does so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, presumably, based on the assumption that there is room for a significant reduction in overtime without adversely affecting the efficiency of enterprises.  Presumably, therefore, it is believed that there is a substantial amount of systematic overtime in the economy.  Is this in fact the case?  Excessive and unnecessary systematic overtime is a serious cause of inefficiency and can arise because management is not adequately controlling production demand or perhaps because management does not want to tackle what employees see as a means of producing tolerable pay levels and thereby run the risk of industrial action.  Some overtime working is obviously necessary.  The Bill provides for emergencies like an abnormal <Col N="1027" /> increase in the volume of work in a particular enterprise.  However, I would ask the Minister if his Department have formed an estimate of the ratio of systematic overtime to total overtime working.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, it was claimed in Britain that the highest levels of overtime worked occurred in the lowest paid industries. I suspect the same holds true here. If it does, we are in effect asking those on low rates of pay to reduce overtime levels in order to help increase employment. This makes it all the more necessary to link the reduction of permitted working time with a general review concerning the improvement of productivity and with it a review of basic pay.</P>
    <P>Serious unemployment levels in all western societies together with the application of micro-electronic technology in various industries and services have, of course, led Governments to explore a range of possibilities for increasing employment, including the time spent at work.  Also, in this context, work-sharing, to which the Minister has referred in his opening speech and which involves the redistribution of existing work, has been the subject of a number of concrete initiatives in several countries in the western democracies.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, Government, trade unions and employers are at one in identifying the magnitude of our unemployment problem.  There is not, however, the same degree of consensus on how the problem should be tackled and solved.</P>
    <P>On financial grounds alone, unemployment is a very costly problem.  For example, in 1983 it has been estimated that unemployment payment and the loss of tax revenue amounted to £850 million. Added to this financial cost is the human cost of long-term unemployment as manifested in material deprivation and psychological damage.</P>
    <P>One option in tackling our enormous unemployment problem is to share the available work among a greater number of people.  The Bill before us which provides for controlling and reducing overtime does represent a step in this direction. The overtime limits in the Bill of 40 hours over four consecutive weeks and <Col N="1028" /> 100 hours over 12 consecutive weeks are not harsh.  Based on experience with this legislation, it may well prove possible to reduce gradually the overtime limits, perhaps every year.  The Bill when enacted and enforced will need close monitoring. The normal rational for overtime working is the degree of demand for goods or services from individual enterprises.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill overtime limits will be set irrespective of the degree of the demands, though emergencies will be catered for.  There is no guarantee however, and this is a cause for concern, that employers will recruit additional people to compensate for overtime, if reduced. Instead, they could for example seek improvements in productivity by negotiating the elimination of restrictive practices or by increased mechanisation.  It is unlikely that the provisions of the Bill will be welcomed by workers, especially those who at present work overtime in excess of the limits in the Bill.  Indeed, there are several Labour Court recommendations which illustrate organised opposition to the reduction of overtime. If the provisions of the Bill are to work in practice and the hoped-for increased employment is to materialise, the active support of both employers and workers will be necessary.  The Government should consider, I suggest, in what ways they might facilitate the transition from present working hours to the new limits set by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to expand jobs in the economy by sharing existing work.  I would like to make a few suggestions to the Minister for the redistribution of existing work in instances where the Government are the paymaster.  I note that the Bill will not apply to certain types of workers, including doctors and nurses. On the face of it I can understand the rationale behind the exclusion of these two professions from the provisions of the Bill.  However, in the case of doctors it is worth remembering that medical education is expensive and is heavily subsidised by the Exchequer.  Within the general medical service &mdash; the GMS &mdash; however, which is funded by the State, many doctors have overloaded practices, while simultaneously, there is unemployment <Col N="1029" /> and emigration among doctors whose education has been subsidised by the State.  There seems to be a case for examining work-sharing possibilities in the GMS.  Again, I wish to refer to two other professions &mdash; dentistry and nursing &mdash; where there is a substantial amount of State investment in education and training.  More specifically I want to refer to married women with young families who are qualified dentists and nurses. Some of these married professional young women work full-time but find combining the roles of housewife, mother and the full-time professional job a great strain.  Others decide not to take up professional work at all and devote all their time and energy to managing their homes and rearing their children.  The rearing of children is, of course, a vital and priceless function in terms of both the family and the contribution to the country and its future.  I fear that in the ongoing debate on the advancement of women's rights, too little attention and credit is given to the incomparable role that the full-time housewife and mother plays in Irish society.  Having said that, I think that in the case of nurses and dentists who either hold State jobs or would wish to take up such positions of public service and who at the same time are housewives and mothers, every effort should be made by the State to facilitate their participation in the labour force. For example, there are mothers who are also full-time nurses and dentists in this category who would, if the opportunity were provided, welcome the chance to work half-time rather than full-time. There are others who are now full-time housewives and mothers who would wish to work half-time in these professions and use their professional skills.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibilities of facilitating these people in the manner I have suggested.  I feel that for too long our thinking has been too rigid in respect of such positions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the aim of the Bill but remain somewhat sceptical, for the time being at any rate, about its potential value in practice.  As to the specifics of the Bill, the Committee Stage <Col N="1030" /> will afford the opportunity to go into more detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome him although I understand that he has been here on previous occasions.  I also extend a hearty welcome to the Bill, and from the reaction of the first speaker from the Opposition side of the House one anticipates a general welcome, with some reservations, for the Bill.  It is a long overdue Bill because, as has been stated by the Minister of State in his opening remarks, it is the first legislation to be introduced to the Oireachtas since the thirties regulating and stipulating hours of work.  I would also like to extend a welcome to the Bill in the hope that it can achieve its stated aims, one of which is the facilitating of the expansion of employment in the economy.  This again has been welcomed from the other side of the House and must, of course, be welcomed by everybody.</P>
      <P>However, we must guard against over-expectation with regard to the various tenets and what the Bill can, should and is designed to achieve.  The primary aim of the Bill as has been outlined by the Minister of State, is to reduce the working hours in order to streamline things, to make the average normal working week 40 hours and thereby at least to bring us into line with the standards already being applied in Europe.  Initially when one heard and read of the Bill and saw the general public reaction from employers, unions and the media comment, one was taken somewhat aback by the general reserve and from some quarters the general degree of caustic comment in relation to the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by the unions initially was that the working time should have been further reduced to 35 hours per week.  In fairness, this was already alluded to by Senator Hillery.  Many jobs in this country have now reached this standard; indeed, the vast majority of jobs in the public sector, the public service, are below the 35-hour threshold. The main reservation as regards the Federated <Col N="1031" /> Union of Employers seems to have been that overtime is essential in certain jobs and these provisions could, therefore, be overly restrictive.  Again, as has been stated by the Minister of State and Senator Hillery, the 40 hours overtime in any period of four weeks is a relatively generous provision.  When one takes it in conjunction with 100 hours in any 12 weeks I think it is sufficiently flexible and sufficiently generous to accommodate the welfare of all.  The Minister is trying to be fair.  He is trying to strike a balance and to achieve equilibrium and I think in this Bill he has done this.</P>
    <P>As regards whether it will achieve one of its stated objectives, the creation of additional jobs, initially at a press conference the Minister stated that the aim and objective of the Bill would be to achieve something in the region of 10,000 to 12,000 new jobs.  Again I ask that we should not expect too much initially from the Bill.  It is very hard to regulate how precisely the excess hours will be pruned off as a result of the introduction of this legislation, but undoubtedly, given time, the benefits that will accrue from the Bill must percolate into the economy by way of creating additional jobs apart altogether from one aim of the Bill which is to achieve equality, fairness and general equilibrium.  People should see this legislation not as a main job creating factor but as a component in the Government's overall plan to create new jobs.  It must be taken in context with work-sharing, with the general job creation plan and the general drive to create and to stimulate jobs within the economy.</P>
    <P>The elimination of excess overtime and double jobbing must be and is welcomed by all fair-minded people.  Every measure which will assist towards employment must be welcomed.  There will also be a general welcome for the Minister's undertaking in the Bill to provide the necessary personnel by way of departmental inspectors to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are enforced.  Undoubtedly, it will be very difficult and one would like to see the maximum vigilance, <Col N="1032" /> particularly at the outset, in order to ensure that the spirit of the Bill comes through and is enforced.</P>
    <P>The penalties for breaches provide a necessary deterrent.  Those penalties for the employers who abuse the conditions laid down in the Bill are sufficiently prohibitive to ensure that the deterrent objective is realised.  Those penalties for the employee who decides to flout the Bill are sufficiently realisable and realistic to provide the necessary deterrent.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the inbuilt guarantee in the Bill that, where the Minister wishes to extend the classes of workers to which the Act will apply, there will be maximum consultation right across the board, particularly with the two main parties involved in this &mdash; the workers themselves and the employers.  It is a good Bill and a positive Bill.  A very positive aspect is the introduction of the time off provision in lieu of overtime.  It is a Bill that will be hotly debated.  The Minister is a very reasonable person and whatever changes are seen as being reasonable in order to adapt this Bill to provide a framework for future years to determine the normal working week will be accommodated by the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the warm welcome that my colleague, Senator Hillery, has for this Bill.  It is not the first time I am out of step with some of my colleagues on this side of the House while always out of step with my friends on the other side.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for me to make any worthwhile assessment of this Bill.  We seem to be talking over and over again about unemployment and employment and creating jobs.  For the life of me I cannot see how the Minister will create more jobs under this legislation.  I would ask how many jobs might be lost when he is finished, if he gets to implementing it at all. It is not legislation that in fairness could be supported by the real members of the Labour Party.  There is of course confusion about who the real people are in all parties at the moment but I suppose Senators will hear more about that later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will achieve very little in helping <Col N="1033" /> to create jobs but it seems to be sufficient for this Government to give the impression here and in the media tomorrow that they are talking about creating jobs.  They seem to be quite happy that they have done another PR job and we are talking about creating more jobs, even though since this Government came into office we have, I understand, about 45,000 people extra on the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>Are the Government satisfied that the unions are happy about this legislation? Do they know that the FUE, the employer side, are happy with this legislation? It is important to say, even though the Minister is not here, that this was not just thought up by this whizz kid Coalition Government of young Ministers.  We had good Ministers for Labour in Fianna Fáil and this kind of legislation finished up in the dustbin.  Their judgment an odd time is right and I am sure it was quite right on that.</P>
    <P>This Bill will shorten some working hours, therefore giving less in the pay packet of workers.  What will we have then?  We will have more women going out trying to balance up the wage packet to pay for food and clothes, not to mention the VAT which the Minister for Finance saw fit to impose in his budget. There will be extra persons looking for jobs when the pay packet of the man in the house has been lessened.  People will be trying to have two jobs in a house rather than one.</P>
    <P>It is grand to come in here to the Upper House and make a big speech about job creation on the Second Stage of a Bill and go out and say they all swallowed it. Where are the jobs in this legislation? Maybe I am not as bright as the rest of my colleagues.  I understand inspectors are to be appointed to see that this works. I suppose that again is jobs for the boys and the girls.  That is not creating jobs for the young people.  It is another exercise of this Government's practice whereby one day they are creating corporations and another day they have this kind of legislation dealing with the problem of unemployment.  There are no jobs that I can see in this legislation.  Maybe by the time the discussion is finished I will be <Col N="1034" /> convinced about where jobs are being created.</P>
    <P>Certain categories of workers have been singled out, such as those in transport and health.  Does the Minister not see trouble there?  Will this not be another problem of where to draw the line?  Does he not see trouble in giving that kind of concession to certain workers?  He referred in his speech to those engaged in transport of persons or goods and those in essential services. Where do you draw the line in regard to essential services?  Will there not be, as in the case of other Bills the Government have brought in, grey areas, blue areas, white areas and red areas?  I do not know really.  The unions and the FUE, the employers, are deeply concerned about being pinned down to certain hours of work.  There are certain industries &mdash; thank God we still have some left, while we keep closing them down, at least four a week &mdash; that have to have overtime to get their products onto the export market. They are not in the grey area for which there is to be an exception.  If a flexible approach is adopted, this legislation may be undermined.  On the other hand, if a tough approach is adopted, trouble could be caused in the industries to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously on job sharing and I understand that it has worked. It is something that should be looked at again with a view to introducing it in other areas.  I cannot say that I am enthusiastic about the Bill before us.  I am glad we are not taking Committee Stage this evening.  It will give us a chance to take the Bill section by section.  I would appreciate very much if the Minister, who may have thought up this brainchild, were present to listen to our remarks on Committee Stage.  I am sure there will be amendments tabled by the time it is decided to take it.  I cannot say that I wish the legislation well.  I do not feel that way about it.  I am not convinced that there is one extra job in the legislation.  I do not know how it got here with a Coalition Government with good Labour people in it.</P>

      <P>Not for the first time I <Col N="1035" /> substantially share the views expressed by Senator Honan.  Like her I have little enthusiasm for the content matter of the Bill.  I was not in the House when Senator Hillery made his observations, but I listened carefully to Senator Honan's reaction to those observations.  I was rather pleased to conclude that my first criticisms of Senator Hillery were well founded.  In effect when it comes to discussing legislation which is essentially related to industrial relations, he is a refugee from the halls of academe, one who sits in comparative comfort and exercises and weighs judgements on matters on which he will not be asked to prove himself in the market place.  I am pleased that it is agreed only to take Second Stage and that Committee Stage will afford those of us who wish to avail of it the opportunity to put down amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am aware that acute dissatisfaction has been expressed to the Minister by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Despite protestations that consultation has taken place and will take place, it would appear that the level of that consultation was hardly of sufficient strength to cause the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to view the Bill with any degree of comfort.  They have asked me to table a substantial number of amendments to the Bill, which I propose to do on committee Stage. One's perception of the Bill can be highly coloured when regard is taken of the fact that it is one of the rare matters on which employers and trade unions take the same view.  Both employers and trade unions have criticised the Bill substantially as being in need of further distillation in order to make it palatable to those to whom it refers.  As an aid or a panacea for the unemployment problem it fails miserably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout legislation which has connections with employment there has always been, and I have no doubt there will always continue to be, a heavy emphasis of dependence on the private sector.  I have not heard anything in recent months to convince me that the Government have shaken off their Victorian approach to the dignity of work.  It <Col N="1036" /> appears that the Government no longer regard themselves as being under the obligation to provide any of our citizens with employment.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that however powerful the trade unions may be &mdash; I would hope that they are as powerful as I think they are and that their strength will continue to grow &mdash; nevertheless we have not been able to stop the emigration of Ranks, Dunlops or Fords.  These people stand as milestones to the dispassionate approach to the employment situation by the multinationals whom we have lauded in the past.  I do not intend to speak at any great length on the Bill, but to reserve what I have to say to the amendments which I propose to move on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I would like to make.  I am surprised that there is an impression coming from the House that there are objections from the employers and from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Bill, while I would have reservations about it, is an effort to create employment.  It is questionable whether it is doing the right thing but we must readily admit that there are areas of work where an opportunity exists to create employment.  The Bill is really asking whether we can create something for somebody who is not working while asking the person who is working to get so much and leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Bill is preventing people from working overtime when they have the opportunity, but overtime is the area that I would like to question most. How does one define overtime?  To me, work from 5.30 onwards in a factory is overtime.  There are several cases in the Cork area where there were redundancies in particular plants.  Within one month of the redundancies the reduced workforce were working overtime.  How can I stand up here as a public representative and say that the State had to pay back 60 per cent of redundancy payments to one company, while less than two weeks later that company were bringing in the reduced workforce on a seven-day week?  Nobody could ask them to take back for the two days the workers who <Col N="1037" /> were laid off.  Out of a workforce of 66, 17 were laid off, and less than two weeks later the same company had the remaining workforce working seven days. Above a certain income level the worker pays approximately 65 per cent tax, so he gets 35 per cent of his wage for working the two extra days.  The worker may say he does not want to work it because it is not worth it.  Is it not possible to have a situation where we allow the 17 workers who were laid off to work the two days and get the full rate for it?  It would cost the State less.  Can that situation be brought about?  Can we create something like that since the person who is already working is getting enough?  People are readily admitting to me, and I am sure it must be said at trade union meetings and between workers them selves, that it is not worth working overtime because of the tax situation.  How do we answer that?  Is this Bill saying that?</P>
    <P>How do we deal with the question of part-time workers?  An employer has no right to employ anybody on a part-time basis if he is unemployed.  He is breaking the law if he works more than a certain number of hours.  I know of several employers in Cork city who want part-time workers but the people they employ must already be employed.  How stupid can we be?  How silly can we be?  How can anybody stand up and defend something like that?  It may not be for 40 hours or even 20 hours but we could be creating 16 or 18 hours work for people who are not working at present.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, the first priority must be some form of employment. Young people and those who have been made redundant in Dunlops and other places have been saying to me that they will do any type of work so long as they can say to somebody else that they are working.  In some houses there are three of four young people without jobs. We must provide them with some type of work, even if only for 20 hours.  People are objecting and saying that we should not do it, yet the person who is already working overtime says he is not getting enough for it.  He does not want to do it but if he does not do it the production will not be on time.  Which is the priority? <Col N="1038" /> How many people in Cork city alone are employing people on a part-time basis?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of hotels and bar work and shop work on Fridays and Saturdays.  In O'Connell Street in Dublin they wanted to create something and they were not allowed. People were not allowed go to work, even on a part-time basis.  These people could have said they were working, maybe on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  What is wrong with that?  Because they must work the 40 hours between 9 o'clock and 5 o'clock they are deemed not to be working. That is the problem.  In this country if you are not doing a particular thing like everybody else you are not doing it at all. Employers must have the right to employ part-time workers on a legal basis.  It must be legalised.  After so many hours working on a part-time basis an employer can be summoned for giving these people wages.  I do not see any reason why we should not change this position.</P>
    <P>If work is available it must not be the case that some get it all but that the majority of young people get nothing or that any person who is not working must look out for himself.  If there is work available it must be given to the greatest number of people.  I make no apologies to anybody for saying that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>While in theory this Bill would seem to be the answer to some of our problems and the Minister hopes that it will create 3,000 additional jobs, my opinion is that this Bill will not do anything for the unemployed.  Let us start with the legislators.  How many of them are working only 40 hours a week?  Everyone here no doubt works a lot more than 40 hours.  Many of us are involved in business outside or are involved in careers in teaching or other professions. Whether we admit it or not we would be breaking the law as it is proposed.  I would have it broken by Wednesday evening at least in any week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking at this as a Bill to prevent overtime, but many businesses are not able to provide for the extra staff that would be required to prevent overtime. Their business may not allow sufficient work or they may find that their <Col N="1039" /> employees have to work ten or 15 hours a week overtime.  Overtime of 55 hours a week will not create two jobs; it will only create 27½ hours a week and that will bring it back to the part-time employment of which Senator Cregan is talking. Indeed it might reduce employment because the employers might decide to operate a type of black economy which would be created by this Bill where they would pay the person under the counter and not allow for it.  In doing so they would avoid paying tax and PRSI.  At least where somebody's overtime is properly written up and properly charged on their time sheet the State is getting the tax and the PRSI which is due.  If we have legislation which stipulates a maximum number of hours, we will find that employers will write up to the maximum number of hours allowed and pay the person under the counter for the extra hours he or she works.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill is unworkable. People will fiddle to keep themselves within the regulations.  At the moment we see it going on.  We have a black economy which in Europe is second only to that which is purported to exist in Italy. I do not believe that this legislation will do anything to clean up our own black economy.  It will not do anything for the young people who are looking for jobs. I am beginning to wonder when we are going to tackle our main problems.  Overtime is being forced on people.  It is being forced on people to meet mortgage commitments and other family commitments, otherwise they would not be able to meet their repayments.  In many cases people will not go to work unless they feel that they can get a certain amount of overtime per week.  It is a common fact that people need this overtime or need a second job to pay for their commitments.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister make some sort of examination of the position with regard to working wives whose husbands would be in a position to maintain them and their family.  It is a far more pressing legislative matter to do something about the problem of families where both husband and wife hold good positions and leave somebody paid at a <Col N="1040" /> very low wage to mind their family while they are both at work.  If the Minister is serious about doing something about unemployment, this is one area he must look at as well as looking, in conjunction with his colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare, at the black economy.  Because let us be fair about it &mdash; there is no way that this legislation will create one more job for the unemployed.  I would like to know where the Minister intends to recruit the inspectors to carry out the necessary inspections.  Will he recruit them through Manpower and will he recruit them from the Civil Service as it is at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to reject very strongly the arguments put forward by Senator Ellis in his suggestion that a significant response to the unemployment problem would be the penalisation in any way of women who participate in the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not meant as a penalisation of the women who work.  It was a suggestion that the Minister should tackle the problem of families who have double or treble the income necessary for them to have a decent living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question Senator Ellis has advanced would be answered very effectively in terms of a wealth tax or any form of direct taxation but, of course, such taxation measures have encountered the hostility and direct opposition, not once but several times, of the members of his party.  To take this suggestion that the Minister should consider addressing the problem of multiple income &mdash; and Senator Ellis did specify working wives &mdash; the very worst response we could have to the unemployment problem in general would be that we would proceed, like people in a sinking boat, to throw bits and pieces overboard. Some of the last things we would want to throw overboard are the social legislative developments, particularly in the area of women's participation, that we have made through the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some sympathy with people who seize on strategies for the relief of unemployment <Col N="1041" /> in any respect.  It is without a doubt the greatest single challenge which has faced us in the modern historical period.  Indeed, I would argue that in the spring of this year, at the end of April, we reached a new historic level of impact of the unemployment problem in our society when for the first time the number of those who were unemployed, that is 216,000 at the end of April, was a greater number than the number of those at work within industry, which at the end of the same month was 194,000 people.  In many ways this imbalance between those at work within industry and those out of work, in one form or another, challenges us in a new way.  I would like to be very fair to this Bill.  I do not think that the Minister, or the Minister for State in introducing it, suggested that it was a complete or a comprehensive response to the unemployment problem.  I do not think either that he suggests that the main thrust of the Bill is aimed at job creation of such a magnitude as would make a significant impact at the level we would want on the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be amended in some respects.  For example, the published opinions of the Congress of Trade Unions seem to be sensible in a number of areas and this we can discuss on Committee Stage.  However, anyone who is knocking this Bill would want to be careful as to what he is doing, that is, disposing of one of the instruments which could come to bear on the unemployment problem in the years ahead.  The major impact on unemployment will probably be achieved when we have established an effective industrial policy and an effective employment policy.</P>
    <P>The major reports that have been published in recent times, such as the Economic and Social Research Institute's major publication to which every member of the staff submitted an opinion on unemployment, the report of the National Economic and Social Council and the different other semi-leaked and officially leaked documents commenting on Government strategy, including the report of the planning board and so on, all have acknowledged the priority that the unemployment problem should be <Col N="1042" /> given.  I welcome this because for almost a decade now I have argued for the inclusion of the unemployment problem as a main priority within economic planning. There is a well known and recorded debate between people who hold that view and others who argue that the principal purpose of economic management is the reduction of the inflation rate, for example, the reduction of the public borrowing requirement, the elimination of deficits and so forth.  I welcome the new status that has been given to the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>To get to this Bill very directly, in addressing the unemployment problem as I have stated, the features of our industrial policy will be very important and I would share with you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and other Senators who have spoken, a certain impatience at our waiting for an excessively long time for an opportunity to debate industrial policy.  In many ways, those who watch television programmes and heard about the leaked Telesis Report and so forth, have had a better opportunity of debating industrial policy than Members of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I think is a pity.  Within that industrial policy we will have to make clear political and economic choices.  These are going to be very important.  For example, it has been suggested in Killarney by Dr. Michael Killeen, and again recently by Liam Connellan of the Confederation of Irish Industries that the problem of job creation is essentially one of increased competitiveness abroad.  It has been repeated more than once by the Taoiseach, and it is an opinion, by the way, that I do not share.  I agree that increased competitiveness can bring more jobs but I think, no more than this Bill here, increased competitiveness with the present volume of production of exports will not bring you jobs of the magnitude you need.</P>
    <P>What an industrial policy must specify, therefore, is the future pattern of productive activity within the economy, how to make the economy more productive, that will have the effect of creating jobs. For example &mdash; I want to be positive in everything I have to say about the unemployment problem in debates such as this <Col N="1043" />&mdash; I would urge people to speak less about apportioning blame or scapegoating different aspects of the economy in productivity and to address themselves more to the future shape of a productive Irish economy.  I have no doubt whatsoever that you will not be able to get the jobs that you need in the short term, medium term, or long term by relying on expanding traditional manufacturing industry.  More and more, a greater number of jobs are going to lie in the services sector and the growth that will be significant for the economy, that will produce lasting jobs, will probably be in the high technology area and producing services that are internationally traded.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is a word which I am afraid switches people off in this country and for some very good reason.  It is time we drew a distinction between occupation in productive employment in services and employment in the service sector that is not productive.  For example, at present of every 100 people productively employed in this country 17 work in agriculture, 20 in manufacturing industry, ten in building and related activities and 50 in the services sector.  Of course, people examining the structure of employment within the services sector could immediately find unproductive expansions of employment.  I imagine this is possible although I do not think there is any point in concentrating on that.  I have specified what I believe is an area within industrial policy which could yield employment.  In getting to that point there is an important distinction that needs to be drawn.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Leas-Chathaoirleach talking about the effects this Bill will have on income and I feel it will be necessary for us in devising an industrial policy and an employment policy to at last draw a distinction between two quite separate problems, and I hope this Bill is a step in that direction, and that is the distinction between problems of income and problems of employment creation.  It is important to draw that distinction because at the end of the day anybody who favours legislation such as this would not want to drive people, as a result, into the ranks <Col N="1044" /> of the poor.  One would like to sustain household income even if I happen to think that &ldquo;herself&rdquo; has the right to work as &ldquo;himself&rdquo; has but let us call it household income so as not to provoke that issue again.</P>
    <P>If you want to sustain household income there is one kind of problem. Anybody who suggests that you can manage a direct fit between job creation and income distribution is not talking very convincingly at the present time.  Now this is not, to take up Senator Kirwan's challenge, a mere academic speculation. For example, it is calculated that you could create a job in 1960 at a cost of £5,000.  The new investment to labour ratios have changed so much that by the end of the nineties it will cost £500,000 to create a job.  I am sure nobody would want to end this century with the suggestion that only those who have jobs are entitled to income.  The biggest problem about unemployment is undoubtedly the question that when you lose your job you lose income, you lose consumer expenditure power, you lose the capacity to meet your needs and, very significantly, you lose status within the society in terms of the terms in which you participate.  The question of income distribution is one that will challenge politicians of all parties. It is a question of how to meet the needs of a population that we should regard less as a problem than as a resource and how do you dispose of income across this?  If you are going to have fewer jobs then you are going to have units of income distributed throughout the society.  It becomes important to allow people an opportunity to participate in what will be regarded as work not, I suspect, at the end of this century but at the end of the next decade.</P>
    <P>For that reason &mdash; and I rarely welcome sections of Bills &mdash; I welcome the section of the Bill that makes it possible for people to balance activity spent within productive paid employment regarded conventionally as work and other activities. In that we have a clue to the future. If we are to have a productive economy and a satisfying society at the end of the nineties we will have to accept the fact that the activities the people are speaking <Col N="1045" /> about will be characterised by new relationships between productive work, between education for example and leisure. This is all very good.  How could it be regarded as acceptable in a democracy that people would have exhausted all their opportunities to participate in education by the time they were 21 years and that they would spend the rest of their lives working, as it was conventionally called, excluded from the possibility of entering institutions that were paid for by their taxes and so forth?  We have often made this case when discussing adult education.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused of involving myself in an academic speculation about the year 1990 or the year 2000 to the exclusion of a concern for the 216,000 people who were unemployed at the end of April.  I will have a word to say about that in a moment, but I want to state emphatically that it is only the most mindless of people who would not be speculating on what the shape of society will be at the end of the decade and at the end of the farther decade.  We have to think about that and we have to accept the fact that we are not uninfluenced by the applications of technology in industry and the world of work.  We can live with some old daft notions.</P>
    <P>I will give you an example of a favourite prayer in this country.  It comes from the Federated Union of Employers on regular occasions and from the Confederation of Irish Industries as though in chorus, &ldquo;If only the atmosphere was conducive to investment, if only we could create an external environment we would, in fact, have investment and we would have jobs.  We would wake up one morning and we would have job creation going on&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, one report after another &mdash; I am aware of a recent one in University College, Dublin &mdash; has shown that the best incentives in the world will not dislodge money from its little hoarding layers in the Irish banking system into anything like venture capital. Even when, in the Finance Act, there are some suggestions as to how to move it into more productive usages a scream has gone up.  &ldquo;You have not guaranteed us against loss&rdquo;.  These are the entrepreneurs. <Col N="1046" /> In another place I drew a distinction between the &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo; of the sixties and the &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo; of the seventies.  I have never understood the distinction other than a change in accent. But the argument remains the same, and there is no historic evidence whatsoever that they have any natural flair for expansion or risk-taking.  The banking system is by and large a glorified money box, with few capacities within it for investing in Irish venture capital.  I do not want to get irritated or to irritate other people by getting caught on that one.  I will give it as an example of a mantra.</P>

      <P>It is a mantra, it is a repeated something or other to tell you that you are concerned about unemployment. You say &ldquo;keep changing the external environment&rdquo;&mdash; I hear this so often &mdash;&ldquo;an investment will occur and this will lead to jobs&rdquo;.  Then there is a competing prayer coming from the other side: &ldquo;If competitiveness is improved, exports will improve.  Dá bhrí sin we will have more jobs&rdquo;.  With the greatest respect, it deserves a little deeper analysis.  I believe that the electorate, people who are parents, young people and people of all ages, are entitled to an answer as to what the different political parties are saying about the unemployment problem.  I repeat what I said, that at the end of the nineties and later the economy, if it is to survive effectively and productively, and it can, will be one in which it will have defined an area within industrial policy in which it can make a contribution at international level.  This will be overwhelmingly in the services sector.  In agriculture there is room for very effective growth, for example within the food industry as opposed to rather simplified agriculture. What has all of this to do with this present Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to elucidate for you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I was addressing myself to what I hope was not a distraction in your own contribution, in which you were addressing the problem of unemployment rather generally. I was suggesting that we will need debates in the House on industrial and employment policy to deal with those generally.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the direct terms of the Bill itself.  As I said in my opening remarks this Bill has to be seen in the context of that argument.  When we will be looking at the different measures that are appropriate &mdash; I mentioned the medium and long term industrial policy and employment policy &mdash; there is no doubt whatsoever that we will have to remove obstacles to enable the maximum number of people to have access to what employment opportunities are there.  I have acknowledged that there is some merit in many of the amendments that will come up on Committee Stage on this Bill, that it can be improved so that it will not impede people's access to work.  I am very worried about a point raised by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, that it would not have the effect of reduced household incomes.  This is something we can take up again.  The question that is important to my mind is that it is not throwing in the towel in relation to unemployment. I emphasise that.  It is simply an acceptance of the shape of the industrial future. You will need to have legislative instruments that have been amended or are so flexible that they will enable you to respond to the conditions that will arise. I have said that I welcome in particular that section which enables people to balance new time budgets between the world of work, the world of education and the world of leisure.  I would remind the opponents of this Bill that in the 19th century there was a wideapread hostility to people being free from work other than for reading the Bible once a week on Sundays.  We have made progress in undoing what were disgraceful views towards working hours and towards the exploitation of people and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we acknowledge the importance of income maintenance at the same time as <Col N="1048" /> we consider measures like this, then such measures will be good.  There are many capacities in it.  I said I gave a qualified welcome, indeed I can give a rather general welcome to this Bill, with some reservations. That is a more accurate expression of my attitude towards it.  I do want to say that I hope too much is not made of it.  It is a very small measure.  It would be wrong to dress it up in anything more. To give an example, if you lock the question of working hours in an inflexible way to the question of income, if you say to people: &ldquo;You will live on what you get in your wage packet every week&rdquo; then this Bill will fail in many of its measures and many of the results and consequences it will bring about may not be valuable. If you reduce income the imbalance between the top 5 per cent who have access to income and the bottom 5 per cent will grow larger.  Equally the question of access to education will become worse because you will have less money to spend on education, you will have less access to other things in life and so forth. If, however, you are willing to see the connection between income and the cost of services and the transfer system of society as being willing to be broken away from the workplace, then this Bill is nothing but good.  It gives you flexibility, it enables you to do other things, many of which are very good.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the exceptions, it is a good idea that, after consultation with employers and employees, one should be able to add to that list of exceptions should it become necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by saying something about the question of the black economy. When we think of the way people will live in ten and twenty years' time we need to realise, for example, that one of the advantages, if the context is right, that could come from the Bill is that we will not see people in the same jobs for most of their life with the same level of training. The decades that we are entering are ones in which people will be re-training themselves, people will be re-training for different occupations and different emphases on the world of work.  They will need time to leave the world of work <Col N="1049" /> and re-enter educational establishments and institutions.  It is imporant that we acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the opposition to this Bill, I quite understand the impatience of those who want an effective answer to the unemployment problem.  I equally understand people who feel that it may have a detrimental effect on income.  I can take those on board but having borne all those things in mind should the context be right I have no doubt that it would be a significant addition to the armoury of flexible instruments that we will need for balancing new forms of activity between work, education and leisure in the decades ahead.  For that reason I think if we are willing to put the amendments in on Committee Stage, which makes sense, and if we are willing not to demand too much of this Bill I think it could be a welcome reformation of the whole nature and structure of work.  It is too negative entirely to dismiss a Bill like this by simply saying we will not touch matters like this until we have begun to deliver on job creation by the conventional measures.  Making changes like this is a necessary short term response.  It is something we can do within a legislature that will have an effect, I believe, on the unemployment problem.  For those reasons I broadly welcome this measure.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in to hear the entirety of Senator Michael D. Higgins's contribution.  I suspect that if I had I probably would not have to stand up at all because it would have reflected a large part of my own views.  Whether that is a compliment to Senator Higgins I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the last thing he said.  It is far too simplistic for many people, who would describe themselves as being on the radical left, to dismiss any idea such as this being irrelevant because it does not tackle the central problem.  There is a need in talking about this whole area of the relationship between work and income to look not at a kind of nineteenth century model on which &mdash; though I have not read him in any great detail &mdash; I understand most of Marxist analysis is based but to look at a late twentieth <Col N="1050" /> century analysis which is based on an entirely different set of realities.  There is a standard link &mdash; and I think many economists are still caught up in this &mdash; assumed between production and employment and between capital and labour which assumes that if further investment takes places automatically further employment will be generated. There is an assumption, for instance, that if demand picks up in this economy and world economy generally we will automatically have a resultant increase in employment directly in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely, and there is some evidence from our own economy in the last year and in the projections for this year, that quite substantial increases in manufacturing output will produce no increase in employment and, in fact, may result in declines in employment for a reason that I will indicate.  Most of our manufacturing industry has been operating below capacity in recent years, even those in the high technology areas &mdash; microprocessors, microelectronics and things like that &mdash; have suffered to some extent from the winds and the chills of the recession.  However, now that the world economy is moving out of recession there may well be an increase in demand. The assumption is that that increase in demand will produce a consequent increase in demand for labour.  I think it may well be the opposite, it may well give the necessary economic incentive to many employers in manufacturing industry to do the exact opposite, to invest in labour-saving high technology devices which it would not have been economical, because of cash flow problems, to introduce two years ago but which will now be economically attractive and which may result not in further employment but, in fact in a reduction in employment in existing industry.  The consequence will be enormous increases in the capacity to produce wealth, quite unparalleled increases in the capacity to produce wealth, but no resultant distribution of that wealth through employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>Since our taxation structure in the area of manufacturing industry is so favourable <Col N="1051" /> to investors as to virtually render them liable for no corporation profits tax we may well have none of that wealth being distributed within the Irish economy, and since there is an increasing trend for the profits from foreign investment to be repatriated to the country of origin virtually none of the wealth that is being created in this country from high technology modern industry may actually be available to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We must be unique in the world, for instance, in having had a 23 per cent increase in our exports last year and having had a 10 per cent increase in unemployment at the same time.  It is quite an astonishing combination of facts that we can have that sort of volume increase while the volume increase in exports is around 13 per cent, if you take inflation away, and yet have an increase in unemployment. If you take in addition that exports represent close to 50 per cent of our gross national product and we had a 23 per cent increase on exports and at the same time had an overall increase in national growth of about 1 per cent it gives some indication of the astonishing decline in the other sectors of our economy that even with the 23 per cent increase in exports we are still actually in a major recession.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, a number of questions to be asked about the structure of the Irish economy and about how you create employment in the Irish economy which are not addressed at all either by conventional free enterprise, free market economics or indeed by the traditional left wing analysis of production and of economic development because they all assume a direct relationship between investment and employment which is no longer true.  It is quite likely that, in fact, increased investment instead of increasing employment may produce the direct opposite and may reduce employment, more wealth and less employment.  It is true in the industries with which I would have the greatest familiarity, which would be the chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries which is where the limited professional expertise I have would be directed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> It is quite likely that you could, for instance, in the future increase the productive capacity of many of our pharmaceutical industries by 100 per cent or 200 per cent and in the process of that major expansion actually introduce new technology which would result in fewer people being employed at the end than there were beforehand because the whole process could be further automated, modernised and brought under the control of a smaller number of people, so that a smaller employment force could actually be used to produce twice or three times the present rates of production. That is a problem, therefore, that traditional analysis from either the left or the right cannot confront.  It is in that context that I think Bills like the present legislation must be judged in the context of a new reality of the relationship between investment and employment.  That is why the Bill, though it is far from being the remedy to our problems, is a step in the right direction because it at least reflects an initial attempt to think about the new reality that will exist for the rest of the century.  It would be utterly pointless for the trade union movement or the political left in this country to attempt to prevent the changes that are taking place in manufacturing industry from taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I read the Minister's speech and it seemed that many of the things he referred to are things that I have just developed upon but I would not dream of disagreeing with your ruling.  I will confine myself to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, I think, an honest attempt to move in a direction but there are a number of problems contained in it that I think need to be addressed.  There is an assumption that all of those, for instance, who work in two jobs are the well-off, the prosperous and the wealthy.  The trouble is that we may end up penalising those who have already suffered most from the recession by imposing fairly <Col N="1053" /> rigid restrictions on double employment and that many of those who are technically involved in two occupations, like many of us in this House, for instance, who have, as I have, a comfortable salary from another place of employment and also have a salary from this House, and many others in this House who are self-employed and have also a salary from this House are not covered by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand the motives and the intentions of a Bill like this but in terms of public perception of what we are doing, the proposal is that we will not be covered by the provisions of the Bill while somebody working for instance as an attendant in my own place of employment, a regional technical college, earning £120 per week and who works two nights a week in a bar is liable to be covered by the Bill.  That is calculated to give further offence to those who have suffered most from the recession.</P>
    <P>I welcome attempts to restrict overtime. Such a move has been a long term demand of the trade union movement but I have often wondered how sincere large sections of the trade union movement have been about this demand. Nevertheless it has been the official policy of the trade union movement, at least that part of it with which I have been mostly involved &mdash; the local council of trade unions in Cork.  Consistently for many years they have been calling for statutory restrictions on overtime.  I am glad, therefore, that some attempts have been made to restrict overtime but I am extremely concerned that a well intentioned attempt to restrict double jobbing would end up penalising, not those who can afford comfortably to live on one income, but those who are struggling to live on one-and-a-half small incomes.  We will have to look at the provisions for double jobbing contained in this Bill when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I had a number of other points to make but in deference to your ruling I will leave them to another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will <Col N="1054" /> begin by thanking all those Senators who contributed to the debate.  It has been a worthwhile debate, by and large, a nonpartisan debate, during which a number of very constructive and worthwhile contributions were made.  For my part, I will consider very carefully the points which have been raised and see whether it is open to me on Committee Stage to introduce amendments to take account of some of the concerns expressed by Senators. In any event, Senators participated in this debate in an open minded fashion and I will be equally open minded when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Michael Higgins who summarised his attitude to the Bill as being that he gave it a general welcome with some reservations.  That is a fair summary of the attitude taken by the Seanad as a whole.  Senator Higgins went on to say he hoped that not too much would be made of the Bill, that it would not be over sold.  That is a very reasonable request.  I do not want to be accused of committing that offence, of over-selling the Bill and making too much of it.  It is a step and it is on that basis that I commend the Bill to the Seanad.  Contrary to what has been suggested, I make no claim that the Bill represents a panacea for all our problems.  Manifestly it does not but it invites us, first us as legislators, and then the community as a whole, to address ourselves to a question of some importance.  That question is whether, in the present economic climate, the persistent and systematic working of overtime can be socially justified. I invite the Seanad and the community to say that they set their faces against that practice.</P>
      <P>One of the strengths of the Bill will be not so much the specific detailed provisions but in a sense its educational effects in that it invites all of us to consider what approach we take to that question and to accept that equity makes demands of us in the present climate and that at a time when the amount of work available is limited, it is inappropriate that work should be concentrated in a few hands while there are so many hundreds of thousands without any work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> We do have some problems in meeting some of the points made by Senators, notwithstanding my desire to be open minded.  I think it was Senator Honan who expressed the hope that the Minister who conceived this Bill would be present for the Committee Stage of the debate. The rules and procedures of the Seanad do not allow for the presence in the Chamber of the Opposition spokesman for Labour during the Committee Stage of the debate but this Bill's legislative origin was as far back as October 1980. It had its origin in the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development.  In paragraph 16 of that document, the Government of the day gave a commitment to have discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employer organisations on hours of work legislation and to circulate the text of the Bill to reduce the statutory limit on working hours during the first parliamentary session of 1981 for early enactment.</P>
    <P>I have no idea what happened subsequent to that commitment during the lifetime of that administration but since the change of Government, Opposition spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald has, on a weekly basis, demanded that the Government bring in this legislation as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In considering the political history of the legislation, it is proper that I should say something about the response the Bill has received from the social partners. Listening to some contributions, one might have thought that the reception received was a hostile one.  I do not think that would be a fair summary of the response of either the FUE or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It does not represent, most particularly, the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Senator Kirwan commented that it was unusual to find a situation where the employers and unions found themselves united in unhappiness with the measure. It is true that there is a degree of unhappiness from both of those bodies.  However, the Senator did not go on to say that the unhappiness stems from the fact that the employers feel the Bill is too <Col N="1056" /> restrictive and that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions feel it does not go as far as they would wish.  At least we have established beyond doubt that that is the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; a welcome in principle for the Bill but a desire to see it go further.  On 11 April, 1984, <i>The Irish Press</i> summarised reaction to the Bill when it stated in respect to the reaction from the ICTU that although the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomed the Bill, saying it was long overdue, they regretted the Minister did not use the opportunity to reduce further the level of working hours.</P>
    <P>That is a fair summary of their position: They are glad that the Bill is there but they wished that it had gone further.  I know they are uneasy about some of the categories of work that have been excluded from the Bill and I have no doubt that there will be much to say about that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is that response from the social partners, that the employers are concerned that perhaps we have been unduly restrictive, while the trade unions are anxious that we be more restrictive and go further, shows how delicate a task faces any Government in introducing legislation of this kind.  Any move to re-organise working time designed to ensure that the existing pool of work is made available to more people requires the most careful consideration. Were working hours to be too rigidly controlled, this would have the effect of creating difficulties for employers, difficulties in regard to the efficient operation of their undertakings and perhaps difficulties in the matter of their operating costs.</P>
    <P>What is required then is that we strike a balance.  I am glad to say I was not the one to have to say that we thought we had got the balance right.  It was Senator Jim Higgins who made that claim on my behalf.  On the last occassion when I said that I thought that the Government had got the balance right in respect of a particular piece of legislation, I saw that <i>Magill</i> magazine quoted me as saying it and suggested that I would be better off out hunting for a job instead of being cocooned in Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> I do think that we have succeeded in treading that path between the two dangers that faced us &mdash; the possibility that the Bill would be so open ended as to be ineffective and the possibility that it would impose unreasonable restrictions on enterprises and as a result do the very opposite to what we had intended.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could comment very briefly on some of the specific points made by Senators.  Senator Hillery in his very helpful remarks referred to the positions of nurses and dentists.  The position is that a decision was taken to exclude these people from the operations of the Bill because of the essential nature of the service provided.  There are views taken that it would obviously be wrong to lay down limits in areas where emergencies can be so clearly anticipated and where of course human life in those circumstances could be at risk.</P>
    <P>The fact that those particular categories of workers will not be covered by the Bill does not mean there is not the same obligation to address themselves to the social policy behind the Bill and to see how their working arrangements can be so organised as to maximise employment opportunities.  The remarks the Senator made in relation to the possibility of work-sharing in that whole medical and para-medical area are appropriate and will be considered further.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan was a little dismissive of the Bill, a little harshly dismissive of it.  She suggested that it was improbable that the FUE and the ICTU knew very much about this Bill at all and wondered how they had ever allowed it to get through.  Let me say here that the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been consulted very fully about this Bill, that there has been, in fact, an exhaustive process of consultation on the measures in this Bill.  That has been worthwhile consultation.  For example, one provision &mdash; it is proper that credit be given where it is due &mdash; that has received particular welcome from the Seanad is the proposal to negotiate for allowing time off in lieu of overtime.  That was introduced to the Bill at the joint suggestion of the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish <Col N="1058" /> Congress of Trade Unions.  Therefore, it is not the case that there was no consultation. There was consultation, very substantial consultation, as a result of which the Bill before the House is an improvement on what is otherwise might have been.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis was the other Senator who was particularly critical of the measure. I have to join at the outset with Senator Michael Higgins in rejecting the suggestion that any solution or any progress towards a solution in relation to unemployment can be achieved by targeting a particular group of people&mdash; married women &mdash; and suggesting that their exclusion from the workforce offers a way forward.  It does nothing of the sort and it is not an option that will be considered by this Government nor, I suspect, by a Government of any conceivable shade that is likely to be elected in the future.</P>

      <P>On the point made by Senator Ellis that there is an opportunity to circumvent the legislation, that there is a possibility that some unscrupulous people will find ways around it, I do not deny that that possibility may exist but I very much hope that people will not be so unscrupulous.  Anyone who is tempted to be so unscrupulous or to behave in such a fashion should not ignore the fact that the inspectorate of my Department will be enforcing the provisions in the Bill, that the Bill will give them substantial powers to enforce its provisions effectively and that the Bill also provides for effective deterrents against the sort of activity contemplated by Senator Ellis.  I hope that anyone tempted in that direction will think twice about the matter and not proceed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred particularly to the question of employment on a part-time basis of people who are already in other employment.  The point made by <Col N="1059" /> him is well taken and I can only say that I trust that the provisions of this Bill governing double-jobbing will help to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Very many of the other contributions took the form of saying that the Bill was welcome so far as it went, that there were particular aspects in respect of which individual Senators had reservations and that they would want to address themselves to those areas on Committee Stage.  I began my remarks by saying that on Committee Stage I would be anxious to hear the views of Senators and to respond as constructively and helpfully as possible.  I look forward to that debate and I thank Senators for their contributions on this Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>An lá faoi dheireadh bhí mé ag caint ar an mBille seo nuair a chuir mé deireadh leis an díospóireacht.  Bhí an chuid is mó de mo óráid tugtha agam ach tá cúpla focal eile le rá agam inniu.  In discussing the Bill the last day I had not reached the stage where I wanted to ask the Minister to ensure that this Bill gets off the ground by making sure that the lessors, those who have land to lease, will not suffer any disadvantage when it comes to social welfare benefits.  The one snag that hangs over land questions in <Col N="1060" /> Ireland is that people are inclined to hold on to what they have in case they do not have an income of some sort or other. Many of these people are the people who are going to be in the category of getting social welfare pensions.  I would like to ensure that those who are in the position of leasing their land will feel very confident and will be encouraged to do so not just on a negative line.  As well as that, I feel that many of the people who will lease the land will be young farmers, farmers' sons perhaps who will not have working capital and who will have to spend more than the ordinary farmer because much of the land they will be taking over will be land that has been neglected down the years.  I would think that it could be a help to them if they were given an incentive, perhaps an income tax incentive if they are at that stage, that would encourage them to take the risk of taking on land that would demand extra expenditure and extra care.  They are the two main points that I wish to raise today.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will help in disadvantaged areas though I am not too sure whether a disadvantaged area is a place to benefit from land-leasing.  But I would ask the Minister again to ensure that the whole concept of what constitutes a disadvantaged area is looked at because low incomes and falling population, as I said on the previous day, is not necessarily the real test.  People are building houses in areas that are disadvantaged.  In my own area, in the plateaux, Castlecomer, which is very high and where, as a result, there is more rain, where the weather is cooler, where growth is later in the year, people are building because they work in industries in Carlow and Kilkenny.  If the Minister could get that changed he might help a lot as well to encourage people to even lease land there because there would be better grants there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, one of the Opposition speakers said about our Minister some time ago that he was like a train driver with no train.  That was the first lesson I got on why CIE have failed, because obviously since the Minister is the first Minister to change the laws of 1870 and 1881 we must have had no trains and <Col N="1061" /> certainly no train drivers since we founded the State.  I should like to compliment him at least on taking on the very difficult job of driving a train without having a train and tackling what is a very major problem.  I hope that his work will be rewarded.  It is very easy to say that the Bill is not as imaginative as people would need but at least we are taking on Bills of 1870 and 1881.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in building up a head of steam and doing 60 miles an hour to help the land question in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this Bill.  I regard it as one that is heading for a sudden end.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for this. The Bill, as it is proposed, will not work for a number of reasons.  The first reason is that if you take a farm of land which is leased to somebody, no doubt the owner of that farm will want to get a realistic income from it.  Where is there going to be sufficient incentive for a farmer to be able to give a reasonable leasing value for a farm of land to the owner and still have sufficient funds left for the necessary capital investment, to develop that farm and to stock it?  This is where the major problem will arise.  The Bill itself may have a number of good points but this is the main point &mdash; that it will mean that the smaller farmers who have not the capital available to them will not be in a position to take those seven-year leases on other farms.  The other side of it is that a farmer who leases and then has to go into the bank and borrow money at 15 per cent to stock the farm or to improve it may find at the end of the seven-year lease that the lessor will no longer renew the lease.  What is he to do with the cows that he has bought to put on the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent developments at European level will act as a disincentive to farmers to engage in this type of expansion.  We all see that the Common Agricultural Policy is under threat with regard to the super levy.  The fact is that if a farmer who is engaged in dairying takes an adjacent farm of land and increases his milk output by over the limit, he will put himself in a situation where he will be penalised. The Minister will not be in a position <Col N="1062" /> to provide any exemption to that farmer to allow him to expand and to make use of land which in many cases is not being used to its full potential.  Indeed the 11-month system is totally against good farm management, because what happens is that farmers take the land knowing that if they make any improvement to it they will face the possibility of somebody else coming in and reaping the benefit by putting up the price.  The present situation and the present threat to the Common Agricultural Policy means that there will not be any incentive.  We hear rumours of threats to beef production for next year.  What are the farmers engaged in that activity to do?  Farmers will expand to the edge of the guideline but will not go any further.  This seems to be the basic problem, and it will be the problem until such time as they are guaranteed that they will get the maximum price for what they produce.  We have seen recent happenings with regard to incentives to farmers, for instance, the question of the lime subsidy.  The first thing a farmer taking land on a seven-year lease would have to do would be to apply lime and manure to the land.  Now we see that the lime subsidy is being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Government who had made a provision in their budget have not yet committed themselves to a reduced subsidy for lime and fertilisers.  There is, too, the withdrawal of the AI subsidy.  That is another disincentive to farmers to expand.  What we are heading for here is finding that this scheme with all its good intentions will fail due to the lack of finance available at a reasonable cost to the person who would lease these farms and try to improve them.  We are talking about farms that are not capable of generating two incomes.  People working an extra farm of land must have the necessary financial incentive if they are to see something reasonable for their work.  It is an old Irish saying that one is as well to sit idle as to work idle.  That is the sort of situation we are heading for with regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to tackle the problem but a more beneficial system would have been to tackle it possibly through adjustment in the Land Commission <Col N="1063" /> structure which he proposes. There should have been developed a system whereby these farmers would be given money at reduced interest rates to purchase those farms and develop them in the secure knowledge that they were the owners of those farms and were not going to find themselves outside the gate after seven years.  Seven years, while it may seem to some people a long time, is a very short time in regard to farming.</P>
    <P>What I would say to the Minister is that in view of the present situation he should go back to the Department and ask them to have another look at the Bill, to see if the necessary finance will be available to provide the incentive that is needed whether by means of prices for produce or by means of subsidy towards the development of these farms.  It is obvious from the Bill that the people who will take this land are not the small farmers whom the legislation is designed to help, because they will not be in a position to raise the finance necessary to carry out improvements or to stock the farms. Those people who will take the long-term leases will be the large farmers who will be in a position to move and to carry the necessary capital investment from their own resources.</P>
    <P>These are the major problems that face us with regard to land leasing.  They are bigger problems than the problems of land ownership, which has been a major bone of contention.  What we will see coming from this Bill is a position in which farmers will not take long term leases due to the uncertainty and the unstable situation with regard to agriculture and due to a fear that at the end of the lease, having spent six or seven years developing and improving a farm, it may be taken from them by the lessor who will have a nephew, a niece, a brother or a sister who will come in and say &ldquo;hold that farm for me&rdquo; and put the tenant on the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill and indeed in welcoming the policy which underlines it &mdash; the policy of this Government to ensure that the natural resources of this country are used to the maximum.  In great measure <Col N="1064" /> that is what points to the difference between the policy of this Government in many areas and the policy of their predecessors.  This Government believe that the natural resources of this country must be used to the maximum and that people who have the opportunity of using these natural resources are given every assistance to use those resources properly, whether they be in the area of forestry, of fisheries, peat development or above all, our most important resource, the land.  This Government by giving every support possible will continue to ensure that people will use that resource constructively and properly.</P>
      <P>Despite what the previous speaker said, I look on this Bill as being one measure along the road in that direction, one measure which is an indication of this Government's commitment to ensure that our most important natural resource, namely our land, can be used and used properly.  The word &ldquo;cobwebs&rdquo; has been used.  We must wipe away the cobwebs from the structures surrounding the land and the use of land.  We must make land a little more free to ensure that those who have the ability to use it do so properly. The Taoiseach was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 March 1984 as speaking the previous day at the annual conference of the Regional Studies Association in Dublin when he spelled out the position of the Government regarding land.  I quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We cannot afford to see it lying idle or under-utilised on any wide scale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Too much of our land was not being used productively and the first objective of any new land policy must be to promote the most efficient use of land. A greater degree of land mobility was the necessary first step.</P>
      <P>That remark from the Taoiseach underlines the policy behind this Bill.  The Minister of State must be complimented for the work he has undertaken in 18 months in office, not merely in promoting this Bill but in promoting many other measures which will see legislative form in the months to come and will allow greater mobility in land and reform a land structure badly in need of reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> It may be no harm to refer to the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the same day, 31 March, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The scheme of medium term land leasing which the Government has introduced should go a considerable way towards achieving this aim.  It will encourage a greater mobility &mdash; a passing of underused land to active, adventurous men and women, and hopefully it will end the short term pernicious letting of acreage, which leads to ill use and impoverishment of the soil.</P>
    <P>Listening to the last speaker I understood that he approved of the 11-month system. I come from the same part of the country as he comes from and I regard the 11-month system as one which leads to nothing but damage to our land.  People enter lands on the 11-month system and they do nothing to fertilise those lands or to maintain them in any way, because their tenure there is so short and their aim is simply to get the maximum advantage out of the lands which they occupy.  This measure is important in that it facilitates the leasing of land for agricultural purposes for a reasonable period.  That is to the advantage of the tenant and the owner of the land in that the land which is occupied is not damaged in any great way.  I also welcome the amendments to other legislation contained in this Bill which streamline procedures and remove certain statutory inhibitions from the letting of land.</P>
    <P>Particularly in the west in many circumstances it is not convenient for the owner of land actively to farm that land, especially in a part of the country where we have a high proportion of farmers who are not active because they are elderly and perhaps unmarried and have not had the benefit of up-to-date agricultural education.  In many of these circumstances there is a genuine fear that if the land is let on anything other than an 11-month system the owner of the land may never regain possession of it.  There is a fear of the creeping Land Commission official &mdash; I mean simply the Land Commission official who cannot be seen.  There is a fear that a notice of inspection will be <Col N="1066" /> served and that somebody who lets his land may ultimately lose ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>The great benefit of this Bill is that if the powers which it introduces are properly understood people in the west and other parts of the country where we have this type of land owner will appreciate that that danger is no longer present. That must be accepted, bearing in mind the whole history of land in this country. All of us are aware of the importance that the Land Acts played in our history, particularly in the 19th century.  We are all aware of the tremendous grá which most people in this country have for the land.  We are all aware of the desire that people have to hold on to land which they have and not to lose it under any circumstances. That gradh and historical background must be understood by any Government trying to reform our land structures.  If we try to reform without understanding that and the history of Irish land, then we will get nowhere.  It is no harm to remember that it is only 110 years since Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell were coming together to fight for independent ownership of Irish land, and that is a very short time ago. We all know and still meet people who have very definite memories of the land war period.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in this Bill are good when, to be realistic about it, the Land Commission at the moment have not very much money to acquire land. Last year we passed a measure in this House to make more funds available to the Land Commission, but I think that that measure was academic because the money is not there to allow it to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Ellis to the fact that young farmers at the end of the seven-year period would be more or less on the road.  I do not accept that.  If we develop the concept of land leasing and if the market for land leasing increases &mdash; and it should increase &mdash; then there would be more land for leasing on the market.  Any young farmer who would lease land for a period, make use of it and gain by his experience would then be in a position either to buy land <Col N="1067" /> for himself from the money he has made during his lease period or to lease other land.</P>
    <P>The role of the Land Commission in this is important.  The Land Commission are a body who have come in for a great deal of criticism, some of it justified and some of it unjustified.  The Land Commission must make people aware of what is behind this idea and ensure that there is an adequate supply of land on the leasing market.  It is extremely important that the Land Commission, as the relevant agency, go to the farmers, the landholders who have land available, explain to them what is behind this measure and encourage them to put their land on the market so that the owner of the land is aware that at the end of the day he will not be losing what he and his forefathers fought so hard to achieve and to maintain. Perhaps the ACC could play a role here to ensure that funding is available, and the Government and the Minister could negotiate with them to ensure that a suitable package is made available to tie in with this scheme.  Reference has been made by other speakers to the financing of this scheme.  The scheme of land leasing will work but money must be made available to finance it.</P>
    <P>I have made reference earlier to the question of elderly farmers.  One of the problems that this scheme will face is the danger that elderly farmers may feel that by leasing their land and obtaining a substantial rental income from it they may lose out on social welfare benefits.  That is one of the reasons why the farm retirement scheme which was introduced about ten years ago did not prove as successful as it should have proved.  Some steps must be taken to ensure, on a trial basis at least, that income from land leased for a certain period would not in any way damage certain categories of land owners' social welfare entitlement.  If it debars them from social welfare entitlement then I can see this scheme running into certain difficulties and it will not be successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis said that large farmers would be the people who would lease land and that the young farmer would not <Col N="1068" /> have the opportunity to do so.  From the reading of the Bill it seems to me that the power of the Land Commission under section 12 of the 1965 Land Act still exists.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  Will every lease still be subject to Land Commission consent?  If every lease is subject to Land Commission consent I would like to see the Minister establishing pretty general criteria which the Land Commission would adhere to in giving their consent for land leases.  I would certainly be worried if the very big farmers were involving themselves in leasing and the provisions of this Bill were not being made available for the younger and less well off farmer.  If the power contained in section 12 remains then I would like to see criteria being established by which consent would be given.</P>
    <P>It is important that the role of the Land Commission in this be carefully stated. There is a fear that if land is leased or is used by anybody other than the registered owner, the Land Commission will serve an inspection notice and take steps to acquire the lands.  I would like the Minister's view on this and his assurance that in the event of anybody leasing land, at the end of the lease period the Land Commission will not be coming around threatening the registered owner with a notice of inspection or a take-over of the land in question.</P>
    <P>If we are to encourage the passing of land&mdash;perhaps this is slightly outside the scope of the Bill &mdash; and earlier transfer of land from one generation to another, certain areas of policy also need to be looked at.  The Government have taken certain steps which might not have been helpful in that direction.  I am referring in particular to certain stamp duty reliefs which have been effected by recent Finance Acts and budgets.  The Minister, as the person responsible for restructuring of land and reform of land occupation, should take steps to ensure that certain provisions existing in the area of stamp duty, which are not encouraging to people to transfer in their lifetime should be looked at once again.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Land Commission procedures in so far as the compulsory acquisition of lands is concerned <Col N="1069" /> should be reformed.  They are the most archaic, unworkable and ridiculous procedures existing.  I say that as a solicitor who has had many dealings with the Land Commission examiners branch dealing with matters of this nature.  Recently I had the opportunity of attending a meeting of the law society with other Oireachtas solicitors.  Dealing with this Bill, that point was raised very trenchantly.  Totally outmoded procedures which exist in the Examiners Branch of the Land Commission should be changed.  Many people whose lands have been acquired by the Land Commission complain that they have been held up for years, not getting their land bonds.  The reason for delays frequently lies with legal people, but these delays in turn lie with unworkable procedures.  Everybody would be well served if these procedures were reexamined.</P>
    <P>I am a little curious about section 4 of the Bill which relates to land purchase annuities and gives the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture power to waive annuities of less than £2 in any one year.  My understanding was that annuities of less than £2 had been abolished by the Land Commission approximately two years ago and that everybody with an annuity of less than £2 received a letter from the Land Commission informing him that he had received automatic redemption without paying anything.  Why is this provision now contained in the Bill when something of that nature has been operational? Secondly, I wonder why the £2 figure is contained in the Bill.  The Minister might consider an amendment on Committee Stage which would increase the £2 to another figure which would give future Ministers in a few years time, with increasing inflation, the power to consider the abolition of annuities which at that time would be of a very small amount.</P>
    <P>The payment of an annuity by a landholder creates a feeling that is less than a fee simple owner and that the Land Commission have a power which they do not have.  It would be no harm if the Minister or the Land Commission could have a circular sent to all occupiers of <Col N="1070" /> land in the country indicating the redemption value of their annuities at present and encouraging people to purchase out these annuities.  A substantial section of the Land Commission in Michael Davitt House in Castlebar is concerned purely with dealing with the collection of annuities.  The sooner these things are cleaned up the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7 which deals with the dissolution of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund.  I understand that when the Government of Ireland Act was passed in 1920 the fund existing at that time was apportioned as between the Irish Free State, as it then was, and the Six Counties.  I am wondering as a matter of curiosity if the fund still exists in Northern Ireland.  This seems to be another area where our laws are now changing and I wonder if the laws there have changed in the same direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as one of the measures the Minister is taking to reform the whole land structure.  He must be complimented for introducing it and for the steps he has taken in relation to the division of commonages which will also make land available and ensure that land as a natural resource is more properly used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill states:</P>
      <P>As part of its overall land policy the Government has launched an intensive programme to promote and encourage leasing so as to get under-utilised land into the management of those who will use it to optimum advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say at the outset that I am disappointed that the Bill does not contain any incentive which will promote and encourage leasing.  The main purpose of the Bill is to remove from the Statute Book or to amend certain provisions of previous Land Acts which could be regarded as obstacles to leasing.  It is also proposed in the Bill to streamline some Land Commission procedures, thereby facilitating re-vesting and the exchange of land.  The Bill further provides for the <Col N="1071" /> modification of section 80 of the Building Societies Act, 1976 by providing that the existence of charges on land in favour of the Land Commission should not debar a building society from advancing a mortgage on a property so charged.  All the proposals contained in the Bill are desirable and worthy of support, but it is disappointing and to be regretted that the Bill does not contain a single positive incentive to promote or encourage land leasing as a standard land management practice.  The Bill could be considerably strengthened by the inclusion of positive incentives which would encourage leasing.</P>
    <P>It has been said many times during the course of the debate that land is the greatest natural resource we have and that agriculture is of fundamental importance to the economy.  It is estimated that 3½ million acres is under-utilised and that of that 3½ million acres approximately 1 million acreas are let on the 11-months system and the remainder is being farmed at a very low level of efficiency, mainly by elderly farmers who in most cases are unmarried or without direct heirs.  On the other side of the coin we have a considerable number of trained, energetic young farmers who are anxious to start up in farming and who, because of the very rigid land tenure system, have very little opportunity to do so.  I agree that it is very difficult at present for young, trained farmers to get an opportunity to start in farming, particularly if they are landless at the moment.  The only opportunity that such a young person has to get land for farming is through inheritance, purchase or leasing.</P>
    <P>We must have a land policy which will encourage the greatest possible degree of land mobility through each of those three sources.  Incentives could be provided which would generate greater mobility of land through inheritance.  The most effective incentive that could be provided which would generate greater mobility of land through inheritance.  The most effective incentive that could be provided would be an effective or attractive farm retirement scheme.  The farm retirement scheme that we had was an absolute failure. First of all, the fixed sum which was paid lost its value through inflation as the pension which the retired farmers <Col N="1072" /> received lost its value.  The farmers, of course, lost their entitlement to social welfare and health benefits, medical cards and so on, with the result that farmers who retired under that farm retirement scheme very soon saw that their neighbours who had held on to their land, had qualified for the old age pension and were qualified to hold medical cards, were better off than they were.  The farm retirement scheme we had was a total failure, but an attractive farm retirement scheme could be a great incentive to making more land available.</P>
    <P>An attractive farm retirement scheme could encourage the phased transfer of ownership and management from elderly owners to prospective heirs, and the earlier transfer of lands, particularly if it were linked to some sort of establishment grant for the young farmer setting up in farming.  If the farm retirement scheme were attractive enough and if an attractive establishment grant were available to a young farmer many present owners would be prepared to release their land either immediately or on a phased basis to their prospective heirs.</P>
    <P>The chances of a young, landless farmer being able to start up in farming through acquiring land by purchase on the open market is very remote in that the return from land is low in relation to the cost of land.  Even though land prices have dropped somewhat in the last few years they are still very high in relation to the income that farming can generate. However many progressive small and medium farmers need additional land to carry out their development plan.  For farmers who have already achieved a high level of performance on their existing holdings, the best opportunity to get extra land is either through purchase or through leasing.  Aid should be made available to enable or assist such farmers to compete on the open market for the very small volume of land which becomes available in that way.  A land purchase subsidy should be devised which would enable them to be competitive for land which might become available adjacent to their existing holdings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the encouragement that the Minister has given to the idea of group <Col N="1073" /> purchasing although I feel that, particularly in the west, the opportunities for group purchase may not be very many. However, where such an opportunity presents itself every assistance should be given to the group of farmers involved, particularly when, through the group purchase of land which comes on the market, fragmentation of existing holdings can be eliminated.  Fragmentation is a very great inhibiting factor of development, particularly where the amount of land in the farmer's possession is limited.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that leasing offers the best prospect for young, energetic farmers to start up in farming.  Leasing has definite advantages for both lessor and lessee.  The lessor is assured of a fixed income which will, to some degree, keep pace with inflation and for him leasing has very definite advantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 11-months system.  As far as the lessee is concerned, a much smaller investment is involved than if he becomes involved in purchase of land: the investment is phased over a number of years and he has a certain fixity of tenure for the term of the lease.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assurance that the Land Commission will not become involved in the acquisition of land which is made available for leasing.  In this regard I suggest that the Land Commission might keep a register of lands which would be available for leasing in the respective Land Commission office areas, and that an assurance would be given to the people involved that if this land was on the Land Commission register of land available for leasing there would be no question of acquisition proceedings being instituted in respect of that land.  Some of the land which might in favourable circumstances become available for leasing will be owned by people such as widows with young families.  That land will be available for leasing for only a certain number of years and subsequent to that period a member of the owner's family may then return to farming it.  Therefore, it would be in everybody's interest if the Land Commission were to be the body charged with keeping up to date a register of land available for leasing, but I emphasise that very positive assurances must be <Col N="1074" /> given that there would be no question of acquisition proceedings being instituted in the case of such land.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a climate of confidence exists which would encourage leasing at the moment.  We hear and read every day of the number of farmers who are in financial difficulties.  I believe that most of the land which will become available for leasing will be in a very low state of fertility and will require fairly big investment of capital in order to bring its fertility up to what it should be.  Therefore, a certain amount, probably a considerable amount, of borrowing will be involved by the young farmer who is leasing the land.  With all the talk of farmers in financial difficulties there is a reluctance on the part of even the most energetic young farmers to become involved in borrowing.</P>
    <P>We have problems with the disease eradication schemes because when an outbreak of disease occurs the level of compensation is so low that great financial problems are created for that farmer.  It would be an incentive to leasing and an incentive to the restoration of confidence in farming generally if the level of compensation for reactor animals under the disease eradication scheme were brought up to what it should be.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy, and farmers, particularly those in dairying, are not at all confident or certain as to what the future holds. Then there are tax disincentives in operation too, and in the past few weeks we have seen the withdrawal of the lime and the AI subsidies.  All these factors have created a lack of confidence in farming, and while that lack of confidence exists I cannot see leasing taking off.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is in earnest and genuinely wants to encourage leasing.  I have heard him speak on this matter on a number of occasions and I know he has a very genuine interest in seeing every acre of land utilised to its maximum potential and every genuine young farmer being given the opportunity to put his skills to work.  However, much more <Col N="1075" /> will have to be done to encourage leasing than is being done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A realistic farm retirement scheme will have to be introduced and social welfare and tax incentives will have to be provided for both lessor and lessee.  In the case of lessees an establishment grant would be a major incentive.  Finance for development at realistic interest rates is absolutely essential, and there should also be tax incentives to encourage young people to become involved in leasing.  If the right incentives were provided &mdash; I accept that in order to provide these incentives finance would have to be made available &mdash; greater land mobility would be encouraged through leasing and land would come into the hands of people who would farm it more efficiently and productively than it is being farmed at present. If that were to happen there would be a considerable increase in agricultural output, with consequential benefits for the economy.</P>
    <P>Whereas everything that the Bill contains is desirable and worthy of support, I am disappointed that incentives which we were expecting are not contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural representative I have taken a keen interest in this whole subject of land leasing ever since it was introduced and mooted some time ago.  I compliment the Minister on his initiative and I am sure that a lot of this initiative stems from that fact that he is a rural TD himself and is very much aware that so much of our land is lying idle.  This is probably one of the main reasons for the introduction of this Bill, and there is a general awareness among all of us that if we are to reach our potential as a nation, all our natural resources will have to be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having looked at the concept of leasing for the past four weeks, I am very struck by the fact that our EEC partners have a very comprehensive system of land leasing, especially in France where the percentage of owner-occupied land is just 51.8 per cent and the percentage of tenant-occupied land is 45.9 per cent.  In Belgium the percentage of owner-occupied land is 28.6 per cent and the percentage <Col N="1076" /> of tenant-occupied land is 71.4 per cent.  It is worth noting from the figures of the other EEC countries that Ireland has the slowest rate of change in the number of farm holdings and that the rate of change is five times greater for countries where long-term leasing is established than in Ireland.  Most of the 8 per cent of tenancy in this country is under the conacre system, and this is probably the least satisfactory form of land tenure.</P>
    <P>The law which governs the relationship between the owner and the tenant is quite complex in its nature.  In reading the Dáil debate on land leasing when the then Minister for Lands, Mr. Childers, made a genuine effort to introduce a concept of land leasing, I was very much taken by the fact that James Dillon, the Opposition spokesman on agriculture, pointed out that this could bring back landlordism in some form.  Some people here today expressed similar sentiments.  This was a very genuine fear.  Any man giving a long-term letting of his land was thereby putting the security of his farm into jeopardy, and people were quite genuine about this fear.  Farmers were fearful that in parting with their land the tenant might try to take control of the land, and in some cases farmers who leased land on a long-term basis had this experience.</P>
    <P>Since the 1936 Land Act, a tenant taking a letting of land by law could not establish ownership according to that Act, but as we know he could avail of other tenant rights hidden away in the Land Acts of the late 19th century, and these are set out in the explanatory pamphlet. For example, a tenant could claim for compensation for improvements or disturbance and he could demand the right to sell his tenancy.  One of the reasons this Bill was introduced was to remove these inhibiting forces.  Of course these laws were meant to protect the right of the tenant, but now that most of the land is owner-occupied they are no longer needed.  These laws defeated a legitimate scheme to release the land that is now frozen.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why the 1958 initiative failed was that these old provisions could be invoked by the tenant to <Col N="1077" /> the discrimination of the lessor.  The removal of these inhibitory forces will lead to the success of the present system.</P>
    <P>Somebody has already mentioned that if this initiative is to be successful then incentives such as a good farm retirement scheme will have to be provided.  Up to now attempts which were made to induce farmers to give over their land were relatively unsuccessful because the farm retirement scheme did not provide a good enough incentive.  Two feeble efforts &mdash; and I must say they were mostly unsuccessful &mdash; were made in the 1965 Land Act and under the EEC Directive 160 in 1974.  We can learn a lot from their failure.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly mentioned that we will have to give the farmer proper incentive if he is to part with his land.  The annuities should be far greater and should be indexed to the old age pension. Part of the income from the leasing should be tax free.  There should be more flexibility in the qualifying age.  If necessary, the pension should be given to retiring farmers at 55 years of age rather than giving dole to younger or small farmers. All acreages should be eligible to allow more land to be released.  The present limit is 45 adjusted acres.  As five million acres of our 12 million acres of land are owned by farmers over 55 years, we need to provide every incentive to promote the mobility of this land, thus improving both the holding structure and the age structure.</P>
    <P>With reference to the whole concept of long-term leasing, I have first-hand experience of this myself as my mother has leased land on a long-term basis. While it benefits her it benefits the farmer even more.  He had it on the conacre system originally.  He is now inclined to invest more in the land by way of fertiliser and he has more respect for the land because he realises he has ten years in which to make it pay.  That is the kernel of the problem.  Up to now within the conacre system &mdash; we must remember that about 7.5 per cent, or almost one million acres, is in this system &mdash; land was run down due to the minimal use of lime and fertiliser.  Also, generally speaking, all rotations were ignored and it discouraged <Col N="1078" /> the use of winter cereals.  There was little long-term planning for the future development of that land because the farmer knew that he could be displaced at any time.  With long-term leasing we could overcome many defects in the conacre system.  Some of the main advantages would be, for example, that freehold ownership would be retained and it would encourage long-term development and planning.</P>
    <P>Senators have mentioned capital already.  More working capital would be available.  The tying-up of capital is one of the worst aspects of land purchase. The young farmer would not have to lay out as much capital initially and he could spread the investment over a period of time.  It would allow more flexible sizes within farms and it would help the whole transaction of buying and selling.  It could also provide a secure annual income to the owner as in the whole concept of long-term leasing rent review clauses would be included.  In long-term leasing any financial arrangements and obligations should be tied to the agricultural price index and consumer price index, and they should be easier to meet than mortgage payments.  Long-term leasing favours the young and ambitious farmer who may not have sufficient reserves to compete with more established farmers for the purchase of holdings on the open market.</P>
    <P>This whole concept of long-term leasing must initially compete with conacre. Farmers will be very slow to change over from the system of conacre unless adequate incentives are given to them. Whereas these incentives are not included in the Bill, I cannot see why they should not be given as time goes on. Conacre rent is treated as non-farm income.  I am glad that the Minister has stated that in the social welfare code people on long-term leases will not be penalised, in other words the capital value of the investment will not be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly pointed out that financial institutions should encourage the setting up of a fund, enjoying tax concessions similar to those of the building societies, which would make relatively <Col N="1079" /> cheap credit available to young farmers leasing land, or else interest subsidies. This is a very important consideration, because one of the main inhibitory forces at the moment in land mobility is the lack of finance.  The restriction of capital allowances to 30 per cent and the clawback of stock relief would also have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>If some of those measures I mentioned are not implemented the whole system of long-term leasing will probably not get off the ground.  I am sure the Minister will look at the possibility of giving greater incentives now that he has removed one of the major obstacles, the legal obstacle.</P>
    <P>The master lease, produced by the IFA and the AIB, would cover most of the framework for a good leasing system. Financial institutions and we, as politicians, must provide the correct environment in order to allow the system to take root and grow.  I would advocate the setting up of some form of land tribunal, properly structured to deal with leasing agreements.  This would be a positive step, and I would advocate that the country be divided into various regions in order to organise this.  Many farmers could be better off, in monetary terms, if they either leased their land or sold it and invested the proceeds.  That implies that there are social as well as monetary considerations, and we must consider this also.</P>
    <P>To achieve the full potential of our land resources will require a tremendous transformation in the way land is used. Inevitably this must affect those who use it.  Land acquisition should be thought of in terms of control of our land and not necessarily the ownership of it.  Ownership is one thing but the Government or a State agency must have some say in the control of the land that people have. While not disputing the right of people to own land, there must be some onus on them to work their land and to use it for the good of the country.  Control could be achieved by leasing.  This legislation on leasing can satisfy the three Fs, and it will give a whole lease of life to the agricultural scene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The purpose of this Land Bill is to promote and encourage leasing so as to get under-utilised land into the management of those who will use it to the optimum advantage.  There is no doubt that there are vast amounts of under-utilised agricultural land, and the introduction of legislation to get this under-utilised land into proper management so as to achieve its full potential is most desirable.  Does this legislation go the full way to ensuring that all our under-utilised land will from now on be managed by young progressive farmers? Will the proposals set out in this legislation build up a momentum of demand for leaseholds?  The proposed legislation does something to remove legal obstacles to land leasing.  It will prevent squatters' rights claims and will protect ownership.</P>
      <P>Over 20 per cent of the land is working far below potential.  It is in the hands of ageing farmers with no incentive or desire to push production to the maximum.  At the same time we have a growing number of young people, competently trained in farming, willing to apply their knowledge but without the resources to run a farm. Therefore, to get land working to its full potential the objective must be to encourage owners, who are not working their land due to age or for some other reason, to lease their land on suitable terms.  The Government must also establish conditions which will allow young people to enter acceptable leasing arrangements and remain economically viable.  There must be incentives for the landowner to lease his land on long-term leases and there should be special tax exemptions for landowners to encourage such leasing. Support is also necessary for the young farmer entering a leasing arrangement, that is, establishment grants and interest subsidies which are generally available to young farmers in other EEC countries should be introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hourigan mentioned that interest rates for lessees of land should be in the region of 10 per cent.  They should be much lower than this figure.  A figure of around 5 per cent would be a better incentive to young farmers who <Col N="1081" /> have to rent land and attractive borrowing rates would be an incentive for them to develop it.  When I suggest a 5 per cent interest rate, I mean 5 per cent for the duration of the loan.  The borrower, especially if he is a lessee borrowing money to develop his enterprise, should get every encouragement to utilise the land he has leased to its full potential by way of an attractive interest rate that would not vary from time to time.  The interest rate would remain steady for the duration of the loan.  He would know exactly how much his repayments would be and they would not keep on increasing, as has happened heretofore.</P>
    <P>There should be more land mobility in order that land would get into the hands of young progressive farmers who could farm it to its full potential.  Young farmers, whether they be farming their father's farm or their uncle's farm or farming leased land, should get every encouragement to ownership.  Lessees of land who are farming that land to its full potential should be grant-aided to buy land if land offers in their own vicinity which would be suitable.  There should be a fund set up to provide a land purchase subsidy.  Other Senators have promoted this idea.  This fund would help the young progressive farmer to acquire land and would ensure that the mobility of land would be so effective that all the land in future would be in the hands of this type of farmer.</P>
    <P>There should also be incentives for the farmer who is leasing his land, or the ageing farmer working with the help of his son or nephew to retire and transfer it to his son, or sell in the case of a lessee. There should be incentives for such farmers, who should have no fears of retiring. Retirement from farming should be made more attractive than at present.</P>
    <P>The EEC retirement scheme introduced some years ago has been a failure. Under that scheme a farmer over 66 years of age has very little incentive to opt out of farming.  I would suggest that retirement from farming should be made as attractive as staying in farming.  The retirement benefit should be aimed at the relinquishment of management control rather than ownership of the land occupied, <Col N="1082" /> that is if the owner is anxious to retain ownership.  While other EEC countries have contributory pension schemes for farmers, there is no such scheme in Ireland.  Ireland is the only EEC country without such a pension scheme for farmers.</P>
    <P>Most contributory pension schemes aim at retirement from work rather than from ownership.  In view of the traditional Irish attitudes to land ownership this could be very important.  Contributory pension schemes tend to be substantially higher than non-contributory schemes and therefore more likely to encourage retirement and thus stimulate land mobility.  Where farmers are willing to transfer, the Minister and his Department should examine the introduction of some contributory pension scheme that would make retirement more attractive to farmers, especially farmers who are not utilising their land to its full potential and who would be encouraged to transfer the management of it to young trained farmers.</P>

    <Title>Belfast Court Decision: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses grave concern at the implications for peace and stability in this country of the decision handed down in a Belfast Court on April 3rd, 1984 in the case involving the shooting dead of an unarmed civilian in County Armagh.</P>
      <P>It is significant and most heartening that this motion has the support of all parties in Seanad Éireann.  This is a clear indication of the deep concern which exists in regard to the implications of the court case in question and the recognition that the erosion of confidence in the whole system of law and order in Northern Ireland over the years threatens to develop into a landslide as a result of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing this motion I am not unaware that what I have to say will be seized upon by spokesmen for the Provisional IRA and used in an attempt to <Col N="1083" /> justify their vile campaign of murder and intimidation.  The simple answer to such claims is that justice and human rights are indivisible.  The posturing of such people as defenders of human rights and champions of the oppressed must continually be exposed for the hypocrisy that it is.  They would claim for themselves and their associates, whilst denying it to their victims, the right to a free and open trial as laid down in Article 6 of the European Convention.  They protest vehemently at the &ldquo;kill, don't question&rdquo; policy of the security forces, yet remain silent about, even seek to justify, the murder of a judge or a young teacher as they leave Sunday Mass, or indeed the summary execution of a young Protestant farmer as he ploughs his fields on the Fermanagh-Donegal border.  Their championship of human rights is entirely conditional on whose human rights are at stake.</P>
    <P>By the same token, any criticisms of the forces of law and order will undoubtedly bring forth accusations from Loyalist politicians of giving succour and solace to the IRA.  The truth is that those who are genuinely concerned about law and order should be the first to express concern at any evidence of an erosion of confidence in the police and the courts.  Such an erosion has been, and will continue to be, exploited by the paramilitaries and it is from this that they garner most succour and solace.  The spectacle of public representatives from major parties congratulating the security forces on the use of maximum force to shoot dead unarmed civilians is indicative of the depths to which Northern Ireland has sunk.</P>
    <P>The Diplock Commission, set up to consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in Northern Ireland, stated in 1972 &mdash; at the beginning of the troubles &mdash; and I quote:</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland has always been a province whose inhabitants have been divided into rival factions by difference of creed and politics.  The judiciary has nevertheless managed to retain a reputation for impartiality which rises above the divisive conflict which has <Col N="1084" /> affected so many other functions of government in the province; and the courts of law and the procedures that they use have in general held the respect and trust of all except the extremists of both factions.  We regard it as of paramount importance that the criminal courts of law and the judges and resident magistrates who preside in them should continue to retain that respect and trust throughout the emergency and after the emergency has come to an end.  If anything were done which weakened it, it might take generations to rebuild it.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  Therefore, the considerations which I have just outlined cannot and will not prevent me or my party from speaking out on matters of such crucial importance.  My concern is with the steady erosion of confidence in the judicial system and with it the increasing alienation of increasing numbers, particularly within the Nationalist community. I do not have to tell this House that such confidence is fundamental to stability in any society.  How much more important is it in the divided and conflict-ridden society of Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>The conflict in Northern Ireland is, as we know, rooted in community division, in the failure to accommodate the Irishness of the Nationalist population, in their exclusion from participation and in the consequent alienation of Nationalists from the institutions of the State and from the forces of law and order within it.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years in particular we have witnessed attempts by successive British Governments to resolve the conflict by the introduction of stronger and more oppressive emergency laws and by an increasing emphasis on police and military offensives.  We have seen convictions obtained in the courts on the basis of confessions extracted by ill-treatment in centres such as Castlereagh and Gough Barracks.  We have seen the use of plastic bullets, banned in England because of their lethal nature, and the refusal to ban them despite the fact that they have been responsible for 11 deaths, among them a <Col N="1085" /> young girl running a message for her mother, and a housewife on her own doorstep in West Belfast.  They have also been responsible for many serious injuries including blinding a number of young people.  From time to time we have seen spates of killings by the security forces in highly suspicious circumstances. And in recent years we have seen the courts themselves literally put into the front line of the campaign against terrorism. I am referring to the policy of using supergrasses in order to obtain convictions in the courts.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of the conflict in Northern Ireland, it is self-evident that such an approach was bound not merely to fail, but to compound the problem and it has.  The trial resulting from the killing of Séamus Grew in December 1982, which is the one in question in this motion, and its disclosures about the deliberate issuing of false statements about the circumstances of the shooting, the attempt by four senior police officers to pervert the course of justice, the intrusion of the RUC into the Republic and finally the failure of the prosecution to prove its case have served to confirm the worst fears and suspicions of the Nationalist community about the even-handedness of the judicial system and the credibility of the forces of law and order.  As a result of a security and military approach to what is, in effect, a complex political problem and particularly as a result of the trial to which this motion refers, the view of the judicial system in Northern Ireland which was held by a small extremist minority some 15 years ago has now become the view of an ever increasing and large section of the Nationalist community and indeed of a small section of the Loyalist community.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of practising lawyers are concerned about the situation, a situation which is summed up in <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial of 4 April last, and I quote:</P>
    <P>But the Robinson trial, following as it did on many other events, casts a lurid light on the administration of justice and the conduct of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  It raises <Col N="1086" /> questions which demand urgent and honest answers from the relevant authorities, answers which regrettably are unlikely to be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is that last line which will strike a cord of almost despair with every member of the Nationalist community with few exceptions.  I repeat &ldquo;answers which regrettably are unlikely to be forthcoming&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The editorial continues:</P>
    <P>A system of law and order characterised by conspiracy and corruption cannot ensure present rights or a worthwhile future of society, for either Catholics or Protestants.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish News</i> in Belfast commenting on the judgment on the same day stated in its editorial, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Even moderate Catholics are outraged. And rightly so.  Yesterday was a bad day for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, the latest in an unending catalogue of such bad days.  The judgment at Belfast Crown Court undermines the law and gives comfort to the law breakers ... it encourages the shoot to kill mentality, undermines further the independence of the judiciary and further alienates the Nationalist population.</P>
    <P>In order fully to appreciate the serious implications of the judgment in question it is necessary to view it in the context of the cumulative effect of what is referred to by the <i>Irish News</i> as the &ldquo;unending catalogue of bad days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A study carried out by Kevin Boyle, Tom Hadden and Dermot Walsh for the Baker review last year concluded that of the 267 fatalities caused by the security forces between January 1969 and September 1983, 83 of those were caused in what they called &ldquo;disputed&rdquo; circumstances. The manner in which these contentious killings have been dealt with by the authorities &mdash; that is by the police, the prosecuting authorities and the courts &mdash; has countributed in no small way to the alienation of the Nationalist community and to an increase in paramilitary recruitment and therefore to further voilence and instability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The killings which caused most outrage were carried out by members of the security forces on duty during the periods of December 1977 to December 1978 and more recently between August 1982 and August 1983.  During both periods all the evidence pointed to a policy at the highest level of &ldquo;kill, don't question&rdquo;.  Some people call it &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;kill don't question&rdquo; is a better description.  In the latter period a total of 14 people were shot by security forces on duty in Lurgan, Armagh, Belfast and Derry in controversial circumstances.  Nine of these 14 were unarmed.  Calls for full inquiries for the immediate pressing of charges against those responsible, for full and detailed publication of evidence, were made by responsible leaders in the Nationalist community, among them Bishop Francis Brooks of Dromore, Bishop Daly of Derry, Cardinal Ó Fiaich and spokesmen for the SDLP.  Even the Alliance Party expressed public concern.  John Hume accused the security forces of, and I quote &ldquo;legalised murder&rdquo; and he alleged, and again I quote: &ldquo;a fundamental change in British security policy which amounts to the abandonment of the rule of law.&rdquo; Those comments will sum up the public concern at the time of those killings.</P>
    <P>All of those comments met with the same bland official response, and again I quote from the Northern Ireland Office:</P>
    <P>The security forces operate under the same rule of law that applies to any other member of the community.</P>
    <P>During the 1977-78 period similar protestations were met with similar denials. Altogether in the course of that particular year ten people were killed in controversial circumstances.  In only one of those killings was a charge brought.  It was a particular horrific case of the killing of a 16 years old lad called Conn Boyle, in Dunloy, County Antrim, who had stumbled on a cache of arms in a graveyard. He told his father.  His father, co-operating with the security forces, told the police.  The following day, the young lad went again to the graveyard &mdash; I suppose out of curiosity &mdash; and was shot dead on the spot by soldiers who were lying in wait.  Following a sustained campaign of <Col N="1088" /> pressure led by the SDLP Justice spokesman at that time, Michael Canavan, and after a delay of ten months, a charge was eventually brought against two soldiers. Both were acquitted.</P>
    <P>Fourteen persons have been killed by the security forces on duty between 1982 and 1983.  That is the latter period which I referred to.  So far few cases have come to court and all have ended in acquittals. The fact remains that no member of the security forces in Northern Ireland has ever served a prison sentence for the killing whilst on duty of a civilian.</P>
    <P>I understand that in deciding whether or not to bring a charge against a member of the security forces, the DPP consults with the Attorney General.  It is difficult, particularly in view of the statistics what I have mentioned, to ignore the possibility that political considerations may well take precedence over purely legal ones. Commenting on this very point, Boyle Hadden and Walsh in their submission to the Baker Review stated:</P>
    <P>All this lends support to the view which is widely held among the minority community in Northern Ireland and by many foreign observers that the security forces are not in reality subject to the rule of law, whatever may be claimed to the contrary.</P>
    <P>There is, moreover, a stark contrast in the view taken of killings by the security forces in England and in Northern Ireland.  During the very period last year when a spate of killings in controversial circumstances had taken place in Northern Ireland a young man called Stephen Waldorf was shot in London by mistake by the police.  The shooting caused a major outcry.  Not one of the major parties in Britain condoned it, nor did the Home Secretary, Lord Whitelaw, calling it a &ldquo;most serious, grave and disturbing incident&rdquo;.  He said that &ldquo;nothing like it must happen again&rdquo;.  In the event a charge was brought within three days. In Northern Ireland, in the rare event of a charge being brought at all, there is invariably a delay of ten to 12 months. Expressions of concern such as those made by the Home Secretary are not heard in Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, <Col N="1089" /> in the case of Stephen Waldorf, that young man was rushed to hospital within two or three minutes of the shooting.  In a case of the shooting of three unarmed IRA suspects in Lurgan in November 1982 there was a delay of two to three hours before they were brought to the nearby hospital where they could have been within five or six minutes of the shooting.  Such, then, is the background against which the implications of the Robinson trial have to be viewed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the killing in question, may I, first of all, say that all reasonably minded people would accept the right of a policeman or soldier to defend himself with reasonable force.  I would acknowledge that in Northern Ireland policemen and soldiers have a particularly dangerous job to do.  However, in the instance of the Grew killing, it seems to many reasonable people that excessive fire power was used causing the death of two unarmed men.  If murder was not considered to be an appropriate verdict why not then a verdict of manslaughter, therefore indicating that the use of excessive force by the police would not be excused? Complete acquittal on the basis of the defendant's claim that he feared for his life, and in the absence of any objective evidence of such threat to his life, and in light of the defendant having twice changed his own account of events, seems to many people to be inexplicable.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the case would also raise the question of double standards. Ordinary suspects in Northern Ireland are brought to interrogation centres and held for 48 hours incommunicado without access to a solicitor while they are interrogated.  The defendant in this case and indeed in all cases, I understand, of the security forces had access to legal advice before he was questioned, and that gave him an important advantage over ordinary suspects.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, forensic evidence was made available to the defence long before this case came to trial.  It is inconcieable that such an advantage would be given to any other member of the community.  So much for the claim that the law applies equally to members of the security forces and any other person in the community. <Col N="1090" /> Comparing all the circumstances of this case with the circumstances in which many convictions have been gained in recent times on the uncorroborated evidence of supergrasses, witnesses who themselves have been guilty of the most heinous crimes and who have been offered inducements in order to give evidence, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that double standards apply in the judicial system in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other disclosures were made too during the course of the trial and they raise serious questions.  The matter of incursions into the Republic by the RUC has rightly caused anger and deep indignation. The matter has indeed been taken up by the Irish Government at the highest level and I do not intend, in the time allotted to me here today, to dwell on it.</P>
    <P>The disclosure, however, that four senior police officers asked a man facing a murder charge to tell lies in his defence raises a serious matter of police integrity and credibility.  Worse still the officers concerned would seem to be <i>prima facie</i> guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice.  The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> in its editorial on the day after the judgment expressed concern about this disclosure. The <i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> by the way, is a liberal or moderate Unionist paper.  The <i>Telegraph,</i> editorial stated:</P>
    <P>The majority of fair-minded people look to the Chief Constable to uncover the truth whatever embarrassment it may cause.</P>
    <P>A few days later the Chief Constable indicated that he was asking for an investigation by senior members of the British police force.  At the same time and in the same statement he added:</P>
    <P>I can only say at this stage that I do not believe there was any criminal conspiracy to cover up.</P>
    <P>Such an extraordinary prejudgment of the proposed investigation, far from assuaging public concern and suspicion served to heighten it.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in a statement to Dáil Éireann on 10 April referring to the Chief Constable's remarks indicated that he had expressed to the British authorities the <Col N="1091" /> Irish Government's belief that it had &ldquo;reinforced existing concern&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the record, the statement issued by RUC Headquarters Information Centre in East Belfast four hours after the shooting of Grew and Carroll said that an unidentified RUC member had been knocked down and injured by Grew's car on the Armagh to Keady road.  The policeman at the scene had radioed to another patrol who, they said, had identified the car as belonging to a &ldquo;leading terrorist&rdquo; and intercepted it.  The statement added:</P>
    <P>The driver jumped out of the vehicle and the police, believing they were about to be fired on, themselves opened fire.  Both occupants were shot.</P>
    <P>That was the police statement a few hours after the shooting.</P>
    <P>It was disclosed, of course, during the course of the trial that this statement was a fabrication, a cover-up.  Was it, we can ask, concocted as a cover-up for police intrusions into the Republic as we were told, or might it have been concocted with a view to justifying the use of maximum force?  Conflicting police statements issued after a similar type of killing of three unarmed IRA suspects in Lurgan in November 1982 did little for police credibility.</P>
    <P>Only a full disclosure of the facts and a complete impartial investigation and the pressing of charges against those who are <i>prima facie</i> guilty of a criminal conspiracy can hope to restore any measure of police credibility or to remove the suspicion that the forces of law and order are themselves above the law.</P>
    <P>The Gardiner Committee in its report in 1975 stated:</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of the powers of the security forces, we should like to re-emphasise one aspect which we consider in many ways likely to make a more important contribution to the restoration of law and order in Northern Ireland than all the powers included in Part II of the 1973 Act. This is the acceptance throughout the whole of Northern Ireland of the Royal <Col N="1092" /> Ulster Constabulary as the force responsible for the full range of normal police functions.</P>
    <P>However regrettable, it is certain that the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; referred to by Gardiner has now been rendered an even more remote possibility than ever.  The police themselves and the community as a whole are the losers.  The winners are all those who thrive on conflict and mistrust and who are only too ready to exploit the deepening alienation of a large section of the community.  The resulting deterioration and downward spiral in Northern Ireland has grave implications for the peace and stability of the whole island.  This has all too tragically been demonstrated in recent months and years.</P>
    <P>The need for a radical re-appraisal of attitudes and the urgency of making political progress has been recognised by the New Ireland Forum.  The Nationalist parties have expressed their recognition of the realities and their willingness to face those realities.  Alone, however, they cannot resolve the conflict.  Britain must act decisively.  For the rest of us on this island, whether Unionist or Nationalist, the time for posturing is long since past.  We face a serious and deteriorating situation.  It cannot be resolved by party politicking.  Now is the time for dialogue and compromise on all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I would like to start by reminding the House this evening that according to the figures I have available up to June 1983 at that stage 375 members of the British Army had been killed throughout the last 15 years in Northern Ireland, 176, and that figure has risen considerably since, members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Royal Ulster Constabulary Volunteer Reserve had been killed, 132 members of the Ulster Defence Regiment had been killed and approximately 20 prison officers.  That was the state with regard to the killing of members of the security forces up to June 1983.  There were 1,233 civilians killed and of the paramilitary organisations, 178 members of the Provisional IRA, 26 of the official IRA, 13 of the Irish National Liberation <Col N="1093" /> Army, 38 of the UDA and 23 of the UVF.</P>
      <P>As you all know, to our cost in Northern Ireland these numbers have increased substantially since that time.  With that in the foreground and with literally tens of reports of the last 15 years in the background we must pursue the debate in hand.  Who remembers what was in the Cameron Report, the Hume Report, the Compton Report, the Scarman Tribunal Report, the Parker Report, the Diplock Report or the Gardiner Report?  Since those we have had the Bennett Report and the improvement that took place in its immediate aftermath in regard to the interrogation of people who had been arrested, although it is sad to record that in the years 1981-82 there has been an increase in the number of reports of assault under interrogation.  Then there was the Jellicoe Report on the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Widgery Report and more recently the Baker Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against a background such as this we must decide two things: one, the significance, the importance, of what happened in Armagh on the night in which Séamus Grew was killed.  We must put this in the context of the whole management of affairs in Northern Ireland and see it as a very unresolved deep-seated, long-lived political dilemma.  Secondly, we must ask, as Senator Rogers has already asked, when will the people of Ireland, both South and North, find that degree of compromise in their hearts in which they can reach out to their neighbour to try to resolve this vexed question before another 2,300 people have been laid to their rest in a name of or defending the particular tradition to which they belong in this benighted island?  Extrapolating those figures for killing and for wounding to England, as I said not long ago in this House, would mean some 70,000 people killed and 750,000 injured.  Little wonder then that those of us who have to debate this issue despair because we see the people involved in it caught up in a web of an unresolved historical dilemma, a web which at last &mdash; in recent months, in the last year &mdash; the people of this part of the island have tried to come to grips with <Col N="1094" /> first hand in the deliberations which have been taking place in Dublin Castle.  There was therefore a ray of hope when the Forum's deliberations had been completed and the report was published.  It is on that ray of hope that I would build my hope to look ahead for a new future so that the bitterness which percolates the whole society in Northern Ireland as a result of actions such as the one we are to debate, may at last be defused and so that with goodwill we can look to a future where killings such as those of Séamus Grew will no longer take place.</P>
    <P>There are three things interwoven here.  There is the question of violence, its perpetration and the legitimacy for it, there is the need to monitor the legitimate forces which have the State's <i>imprimatur</i> for actions taken on the State's behalf, and there is a need to look at the unresolved dilemma which has caused so much killing in our country.</P>
    <P>Let us start with the violence.  I have always defined violence as the penetration &mdash; psychological, sexual or physical &mdash; of one human being by another against his will.  The definition cannot change by putting a uniform on a man's back.  The uniform gives the legitimacy to the action but it does not help the man to cope with the consequences of that action.  I have spoken to old men from the First World War, the Civil War, the Second World War and the Anglo-Irish War who find that their Gethsemane was the moment in which they killed, or penetrated, another human being in an irreversible fashion.  We must ask ourselves about this legitimacy in a divided country where there is no consensus because inevitably where there is no consensus the violence or the force used by the forces of law and order, the inevitable violence and force of all the nation states, will be perceived by those who feel ruled or oppressed as belonging to them.  It is their laws, not our laws, their action, not our action. Therefore, we must remember that side of the coin when we come to argue on behalf of the legitimacy of the State that is, that the State's legitimacy is in question where there is no consensus.</P>
    <P>The other side of it is to ask ourselves what are we doing for the men who will <Col N="1095" /> carry to their graves, be they paramilitaries or members of the police or armed forces, the memory and the guilt which they may presently be able to suppress in their consciousness but which as sure as day follows night will either rise to haunt them in later life or be expressed in the form of falsehood about what they have done in relation to acts or crimes against the humanity to which they themselves belong.</P>
    <P>The third issue is the issue of the unresolved dilemma.  We have inherited in Ireland, both South and North, a very limited concept of what the democratic process is all about.  We are only beginning to realise that the claims of consensus democracy must take precedence over the claims of majority-rule democracy if we are sincere democrats and whether we are Irish Republicans or Northern Loyalists.  It is only by reaching an accommodation which can give a feeling of consensus that there will be the ultimate legitimacy which gives to the State's forces of law and order the right to act with the unquestioning support of 99 per cent of the people who live on the island.  Therefore, there is hope that there is a struggle going on to cope with the claims of consensus, what this means and the pain of what it means to people who have traditionally seen their rights in terms of majorities versus minorities.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in Northern Ireland against the background I have tried to portray has been complicated further by the emergency legislation which has now been in existence for so long, the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act in particular. Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, section 12, one can be apprehended for seven days for questioning on a reasonable suspicion of involvement in the commission of an offence.  Under the Emergency Provisions Act, although one cannot be held in detention for as long &mdash; the maximum being 72 hours &mdash; one can be arrested on the ground of suspected status or the suspicion that one has committed a certain act.  Under the various sections of that Act one may be apprehended for 48 or for 72 hours by <Col N="1096" /> the police and one can be apprehended also by the military for up to four hours. The problem only starts there, because 80 per cent of those so apprehended are discharged without a charge being brought against them.  If one considers the number of people who have been arrested under these two Acts &mdash; 22,378 and only 20 per cent charged &mdash; one can imagine the enormous effect if all those were different individuals and not some who are arrested and re-arrested.  This must have an enormous effect in small, working-class communities, especially since it involves largely men and women under the age of 30 in the most deprived sections of the country, in relation to the extended family and the effect on community alienation.  Again extrapolating these figures it would work out that during the years from July 1972 to June 1983, 55,000 to 60,000 people have been detained.  Of those, 45,000 to 50,000 have been released without charge.  Those figures would be equivalent to 6 million arrested and subsequently discharged after being detained under the Acts I mentioned in the United States or 1,500,000 in the United Kingdom.  These were people arrested on suspicion but released without being charged, but nevertheless subjected to interrogation in the meantime.</P>
    <P>We have a most terrible social, economic and political problem in Northern Ireland.  When a policeman, of a force who have lost more than 180 men, shoots dead an unarmed terrorist &mdash; we know that the unarmed terrorist was alleged to have had a reputation for terror &mdash; we have to ask ourselves first how we would react in such a situation and then as responsible citizens, how we can allow a member of the law-providing force in a divided society where there is so much alienation, to kill in the circumstances as we have read them and in the first instance to be persuaded to fabricate his statements.  There was also the situation that despite being a soldier, well trained and belonging to a special branch in the stress of the moment, and for whatever reason, discharged 15 to 19 bullets into the car at very close range.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, with great concern that <Col N="1097" /> I share with Senator Rogers in putting forward this motion.  We are not talking here about the judgment or the judge.  In the context of Northern Ireland, he, too, in the light of the law as it exists and of which I have been critical, has shown courage.  Anyone who lives in Northern Ireland and who is trying to act with integrity in regard to what he believes, has to show courage.  What you fellow Senators have got to do and what the people of the Republic have to do is, starting from what has been discussed through the last year, help to create the climate which can engage us in the North of Ireland in constructive debate with you about the future of Ireland in which the people can live at last with peace and hope for their children.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the proposer and seconder of the motion in expressing great concern and disquiet in relation to the incident which took place on 3 April last.  Having heard the statistics given to us by Senator Rogers in relation to the number of cases that have been taken against members of the security forces in the North in the past year or so and the fact that in no case was the accused found guilty, our concern must be very much more than if this was simply one isolated case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspaper report the description of this incident.  From that it appears that Constable Robinson first fired 15 shots into the car.  It was argued on his behalf that he mistakenly believed the occupants were armed, that a shot had been fired at him and that his life was in danger.  On this basis it could be argued that he had justification for firing some, at least, of those 15 shots.  However, it is the second part of the incident which is impossible to accept because at the end of firing 15 shots, he reloaded, walked around the back of the car, opened the door of the car and fired four shots at the occupant, Séamus Grew, at point blank range.  Séamus Grew was unarmed and there was nothing in the report to suggest that he did anything at that stage to provoke the further shooting by Constable Robinson.  In these circumstances it is <Col N="1098" /> extremely difficult to understand the decision of the judge.  But in saying that I have to acknowledge that it is always dangerous to reach any conclusion in relation to any case, and particularly a case of this kind, without having been present to hear all the evidence.  What is clear is that the reports of the case led many people to the conclusion that justice was not done in this case.  It led many people to believe that the decision was in the nature of a whitewash of the security forces.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that the security forces or the courts in their turn take one view if the accused is a Nationalist and another view if the accused is a Unionist or a member of the security forces has very grave implications indeed for peace and stability, not only in Northern Ireland but ultimately in this part of the country. That attitude, suggesting that that is taking place, will certainly undermine still further a situation in regard to law and order which is already extremely grave. Consequently, though I am not in an adequate position to arrive at a firm conclusion as to the merits of the judgment in this case, it can certainly be said without hesitation that the legal axiom that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done, was not fulfilled in this case and having regard to the statistics we have heard was not fulfilled in many other cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>Impartiality in the administration of law is a <i>sine qua non</i> if any improvement is to be made in the very serious position in Northern Ireland.  The problem there is, of course, basically a political, rather than a security, one.  But while there is some hope of a political solution in the coming months arising from the contents of the New Ireland Forum Report, unless the solutions pursued under the terms of the report are accompanied by impartiality in the administration of the law, then the political settlements would be very seriously endangered.  For this reason we must be deeply concerned to ensure that on the one hand every possible solution is pursued to achieve a political solution and new structures for the North which would ensure peace and justice for all. On the other hand, we must ensure that <Col N="1099" /> this is accompanied by impartiality in the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>This incident has been described as reaching the lowest ebb in the confidence of the minority in Northern Ireland in the security forces and in the courts and law and order generally.  In so far as this implies that the position cannot get worse and can only get better then perhaps there is a ray of hope.  I hope that the position will improve very much.  I hope that that particular incident which has shocked so many people, shocked even the most moderate of people, will be seen to have been so bad that from now on the position will improve.  If that case has the effect of improving the situation, then some purpose will have been served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to join with the Senators who have spoken in regard to the very wide disquiet which was caused by the whole course of the trial of Constable Robinson.  I agree with Senator Ryan that it is difficult if one has not heard the whole evidence to be firmly critical of what was done.  Nevertheless, there are elements in this particular case that cause disquiet.  The evidence has been that it would be considered normal in an incident such as has occurred on this particular occasion that the members of the security forces should not only discharge the full contents of a semiautomatic weapon but should reload and continue to fire.  It seems to go beyond the common acceptance of self-defence and beyond an appropriate degree of force in protection of one's own life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say any more on this aspect because I think our rule in this House of not criticising individual judgments is probably a good rule.  But we are also told equally that the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the judge are not part of the judgement. I have absolutely no hesitation in criticising some of the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the judge as reported on this particular occasion. Even if the judge were firmly convinced as he was entitled to be, that Constable Robinson was genuinely in fear of his life and genuinely of the opinion that it was necessary for him to fire to the extent that he did including the final firing then, of course, he was entitled to reach the <Col N="1100" /> judgment which he did.  But for a judge in that troubled province to have delivered that judgment including the <i>obiter dicta</i> which were in it, to commend Constable Robinson for his marksmanship and to use similar phrases, is to show a degree of insensitivity to the tragedy and the boiling crisis of Northern Ireland that really appals one.</P>
    <P>It is not only these aspects that give rise for concern.  The evidence which came forward in this trial must give us a great deal of concern on a number of counts.  I would like to identify three elements here that are causes for grave concern. Firstly, something which was reflected in the actions of Constable Robinson was the nature of the training which he was given which caused him to act as he did, even if he were acting bona fide on this occasion.  That is something that gives rise to grave concern.  Secondly, the admission that there was an incursion into this jurisdiction which was concealed from superiors and done without the normal reference to the Garda in accordance with the routine that has been established when permission is sought for a temporary minor incursion.  Thirdly, the question of the covering up and the continual change in the statements by Constable Robinson.  These are all matters of grave concern.  As Senator Eoin Ryan said, the perceptions which are so vital on occasions like this have been utterly violated.  The evidence and the judgment and the whole course of this case have had the most serious effect on the alienation of the minority community. They must have confirmed many people in their alienation from the security forces and from the whole judicial system.  It is not only the effects on the perception of the judicial system.  It naturally has affected temporarily Anglo-Irish relations and must have had its effects on the relations between the Garda and the RUC in their common cause against terrorists.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a problem here that is faced by every civilised state in the world today since terrorism is a problem in practically every civilised state.  The dilemma is how can one counteract the determined anonymous terrorist.  To <Col N="1101" /> seek to counter these terrorists who flout both the moral and the civil law by the use of extra legal methods is the ultimate surrender to the terrorist.  The terrorist seeks to destroy the fabric of society, but society will destroy its own fabric from within if it seeks a temporary advantage in going beyond the law.  And if there have been actions &mdash; and the appearance would be that there have &mdash; in Northern Ireland in which the security forces have either been held or have held themselves to be above the law, then indeed we are getting into a condition where there is not much room for hope.  I see this as a universal problem, and it is a problem that we must watch ourselves.  We here are also subject to forces who do not keep within the law and we should be ready to look for any undue reaction which seeks to counter lawlessness by methods that themselves go beyond the law.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned in reading the evidence of Constable Robinson's actions to ask ourselves do those in political authority realise the nature of the training of the members of the special anti-terrorist unit of which Constable Robinson was a member?  Do they realise that apparently this training with its concentration, as Constable Robinson himself said, on aggression and on fire power, involves very little training in regard to what are the limits of adequate force in different situations?  There is a grave responsibility on all of those in authority in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned as well in regard to the revelation that there was an incursion into our territory.  I am very glad that the Government reacted to this immediately, and there is no need for me to go over all that was contained in the statement made to Dáil Éireann on 10 April by the Taoiseach in this regard, but merely to mention some of the highlights. The Taoiseach expressed serious concern with the departure from the normal rules of inter-State conduct and indicated to the British Ambassador that it was harmful to the spirit and practice of security co-operation and damaging to Anglo-Irish relations.  Indeed, all will be glad to note that the British Ambassador on that <Col N="1102" /> occasion expressed his Government's concern and formally conveyed its apologies. The Ambassador indicated then that it was and would continue to be RUC policy enshrined in explicit instructions that members of the RUC should not cross the Border while on duty.</P>
    <P>There is a grave responsibility on the shoulders of those in authority in Northern Ireland at the highest level to ensure that those instructions are absolutely adhered to.  I do not think that the discussions about to take place between the two Governments can possibly prosper unless it is made absolutely clear from the top down that such discussions cannot progress if in fact the integrity of this State is to be disregarded in this fashion in the future.  We understand, of course, that there has been a decision to hold an inquiry into what happened on that occasion. We must await that inquiry when the facts will be known.  I can only hope that when the facts are known as a result of that inquiry they are not going to make the matter worse.  I would hope that the Taoiseach and the Government would continue to press for the results of that inquiry to be made known as speedily as possible and to continue to press for information already asked for in regard to the reasons why the Garda were not contacted on this particular occasion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the coverup, which was the third point which must be a matter of major concern, I think here again we have a serious situation. In order to cover either the incursion or the particular nature of the anti-terrorist operation a story was concocted in a case where there was an inquiry into how a killing had come about.  I think we must reject the premature misguided proclamation of the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland that there is nothing of a criminal conspiracy in this, that this is normal police procedure.  I would certainly hope that it is not normal police procedure in Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom or in this State that, on the excuse of covering up the operational methods of combatting crime, people might be expected to enter into a conspiracy of lies in regard to the question <Col N="1103" /> of how the killing of an unarmed person came about.</P>
    <P>We must read all of this case with very great misgiving.  Of course, we should acknowledge the very fact that a prosecution was taken did at least give us the opportunity to know the worst here, did at least reveal not only the things which gave rise to concern but managed to uncover what had been sought to be covered up in a most unhealthy fashion.</P>

      <P>On the three elements of the nature of the training of members of the special anti-terrorist force, on the question of the incursion into this jurisdiction and on the question of the coverup, we have in all these three aspects a reflection about the nature of the reaction to terrorist operations in Northern Ireland that gives rise to anxiety, an anxiety which can only be deepened unless we receive very early assurances that these are not the norm or if they have been the norm are not to be the norm or the occasion of isolated instances in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been part of my normal fashion to make speeches about Northern Ireland for various reasons, one, lack of expertise in the area that influenced me, also, a quite profound concern about the complexities of the problem and a long process of change in my own part over 14 years.  In 1969 I, reflecting the traditions that we all had grown up in, marched in military formation at the funeral of a Provisional IRA member who had blown himself up in County Laois, as did many other people in those days when the IRA and military violence were seem to be a natural, understandable and, indeed, almost romantic part of the traditions of the country.  Now I find myself unable ever to justify the use of violence.  People ask me what happens, for instance, if the people of Nicaragua are invaded by a hostile power and I have to keep saying wherever the example arises that I will not tell other people what to do in the <Col N="1104" /> case of oppression, I do not believe I could ever justify to myself becoming involved in organised violence to achieve a political end, whether that be official or unofficial.  I support a slogan that a pacifist movement in this country have always used &ldquo;Do not join any army, legal or illegal.&rdquo;  I do not mean to be offensive to people who are in the security forces in this or any other State but it is a position I have developed, very painfully, over 14 years of thinking and reflecting on the nature of political violence in this country. One of the few things on which I agree with Conor Cruise-O'Brien is that the whole history of the romanticisation of violence as the method by which this country achieved most of its progress could well be re-examined.</P>
      <P>I often feel &mdash; and I said it before in this House &mdash; that those in our history who achieved very many great things for us are somehow lower in the pantheon of heroes for the fact that they did not use violence than those who, perhaps in a futile way on many occasions, rose up in the romantic Irish rebellions of this or other centuries.  In that context I have been very slow to speak about Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, some time ago in a debate on extradition in this House I said something about which I have had no reason to change my mind, that if I, in the pretentious way of politicians, claimed to have a noble or an overall objective in being involved in politics other than the fact that I happened to enjoy the process &mdash; as most of us do and probably one of the real motivations for us becoming and staying involved is that we actually enjoy it &mdash; in fact, I had a more altruistic motive.  It was a certain commitment to those whom I felt to be the oppressed and downtrodden in our society, and in that context it could be difficult politically and in terms of striking romantic poses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any criterion the Catholic minority of Northern Ireland, particularly those of the urban working class of Belfast and Derry, must rank as perhaps the most oppressed minority in Irish society, outside some of the marginal groups such as travellers and the like.  As well as the problems of mass unemployment, which <Col N="1105" /> has been, unfortunately, part of their tradition for 50 years, and appalling housing, they have for the last 14 years lived on the one hand with security forces who make them feel fundamentally and totally insecure, and on the other hand they have to live with people on their backs, who claim to be their protectors, who inflict yet further violence upon them.  Yet it appears that we have now moved tragically from a position where the use of violence by certain groups in Northern Ireland was passively tolerated to the position where it appears to be almost actively encouraged and supported. The political process of this and its development is very complex.  On one of my occasional, and not half as frequent as they should have been, visits to Belfast, I visited a social club in a part of Catholic West Belfast and heard words of a song: &ldquo;Go to sleep my weary Provo, and don't you hear those bullets fly&rdquo;.  We are reading then that in Northern Ireland there was no support for violence under any circumstances in tiny minorities, and yet at the word &ldquo;bullets&rdquo; all there rattled their glasses on the tables to do a very good imitation of what sounded to me like machine-gun fire rattling around this club, which was the social centre for a large section of the population in that area.  In the middle of all this the British Army arrived to search the place and I, good Southern Nationalist that I was, was frightened out of my wits &mdash; because a good Northern Nationalist beside me turned around and said: &ldquo;Ah, I see your friends have arrived&rdquo; at which point I wanted to retreat quietly and carefully. In many ways I, as a Southern Nationalist, was almost as alien at that stage to those people in that area as were the forces of the British Government.</P>
    <P>I would not claim to speak with the insight of people living in Northern Ireland, but it appears to me that that group in particular, as distinct from many other Catholic minorities who were living in rural areas or close to the Border, feel themselves entirely outside and alone, unsupported by either the British Government or any of the political organisations down here, and totally alienated from the political structures within their <Col N="1106" /> own community.  As well as that they carry the burden of unemployment. Hence the conclusion that they represent possibly the most oppressed minority in the whole of these islands &mdash; not just in this country &mdash; because there is no political forum or structure within which their views can be heard.</P>
    <P>That process, unfortunately, developed over the 14 years as we all tried to persuade ourselves that the problem was an unrepresentative minority using violence in a mindless way and that if we could come to grips with this 1 or 0.5 per cent of the people, we could come to grips with the problem of Northern Ireland and then reasonable people would surface once the problem of violence was out of the way and everyone would be reasonable to everyone else. We spent an enormous amount of time persuading ourselves to that effect.  Only in the last couple of years has the reality begun to dawn on us that the problem is much more deep seated.  For the Catholic people of Northern Ireland at least the security forces are seen almost as much as oppressors as anything else, and for people down here to talk about security co-operation, which may well be necessary, is to be seen by many people in Northern Ireland as effectively part of the British establishment.  That may not be palatable down here; it may not be particularly acceptable, but it is the way we here are seen by many people in Northern Ireland today.  One hopes that recent developments in the Forum will do something to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Dooge and there was much in what he said that I agree with, which may surprise him.  Quite rightly he identified the fact that if the forces of any state anywhere are forced or allowed or demand the right to resort to tactics that in any way resemble the tactics of those they are fighting against or those they are attempting to deal with, then that is the ultimate victory for the terrorist.  I quoted Terence McSwiney's words here on another occasion when a particularly appalling murder had taken place in Northern Ireland: &ldquo;It is not those who can inflict the most, it is those who can endure the most, who will <Col N="1107" /> conquer.&rdquo;  If we as a society are dealing with the problem of political violence, that problem must be analysed and dealt with in terms of our capacity to remain civilised in the face of whatever appalling violence is imposed on us.  In this context we must examine the recent events in Northern Ireland.  In some ways it is just as well that we had a few weeks of reflection about this, because many of us were extremely angry at the time and at least we have had time now to think about it further.</P>
    <P>What has happened in Northern Ireland seems to have been an increasing commitment of powers to the security forces, largely done in a vacuum of political inactivity, and as one initiative after another has failed people are moving towards what they believe in a very cold, detached and quite ruthless way to be the only way to answer back, and that is by violence.  That is quite frightening.  On a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on the killing of the young Catholic teacher and the attempt to assassinate her father, the judge, people who I presume were selected at random from the Catholic areas of Belfast were interviewed. Women when they were asked if they did not regret the death of this young girl effectively said no, that she was part of the system.  I found it quite spine-chilling that ordinary Irish people could be so alienated, hostile and embittered and that the assassination of a girl of about 19 years of age who happened to be the daughter of somebody who happened to be a judge could be discussed in that manner by people who did not identify with any political organisation, who just happened to live in certain areas.  That such a level of callousness, ruthlessness and alienation is being engendered is a fairly good indication of the scale of the problem which in many ways was crystallised in the recent judgment and the revelations that surfaced from it.</P>
    <P>We must move now beyond condemnation of political violence &mdash; though probably, to our regret, we will have to revert to it again and again &mdash; and talk about responses to political violence and recognise that it is the product not of <Col N="1108" /> manipulation by evil men &mdash; though I accept that they are there &mdash; but of political failure by politicians North and South of the Border and by all of us.  Senator Robb often talks about the need for repentance and in his generous way usually identifies the need for repentance by Northern Protestants in particular.  There is a need for repentance by all of us because of our sins of omission and commission, not just in the last 14 years but in the last 60 years, which have culminated in the dreadful mess ahead of us.  There are signs that we have begun to realise that a new, more complex, more difficult and in many ways quite traditional approach is necessary.  The speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Drogheda, in which he clearly underlined his commitment to the welfare of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, followed a line that was not too fashionable in this country for a number of years because a very defective and slightly over-simplified analysis and an attempt to analyse the problem entirely within the context of Northern Ireland made it less than fashionable.  However, we must go a great deal further if we are to do anything to deal with the frightening alienation of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, almost as much from what they would call the Free State as from the Government which has legal jurisdiction over them.</P>
    <P>Within these 15 minutes I will not attempt to produce an analysis of the solution in Northern Ireland, other than to say that I wish that the process which has been initiated by the Forum can be successful.  I regret that we will not get a chance to discuss that Report, but my political betters have their reasons for such things.  In the context of what happened in Northern Ireland and since the details have been gone into over and over again, what troubles me is the fact that, because we have the same problem here and because the problem of political violence and of crime generally is beginning to frighten us, we may be tempted to move &mdash; at least to some extent &mdash; in the same direction as the people have moved in Northern Ireland.  In a very significant speech about two years ago the present <Col N="1109" /> Garda Commissioner accepted the fact that in large areas of urban Ireland our own security force were now treated as an alien force and were not regarded as particularly friendly or supportive or part of that community.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that the degree of alienation or the process of developing hostility is anywhere near as badly developed &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; in the South as it is in Northern Ireland, but once that process is begun it will take enormous effort, resources, commitment and generosity and a capacity to suffer from unacceptable levels of crime to prevent it becoming complete. When you add in to that process here the fact that, unlike most other countries of western Europe, we have, in our history, a tradition of violence which may or may not be too well romanticised but which is very real in our tradition, in the context of a society which is beginning to strain at the centre because of pressures, internal and external violence, unemployment and other things and of the progressive alienation of our police force, I worry that the people who will see themselves as being without hope, South or North of the Border, will respond yet again in the traditional Irish method of resorting to violence of one kind of another.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge said that to respond to violence in the tactics, or even anything that approaches the tactics of the terrorists is to give them the final victory and to create the conditions in which they can only create more and greater chaos.</P>

      <P>I have made the point I wish to make, that a total alienation of a large minority in Northern Ireland has been achieved.  We are in danger of moving in the same direction here for reasons that are connected not entirely with Northern Ireland but which have a good deal to do with Northern Ireland and also with our own social and economic problems. We need to be careful to avoid simplistic solutions, legislative, judicial, economic or otherwise, which simply accelerate a process of alienation.  For a <Col N="1110" /> long time we persuaded ourselves that it did not and would not happen in Northern Ireland.  It has happened there. The signs are it is beginning to happen down here.  We need to be extremely careful.  This motion reflects concern for the implications for peace and stability in this country, not just in Northern Ireland. The implications are very clear-cut and very definite.  I support the motion wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>That is an Irish solution to a Northern problem.  I was taking notes when people were speaking.  I thank those who have contributed to the debate.  I will make a few comments about what was said.  I missed a little part of Senator Robb's contribution because I was called out to the telephone, but he made an important point about the emergency legislation in Northern Ireland and its misuse.  It has been used not for the purpose for which it was introduced but for the purposes of gathering information, which means that hundreds of young people are arrested on many occasions. The alienating effect of that is a very important factor, which he mentioned. It brings to mind the point referred to in all the reports of the reviews of emergency legislation regarding the need for care in enforcing this emergency legislation.  The question we need to ask ourselves is: when is an emergency an emergency?  When we find that once every six months in Westminster the emergency legislation &mdash; with hardly a discussion &mdash; is rubber-stamped for the next six months &mdash; I think they are now considering doing it on a yearly basis &mdash; we realise that to deal with Northern Ireland by emergency legislation is to <Col N="1111" /> ignore the problem and, in fact, to compound it.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan made an important point when he acknowledged the danger of discussing a judgment or making any comment on a judgment without having been in the court and heard all the evidence. That is something about which I was very much aware myself.  I agree wholly that justice must be seen to be done.  Judging from the reports in the newspapers &mdash; the matter was fairly widely reported in the Northern papers &mdash; what is important in this area, and particularly in Northern Ireland, is very often not what has happened but the perception of what has happened.  The perception in Northern Ireland in this instance was that justice had not been done.  Whether it was or not is beside the point.  The alienation, the frustration and the danger of that situation are quite clear.  It must be seen that the law is impartial.  Leaving aside the case, the indication from the statistics which I gave in my original speech is that the law is not impartially enforced in Northern Ireland. So long as that impression is the view of most of the Nationalist community then we are in a very dangerous situation indeed.</P>
      <P>Another important point which I am glad Senator Ryan made is that he hoped the strong reaction to this particularly bad case would lead to an improvement. I would like to think that he is right and that we might see changes in the way the authorities deal with such cases in the future, although on the basis of my past experience I have concern about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge shared the disquiet of all of us about this case.  Like the rest of the Senators, he was reluctant to comment &mdash; rightly so &mdash; on a judgment that was given, but he was quite right in pointing to the insensitivity of some of the comments of the judge, in particular the comments he singled out where the judge commended Constable Robinson for his marksmanship.  That was certainly interpreted by one section of the community in Northern Ireland with a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; and by the Nationalist section as meaning <Col N="1112" /> what I am quite certain the judge did not mean, that he was commending this man for what he had done.  Of course that has implications for peace and stability.</P>
    <P>Another important point was raised by Senator Dooge.  The nature of the training being received by these special units of the RUC was disclosed during the trial. In relation to what I have already said about the need for acceptability of the security forces and the need for a police force which can have the confidence of all the people of Northern Ireland in the divided society we live in, it is absolutely essential that police should not be trained in the manner that those police were trained in carrying out police duties.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan talked about the need for a new approach.  That sentiment was expressed by all of the speakers.  One of the problems we have in Northern Ireland is that political violence has tended to take the centre stage.  Not only the British Government but many people internationally think that the problem of Northern Ireland is one of political violence, particularly because of the violence of the Provisional IRA.  The truth, of course, is that political violence is a symptom of the problem.  The fact that the world spotlight has come in recent years on the violence has done a great disservice to all of the people of Northern Ireland, both Unionists and Nationalists, and to all the people of this island.  It has deflected attention away from the real problem of the divided community, the divided loyalties and the different identities of the people which have not ever been accommodated within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is good to note that the New Ireland Forum, at least, has now started a new initiative which will allow people to look at the real political problem &mdash; the underlying problem and not the symptom.  I would hope, and the same hope was expressed by a number of Senators, that the New Ireland Forum would lead to new political initiatives being taken now that the ball has been started rolling, so to speak, by nationalist Ireland.  It has to be congratulated for taking the initiative.</P>
    <P>Over the years the problem has been that instead of dealing with the problem <Col N="1113" /> the British Government have tended to start off by bringing in emergency provisions. In 1973 we had an Act which was stiffened in 1975 by further provisions. Then we had an attempt to deal with what was called the terrorist problem by confessions extracted in Castlereagh and places like that.  The Bennett Committee put an end to that for the time being, but there are worries at the moment that things may not be exactly as they should be.  For a while it was stopped.  Most of the convictions in the courts in Northern Ireland were gained on the basis of confessions.  Then we have the Diplock courts where a judge sits without a jury. We had a further bending of the law when the supergrass system was introduced in order to gain convictions.  In effect what happens is that the law gradually becomes more and more bent until eventually the law is brought totally into disrepute. Instead of dealing with the problem, that method of approaching it makes it much more difficult to resolve, because in the process you have further alienated those who were already alienated from the State anyway.</P>
    <P>Therefore, after 15 years of dealing with the problem in that manner, with the honourable exception of one British Government at the time of Sunningdale, it is long past the time when the problem should be dealt with as it ought to be dealt with by firm political action and by a decisive response from the British Government when they have studied the Forum Report, a decisive action on a political level to deal with the complex political problem we face in Northern Ireland.  If that is not done, I am afraid that the situation will continue to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>I resent people who contend that in saying this we are riding on the backs of terrorists and so on.  We are simply stating the truth and stating that if there is not a political solution, if accommodation is not to be found for both traditions in Northern Ireland, there is only one corollary. It is that the conflict will get worse and that the violence will increase.</P>
    <P>All Senators would agree that the only <Col N="1114" /> way forward is by political means.  The Forum has started that.  It is now a matter for the British Government to respond. It is the hope of all of the Irish people, North and South, Protestant and Catholic, Unionist and Nationalist and it is in their interest that this should happen.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 May 1984.  As already indicated, it is hoped that the Finance Bill will complete all Stages in the Dáil tomorrow and accordingly the Seanad should meet on three days next week.  It is the intention to take the Second Stage and between Second Stage and the commencement of Committee Stage to continue the debate on the Land Bill, and possibly to take the Committee Stage of the Hours of Work Bill.  I am warning Senators to be ready for three days' work next week.</P>

      <P>It is intended to commence the Committee Stage but not necessarily to complete it.  The Finance Bill must be law by the following week. It may be necessary for us to meet on Tuesday of the following week to complete Committee Stage.  It is felt because of the pressure of time that we should commence the Committee Stage but I will arrange for a couple of hours in between the Second Stage and Committee Stage to allow the drawing up of amendments.  We will put in other Government business.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. Tuesday, 15 May 1984.</P>
