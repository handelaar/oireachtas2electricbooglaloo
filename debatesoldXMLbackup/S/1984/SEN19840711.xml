      <P>I have received notice from Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The increase in the problem of smuggling and its implications for the economy and business.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that this matter is very wide-ranging in its scope and not appropriate for the limited debate allowed under the Standing Order.  It may be more suitable for discussion on a substantive motion.  I must, therefore, disallow the matter.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Since the Bill was published in October last it has been subjected to a long, detailed and, I think, constructively critical examination both in the other House and outside of it, and Senators, I am sure, will be familiar &mdash; in general terms at any rate &mdash; with its content and perhaps with the main features of the changes that were made to it during its passage through the Dáil.  I <Col N="1159" /> shall be dealing with the most important of these in my remarks here today.</P>
      <P>The Bill has provoked a great deal of discussion on certain issues that are fundamental in a free and democratic society. The ensuing debate I think, has, been useful and important and, certainly for me, instructive.  On that account we could perhaps all agree, whether we like the Bill or not, whether we are for or against it, that its advent has served at least one useful purpose &mdash; to cause us to reflect on some of the values of our society.</P>
      <P>At the core, the very heart, of the matter is the nature of freedom itself and its parameters, the extent to which and the circumstances in which it is permissible for the State to interfere with that freedom and the difficult task that confronts the State of attempting to reconcile sometimes conflicting rights.</P>
      <P>The common law has for long recognised and cherished the freedom of the individual, and that tradition and that specific common law right of individual liberty has been incorporated into our Constitution though it is not of course an unqualified right that cannot be abridged, as the Constitution makes clear.  The questions we have to ask ourselves are whether the Bill affects those rights for a justifiable reason and whether it does it only to the extent necessitated by the exigencies of the present situation.  In considering these questions it is necessary first to consider the immediately relevant question of the problem of crime in our society.</P>
      <P>In the period 1973 to 1982, the recorded number of indictable offences rose from 38,022 to 97,626 &mdash; a staggering 156 per cent increase.  Since then, as the 1983 Report on Crime shows, the figure has risen yet further to 102,387.  The problem is at its worst in our cities and large towns.  Dublin, with about a third of the total population, accounts for about 60 per cent of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell to any extent on the effect this appalling problem has had and is having on our communities. The picture has been very well painted already by others and there can hardly be a single Member of this House who is not <Col N="1160" /> intimately aware of it or who has not had direct experience of it himself or herself.</P>
    <P>We have become a crime-prone society, perhaps not to the extent of some other jurisdictions yet, thankfully, but the trends are there and we are heading in that direction unless we can succeed in doing something about it.</P>
    <P>Now I know that some Members of this House will tell me that this Bill is not the answer to the crime problem.  They will say, as others already have, that the Bill does not address itself to the causes of crime.  My answer to that is a straightforward one.  Yes, I agree that the Bill does not address itself to the cause of crime which, it is acknowledged, are deep-rooted in society.  But I have to say &mdash; without I hope offending anyone &mdash; that it is somewhat simplistic to assert that a Criminal Justice Bill &mdash; or indeed any Bill &mdash; can by itself solve the social problems that cause crime.  Certainly I have never made that assertion.  We cannot legislate away poverty and social deprivation which it is generally accepted contribute, perhaps significantly, to crime even though we know that the vast majority of poor people are never in trouble with the law.  We cannot legislate away unemployment &mdash; if we could it would have been done long ago.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that social legislation has no part to play in improving society or that it cannot be used as a mechanism for effecting desirable change or contribute to the creation of a more egalitarian society.  Of course it has an important role to play, but in our kind of economic system, and given our present level of resources, we can only hope to improve fundamentally the position of the poorer sections by striving to achieve increased prosperity.  The task of the Government is to ensure that, as far as possible, the climate is conducive to achieving this and I believe that we are doing this as effectively as we can in present circumstances and given the difficulties we face.</P>
    <P>The Government have the duty to govern and to deal with the problems of the day.  Crime is a major social evil and the people expect the Government to tackle it and, if possible, to solve it &mdash; certainly <Col N="1161" /> to do what is necessary to combat it and reduce it.  We would be failing in our duty and in our commitment to the people if we shirked that.  This Bill certainly addresses itself to the problem of crime. Admittedly it is thus addressing itself to the manifest consequences of our social ills and not to their root cause, but that is not a reasonable or a fair criticism. Crime is seriously affecting people's rights.  Individual liberties are being eroded by it &mdash; very seriously in some parts of our cities and towns.  Crime is big business &mdash; big for the criminals and profitable too, and big for the State.  It is costing close on £300 million in directly identifiable expenditure this year and there are huge unquantifiable costs in lost revenue from tourism and lost opportunities in industrial development.  It is inhibiting the creation of the kind of climate that I was referring to which is helpful to economic as well as social progress. Moreover the State is specifically obliged by constitutional imperative:</P>
    <P>by its laws [to] protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>When we took office many people were of the view that the criminals were winning the battle.  At times and in some important respects, the Garda and the courts seemed powerless to do anything. The concept of the rule of law appeared threatened.  People accused of serious crimes seemed all too often to be getting away on technicalities.  The balance seemed to have tipped in favour of the criminals.</P>
    <P>It was against this general background that this Bill was conceived and brought forward.  It results from a review of our criminal justice system &mdash; a review designed to identify means of improving law enforcement, especially criminal investigation and crime detection.  The review sought also to identify weaknesses in pre-trial procedures and in the trial procedures themselves &mdash; loopholes that were being exploited or that allowed people to get off on technicalities.  In <Col N="1162" /> short, the task of the review was to establish how best the balance could be restored so that people could again have confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>The absence of a power on the part of the Garda to detain suspects for a reasonable period so that they can be questioned and so that forensic and other tests and inquiries can be carried out was identified as perhaps the single most important and most urgent reform that was necessary.  I have dealt in some detail previously &mdash; though not here &mdash; with the background to this and it is perhaps reasonably well known.  It was the resurrection in the seventies of a 1930 Supreme Court decision, which seemed for many years to have been forgotten, <i>Dunne v. Clinton</i>, allied to an important decision in 1965 about admissibility of evidence obtained in breach of constitutional rights, <i>The People v. O'Brien</i> that effectively precluded the Garda from detaining suspects for questioning except under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  For a very long period previously the Garda had acted as if they had a power to detain people for questioning and I would think that, if the question had arisen, a majority of people would have assumed that they had.</P>
    <P>Even after it became clear that there was no legal power to detain suspects, resort was frequently had to the practice of inviting the person to come to the station to &ldquo;help the police with their inquiries&rdquo;.  More often than not, it has to be admitted, this was operated in such a way that the suspect might have thought that he was in fact being detained and, of course, he would have presumed that the Garda had power to do that.  It was only when the admissibility in evidence of statements or confessions was subsequently challenged in court that, eventually, in a series of cases, the courts effectively ended the practice of inviting suspects to &ldquo;help with inquiries&rdquo;.  The consequences have been very serious indeed.  In some cases accused persons about whom there was little or no doubt that they had committed serious offences &mdash; because they had confessed &mdash; were acquitted even though there was no question that the confessions had not been <Col N="1163" /> made freely and voluntarily.  This is an unacceptably high price for the community in general to have to pay for a defect in the law.</P>
    <P>It is to that problem that sections 4 to 10 of the Bill are directed.  In my view a responsible Legislature must, especially in present circumstances, respond to the problem and give the Garda the power that they need to do their job properly. Some people have criticised the proposed powers of detention on the ground that they are importing into the permanent law a new concept that has no precedent except in so-called emergency legislation. That is not the case.  As I have already mentioned, for many years most people here assumed that the Garda had a power to detain suspects for questioning and the Garda acted as if they had.  We are, therefore, quite used to the idea of people who are reasonably suspected of an offence being brought in for questioning and, on that account, it cannot be regarded as a new departure.  Indeed, let me once again point out in this connection that section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act is not emergency legislation but is part of the permanent law of the land.</P>
    <P>Another objection voiced to the power of detention is that it will encourage the Garda to concentrate on interrogations with a view to obtaining confessions instead of seeking to obtain independent evidence as a result of more traditional detective work.  I do not accept that this necessarily follows and, in any event, it seems to undervalue the role played by skilled questioning of suspects in modern police methods.  Questioning of suspects &mdash; and the availability to the police of a power to compel suspects to attend so that they can be questioned &mdash; is widely recognised as an essential part of criminal investigation.  The Thomson Committee which investigated criminal procedure in Scotland &mdash; its report was published in 1975 &mdash; recognised this and recommended that the police should be given power to detain suspects.  They said:</P>
    <P>The policeman's real difficulty arises in investigations where he wants to interview a suspect or prevent him from interfering with evidence such as <Col N="1164" /> stolen property.  At present the police are powerless to act without the consent of the very person who is likely to have most interest in refusing to give that consent.  Clearly the police should not be entitled to arrest anyone they want to interview but it seems plainly wrong, for example, that a suspected violent criminal with significant evidence on his clothing has to be left at large while the police seek other evidence of his guilt sufficient to entitle them to charge.</P>
    <P>The Thomson Committee recommended that the power should be exercisable only where the constable had reasonable cause to suspect the detainee of having committed an offence for which there was a power of arrest without warrant. They also said that:</P>
    <P>This power of detention should of course not be exercised in every case in which the police have reasonable cause for suspicion but only when the police consider it necessary to detain the suspect for the purpose of their investigations.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows this approach by providing in section 4 (2) that a person may only be detained following a lawful arrest on &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; where the member in charge of the station to which he is taken has reasonable grounds for believing that the person's detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>In England the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure which reported in 1981 also recognised the importance of a period of detention following arrest, as did the Australian Law Reform Commission. In our country, Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain, in an addendum to his committee's report, recommended that the police should have a power to detain suspects following arrest.</P>
    <P>These are all common law jurisdictions to which I have referred.  But we know also from our researches that in continental Europe the position is the same.  Every police force that we know of has a power to detain suspects for questioning &mdash; generally for a duration of 24 hours &mdash; and in Europe of course such a period is usually <Col N="1165" /> followed by a further period of examination before a magistrate, which could go on for very long indeed.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of detention I want to mention particularly the safeguards that are in the Bill and others that will be available when the powers of detention begin to operate.  I have said already that arrest &mdash; and incidentally let me mention in passing that this Bill does not confer any new powers of arrest on the Garda &mdash; must be on reasonable suspicion that an offence carrying a penalty of at leave five years imprisonment has been committed.  Then there has to be confirmation by the member in charge of the station that detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence. Again there must be reasonable grounds for this authorisation.  Six hours is the maximum period of detention unless it is extended by at least a superintendent who must also have reasonable grounds for believing that the extension is necessary. These tests of &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; are, as Senators will appreciate, objective tests and are open to review by the courts. Although the Bill authorises detention for up to 12 hours &mdash; which incidentally is the maximum period for which a person may be detained unless he consents to a rest period between midnight and 8 a.m. &mdash; the person must be released if within the 12-hour period there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting him, and of course as soon as there is enough evidence to charge him he must be charged and brought before a court.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that arose when the Bill was being discussed in the Dáil was the possible scope for abuse that might have existed under the original draft if the police could detain a person for successive periods of 12 hours at a time for different offences arising out of the same incident.  There was also a view that the Bill could be used in combination with the Offences Against the State Act so that a person could be detained for a possible total of 60 hours for the same offence.  The Bill was amended to seal off the possibility of any abuse of that sort <Col N="1166" /> and I am now satisfied that it does not admit of any such possibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the existing right of reasonable access to a solicitor and adds to it by requiring the Garda to inform the detained person of that right and to send notification to the solicitor and to one other person named by him.  Special arrangements have been made for persons under 17 years old and of course these provisions must be construed in the context of existing law under which, generally speaking, a child or young person must be allowed to have a parent present during any questioning.</P>
    <P>Mention of children brings me to another important amendment made on Report Stage in the Dáil.  The detention provisions will not now apply to children below the age of 12 years.  I did this to allay the genuine concern felt by many sincere people, though I remain of the opinion that their fears would not have been realised in practice and were exploited by those opposed to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of safeguards, perhaps the most important amendment made to the Bill was the inclusion of section 7. This provision makes it binding on the Minister to make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody. The regulations will amount to a code of practice governing the treatment of detained persons and will have binding legal force.  I also agreed, during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, to bring the regulations before both Houses in draft form before they are made so that they can be discussed.  This is reflected in subsection (5) of section 7.</P>
    <P>Before moving to other areas of the Bill let me conclude on detention by saying that no Minister would, I think, come before the Oireachtas with provisions such as these if he were not satisfied that they were essential to deal with a serious situation.  I believe the case for these measures has been demonstrated to rest on a rational and logical foundation and, on that basis, I commend them to this House.</P>
    <P>At least 8,200 indictable offences were committed by persons on bail in 1983 and there is, therefore, an urgent need to do something about this problem.  We <Col N="1167" /> considered introducing measures which would have made it more difficult for persons charged with offences to get bail &mdash; by, for example, allowing the court to refuse to grant it where there was evidence that the person was likely to commit further offences while on bail &mdash; but the legal advice available suggested that this would probably require an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In any event, making it more difficult for people to get bail would probably have proved controversial on the grounds that such a restriction on the availability of bail might be inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.  We opted instead for three measures contained in sections 11 to 13.  First, consecutive sentences will be mandatory for offences committed on bail.  Second, the limit on the aggregate of consecutive sentences in the District Court will be two years instead of 12 months and, third, failure to surrender to bail is being made an offence for the first time.  These measures will, I hope, help to deal with what is, I believe, a problem of scandalous proportions at present.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to sections 15 and 16.  They deal with two very specific and difficult problems facing us.  There has been a noticeable increase in the use of firearms in serious crimes in recent years and there is a thriving business in stolen property.  People found in unlawful possession of firearms of course can be charged with an offence but it is very difficult to get at the source of supply of the weapons.  It is said that in Dublin there is no difficulty in hiring a gun to do a specific job and there are those who specialise in supplying them.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in relation to stolen property, it never ceases to amaze me how stolen property seems to vanish into &ldquo;thin air&rdquo;&mdash; demonstrating, no doubt, how &ldquo;professional&rdquo; the receivers are at disposing of it and perhaps the large number of people who end up buying it at bargain prices.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to charge a person found in possession of stolen property with an offence because evidence of theft or receiving is lacking.</P>
    <P>We need to strengthen the law to deal <Col N="1168" /> with people found in possession of weapons or stolen property so as to get information about sources of supply and this is what sections 15 and 16 are about.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that these sections would oblige a spouse, under penalty of imprisonment, to give information acquired during marriage about the other spouse.  What we have done is to provide that any statement made by a person that would incriminate a spouse will not be admissible in evidence but it would not be possible to go much further than that without depriving the provisions of all value.  If it were possible to refuse to give information on the grounds that it would necessitate divulging a communication made during marriage, then it would be open to every married person to use that as an excuse.  There would be no way of checking the truth of the matter and, consequently, spurious claims could succeed.  The sections would be, I think, valueless.  Originally provision was made for 5-year sentences on conviction on indictment for failure or refusal to give information about illegally-held firearms or stolen property.  I had this penalty deleted to make it clear that there was no intention either now or in the future to make these offences attract the detention provisions.  The offence is now a purely summary one, and is in line with provisions already in the law requiring persons to give information, such as section 107 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention has been focused on the provisions which introduce some modifications to the right of silence.  These are sections 18 and 19. Originally there was another provision of a more general nature (formerly section 16 of the Bill as published) but, following debate in the Dáil and having listened to representations made to me by interested groups and individuals, I decided to drop it.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 represent the substance of a recommendation made by Judge Barra Ó Briain in his report.  I think they are common-sense provisions that need to be in the law to restore a proper balance to our trial procedures. They do not compel a person to give information or answer questions but <Col N="1169" /> where somebody is found in particularly suspicious circumstances &mdash; for example, with bloodstains on clothing or at the scene of a crime &mdash; and fails or refuses to account for that fact when asked, it will be open to the court to draw an adverse inference from that failure or refusal.  The critical point is that the court or jury will only be able to draw such inferences as appear proper.  Whether it would be proper in a particular case would depend on all the circumstances and it must be borne in mind that in a jury trial this issue will be the subject of directions by the judge.  There are various safeguards, including the requirement that the suspect must be warned in ordinary language and that he cannot be convicted on the basis of an inference alone.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to mention one or two other important matters.  Generally we are tightening up on trial procedures and the provisions about giving notice of an alibi &mdash; 14 days notice will have to be given to the prosecution &mdash; and abolishing the right to make an unsworn statement at trials have been widely welcomed.  Majority verdicts are being introduced.  Not everybody agrees with majority verdicts but the Government believe they are right in principle and necessary to deal with the growing number of &ldquo;hung jury&rdquo; cases in some of which, at least, there was more than a hint of intimidation.  Majority verdicts have been working well in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland for many years and there is no evidence that any miscarriage of justice has ever occurred as a result.  The provisions allowing evidence to be given in writing instead of orally in certain circumstances &mdash; sections 20 and 21 &mdash; are designed to speed up trial procedures by allowing purely formal matters which are not in dispute to be proved in this way.  There should be a reasonable &ldquo;spin of&rdquo; from these provisions in terms of reduced costs at trials.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the introduction of electronic recording of Garda questioning of suspects.  It will be introduced in due course by means of regulations made by the Minister under section 27. <Col N="1170" /> Some time before the Bill was published I set up a small committee to advise me on how best this should be done.  The committee include an expert in electronic engineering.  A great deal of work needs to be done before we can have recording of questioning &mdash; whether it is audio or video or both &mdash; and field trials need to be carried out to evaluate it.  The committee have already examined developments in this field in Scotland and England and will be looking at other jurisdictions.  Until such time as the Bill is enacted and section 4 is operational, the field trials cannot get under way because, apart from section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, there is no legal power to detain suspects for questioning.  I want to assure the House that this is a key matter in the context of this Bill, that the Government are committed to it and that it is intended to proceed with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>It was urged on me that I should put a time limit on certain sections so that they could be reviewed and a decision made about their continuance in the light of experience of their operation.  Although I dislike the emergency flavour that this might impart to the provisions in question I agreed to do it because I thought it would be useful to have such a review after a period.  The sections in question are those dealing with detention, withholding information and inferences from silence.  The operative provision is section 2.  It provides that these particular sections will cease after four years unless continued in force by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  Statistics on the operation of the sections will be kept as a basis for review.  The four-year period does not of course exclude amendment of any of the sections in the interim if that should prove necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government gave a commitment when the Bill was published that the provisions giving increased powers to the Garda would not be brought into operation until new procedures for the handling of complaints against them, introducing a strong independent element, were in force.  I want to reiterate that commitment here today.  The Bill to give effect to it is being prepared at present <Col N="1171" /> and consultations with Garda representative associations are proceeding.  I hope to have it published in the autumn.  While I cannot at this stage comment on the substance of the new procedures, I am confident that they will be widely accepted as being independent and fair and that they will help towards improving the image of the force and the confidence of the public in them.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the outset of the difficult task the State has in reconciling some times conflicting rights and which is at the heart of the debate over this Bill.  There is, on the one hand, the right of the individual, which is paramount in a free society, to freedom from arrest and detention &ldquo;save in accordance with law&rdquo;&mdash; a right which has for long been embraced in the concept of the rule of law under which we live.  It is incumbent on the State always to show great sensitivity in upholding this right and not to allow it to be endangered by the exercise of arbitrary power.  There is also the right of the individual charged with an offence to be tried fairly in due course of law.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, and on the other side of the equation, there is the right of the community to have those responsible for criminal acts brought to justice and the corresponding right of the citizen to be protected in his life, person and property from unjust attack, a right that in our legal system has, as I have said, been given a specific constitutional basis.</P>
    <P>In attempting to reconcile these rights, a balance has to be struck.  I believe the Bill has done so, fairly and properly.  The fundamental rights of the individual that I have mentioned are not threatened by this Bill which confers no power that can be exercised arbitrarily.  There are, as I have shown, important restrictions, qualifications and safeguards and, in the end, there are courts of law which will not be slow to vindicate those rights and deal with any transgressions.</P>
    <P>As regards fairness of trial procedures, perhaps we need to be reminded from time to time that it is not all that long since the position of an accused person was far less favourable than it is today.  It is not that long since an accused had very little right to legal representation even in <Col N="1172" /> serious cases, could not give evidence on his own behalf and enjoyed only a very limited right of appeal.  Nowadays legal representation is the rule, even in minor cases.  More often than not it is paid for by the State.  An accused may of course give evidence like everyone else and there are extensive rights of appeal both on the merits and on points of law.  Trials take up a lot of time and judges and juries are scrupulous in giving the benefit of any doubt to accused persons.  The risks of miscarriages of justice accordingly have been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>It seems therefore that fairness has a very different meaning today than it did in the not too distant past.  But perhaps we need to ask whether, to some extent, fairness has not been carried too far in one direction and whether our trial procedures nowadays are sufficiently fair to ourselves &mdash; the law abiding community. In their Eleventh Report, the English Criminal Law Revision Committee, which comprised some of the most eminent lawyers of our time, had this to say about the concept of fairness:</P>
    <P>We need hardly say that we have no wish to lessen the fairness of criminal trials.  But it must be clear what fairness means in this connection.  It means, or ought to mean, that the law should be such as will secure as far as possible that the result of the trial is the right one.  That is to say, the accused should be convicted if the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty, but otherwise not.  We stress this, although it may seem obvious, because fairness seems often to be thought of as something which is due to the defence only.  At least there seems to be an idea that the defence have a sacred right to the benefit of anything in the law which may given them a chance of acquittal, even on a technicality, however strong the case is against them.  We disagree entirely with this idea.  It seems to derive from an unwarranted extension of the principle that, in order that the accused should be convicted, the prosecution must prove their case and perhaps also of the convention that those appearing <Col N="1173" /> for the prosecution are not concerned to secure a conviction but only to present the case.  As a result the habit has grown up of looking at a criminal trial as a kind of game to be played, according to fixed rules, between the prosecution and the defence; and since the defence are naturally likely to be the weaker (and the accused may very likely seem stupid and helpless), it seems to be expected that the prosecution will refrain from using all their strength and that the judge will take any opportunity to make the contest more even.</P>
    <P>The spirit of that passage certainly underlines many of the provisions of this Bill especially perhaps those dealing with trial procedures.  I very much hope that Senators will see the Bill in this light.  One way or the other I am sure that this debate will be a constructive one.  I am, of course, here to listen to the views of the House and to take them into account.  In my view the Bill is a better one now than it was when first published.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been discussed at great length in another House. A number of its unacceptable parts have been removed.  Generally it has been improved during its passage through that House.  The Minister said at the beginning of his remarks in that House that he would listen to suggestions, that he would accept amendments and he in fact did so.  He has acknowledged here today that the suggestions that were made have improved the Bill.  I hope that he will adopt a similar attitude in this House. Undoubtedly there will be amendments put forward.  I hope he will consider them in the same objective way and accept them if the case is made for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill covers several aspects of the criminal law.  Many of its provisions are clearly acceptable and very useful reforms of the criminal law.  On the other hand, a number of them give rise to very serious misgivings.  When I say that they give rise to serious misgivings I am saying that perhaps in the long term these provisions <Col N="1174" /> are necessary.  Nevertheless they cause a great deal of thought and a great deal of misgiving as to whether, in all the circumstances, they are necessary.  The Bill is in many ways a Committee Stage Bill.  I do not propose to go into details here today.  We will have adequate opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 25 deal with trial procedure. Whereas some points may arise on Committee Stage and possibly some amendments will be put down, in general terms the provisions of the Bill dealing with trial procedure are useful and should be considered favourably.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 12 and 13 again are reasonable.  They deal with bail.  Concurrent sentences for offences committed while on bail, which has been the rule up to now, really made no sence whatsoever. A person who knew that almost certainly he would be convicted was, in fact, encouraged to commit another offence while he was on bail.  He knew that he might as well have a go, that he would not get any extra sentence, and if he needed the money or felt that his family needed the money there was nothing to be lost by committing further offences. Therefore, that provision in existing law has been changed and the case for that change is very strong.  The rules about granting bail at present are very strict as a result of a Supreme Court decision some years ago and are really confined to two cases.  In my view the rules are too strict because, in a number of other situations a case could be made for refusing bail but as the law stands at the moment it would be impossible to change this without amending the Constitution. Therefore, in the present situation the Minister cannot take any action in this regard, but in the absence of a change in the rules under which bail can be refused section 11 is of some help.</P>
    <P>Section 14 increasing penalties for firearms offences is useful in so far as it emphasises the seriousness of the offence, but it is unlikely to make any practical difference.  Increasing sentences from 14 years to life certainly emphasises the seriousness of the offence, but I cannot see it ever being put into operation. Even at present the average sentence <Col N="1175" /> served by a person convicted of murder is about eight or nine years.  Therefore, if that is the position regarding the most serious crime that exists, I cannot see in practice a person convicted on a firearms charge serving more than eight, nine or perhaps ten years.  The extension of this has some advantage, some purpose, from the cosmetic point of view but it is unlikely to be used to the full extent.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 create the offences of withholding information regarding firearms, ammunition or allegedly stolen property.  As the Minister has pointed out, this is not entirely a new concept.  It exists in the Road Traffic Act and the Official Secrets Act, but now we are moving into an undesirable area as far as the law is concerned.  Looking at this from one point of view it is an infringement of the right to silence.  When somebody is asked to make a statement or give information and cannot simply say that he does not wish to say anything, this is clearly an infringement of the right to silence.  These sections introduce something which must be looked at very critically to see whether in all the circumstances this is really necessary and whether the advantages which it is alleged will be introduced by these provisions are worth the inroads into personal liberties.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, we have precedents for doing this, and this is the danger of creating a precedent. What happens is that a very strong case is made in some situation, in some Bill, for doing something that is a precedent. The case is so strong, so convincing, so persuasive that the precedent is created and when another Bill comes along the Minister of the day can say, &ldquo;Of course, this is not such a dangerous provision; after all, there is a precedent&rdquo; or &ldquo;There are precedents&rdquo;.  It emphasises the danger of creating the precedent.  We have it already and if this Bill goes through we will follow that precedent and from then on it will be very difficult to resist further provisions of this kind. We must consider these two sections of the Bill very seriously, weigh up and pros and cons and consider whether in all the circumstances these provisions are worth <Col N="1176" /> while, worth the sacrifice we will be making in having them on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 deal with inferences, the question of a person being asked to account for objects, marks etc. on his clothing, for instance, and if he does not account for them then inferences can be drawn when the case goes to trial.  Section 19 deals with his presence at a particular place at a particular time which gives rise to suspicion that he was involved in a crime.  This goes even further than the sections about information. These sections are without question in contravention of the existing right to silence.  These and the provisions about detention are the two aspects of the Bill which give rise to the need for looking at this Bill very carefully indeed.  The importance of the right to silence is that it prevents a person from incriminating himself.  This applies in two cases.  An innocent person, as a result of this section, may make a statement or give an explanation which, far from explaining satisfactorily how the mark or whatever originated, may incriminate him or appear to incriminate him and suddenly he becomes a prime suspect.  If the person is rather simple and unsophisticated he may well, as a result of this section, find himself deeply involved in some crime for which he is in no way responsible. This can happen.  A person may be asked, sometimes in a rather unfair way, to explain something.  One must accept that the police have a job to do and they are not going to ask questions in an entirely objective way or lean over backwards to be fair.  They will suggest and ask the person to explain and go on further when he gives an answer and manage eventually to persuade and induce the person to give explanations which will make the position very serious indeed for the person involved.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of a person who is guilty there may be no other evidence against him, certainly initially, and this will possibly lead to his incriminating himself.  It may be said by many people that if he is guilty he does not deserve any consideration so there is no harm done.  But this is not the view which the State should take.  We have to realise and <Col N="1177" /> accept that these two sections are very serious sections from the point of view of the right of the citizen and that if we make this departure we are making a departure which is very serious, which is basically new and which, in the way precedents tend to develop, may be used as a precedent for something further in the future and may lead to a deterioration in the right of the citizen in terms of his personal liberty.  These two sections are ones which we have to approach with considerable trepidation.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with detention are the ones which have given rise to most discussion and debate, both within the Houses and outside.  They have been very seriously criticised.  They have been opposed.  Most of the opposition to this Bill has been in relation to the sections on detention.  This approach to detention is a new departure and a very serious one.  The Minister said today that the concept was not really new in this country because for many years people were detained for questioning because they did not realise they need not stay in the Garda barracks, that they were helping the police with their inquiries.  I am sure that in 99 cases out of 100 the people concerned did not realise they could simply walk out and refuse to say anything. The Minister says it is not a new departure because it has been happening and this is merely legalising something that was happening in the past.  That is hardly the correct way to approach this situation. It ceased to happen because the courts pointed out that what was happening was improper and the Bill is now seeking to make it legal to detain people and to allow interrogation to take place.</P>
    <P>People tend to think that this will only happen to criminals, to bad types and so on and that consequently there is no great harm done, but the fact is that this kind of treatment, though it might not in the end lead to any conviction or anything of that kind, may be meted out to perfectly innocent people.  It is the kind of thing we must realise could happen to a member of our families, to ourselves, to neighbours whom one knows to be highly respectable, decent people.  The trouble <Col N="1178" /> about these things is that when we introduce a power of this kind, everybody in the State is liable to be affected by it and liable to be affected even if they do not end up by being charged with anything. The idea of spending six, 12, or possibly even 20 hours in a Garda station being subjected to interrogation and in addition to questioning, to be liable to be searched, photographed and fingerprinted, to have tests taken and to have everything of their belongings taken from them, is rather terrifying.  It is new.  If we pass this Bill we are passing something very serious into the law of this country. Consequently, we have to look at it very carefully, to weigh up the pros and cons and to decide whether in all the circumstances the provision is really necessary.</P>
    <P>We would need to be careful in this House because the very fact that the Bill has been discussed in another House for upwards of a year, that we have been reading about it and have heard the arguments from both sides, means that we have to an extent got used to the idea. Familiarity breeds contempt.  We have heard so much about detention and heard the arguments and so on that we are inclined at this stage to take if for granted, to accept that it has passed through another place and there is no use discussing it any further or fighting against it further.  One thing we must do in this House is look at this particular aspect of the Bill, look at it with an entirely fresh mind, forget so far as we can the arguments and so on that have taken place in another place and look at it as though it was only published for the first time a few days ago.  That is something that is true of most Bills that this House considers but it is particularly true of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the powers of detention which are introduced in this Bill exist in almost every country, in the common law countries and in the European countries and that in most cases they are at least as extensive as the ones proposed in this Bill.  The fact that they exist does not necessarily mean that they are justified because not all laws in all countries are right or justified merely because they exist.  It may be that some <Col N="1179" /> of the countries that have been experiencing these powers may well be coming to the conclusion that they are too extensive, that they would be better off without them, or certainly better off without them in the form they are at present.  The fact that they exist and that we are merely being brought into line with what happens in other countries is an argument and something we have to bear in mind but it is not necessarily a justification of what is proposed in this Bill.  There may be in those countries, as well as certain advantages in having the power of detention, a great deal of injustice and hardship created because of them and the weighing up of the pros and cons is something which would be impossible for us to judge.</P>
    <P>This is probably the most serious point of view of personal liberties, the most serious aspect of this Bill and one to which we must bring a fresh mind to bear. We must consider for ourselves whether these powers are necessary to the extent and in the way which they are proposed in this Bill.  The Bill, from the point of view of personal rights and liberties, is the most serious and most significant change in the criminal law which has been introduced in this country for the past 30 or 40 years.  It is no exaggeration to say that.  It puts into perspective the kind of Bill we are dealing with and the serious decisions we are asked to take.</P>
    <P>However, it would be wrong to look on the provisions of this Bill as though we were some kind of a commission dealing with personal rights, the liberty of the individual and so on.  We should not look at it merely from that point of view.  It is the obligation and duty of the Members of this House to take a very broad perspective and to look at criminal law not merely from the point of view of the individual but from the point of view of the community also.  We have to try to weigh up the situation bearing both these factors in mind.</P>
    <P>The price of liberty is eternal vigilance, vigilance for personal rights on the one hand and vigilance for the rights of the community.  It is very often the case that an exaggerated concern for personal rights leads to an undermining of the <Col N="1180" /> rights and welfare of the community generally. Law and order must be preserved. One of the unfortunate things is that almost any Bill dealing with law and order automatically involves some curtailment of personal rights and liberties. Consequently, it is a matter of weighing up the infringements to see whether in all the circumstances every measure proposed is really necessary.  The onus of proof, as it were, must be on the Minister and on the people discussing this to show that it is really necessary.  If there is any doubt, provisions of this kind should not be introduced.  It will be impossible to prove to everybody's satisfaction that exactly the right balance has been achieved.  We have a responsibility on both sides, responsibility for the welfare of the community as well as a responsibility for the personal rights of the individuals.</P>
    <P>In deciding how far civil liberties, civil rights and personal rights may be infringed there are no absolutes and no constant factors.  A Bill of this kind must always be viewed against the background that exists in a country.  In times of peace and prosperity undoubtedly the emphasis should be on personal rights.  On the other hand, we all know that in times of war emergency powers are introduced with the approval of almost everybody because they feel that in such times it would be impossible and unrealistic to have too much regard for the niceties of the rights of individuals.  There are two extremes in approaching this.  We always have to look at the existing situation before we decide whether a Bill such as this is appropriate in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider are the statistics of crime for the last decade.  The Minister has given examples of the increase in indictable crimes over a ten-year period which, by any standard, are very alarming and depressing.  One could not but come to the conclusion that crime is on the verge of getting out of hand and that very severe measures may have to be taken to try to deal with it.  There has been a dramatic rise in crime, particularly in the cities.  It is against this background that we must consider whether the powers <Col N="1181" /> in this Bill are necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>A personal experience brought home to me the deterioration of the situation with regard to crime.  A family I knew very well having lived in Ireland for many years decided for family reasons to go to the United States.  After a short time there the husband died and the wife wrote to us to say that she was bringing her young family back to Ireland.  She decided that she would bring them back and rear them here because this was a country where she knew her children could walk the streets of the city in perfect safety without fear of being attacked or mugged.  That was not much longer than ten years ago.  Listening to her, we could then say that she was perfectly right to bring her family back to Ireland. Nobody could say the same about Ireland today.</P>
    <P>However bad it is in the US it is just as bad here and, possibly, even worse.  It is a sad commentary on the deterioration that has taken place in this regard in approximately ten years.  The deterioration is startling and alarming.  For that reason it would be irresponsible to ignore what has happened and not to give serious thought to any measures put before us which might help to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Part of the Minister's case for including some of the provisions of this Bill is that technicalities are frustrating the police. These technicalities are preventing law breakers from being brought to justice. If that is true we must look at the position to see whether something needs to be done.  It must be borne in mind that if the Garda continually find themselves frustrated by technicalities in bringing accused people before the courts and getting convictions, and frustrated because, in some cases, sentences are minimal and derisory, it would be impossible to blame them if they came to the conclusion that they were wasting their time trying to solve crime, getting convictions and so on.  One could understand if they began to adopt a &ldquo;could not care less&rdquo; attitude to the job of curbing crime.</P>
    <P>To the extent that this argument may <Col N="1182" /> be true, we must look at the situation and see if the Garda are being unduly frustrated in their activities and if we can help in the situation without going too far in another direction, but we must keep our approach to this in perspective.  It would be very easy indeed to err on the other side.  Nearly all the provisions that exist for the protection of the liberty of the individual, personal rights and so on, could be described by enthusiasts for law and order as mere technicalities.  The complaint that the Garda are being frustrated by technicalities has to be looked at seriously, but looked at in perspective &mdash; not adopted or accepted as being necessarily true because many of the technicalities, as they might be called, are amongst the fundamental provisions for the protection of the individual.</P>
    <P>I am sure that we will be told in the course of this debate that these measures are not necessary at all, that they are not getting to the roots of the problem, that the roots of the problem are economic and social and so on and that if these were improved there would be little or no crime.  There is no doubt that economic and social conditions have a bearing on crime and are responsible for some crime, but I do not accept that all crime is due to environmental or hereditary factors.  If you push that to a certain extent you get to the position when nobody is guilty, in the strict sense, of anything, it is always because of their background or some weakness for which they are not really responsible.  The French phrase was &ldquo;To understand is to forgive&rdquo;.  If you fully understand a person and why he committed a crime, then you must forgive him.  That is pushing the argument to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is our primary responsibility, as legislators, to do everything in our power to improve economic and social conditions. In so as far as that is done and in so far as that will lessen the amount of crime, then it is our duty to do it.  I do not accept that that is the only reason for crime.  Even if it were, we would still have to try to preserve law and order while doing our utmost to improve the social and economic situation.  We have a duty in both ways.  A lot of crime has nothing to do <Col N="1183" /> with deprivation, poverty or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at the kind of savagery and viciousness that was displayed in Slane a few days ago to realise the kind of people who exist, the savagery that exists for no reason that is possible to understand except by the individual himself. That kind of crime goes on and is something that has to be dealt with.  In so far as this Bill may help to prevent that kind of behaviour, then we must give it very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill could be regarded as being disappointing in the sense that it does not have positive features.  It is mainly repressive, not in an offensive way but in the sense that it introduces new ways in which law breakers can be brought to justice, but in a repressive way.  There are a number of things that possibly could have been included in the Bill.  The Minister can say there will be other Bills and perhaps other more appropriate occasions. To take one example, the discussions, the experience we have had in the last few years about community involvement in preventing crime, community watches and so on are very important developments which can prevent crime and do something else as well &mdash; they can create a better kind of liaison between the public and the Garda if the Garda co-operate with the community in this way.  That is important and useful from two points of view.  It is something which deserves support and encouragement but also needs a certain amount of control, because it can get out of hand.  It could have been introduced in this Bill or should be introduced in another Bill in the near future.</P>
    <P>A serious effort must be made by the Garda to improve their relationship with the public.  It would be wrong to say that the Garda are doing all that is reasonable in that regard at present.  This relationship could be improved by very simple things, by just a little bit more courtesy, a little more ordinary good manners in dealing with the public.  The fact is that some gardaí, at least, behave in a quite bad mannered way when they are simply stopping people for routine checks and so on.  The bad manners displayed by some gardaí are unbelievable.  A law-abiding <Col N="1184" /> citizen whose attitude to the Garda is a very positive and favourable one can be very seriously turned off by a simple, unnecessary incident like that. This situation is quite serious.  The relationship between the Garda and the community is a very important one.  If the Garda are to get co-operation from members of the public, this can be very important in dealing with crime.  A well disposed citizen who is turned off by that kind of incident may be a vital person in giving information or helping the Garda in relation to some crime and may not be disposed to do so as a result of that kind of incident.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to the complaints procedure.  As I understand it, the Minister has promised that this Bill will not be put into operation until the complaints procedure is available.  I am not clear as to how that would be introduced &mdash; whether it would be in the form of a Bill. It appears that it will be a Bill and that it will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is most unsatisfactory that we did not at least have the details of the complaints procedure available so that we would know exactly what was envisaged, to what extent it was independent and to what extent it was likely to be effective and reliable in dealing with complaints. It is impossible fully to evaluate the contents of the Bill before us without knowing what the complaints procedure will be.  One might be in considerable doubt whether in all the circumstances some of the measures in this Bill are necessary and one would be affected by complaints procedure.  If the complaints procedure was likely to be effective, then a person considering this Bill might be willing to take what was obviously a risk from the point of view of the individual's rights. The fact that we do not know what this will be like must make it difficult for Members of this House to evaluate the Bill and to know whether they are justified in approving the measure.  From that point of view the fact that it is not available will make it difficult to consider the provisions of this Bill satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier this is very largely a Committee Stage Bill.  The various highly technical and very detailed provisions can <Col N="1185" /> be gone into in great detail on Committee Stage and amendments proposed if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this Bill has been the subject of extensive debate and careful scrutiny both in the other House and outside the Oireachtas.  It is still a very worrying Bill and one which has rightly caused grave concern among very broad sections of the population. One preliminary comment which I should like to make is that the extent of that concern and the amount of debate are very encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall when the Bill was first published and presented by the Minister last October, and when it was first discussed in the Labour Parliamentary Party, one concern widely expressed was a fear that it would not be properly and adequately debated.  Indeed, there was an initial concern that it might be pushed through before Christmas and that there might not be an open and full discussion of the terms of the Bill.  There was also a very deep concern among members of the Labour Parliamentary Party about certain aspects of the Bill and certain sections of it.  Meetings were held with the Minister for Justice and a number of significant amendments were made as a result of those representations and no doubt I will deal in more detail with those in due course.  It is worth casting our minds back to the publication of the Bill in October and the immediate aftermath of it, because it is fair to say that the reaction to the Bill was like a slow burning fuse.  There was a very subdued low-key reaction initially, but gradually there was a much deeper and sharper awareness of the implications of the Bill.  Tribute should be paid to those who led in creating an awareness of the implications of a measure such as this &mdash; bodies such as the Council for Civil Liberties, the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, the <i>ad hoc</i> group, consisting of individuals like Joe Costello, who got together to oppose this Bill.  These groups started a debate in the public generally, and this debate was very strongly supported by an <i>ad hoc</i> group of lawyers who got together to <Col N="1186" /> express concern about the Bill, and by the Incorporated Law Society and by the Bar Council &mdash; by the establishments of both branches of the legal profession. All of this contributed to a growing awareness of the implications of a measure such as this for society.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the scope of that debate.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Bill has provoked a great deal of discussion on certain issues that are fundamental in a free and democratic society.  The ensuing debate has, I think, been useful and important and, certainly for me, instructive.  On that account we could perhaps all agree, whether we like the Bill or not &mdash; whether we are for or against it &mdash; that its advent has served at least one useful purpose &mdash; to cause us to reflect on some of the values of our society.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree that the debate has been a broad, constructive and instructive one, but I strongly disagree with a debate of that kind taking place on a Bill which forecloses so many of the issues.  That is a very serious problem with a measure of this kind.  We have a Criminal Justice Bill which, even though it has been substantially amended, cannot in fact be transformed into a different approach to the whole issue, and that is where the real problem arises.  What we did not have &mdash; and the lack of it is clearly shown up by what has happened &mdash; was a White Paper analysing the values in our society, setting out what the possible alternative approaches were, and raising these issues for debate.  Had that happened, we could have had the constructive debate which the Minister refers to, and which I agree with him has been valuable, but we would have had it in the best manner.  This would then have led to an appropriate consideration of how we would address ourselves as a society to the problems and the conflicting values, and how we create the best balance and the most effective means of coping with the problems.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I regret deeply that prior to the introduction of this measure there was not a White Paper.  A White Paper was not produced by preceding Governments either on the issue, although it was <Col N="1187" /> well known that there was an intention for a number of years &mdash; and substantial pressure from the Garda &mdash; to introduce a wide-ranging measure of this kind.  It is regrettable, because it is much more difficult when a Government Bill is published to change the orientation and to change the actual approach being adopted.  What we have been left to do is to secure as much improvement as possible in the provisions of the Bill without being able to recast it, remould it, or argue that essentially it is the wrong approach to the problem.  I am convinced that the Bill is to a worrying degree the wrong approach to the particular problems highlighted by the Minister in his opening speech &mdash; what he terms the problem of increased crime in our society.</P>
    <P>Therefore, before looking in more detail at the specifics of the Criminal Justice Bill, I want to look at this measure in a broader scope and from two different perspectives.  I want to look at the effect of this Bill first of all on police-community relations.  Senator Ryan referred, towards the end of his contribution, to the importance of ensuring that police-community relations are not only maintained at the level at which they are at the moment but he saw the need for improvement.  I would go further than that.  It is not just a question of better manners or a better attitude by individual gardaí.  There is a great need for radical structural changes in community-police relationships and how they operate on the ground.  That is the first area which I propose to examine, looking at the possible effect of a measure like this Bill on police-community relations.  Secondly, I propose to look broadly on the whole area of the protection of individual rights and liberties and the kind of balance which is altered by the cumulative proposals in this Bill.  In the context of looking at that, I shall also look at some very important safeguards which have been introduced by way of amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me turn first to the all too predictable effect which a measure of this kind may have on the important area of <Col N="1188" /> community-police relations.  Here I would like to refer to a commentary on the Bill by a note Irish criminologist, Barry McAuley, who lectures in criminology in University College, Dublin, because I agree very much with his critique of the Bill.  The article I am going to refer to was published shortly after the Bill was first issued.  It is from the November 1983 issue of the <i>Irish Law Times</i> but I think the critical analysis of the Bill would not be altered in any significant way by the amendments which have taken place on Committee and Report Stages in the other House.  The <i>Reflections</i>&mdash; that is the title of the article &mdash; on the Criminal Justice Bill would be unaltered even if the article had been written last week.</P>
    <P>The first point Mr. McAuley makes as a criminologist is that it is inadequate and indeed potentially distorting to examine and criticise this Bill purely from the standpoint of the effect it may have on individual civil liberties.  He &mdash; correctly I think &mdash; points out that simply to regard the Bill as being a measure which must be examined as to whether it strikes the right balance between the position of the individual and the individual's rights and the position of society is not only too narrow a focus but it can distract from the broader and the worrying impact which a measure of this kind may have in that it does not open up the fundamental question which is posed by the measure. His criticism is very appropriate to the discussion we are having on this Bill on Second Stage because we must look at the fundamental issues of our society and how a particular and wide-ranging measure of this kind will affect them.  From the standpoint of somebody who is actually criticising what he calls the libertarian or civil liberties analysis he says:</P>
    <P>First, this way of looking at the Bill deflects attention from the social conditions in which the measure will operate. Although the assumption that the police are above the social and economic divisions in society is part of the ideology of the law, it has little basis in reality.  In all modern legal systems, crime prevention and law enforcement <Col N="1189" /> are highly class-specific activities, in the sense that they are, by and large, directed against the more economically disadvantaged sections of the community. This is so in the double sense that the police tend to regard areas of low income and high unemployment as inherently criminogenic and consequently, to treat the entire populations of such areas with a mixture of suspicion and hostility.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, this means that people living in these areas have to put up with very high levels of police surveillance and interference in their daily lives: young people, particularly if they are male and unemployed, are frequently asked to account for their movements and parents for the whereabouts of their children; groups of male youths are as a rule dispersed and their drinking parties broken up; young people of both sexes are constantly stopped and searched for weapons and drugs, bundled into police cars and taken into custody, only later to be released; suspects are frequently intimidated; and police violence is common. Unsurprisingly, police community relations in most economically deprived areas are at a very low ebb, and in some areas the police are seen, and indeed see themselves, as an occupying force.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly bald and graphic description of a situation which I think is fairly well known to elected representatives in this country, that there are &mdash; particularly in economically deprived areas &mdash; what are practically no-go areas, where there is a whole sub-culture of alienation from, resentment of, fear of, but mainly lack of any identification with, the Garda.  The extent to which that is so at the moment must be of very real concern to us and any measure which might worsen or sharpen that alienation is one that we should really think of extremely seriously.</P>
    <P>The implications are of giving further powers to the police without changing the role and approach of police and community.  That is why I think it is of <Col N="1190" /> more importance and would be more effective if we had a radical approach to restructuring community-police relations and to giving the resources and the capacity on the ground for the establishment of much better relationships between communities and the police in those communities and a mutual support system which would take some time to build but in regard to which we could take substantial measures to get started and seek to improve on.  That is a very different approach from giving these very significant increased powers to the Garda in relation to individuals whom they can arrest and detain.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has already hinted that it is going to be said that the problem of crime either does not exist or is purely an aspect of social conditions, that there will be a superficial analysis which deals with social conditions and that crime will go away and all the rest of it.  I think he may perhaps have been indicating that persons such as myself would make those kind of general observations.  I want to look more deeply at how we look at, analyse and identify the problem of crime.  I am certainly well aware &mdash; as we all are &mdash; of an increased perception in the community of the incidence of crime, of an increased fear, particularly by old people or people who are living alone or who are vulnerable in the community. You only have to go around any area of Dublin and see the locks, bolts and wires over the windows and all the outward trappings of that fear and apprehension. Again, I think it is important that we look to what the specialists tell us of the situation because it is a matter which has not been the subject of a very detailed analysis, in fact it has not been the subject of any analysis from a Government source in this country.  We do not have the benefit of a White Paper or a more detailed background to this particular measure.</P>
    <P>On the question of the identification of and perceptions of the crime problem, in his article Barry McAuley draws attention to the fact that we do not have a crime problem in the sense normally posited as a justification for a measure of this kind.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> The central question for libertarians is how far the police should be allowed to go in tackling the &lsquo;crime problem&rsquo;, given the fundamental rights of the individual; while the logically prior question of whether there is a &lsquo;crime problem&rsquo; which needs to be tackled is ignored.  This is very convenient for the police, since it leaves unchallenged their repeated assertion that there is a &lsquo;crime problem&rsquo; of ever-increasing magnitude, and their concomitant demands for more extensive powers, especially in the fields of detention and arrest, to deal with it.</P>
    <P>However, as criminologists have been saying since the late nineteenth century, there is no &lsquo;crime problem&rsquo; in the sense in which the police claim there is.  To be sure, the crime rate in the developed world has climbed steadily since the Second World War and, in this country, has shown a three-to four-fold increase since the 1960s.  However, this still leaves existing crime levels much lower than they were throughout the nineteenth century. Moreover, in the case of Ireland, the steep increase since the 1960s is a direct consequence of the country's industrialisation and urbanisation. Indeed, the Irish rate now seems to have come into the line with those found throughout the developed world.  Criminologists refer to this phenomenon as the &lsquo;normal crime rate&rsquo;, by which they mean that the rate for a particular country more or less coincides with those found in other countries of comparable social and economic development.</P>
    <P>From this perspective, the repeated demands of the police for extra powers appear in an entirely different light. The question is no longer whether such powers can be justified as attempts to solve the fictitious problem of the high crime rate, but whether they might themselves be responsible for the very real problem of rapidly deteriorating police-community relations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is evidence that, at least in the more enlightened corners of the developed world, the so-called &lsquo;crime problem&rsquo; is now being redefined <Col N="1192" /> in precisely these terms.  Hence the new importance being given to the promotion of the idea of community policing in Britain and elsewhere.  The basis of this idea is that the confrontatist posture traditionally adopted by the police is both counter-productive and undemocratic: the police must be made more responsible to the needs and criticisms of the communities in which they actually operate, the existing system of centralised, virtually autonomous forces replaced by smaller, locally accountable units.</P>
    <P>These developments deserve a sympathetic hearing from Irish legislators. However, if they are to get a hearing at all, this debate will have to be freed from the straitjacket imposed on it by the libertarians.  Which raises the question of the Minister's undertaking to establish an independent tribunal for investigating complaints against the police before the Criminal Justice Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental issue to which we should address ourselves and consider on Second Stage of this measure.  The Minister in his speech gave the statistical profile of the sharply increasing crime statistics and they are referred to by Mr. McAuley in his article, but we must in a sense recognise that if we approach this problem from the point of view of concern about rising statistics in a superficial way we will be doing precisely what we criticise in a very major way as being the approach of successive British Governments to the problem of Northern Ireland &mdash; to see it only in terms of a security or policing problem.  The whole focus of our discussion of this issue should be on how we build up on the ground the supports and indeed the acceptance of policing and the sharing of responsibility between communities and the police for the effective exercise of the police powers in that area and this has directly to do with accountability for policing.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty which we have in this House in looking at the scope of this very wide-ranging measure is that it is too late to try to effect the kind of reorientation to argue the necessity for a very different kind of approach.  We are left <Col N="1193" /> with the necessity to drive home as forcefully as possible the concern which we must have that the powers which this Bill seeks to confer on the Garda will not do what the Garda hope they will do, which is to help them to cope with the crime problem as analysed by them, but may indeed have a counter effect, may worsen the situation on the ground by creating a greater alienation between communities and police, particularly in certain economic disadvantaged areas, and will lead to more effective and acceptable methods of policing.</P>
    <P>That is the first general effect which I wanted to draw attention to and which I wanted to put in priority among the issues I am now going to focus on which are those of the potential erosion of or diminution of civil liberties in the provisions of this Bill and whether this is acceptable. Clearly, the first provision of the Bill which will change the present scope of liberty of the individual is that in section 4 allowing for detention for questioning after arrest.  In his speech introducing the Bill the Minister came up with what I have to regard as a somewhat novel justification or validation for seeking to introduce this new power.  He said:</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, for many years most people in this country assumed that the Garda had a power to detain suspects for questioning and the Garda acted as if they had.</P>
    <P>That seems to have the distinguishing feature of being a very novel justification for something that was being done illegally and in an unauthorised way, when people were not aware of their rights and, therefore, did not assert their rights or did not question it when they were detained for questioning because they did not know it was illegal so to do; that this is somehow a justification for now making that power a legal one.  However, the Minister has a point.  This Bill, especially section 4, will to a considerable extent have the effect of validating some practices which are taking place on the ground.  That is the case but whether a Minister for Justice would use it as a basis for justification is another matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Since the Minister has sought in part at least to justify the increased powers of detention on the basis of the fact that this was happening although people did not know it and the Garda were doing it in any case until fairly recently, it is worth putting on the record of the House some recent judicial pronouncements on what the law in this area is and will be until such time as the provisions of this Criminal Justice Bill are passed.  The two brief quotations from members of the Supreme Court are from cases in 1980, so they are comparatively recent statements. In the first of these, Mr. Justice Walsh in the course of judgment said:</P>
    <P>A person may only be arrested for the purpose of being charged and brought before a court as soon as is reasonably possible.  A lawful arrest, whether under warrant or not, is simply a process to compel the attendance before a court of the person accused of an offence.  Neither the arrest nor the charge confer jurisdiction and cannot amount to a complaint if it is not made before a court, Peace Commissioner or the District Court Clerk.</P>
    <P>In the same year the Chief Justice, in a very ringing passage which has been referred to subsequently on a number of cases, said, and I quote as follows:</P>
    <P>It has been stated many times in our courts that there is no such procedure permitted by law as holding for questioning or detaining on any pretext except pursuant to a court order, or for the purpose of charging and bringing the person detained before a court. Any other purpose is unknown to the law and constitutes a flagrant and unwarranted interference with the liberty of citizens.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, there is the power to detain under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act for a maximum period of 48 hours.  It is important for us in looking at the existence of that power to examine how it has been used. It must be of concern to us that there appears to have been very substantial over-use of the powers under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. <Col N="1195" /> That may be part of the <i>rationale</i> behind bringing in the capacity to detain which is sought in section 4 of this Bill, that since the section 30 powers are being used much more widely than was initially intended, or than appears to be warranted from the number of people subsequently charged with an offence, there should be some alternative measure.  But there is equally the counter argument.  If, there is an existing power under a section of an Act &mdash; under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; which is so widely and fictitiously over-used for the purpose of securing the detention of persons, then we must be very careful to make this part of the norm of our general criminal law because although it is clear from section 4 that for this power of detention to be exercised there must be the reasonable suspicion that a person has committed or attempted to commit an offence for which he would be liable to imprisonment for five years, the difficulty is that we have a track record of over-use of, and therefore abuse of, the powers under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>I wish it were possible to get clearer and more comprehensive statistics on the use of and arrests under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act but, unfortunately, we do not have accessible to us that kind of detailed records and they are not easily available.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties have drawn attention to this problem and Senators have been circulated with material from them.  I have here a document dated 15 November 1983 in which they draw attention to this problem, and I will quote the relevant paragraph:</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act already allows the gardaí to arrest a person for up to 48 hours without charge.  In 1982, 2,308 people were arrested under section 30 powers. Only 256 of these people were charged with any offence within 48 hours of being arrested.  Not all of those charged were necessarily convicted.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that you would not have a 100 per cent conviction rate, but there is a very worrying gap between the <Col N="1196" /> volume of persons in that particular year &mdash; I took a year to illustrate &mdash; who were arrested and detained under the powers of section 30 and those who were subsequently charged.  We do have cause for concern and it is one which we must be aware of and then see whether on Committee Stage we can ensure, by amendment, that there is no possible basis on which the power can be abused.  We have to be concerned that powers, when given, may well be used for purposes which were not envisaged or, as appears to be the case, over-used.  There is inevitably an area of discretion to the Garda which is very difficult to challenge, and which, certainly up to now has not been sufficiently monitored.</P>
    <P>Having been critical in the sense of having cautioned about the desirability of giving a power to detain within the terms envisaged in section 4 of this Bill, I would also like to commend the Minister and to welcome wholeheartedly an important amendment which he has introduced, the amendment in section 7 under which he will be bringing in regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody.  It was drawn to the attention of the Minister that there were up until then, and there are now, very inadequate standards in relation to safeguards for persons who are in custody and that it is urgent &mdash; even if the other measures in this Bill were not being introduced &mdash; that there are regulations to create and ensure a uniformity of standards in relation to the treatment of persons in custody.  Section 7 provides that the Minister will make such regulations. They are not confined to persons who would be arrested and detained under section 4.  They are of general application. They will include provision for the identification of a member of the Garda in charge of a particular station, or some member to have the responsibility of over-seeing the application of the regulations in that station only they will presumably deal in detail with the periods under which a person can be questioned, because we are taking that very major step of authorising not only holding in custody but holding in custody for the purpose of questioning.  The regulations <Col N="1197" /> will presumably deal with the periods during which a person can be questioned, with rest periods, with the question of medical examination and medical supervision and a number of other matters.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if in his reply the Minister could give a detailed indication of the matters which will be covered in the proposed regulations.  Furthermore, it is welcome in the sense of allowing participation in the drawing up of these regulations by both Houses that the Minister proposes to introduce them in draft and that both Houses will have an opportunity to debate the scope of those regulations before they are finally adopted.  Nonetheless, it would be an important step to ensure that this is done at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has power in section 1 in relation to the commencement of this Bill to provide that it will come into operation in such parts as he shall order &mdash; and this has relevance to the sections which he has given a commitment will not come into effect prior to the adoption of the complaints machinery which I will be dealing with later.  I would like further clarification on the coming into operation of sections of this Bill.  It gives him the flexibility to introduce certain sections first.  I would have thought it would be very desirable that section 7 be introduced immediately and that the draft regulations be laid before both Houses at the earliest possible time so that these very significant safeguards can be made part of our code of treatment of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>The necessity for them is clear to any Member, certainly to anybody who has had experience of complaints about persons held in Garda custody.  But the necessity is particularly brought out by one of the most widely publicised and distressing cases that have come before the courts here and which was recently submitted to the Court of Human Rights, namely, the Nicky Kelly case.  If the background to that case is examined &mdash; I was required in a professional capacity to examine it when assisting in the bringing of his petition to the Commission on Human Rights &mdash; it is abundantly clear <Col N="1198" /> that there are inadequate standards in relation to the rights of a person in custody. There have been improvements since the arrest and detention of Nicky Kelly, but it is worth reminding the House what he experienced.</P>
    <P>The case was significantly lacking in regulations and the kind of safeguards that we hope will be introduced by section 7.  He was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; there is some question of whether the arrest itself was a lawful one, but no issue was ever taken on it &mdash; and he could be detained for a maximum of 48 hours for questioning.  It was conceded at the trial that he could have been interrogated for the entire 48 hours without constraint as to duration &mdash; until the Minister deals with it by regulations there is still no provision in our law as to the period of rest, as to what is a reasonable period of interrogation, in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>It was an interesting feature of the Kelly case that the question of his access to a lawyer was dealt with as being a right of access if he had asked, and only if he had asked.  If he did not ask &mdash; the court concluded that he had not asked for a lawyer; Kelly himself said he had asked &mdash; he did not have a right to be informed of his right to a lawyer.  Such a provision specifically is being introduced in this Bill &mdash; a person will have a right to be informed.  I am still not satisfied whether he will be made aware of the right at a sufficiently early stage.  These are Committee Stage issues which can be raised in relation to section 5.  The section specifically provides for access to a solicitor and for notification of the entitlement to consult a solicitor.</P>
    <P>That right did not exist in a positive sense in the Nicky Kelly case.  If he had requested it he could have created for himself, by requesting it, the right to a lawyer.  At the time of his arrest &mdash; and at the moment &mdash; there were no regulations requiring medical examination at any point during the period of custody, regulating rest periods, food, sleep and the accumulative effects of successive periods of interrogation.  It is worth recalling that the interrogation of Nicky Kelly lasted for 27½ hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> I specifically referred to that case because this is one of the few opportunities when it is possible to draw the attention of the House to very worrying aspects of that case.  This is a Criminal Justice Bill and we are concerned about standards of administration of justice.  I submit that anyone who examines the background to the process whereby Nicky Kelly was imprisoned following a pre-trial and post-trial process would not be happy that it met an adequate standard of fairness and what could be stood over as proper administration of justice.  I make no apologies for that statement and for putting it on the record of the House because I have made private representations to the Minister urging him to examine it in very through detail.  The whole pre-trial process and the way in which the authorities at the time dealt with Nicky Kelly to me are a blight on our system of legal justice, yet an examination of the record in this matter has not led to the release of Nicky Kelly.  I find it very difficult to accept that the merits of his case on the issue of how he was dealt with by our system of administration of justice would not be completely convincing to anyone who approached the subject with an open mind.  That is the issue. If he was not dealt with by proper, fair and appropriate standards in relation to his arrest and detention and the bringing of him to trial, then he should not remain in prison.</P>
    <P>I now publicly urge the Minister to do what privately I have been urging him to do, and what I know others have been urging him privately to do &mdash; to examine as a matter of priority the continued detention of Nicky Kelly in the light of the whole pre-trial and trial processes which he had.  The Commission on Human Rights, on the technicality that the petition had not been lodged within the statutory six months, declared his case to be inadmissible, but the homework on the application and its details are with the Minister: he knows these details and I urge him not only to consider and examine the case as a matter of priority but to conclude, as I think he must in fairness, that it is not a satisfactory case from the point of view of the standards <Col N="1200" /> of due process and administration of justice, and therefore that it is not one that warrants the continued detention of Nicky Kelly.</P>
    <P>When looking at any measure which seeks to increase powers, but as well to introduce important safeguards that were not there before, we must have regard to some of the existing blights on our system of justice in relation to the reality of individual cases.  I tend to feel that a great deal of the focus on Father O'Brien in the Philippines makes even more unacceptable the lack of establishment concern for the position of Nicky Kelly.</P>
    <P>There are many close analogies between the two cases.  If there was to be the same willingness to look at the surrounding circumstances of the Nicky Kelly case, I think there would be a similar happy conclusion for the individual concerned.  I do not think it is necessary to say that I am not at all making any comment or observation, because I am not in a position to, of whether Nicky Kelly committed the acts with which he was charged.  That is not the issue.  He was found guilty.  It is the process that he was subjected to which fell below fair standards in the administration of justice with which I am concerned and which I feel is appropriate to the general principles which we are discussing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will turn to another aspect of the Bill. It concerns the commitment given by the Minister to introduce machinery for dealing with complaints against the Garda prior to bringing into operation the key provisions of this Bill which increases police powers.  In an explanatory memorandum issued at the time the Bill was published, October 1983, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>To supplement the factual material in the explanatory memorandum, the Minister for Justice wishes to state, for the information of Deputies and Senators, that the Government has decided, on his recommendation, that those provisions of the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda Síochána and which will come into operation only when a Ministerial order to that effect is made, will not be brought <Col N="1201" /> into force until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.</P>
    <P>It has not yet been decided whether legislation will be necessary to establish such a procedure or whether it can be introduced, at least in the first instance, on an administrative basis but in either event it is the Government's intention that both Houses should be given an opportunity of discussing the complaints procedure before it is brought into effect.</P>
    <P>If legislation were necessary, it would in any event have to be a separate Bill as the present Bill is concerned with criminal law and procedure and could not appropriately deal with non-criminal procedures.</P>
    <P>There were some attempts, by way of amendments in the other House, to link the two in the Bill but they did not succeed. However, what is a fair point, and I hope the Minister will reply to it, is the time which has now elapsed since the Minister made that welcome statement of his intention not to introduce key sections of the Bill until there was legislation on complaints machinery.  The Minister has said that this legislation is in the stage of preparation but it is of such key relevance to our understanding of the scope and effect of the Bill that the Committee Stage should not be concluded without sight of the legislation establishing the complaints machinery.  It is of relevance and significance to Senators in assessing the import and effect of some of the sections to be aware of what the proposed approach to the complaints machinery may be.  From that brief statement, and from statements made by the Minister in the other House on the matter, it appears that the approach to be adopted may be a relatively narrow one.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the article by Mr. Barry McAuley, Lecture in Criminology at University College, Dublin.  I find his comment on the potential complaints machinery highly relevant.  In referring to a passage in his article I should like to <Col N="1202" /> ask the Minister to give an indication when the Bill will be published and urge that it be published before we deal with Committee Stage.  The criticism Mr. McAuley makes of the possible approach to the establishment of complaints machinery is part of his analysis of the too narrow civil liberties-based criticism which has been in large measure the criticism of the Bill and which appears to be reflected in the Minister's statement that it would involve a &ldquo;complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal&rdquo;.  Mr. McAuley in the context of ensuring not only the improvement but the strengthening of community-police relations refers to the importance of accountability to the local community.  In relation to the complaints machinery he stated:</P>
    <P>If the Minister's efforts in this regard are to achieve credibility, he would do well to tune in to the developing debate on community policing in Britain (in which, incidentally, Mr. Roy Hattersley has played a prominent and valuable part).  There he will learn that it is a huge waste of time staffing tribunals of the kind he has in mind with a mixture of civil servants, politicians, trade unionist and <i>soi-disant</i> experts from the media and the universities.  The bottom line in that debate, as Mr. Hattersley has had the insight and courage to realise, is that such tribunals must be staffed in large part by members of the communities directly affected by existing police methods.</P>
    <P>It is important when we are for the first time devising some method of assessing complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána that we learn from the experience and developments in other countries and that we do not delude ourselves that simply establishing a tribunal with the composition referred to by the Minister will be an adequate response and will help us to cope with the problem and congratulate ourselves that we have done so.  It is extremely important to have the benefit of the valuable and searching criticisms made in other jurisdictions, notably in Britain recently, about the inadequacy there of the established complaints <Col N="1203" /> machinery.  Again in the context of the role of communities in the policing of their areas it is very desirable that there should be built into the proposed machinery the involvement of and the accountability to local communities.  That would go a long way to bridging what is almost a culture gap.  It is certainly a gap where there is a very considerable degree of alienation between heavily populated areas, not just in Dublin but in other cities and large urban areas throughout the country, and gardaí in those areas and, indeed, the establishment generally. We must not make the mistake of believing that an independent tribunal is a pat answer to an effective method of having the complaints aired and considered and the credibility of that assessment of the complaints and the extent to which it is acceptable on the ground.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provisions which represent a new departure in the pre-existing situation where there was as part of what has been generally termed a right to silence or a right not to incriminate oneself, the ability of a person to remain silent and not to suffer from a direct inference drawn from that silence.  I should like to refer to the provisions in sections 18 and 19.  Before doing so I should like to say that in the original section 16 there was a measure which went much further than either section 18 or 19 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil and gave rise to very widespread and deep concern about the extent to which it was not only open to abuse but had within itself all the seeds of being a measure which would bear harshly on those who were less articulate, less aware of their rights, less able to communicate and could find themselves victimised and penalised for their failure to mention matters which subsequently their lawyers would seek to use as part of their defence in a criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>We must not allow it to be forgotten that this was a provision of the original Bill and it certainly was one of the key provisions which the Labour Parliamentary Party were deeply concerned about. In the list of reforms we sought to the Bill it was the one most highlighted as being an unacceptable provision.  It was a very <Col N="1204" /> welcome stance by the Minister when, having listened to the representations made and having made a counter case and listened further to representations, he accepted the position and amended the Bill as initiated and deleted section 16. I say that because it is not all that common to find Ministers of whatever administration being prepared to omit a key provision of a Bill.  There was fairly wide reaction from the organisations representing the Garda, saying that in large measure the teeth of the Bill had been drawn or that it was not as effective a measure and that the Minister had given in to the civil liberties groups.</P>
    <P>The removal of section 16 from the Bill as initiated and therefore from the debate has undoubtedly turned the scrutiny and the force of criticism to other provisions, including the existing sections 18 and 19, but there is no doubt in my mind that is was qualitatively more dangerous, that it was potentially unconstitutional.  I have heard the argument well made that if it had been passed it would have been a lucrative quarry for lawyers to hack in, that it would have led to a number of very interesting trials within trials and ultimately probably to a constitutional challenge. That is as it may be.  It was a very welcome step.  It showed a genuine concern on the part of the Minister, having heard the views expressed and the representations made, being prepared to come in and delete that section entirely on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am still concerned about the import of the existing sections 18 and 19, mainly for reasons which possibly will be easier to deal with on Committee Stage.  I refer to the extent to which a person is genuinely made aware of what his rights in the matter are and what the effect of refusal to disclose the information would be, the potential even for a person to give incorrect information.  Section 16 relates to withholding of information regarding stolen property and section 15 relates to withholding of information regarding firearms or ammunition.</P>
    <P>In these sections there is a potential for misleading information to be given to the Garda, where a person cannot refuse to give information because to do so <Col N="1205" /> would make the person liable for what is now a summary offence for which he could be fined £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.  The person in possession of a firearm or ammunition could seek to pin somebody else with responsibility for it, not the person from whom he had obtained it.  In the case of stolen property he might not name a possibly more powerful person from whom he had obtained the stolen property, but would name some less feared competitor and therefore give misleading information on the matter.  In addition, to a considerable extent these sections increase the extent of the confrontation within a Garda station between the individual and the members of the Garda.  There has been a worrying and discernible trend in prosecutions for criminals offences which most criminal lawyers would say is relatively recent but a very definite trend.  In the giving of evidence in a criminal trial where there is conflict between evidence offered by a member of the Garda Síochána and the evidence of the accused, juries used to take the word of the member of the Garda Síochána; now increasingly they will not convict in those circumstances which effectively, though it is not explicitly said, means that they do not necessarily believe what is said by the member of the Garda Síochána on oath in the witness box.  This gets back to the earlier, more general observations I was making about community-police relations, about the credibility of the Garda. It is a trend which should worry us &mdash; we can go back to it on Committee Stage &mdash; in relation to whether we are giving effective, rather detailed and complicated powers to assist the Garda in the detection and prosecution of criminals.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the other section which was introduced into the Bill as initially published as a safeguard but which has not been greatly strengthened during the debate in the Dáil and about which we still do not have enough information for my liking.  This was a matter raised by the Parliamentary Labour Party and which was the subject of submissions made to the Minister for the improvement <Col N="1206" /> and strengthening of the Bill.  It is the provision of section 27 relating to electronic recording of questioning.  It is a vital provision because, as has been said, the major change which would be effected by the Bill would be to give a power to detain for questioning and therefore both the monitoring of that and safeguards in relation to it are crucial to the acceptability of the Bill itself.  In dealing with this matter the Minister referred to the fact that there is provision for the introduction of it.  He then said it would be introduced in due course by means of regulations made by the Minister under section 27.  I do not know what he means by &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on this in his reply to the debate.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Some time before the Bill was published I set up a small committee to advise me on how best this should be done.  The committee include an expert in electronic engineering.  A great deal of work needs to be done before we can have recording of questioning &mdash; whether audio or video or both &mdash; and field trials need to be carried out to evaluate it.</P>
    <P>I would be far from saying that I am in any way an expert on the whole area of electronic monitoring or surveillance but I certainly am aware that there are a number of other jurisdictions which have carried out electronic monitoring of this kind, whether audio or visual.  It does not seem to be the kind of major technological problem that the Minister appears to envisage in talking about a committee being set up before the Bill was published, some time before October.  This committee has been sitting for the best part of a year now.  I would have thought that, if necessary, rather inadequate but nonetheless practical methods of electronic monitoring should be established immediately in the more frequently used Garda stations in particular areas.  Again it is possible to identify, for the purposes of the persons who are likely to be arrested and detained under section 4 of the Bill, where they would be brought in the Dublin area, where they would be <Col N="1207" /> brought in Cork, Limerick and so on and to require that a person in the short-term, until there is a comprehensive system of electronic surveillance of any person who is held in custody, until that can be effected &mdash; and I accept that that may take a little longer &mdash; a person arrested and detained under section 4 would not be subjected to any form of questioning until brought to a Garda station which had in operation the kinds of safeguards and controls envisaged in section 27.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This would help to foster the credibility of the Garda themselves and of the powers which they were being given under section 4.  It would be much more acceptable that a person would be detained for questioning, which is what would be authorised under section 4, if there was a record which was independent and comprehensive, audio or visual &mdash; obviously it would be preferable if it were both &mdash; but certainly an audio record of any interrogation would help the credibility and the authority of the Garda.  One of the real concerns about this measure will be the criticisms that will be made.  Whether or not there was abuse there will be accusations of abuse from certain quarters.  It is quite likely that there will be an increasing number of allegations of Garda brutality. It will be more difficult for the Garda to protect themselves from the kinds of allegations and accusations which may be made, some of them with political motives, some of them deliberately to undermine the character and credibility of the Garda.  Obviously some of them also will have very real foundation to the complaint.  But no matter what kind of complaints machinery we devise it is not going to be possible for the complaints machinery adequately to look into the process which is necessarily of a private and even secret nature which takes place in the Garda barracks.  Any complaints that are made cannot be properly investigated afterwards unless there is a complete electronic record of any questioning which took place.  I have heard criticisms <Col N="1208" /> of the establishment of electronic monitoring of this kind, that it would lead to questioning of suspects in the back of Garda patrol cars and so on.  Again this is a matter which could be dealt with by ensuring that any questioning which took place which was to be of any use to the Garda afterwards would have to be for the purpose of persons arrested under section 4 within a Garda station which has electronic monitoring established and that this was used at all times when the questioning was in progress.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (a), line 6, to delete &ldquo;book,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Standing rather suddenly in the shoes of Senator Brendan Ryan, but being aware of the concern that he felt in tabling these amendments, the primary concern is about the broad scope of the provision of section 5(1) (a) as it stands.  It prohibits a person from printing or causing the publication of, or selling or distributing any book, periodical or other publication and so on.  The second amendment &mdash; and it is a related one &mdash; uses very wide language which &ldquo;advocates or encourages, or might reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage, whether expressly or by implication&rdquo; and so on. At this stage it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate who is to suppose, if the person has not intended, for example, to advocate or encourage &mdash; how would that reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage and how can it be done by implication?  Could the Minister give us practical examples of how this section would operate, because at present it seems to be very broadly cast?</P>

      <P>If I were not so youthful I would have fallen on my way up here also.  I am sure that Senator Robinson has said virtually what I would have liked <Col N="1210" /> to say.  We all acknowledge the objective of this section of the Bill and the Minister had some documents in his possession yesterday which illustrated clearly the need for a precaution such as this to enable us to avoid further manifestations of the drug culture.  As I said on Second Stage, it must be within the wit of parliamentary draftsmen to deal with such a problem without putting in one of these catch-all phrases which effectively incorporate everything.  Off the top of my head I would list <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> by Carlos Castenada as a classic example of a book which quite clearly would be illegal under this section because, whether implicitly or expressly I am not too sure, it advocates the use of mescalin which I am sure is a controlled substance. A series of books all of which are regarded as &mdash; to use a phrase which is used so often in this House &mdash; minor classics at this stage are sold in millions. I do not particularly like those books. The conclusion reached towards the end of the last of a number of them is anything but hope-inspiring.  Nevertheless, they are widely on sale and I suspect that we and, perhaps, South Africa would be the only countries outside the Eastern bloc which do not allow them to be sold. Another book, <i>Confessions of an English Opium Eater</i> is regarded as a classic in its own right.  A large volume of literature associated particularly with rock music contains a continuous debate particularly about cannabis and the merits or demerits of using it.  To suggest that cannabis is such a serious threat that all references to possible pleasurable consequences of using it must be deleted or that any publication which contains a reference to it must be prohibited is not the same as saying that one disapproves of its use.  A publication which contains either articles or letters which advocate the use of cannabis is quite clearly covered by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly worried at the suggestion that things could advocate expressly or by implication. &ldquo;Expressly or by implication&rdquo; is such a wide-ranging term that, considering the mentality of some of our judges, the prospect of what their interpretation of it would be is quite <Col N="1211" /> horrendous.  Therefore, I have drafted an amendment.  I do not for one second suggest that it is the entire solution because we must recognise that this Bill came from the Dáil.  I have not yet had an opportunity to read the report of Committee Stage in the Dáil because it has not yet been published; therefore we do not know the full background to this matter. We had less than 12 hours in which to draft this amendment, so I had to rush it through.  There cannot be many books not in themselves recognised works of literature which would be on such wide sale as to be regarded as any sort of encouragement to drug culture.  Therefore I suggest the removal of the reference to books.</P>
    <P>Since what the Minister seems to have in mind are those magazines that are virtually entirely devoted to the advocacy of a drug culture, to the use of drugs and to explaining to people where and in what circumstances they can gain access to drugs, I suggested, in amendment No. 2, the words: &ldquo;expressly advocates either in its entirety or greater part.&rdquo;  That would cover the circumstances listed by the Minister.  That range of publications, including, I regret to say, the daily newspapers have articles which may well argue in favour of the legalisation of cannabis. I cannot see how you can argue in favour of the legalisation of cannabis, for instance, without effectively, expressly or by implication advocating its use.  You can hardly argue for the legalisation of something if you think that nobody should use it.  Therefore, my amendments are an attempt to meet what I recognise to be a necessary requirement in regard to documents which encourage the drug culture, and at the same time to ensure that there is not interference with normal freedom of communication or the introduction of yet another form of censorship which in this case is quite unnecessary. I will be interested in the Minister's response to these two amendments. I apologise to him again for my absence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to hold the fort for Senator Brendan Ryan, but I cannot support the amendment.  I cannot see in it the meaning that Senator Ryan <Col N="1212" /> is taking out of it.  The section provides that:</P>
      <P>A person shall not print, publish, cause or procure to be printed or published, sell or expose or offer or keep for sale, distribute or offer or keep for distribution, any book, periodical or other publication which either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) advocates or encourages, or might reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage, whether expressly or by implication, the use of any controlled drug prescribed for the purpose of this section,</P>
      <P>That is clear and specific enough.  It does not extend to what has been suggested here.  It does not extend to records, video or films or anything like that.  I would not like to see the kind of publication that the Minister had here last night distributed in this country.  If we are serious about this problem, if we are really concerned about the unfortunate addicts and that they should not be involved in the learning process through books, that they should not be allowed to get hold of any publications in which this is encouraged, then every possible loophole must be examined and we must hope that the scene will improve as a result of that. Every avenue must be watched.  This problem is growing.  This section of the Bill is quite legitimate.</P>
      <P>I support the point made, that in areas where the degree of literacy is not high the videos referred to by the Minister, tapes and other educational aids should be made available to communities where the incidence of drug taking is high.  Communities might learn more from those sources than from books and so on.  We should pursue that action.  As far as publications are concerned, I support the section.  Perhaps Senator Ryan is taking a wrong view.  I do not see the problems that he thinks are there and I cannot support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Fallon has said.  I think Senator Ryan is worried because the word &ldquo;book&rdquo; is contained in this section and he feels that it <Col N="1213" /> is too broad a term, while he supports what the Minister is trying to do in regard to periodicals and other publications.  At the end of his contribution he talked about freedom of communication.  That worried me a little.  It is this area of communication which worries us.  In some states in the US and other permissive societies it seems there is freedom of communication about cannabis.  We should not have freedom of the kind which would be highlighted in the glossy magazines as giving some sort of cult effect to a drug that we consider should not be legalised.  If we accept the freedom of communication we have to quantify in our minds what that communication should be.  Certainly in this area of the glamorisation of drugs of any description I would have the gravest reservations. If as in the terms of the subsection, a book advocates or encourages or might reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage, I would not be in favour of allowing it to be on sale freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cannabis was mentioned specifically and if we have regard to Dr. Deasy's interpretation of this drug it is appropriate that we describe the short-term effects of cannabis which are quite evident apparently.  They include talkativeness, hilarity, euphoria, relaxation and a feeling of being slowed down, all commendable in their own way.  The same effects can be achieved from alcohol. Interference with the memory has also a short-term effect and the learning ability of students is impaired.  Dr. Deasy says there is interference with the clarity of speech and the use of irrelevant words and ideas &mdash; I suppose this could be applied to some of the contributions in this House, maybe mine for all I know &mdash; and impairment of co-ordination. He says that cannabis can be a contributory factor in car accidents particularly when combined with alcohol.  Dr. Deasy says that the adverse reactions to possible high does of THC are fearfulness, confusion, anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations and the long-term effects of prolonged use of the drug can be chronic bronchitis, coughing, hoarseness, laryngitis and pre-cancerous <Col N="1214" /> changes in the lungs.  Such changes could also be associated with tobacco.</P>
    <P>Dr. Deasy goes on to point out that persons at risk include those suffering from cardio-vascular disease and preexisting mental disorders and that there are the possible effects on reproductive and immune systems which one takes into account in the possible treatment of anybody with a particular ailment whether it be a virus or otherwise, that if they are taking cannabis their normal natural inbuilt immunity would be impaired, and that heavy use of the drug almost always leads to abuse of heroin afterwards.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about cannabis we should consider the short-term and long-term effects of the drug.  We should ban any publication, whether it be a book or otherwise, that would somehow lend glamour to the use of that drug, though in some states it is not considered to be an addictive drug.  In a society in which we are faced with so many other problems, we should do everything possible to tidy up the area of communication while still accepting the principle of the freedom of communication.  We must be careful as to what communication we want the freedom of.  I consider the section to be appropriate as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any confusion, we are not talking about cannabis. The list of effects read by Senator Ferris seemed to me to be a fairly good summing up of the effects of alcohol and tobacco. There is also a dreadful capacity in the scientific establishment to use different base lines to compare different factors. There is a justifiable concern among many researchers about the short-term and long-term effects of cannabis, but there is also an extraordinary ability to explain away, for instance, the possible damages from low-level radiation from nuclear waste because in one case the establishment take the view that it is necessary and in another case it takes the view that it is not necessary.  I would just like to get rid of the idea of objective science.  Science is as much a servant of the way a society thinks as is any other area of activity in society.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1215" /> I do not favour the legalisation of cannabis and would not encourage young people to use cannabis largely because of the social sides connected with it, the kind of culture that they would be drawn into, the company they would be brought into and the sort of contacts they would make, apart from the arguable physiological and psychological damage it can do. There are enough things we take risks with without encouraging people to take more risks.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about cannabis but about how, as the Minister for Justice has spoken about at great length in our previous debate, you balance the need to protect society with the right of people in society to free access to information.</P>
      <P>What Senator Fallon and Senator Ferris are saying, effectively is that those books I talked about should be banned. Fair enough: if that should be the case, then let it be.  <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> is on sale virtually in every bookshop in this country.  The first of a series of books tells of the experiences of a man on mescalin and of what happened to him.  It tells about him in a very positive way. There is no question that by implication it is encouraging people to use what is a prescribed substance or a controlled drug.</P>
      <P>If that is what is involved let us be clear about it.  The bookshop should be cleared of that and of other things.  Bob Dylan, for instance, has a song of which the chorus line is that everybody should get &ldquo;stoned.&rdquo;  There were probably eminent Members of this House and of the other House singing along with Bob Dylan last Sunday when he sang that song.  The words of that song are effectively proscribed by the section.  Many of those record albums contain the words of those songs on the sleeve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not refer to records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is the Minister's intention or that of Senator Fallon or of Senator Ferris that that record sleeve should be banned, but I do believe we have a lunatic fringe in this country who have on numerous occasions attempted to put the clock backwards in <Col N="1216" /> many other areas.  A device like this could be very useful to them in attempting to suppress what they would see as a rather subsersive culture of rock music.  It is quite possible to deal with the problem that is being addressed in this section in a very coherent fashion without having this all-embracing section which covers virtually every possible reference in a favourable light to any controlled substance. I do not think that is what we need or that it is what we should have. This is a reasonable response to both arguments.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon seemed to ignore the terms, &ldquo;expressly or by implication&rdquo;. There is no running away from that.  The words &ldquo;by implication&rdquo; extend the possibility of what is covered by this section well beyond the sort of magnazines the Minister is talking about.  Those magazines expressly and clearly advocate and encourage the use of controlled substances. Passing references in newspaper articles, occasional references in songs or on record sleeves and so on are covered because by implication they effectively suggest that the taking of drugs is good. Indeed, the ICCL suggest that the videos being made by the Department of Education or any educational material to do with drug abuse which will in passing obviously refer to the pleasurable experiences resulting from the use of cannabis could be interpreted, by implication, as encouraging the use of controlled substances.  That is an extreme interpretation but there is a problem there for many of us.  I do not think it is good enough to say we want to do something about the problem and therefore, we leave the section the way it is.  We all want to do something about the problem but we must do so in a way which draws a balance between the rights of the individual and the need to protect society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the misgivings expressed by Senator Ryan and I hope very much that the Minister in his reply will be able to allay the doubts and concerns we have.  The magazine <i>High Times</i> which was referred to last night is one that I have not had access to but from what we have heard, I should <Col N="1217" /> be perfectly happy to see that publication removed from circulation.  I understood from what the Minister said that it is a mail order magazine rather than one which is freely available on book shelves. It is perfectly proper and correct that a magazine of that nature, which overtly and absolutely appears to be in the business of recommending the taking of drugs, should be removed from circulation.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in this area in that books which have a literary merit or which otherwise have a great deal to recommend them would in some draconian fashion be removed from circulation.  All of us who care about censorship in society would want to receive very firm assurances from the Minister that in doing the proper and correct thing he was not over-reacting to what we all recognise as a very serious problem.  Yesterday evening we finished very late and it is nice to see the Minister looking so fresh here again this morning.  I think we finished at 11.55 p.m. but we talked at some length about the fact that many of the young people who are involved in drug taking and drug usage are illiterate and that the written word, which is covered by this section, has no relevance, meaning or significance for them.  They draw their mental sustenance from pop music and the videos which accompany pop music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the Second Stage recognised that, functionally, these young people are largely illiterate which is one of the tragedies of our society. They are more in tune with sound and vision as a means of gaining information. It is not that I would like to see the provisions in this section extended to cover pop songs and videos but, at the same time, if as is stated in this section it is being introduced because we are aware of the power of the media to influence our thinking and everyday actions, I wonder what the Minister feels he will be able to do to deal with songs.  For example, I am thinking of one song called &ldquo;Cocaine&rdquo; by Eric Clapton which was very popular some years ago.  The chorus of this song is &ldquo;If you want to get high; if you want to get by &mdash; cocaine&rdquo;.  This is just one of the <Col N="1218" /> many songs which has a very strong, pulsating message and rhythm going through it advocating the use of drugs.  The logic of this section should extend to pop songs like this.  It obviously will not but, nevertheless, we must be concerned about this kind of influence which is directed at young people whom we all care about and for whom this legislation is largely designed.  Yet it seems that we are powerless to deal with the implications of the kinds of culture with which they are in tune.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we discuss and evaluate this.  It is delicate and sensitive. I do not have the answer to it.  I do not know what we can do.  Censorship as such bothers me because it strikes at fundamental freedom in society.  At the same time we must protect, as far as possible, our young people from commercial exploitation and exploitation by pushers and drug users.  It is a difficult one and I would like the Minister to make reference to it in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Brendan Ryan for drawing my attention and the attention of the House generally to the all-embracing nature of this provision.  I do not think it struck most of us on first reading the Bill.  The points raised by him caused me concern.  The section would effectively preclude any article from which it could be deduced that the use of drugs could in any way be tolerated.  Even a reputable scientific analysis of a drug presumably would be precluded under this provision, not to mention the host of other ancillary items which are trivial but entertaining, which we read in our newspapers and to which young people have access, and also the various records and rock or pop periodicals which other Senators have made reference to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the House wholeheartedly agrees with the Minister's intention in this section.  We seem to be alienating young people in many instances.  They feel alienated enough.  The recent European election voting figures, and seeing the actual age levels who participated in that exercise conveyed the fact to me that more and more young people are alienated <Col N="1219" /> by, for want of a better word, the establishment.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about how we deal with matters like this.  We must not spread a draconian net that would preclude anything that is close to young people.  I do not for one minute want to advocate that articles like the one the Minister has with him now could in any way be justified.  They certainly could not and I know that it is the intent of this section to preclude overt advertisements and encouragement for controlled substances. I do not think there is any disagreement in this House about that.  While I would look with concern at the amendment put down, I hope the Minister will be in a position, in responding to these comments and fears, to put the minds of Senators at rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps as much as other Senators I have probably seen the end results of the effects of drugs.  I have had a great interest in the organisation of Alcoholics Anonymous for many years. I share the misgivings of Senator Ryan but, at the same time, we need to be very careful that we do not do anything which would, in any way, diminish the possibility of curbing the epidemic of drug-taking which is now upon us in Ireland.  It appears to be particularly prevalent in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has spent time with people who have been on drugs or who are trying to wean themselves off drugs or have made many abortive attempts to get off drugs, will be aware of the despair and misery caused not only to the persons in their more lucid moments but also to their families and to the community to which they belong apart from the almost incredible difficulty of getting a person safely across the Rubicon of being a drug-taker and living in that sub-culture. If I was asked at this moment which do I see to be the greater evil, I would have to argue that rather than risk a further explosion of drug-taking in Ireland or an extension of what has already taken place, we would have to think long and hard about diluting the words of the Bill. That comes very hard from someone who has spent much of his life trying to champion <Col N="1220" /> the cause of free expression in a very unfree society.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity in a way that we cannot make a distinction between the use of cannabis and the use of hard drugs.  As Senator Ferris highlighted for us, cannabis is a substitute for cigarette smoking on the one hand and alcohol-taking on the other.  As with both, it can be abused and as with both it can be detrimental to health.  Of course, the argument has always been that if people are smoking cannabis frequently and regularly, particularly the young, they are quite likely to be smoking in an atmosphere which encourages them to participate in taking stronger and much more harmful drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in Ireland to become a little hysterical when talking about these taboo subjects.  I hope I live to see the day when, in a slightly calmer assessment of the whole situation, it might be possible to think of cannabis as being looked upon as something quite separate from the hard drug scene and to have a more liberal and less fearful attitude twoards it.  However, at present such is the drug scene and such are the terrible penalties to their health and their future for people who become involved in it that in taking it very seriously we may, in this instance, seriously have to consider a compromise on what certainly would be my ideal &mdash; an ideal which I would like to have felt free to share with Senator Ryan in relation to the whole area of civil liberties, right of private judgment and freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>A drug addict stayed in our home over months, going into years.  His argument was &ldquo;Why should I not be free to destroy my own life if I wish?&rdquo;.  I suppose, extending the arguments of freedom to the final point, he was making a case which might be hard in some way to refute.  Nevertheless, if we are concerned about the social implications of living in some sort of collectivity, a community, a wider or broader society and if we are very troubled by the implications of drug taking and where it is leading society, let us remember that it is a symptom of many other things as well as being a cause in itself.  I speak with some difficulty in opposing my campaigning friend, Senator <Col N="1221" /> Ryan, but I would not be able to support his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two amendments. The first is to delete in line 6 the word &ldquo;book&rdquo;.  I am of the view, which the parliamentary draftsman would share, that if we delete that word &ldquo;book&rdquo; it will weaken the section very considerably. The prohibition would be entirely confined to the words &ldquo;periodical or other publication&rdquo; and then we run into a definition problem.  The two words &ldquo;other publication&rdquo; would carry the risk of being interpreted by the courts as printed matter akin to a periodical and thus could be conceived as not being reading matter in what might be ordinarily styled book form.  That is the strong advice I have received on the section, at which I looked long and hard before bringing it to Government.  The general intention of the whole section, if the amendment, the deletion of the word &ldquo;book&rdquo;, were accepted would be thwarted in a very significant way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment tabled by Senator Brendan Ryan is to delete, in lines 8 and 9 &ldquo;advocates or encourages, or might reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage, whether expressly or by implication&rdquo;.  The Attorney General is not known to be a man of repressive <Col N="1222" /> views on such matters, having suffered enough for his views on many issues over the years but on this issue I am assured that so difficult is it to secure convictions under this formulation generally that it has to be reasonably broad.  If one were simply to adopt the substitute phrase as suggested here by Senator Ryan, namely, &ldquo;expressly advocates, either in its entirety or greater part,&rdquo; then the provision would be so loose that the courts would be in a rather impossible interpretative position.  The whole argument would then centre around whether a particular advocacy was entirely or in part within a particular periodical.  That again would pose considerable difficulties.</P>
    <P>I share strongly the view that our literature, our publications and our general culture should not reflect particular repressive majority or indeed minority attitudes in terms of the printed word. That is why I expressly put in the section &mdash; and draw the attention of the House to it &mdash; the use of any controlled drug prescribed for the purposes of this section.  I am referring, in particular, to hard drugs, heroin, for example and cocaine which is becoming fashionable now in the Dublin area, particularly among our upper income groups.  It is now the more fashionable drug.  Of course, it is equally appallingly dangerous. In effect, the Minister of the day, under regulations made under the 1977 Act will prescribe that with regard to publications relating, say, to heroin or to cocaine, this section will be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, a wide international mail order pushing of drugs and it is substantial now in Ireland.  The consumption of controlled drugs in this country is a multi-million pound business. Some people are very wealthy as a result. Tobacco and drink are larger businesses &mdash; we have to keep a sense of proportion. I am told that in this country we consume in a day £2 million worth of alcohol and another £1 million in cigarettes.  For every heroin addict who dies here, about four thousand a year die from smoking-related illnesses.  Publications on hard drugs going around in this country are posted to young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> I share the view of Senator Brendan Ryan that many young people are alienated from the establishment particularly when they have no employment and a consequent loss of personal dignity in society.  There is a widespread mail order incursion into here advocating particular types of equipment.  They tell how to get your heroin gramme electronically weighed by a piece of equipment in your pocket which can be bought for a few pounds, so that you will not be cheated when you pay £10 for your three-hourly shot.  That type of equipment is advertised in publications.  This section would only apply to particular advocacy of the use of equipment such as cocaine kits, information on how to grow mushrooms on one's kitchen window, which can be done, and information regarding where to buy portable testing kits.  There are also the more esoteric publications, many of them of low literary value, who advocate a drug society, who print on their flyleaf the message that dope is the only hope for society and who firmly advocate it in their publications That kind of publication would be read by young impressionable persons and it would gain considerable notoriety.</P>
    <P>The intention in such instances, as far as possible and without being oppressive, is to ensure that such books, periodicals, publications and advertisements which currently are not subject to control are diluted in terms of their impact.  There are safeguards in the section.  It will be a defence for a defendant to prove that he could not by the exercise of reasonable care have known or ascertained the contents of the book, periodical or other publication.  This is set out in subsection (5) (c).</P>
    <P>I hope that the controlled drugs prescribed for the purposes of this section will be on a narrow front.  I have some difficulty with regard to this matter. Although it may sound appallingly oppressive, if I had my way I would prohibit advertising in relation to alcohol and tobacco.  We cannot forget that 25 per cent of patients in hospital are there as a result of these two drugs and the cost <Col N="1224" /> is phenomenal.  In addition, the human cost is quite incredible.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Senator Bulbulia that there is a danger of overreacting. I have attempted to confine this to controlled drugs specifically prescribed for the purposes of the section.  These drugs are specified in the Schedule to the 1977 Act.  As Senator Brendan Ryan rightly pointed out, I hope the lunatic fringe will not perceive it to be anything else because at this stage some people would prohibit the consumption of water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whereas the drugs are scheduled under the 1977 Act, the particular prescribing for the purposes of this section will have to be done by the Minister of the day.  To that extent they are deemed to be controlled drugs under the 1977 Act but they will have to be specifically prescribed.  I admit there will be some difficulty in relation to cannabis. However, I am particularly concerned about the proliferation of hard drugs such as heroin and cannabis and a number of other drugs such as dicanol which was a particular problem in Cork.  However, these drugs are not generally written about in an encouraging way.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) (a) (i) uses the words, &ldquo;...otherwise than in the course of professional treatment by a practitioner,&rdquo;. We have to be careful about that because the editor and his colleagues on the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> might find themselves before the courts because that journal and other medical journals advocate large consumption of drugs for professional treatment.  They have to be excluded from the import of the section.</P>

      <P>The Act of 1876 and the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, should have been aligned in some way.  The customs and excise people should have the same powers as the Garda in relation to this problem.  Last night I suggested that in the area of customs and excise there should be a drugs squad similar to that in the Garda Síochána.  They are first in the firing line, they operate at ports and airports. There should be a separate unit within the customs and excise to deal specifically with drugs.  I would welcome anything that would help to solve this problem and I am convinced that if this step were taken it would be of considerable help.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This section highlights the parity of control by customs officers and the Garda.  We have to be very careful about this.  The customs officers have substantial powers of arrest and of seizure.  People do not often appreciate the extent of their powers which go back to 1876.  Up to now there was not much point in their exercising their powers because the fines were so small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it purely on a direction from the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the request of the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the customs officers effect a conviction on their own work they will have parity in respect of fines with cases of ordinary convictions under the Misuse of <Col N="1226" /> Drugs Act which are initiated in the first instance by the Garda.  To that extent the role of the customs officers is on parity with that of the Garda Síochána for the first time.  I am not so sure that we should have within the customs and excise section a separate drugs section.  We are a small country and we tend to fragment and specialise in many areas to such a degree that we have so many small groups catering for particular aspects that our efforts become diluted and diffused.  For example, every member of the Garda in Templemore gets basic training in relation to drug abuse and practises it as part of his ordinary Garda work.</P>
      <P>Customs officers are required to cope with illegal importation of all kinds of drugs and commodities of a prohibited or limited nature.  I know there has been a demand for a special drugs squad within the customs but this would mean providing a chief customs officer and a deputy chief customs officer of the drugs squad and a new super-structure would be built up within that structure.  I do not think this is necessary.</P>
      <P>At each point of entry into the State or where internal work is done, the customs officers should have available to them every modern convenience and incentive to cope with their difficult work in terms of coping with the drug situation.  That means, for example, better liaison between them and the Garda Síochána, better electronic liaison, personal relationships and integration of service between the two.  That would create far greater effectiveness than setting up a parallel customs drugs squad with the Garda Drugs Squad and we would finish up with a political drugs squad of Deputies who are specialists in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A diffusion of effort would not be beneficial and to that extent I am not in favour of it.  The Revenue Commissioners could then argue that one could equally set up a whole range of segments within the Customs and Excise sections, such as specialists dealing exclusively with rabies.  While I share the view that there should be specialists in the customs area dealing with the importation of heroin, cocaine and other hard drugs, designations of special squads is not necessary <Col N="1227" /> in this area.  People complain that there are 45 members in the Garda Drugs Squad but there are 10,000 gardaí who deal with the question of drugs as part of their ordinary work.  The Garda Drugs Squad specialise in it in a particular way and that is adequate for the purposes of our control measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 3, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not and cannot agree with handing over to the courts the discretion to decide whether persons convicted under a range of drug offences should be remanded for medical and other assessments pending sentence.  The argument for leaving the element of discretion is apparently to avoid certain well-known or substantial drug pushers being able to use this device to escape the full rigours of the law.</P>
      <P>There must be other procedures for dealing with that, in particular that bail can be refused to people only if the Garda can satisfy the courts that they are liable to abscond.  If the Garda have a reasonable case that the person is liable to abscond then bail can be refused.  This is one of the two recognised grounds for refusing bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are suggesting that the assessment in the first case of whether a person is dependent on drugs should be made not by a specialist who knows about these things but by a member of the Judiciary who would decide whether a person should be subjected to such an assessment before passing sentence.  I will quote the words that I would like to have deleted: &ldquo;if, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the court considers it appropriate so to do&rdquo;.  In other words the court &mdash; and in this case it would obviously be the judge or the district <Col N="1228" /> justice &mdash; will decide whether it is appropriate in a particular case that a person should be referred for the various assessments and there is a very wide-ranging and worth while form of assessment contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977. I have to confess that I was unaware of how wide-ranging the assessment was until this Bill drew it to my attention.</P>
    <P>We are being asked now to take away that obligation and substitute a discretionary element.  However when one sees the astonishing statements produced last week by a judge on Far Eastern rituals as a justification &mdash; at least implicitly &mdash; for his decision in the case of a certain young lady, I would hate to think what an individual like that would do in a drugs case if he was to follow his Far Eastern precedents. Our Judiciary are not qualified or competent to make those sort of assessments.</P>
    <P>Very often they reveal a most extraordinary level of prejudice in their comments which often follow on their judgments. If they are to be left with discretion in an area like this to decide whether a person should or should not be sent for assessment, then I do not believe that they can be trusted to do it humanely and compassionately.</P>
    <P>There is a large graduation within the range of those people who could be technically called drug pushers, from the large organised criminal conspiracies run by one or two people where large fortunes are being made by people who are not directly involved in the use of drugs or indeed even indirectly involved, down to the pathetic individual on every street corner in areas of Dublin desperately trying to raise the money to finance his or her own addiction and who sell drugs to achieve that.  It is not possible to encompass them all within one sweeping definition.  Therefore, it is a question of how we make the distinction between them.  The amendment proposed by the Minister to the Principal Act would effectively leave the distinction to be made by what I would regard as the group least competent to make it, the Judiciary, and would prevent us from ensuring that it was made by the medical and other experts who are the most competent to <Col N="1229" /> make it.  It is a classic case of using a sledge hammer to crack a nut by extending this element of discretion into all cases in order to meet a couple of exceptional circumstances.  My two amendments propose that in the new area to do with the abuse of the Customs Act, the present position should be retained, that in all cases where a person is convicted the court shall remand the person for such period as it considers necessary. Amendment No. 4 provides that the proposed modification of the Principal Act should not be carried into law and that the present compulsory remand and assessment should be retained.  I do not believe that we can leave a matter of such fundamental human importance in the hands of a Judiciary who lack both the medical expertise, training in the social sciences and very often, regrettably, the human experience to make a proper assessment that needs to be made in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the comments made by Senator Ryan.  If people are to be assessed under the proposed legislation, they should be assessed adequately, competently and professionally.  One would not expect the medical profession to make legal assessments, and by the same token, one would not expect the legal profession to make medical assessments. In that context, I wholeheartedly support what Senator Ryan has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about the present format of the Bill in the context of Senator Ryan's amendments. There was merit in the original form of the Principal Act whereby the court had an obligation to see that these persons were the subject of a report of a medical or social nature before the court decided on a sentence or a form of treatment. I see that difficulties could arise from this, but they are not insurmountable. It is desirable that there should be some continuity in the way courts deal with convicted persons.  The provision in the Principal Act led to a standardisation of the way the courts deal with such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> I can see clearly that it might not be desirable to have a mandatory report produced in the case of persons convicted of drug pushing when it was clear that that is what they were and where there was no confusion whether they were pushers and addicts but were simply pushers.  It is desirable that persons who are convicted and are abusers should be the subject of a mandatory report prior to their future being decided by the courts.  This view is shared by many people dealing with drug abusers who are more knowledgeable in this area than I am.  I raise this point because this matter is of some significance and, hopefully the Minister will respond to it.</P>
    <P>I understand some problems arose last year when somebody before the courts absconded when the report was being prepared.  This may have led to the particular formulation we have before us today.  That kind of problem can be dealt with by remand in custody pending a report if the person is an abuser as well as a pusher.  It would be a pity if we dropped the idea of a mandatory report in the case of persons convicted of drug abuse who are also addicts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain the background to this section.  I recall this matter very well because, as Senator O'Mahony pointed out, it was an integral part of the 1977 Act.  As chairman of the committee at that time I remember the argument between the then Minister for Health, Mr. Brendan Corish, and the then Opposition spokesman on Health, Deputy Haughey.  We came to the view that there should be a mandatory medical examination for persons convicted of illegal consumption and usage of drugs. Even then we made exceptions: for example, we did not require a mandatory medical examination for the first or second offence for possession of cannabis for personal use, and rightly so.  It was felt that a problem could emerge and a medical examination would be necessary prior to sentence for further convictions. In practice, that has been the situation over the past seven years.  Nowadays, the defence of the accused has been rebutted in court; the facts have been proved in <Col N="1231" /> relation to drug pushing; and there is clear evidence before the court that the drug pusher is far from being an addict but is very careful about his own personal lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General makes a particularly strong point, as do the Task Force on Drug Abuse and the Drugs Squad, that the convicted drug pusher must be remanded for another eight days for the commencement of a medical examination, putting a particular onus on certain individuals of the health boards, probation officers in the case of a minor pusher, welfare officers and so on.  In that context the mandatory provision should be withdrawn and there should be an optional provision.  I have acceded to that view and in the light of the circumstances and the information before the court in each particular case, the court should decide if there should be a formal medical report on the accused before conviction.  This a rather unique provision in European legislation.  We are evolving a system of having one judge responsible for drug cases before the courts, one State solicitor specialising in this area, and the courts would clearly exercise the option of requiring medical reports.  It is part of the ordinary defence of pushers and addicts in our courts today that medical information is laid before the courts, that the unfortunate individual has been to Jervis Street Hospital on x number of occasions, that his doctor is X, Y or Z and that his medical information is given to the court. Then the court has to give the addict the option, on conviction, of going to Coolmine for two years or, as in a recent case, accepting nine months prison sentence. God knows it is arguable as to what type of medicine that will be to him.  Admittedly, he may have had access to drugs but we are anxious that, particularly in drug pushing convictions, there clearly should be discretion open to the courts before sentencing.  There cannot be summary conviction, those people would have to be brought back to the courts again and the whole process of certification and medical examination would have to be invoked again.  Discretion is advocated by most of the people involved, I was loath to accept it initially but after <Col N="1232" /> consideration I agree that there is a case for reducing the mandatory provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a cogent case but it rests, unfortunately, on the assumption that our Judiciary by and large are people of balance and discretion and a number of other things which most markedly they have not displayed on occasions in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it in more parliamentary language.  It presumes an expertise.  Perhaps the Minister can give me information on the numbers of cases that have been brought to his attention of persons being convicted of serious offences, like drug pushing, who had to be subjected to a mandatory assessment and who turned out quite clearly not to have needed it.  How many of those convicted of drug pushing offences turn out not to have any drug related history?  It is easy to say the medical profession are put out by this, but if somebody is convicted it should not be too difficult for a member of the medical profession to say it quite clearly.  The Minister spoke about beginning a process of assessment after eight days.  If somebody is clearly not addicted to drugs that should be immediately apparent to a member of the medical profession.  In other words, if it is difficult to be sure, it should not be left to a member of the Judiciary to make a decision which is difficult even for the medical profession.  It would be regrettable if people who are seriously addicted to heroin and to other hard drugs were to become victims of judicial indiscretion by virtue of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have precise figures.  As the Senator is aware, there are increased convictions of persons for drug pushing and that would be my preoccupation.  We need treatment for addicts and convictions for drug pushers. That should be our general approach. There is not a mandatory provision in <Col N="1233" /> other legislation to require formal medical reports on everybody.  From experience there is a strong view on the part of the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána that when a person manifestly is known to be a drug pusher, and it is known to the courts &mdash; all this, of course, is post conviction: only then do the courts enter into it &mdash; that it should devolve on the courts to impose sentence. Increasingly, as the Judiciary become aware of the need for treatment and the problem of pushing, I have no doubt the Judiciary would seek medical reports. However, they should not be obliged to do so in relation to every person who comes before them.</P>
      <P>At all times I am anxious to protect the rights of the accused.  I want to see the accused get the benefit of all doubts. I think the 1977 Act imposed a rigour on the Judiciary, because prior to deciding on a sentence for drug pushing there was a mandatory requirement on them.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, and in the light of the substantial advice we have received, the prospect is one of mandatory option. Increasingly, as we know, people convicted of possession of drugs for personal use confront the court with the problem of designation of treatment rather than designation of incarceration.  When a person comes into court a self-confessed heroin addict and he has been before the court before and is known to the judge and the Drug Squad to be a heroin addict, the judge has to remand the person for eight days after conviction for yet another medical examination.  Invariably in such cases there is human medical tragedy and that part of a person's defence is known to the judge and there need not be a further hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, drug pushers have been laughing at us and have adopted forms of defence which have been questionable. With due respect to the medical profession, there is always a doctor who will find some unique aberration in the lifestyle of the drug pusher which will be given as medical evidence in the court in mitigation of sentence.  That may be so because some addicts become pushers in order to finance their habit.  However, to force the <Col N="1234" /> court in all circumstances to require medical evidence after conviction would be unique.  For instance, it does not apply to persons convicted under the Offences Against the State Act of being in possession of explosives.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons convicted of manslaughter or murder it is not a postconviction mandatory obligation on the Judiciary to do so.  Perhaps there should be such an obligation, but inevitably, in such cases prior to conviction all the medical evidence is laid before the court.  In the case of drug addiction medical evidence is invariably laid before the court but under the 1977 Act the court does not have any option but to have another medical examination.  That is why we are seeking to relieve the court of that exceptionally onerous obligation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was not obligatory in most other cases to have medical assessments.  The Minister has reason to be grateful because I am convinced that if there was a medical assessment on every person about to be sent to prison three-quarters of them would end up under the Minister's jurisdiction in pyschiatric hospitals and he would have an even greater expense to deal with.  The evidence is clear-cut the most of our regular and recurring prison population suffer from very serious psychological, psychiatric and other complaints.</P>

    <P>Every so often the Minister comes up with this and I keep getting the feeling that it is because a certain individual caused great embarrassment to the State apparatus by absconding during the period he was supposed to be getting his medical assessment that we have had this response.  Ultimately, the Minister is still saying that a member of the Judiciary is competent to make a decision about a person's addiction.  If that is the case there is not any need for medical assessments at all.  If they are not competent then we need medical assessment for everybody.  If the Judiciary can be relied upon to make the distinction fairly, we do not need a medical assessment.  We may need a social assessment.  It is regrettable that some individuals abuse this but it would be more regrettable if <Col N="1235" /> people who are the victims of drugs are punished as if they were part of the problem. That question still arises.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware that this is a difficult problem.  I wish to raise some questions that concern me.  As far as I understand it &mdash; I do not have the 1977 Act with me &mdash; the provision of a mandatory report applied only in the case of persons convicted of possession of controlled drugs.  I do not think that requirement applied in the case of persons convicted of having the controlled drug for the purpose of selling it to other people or to pushers.  That distinction was worth while because it made a distinction between the pusher who may have been an addict and those convicted of having controlled drugs in their possession for their own use.  It was a useful distinction because it tried to create some type of uniformity of treatment for those convicted as addicts or abusers.  I do not believe it is possible for the courts as they operate at present to be able to suggest the most appropriate treatment programme for an individual or have uniformity in their decisions.  Is it possible at this stage to retain the idea of a mandatory report following conviction and prior to a final decision is made about the treatment or disposal of a convicted person? Is it possible to have a mandatory report in the case of those convicted of having controlled drugs in their possession for their own use and allow discretion in the case of persons specifically convicted under the provisions of the Principal Act which were concerned with drug pushing for commercial gain?  I can see some merit in the notion of discretion there but in the case of those convicted as abusers or addicts with drugs for their own use the provision of a report is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the report was so that the court in making a decision about a person convicted would obtain information as to the nature of the person's problems and the type of treatment option that would best suit that person. That seems to be a humane idea.  I make those observations in the knowledge that the drug problem has got worse since 1977 and that other problems have been <Col N="1236" /> identified but I hope that because of the increasing difficulties we do not lightly throw out what was considered then to be a radical provision, insisting on mandatory reports on persons convicted of having drugs in their possession.  It would be valuable if it could be retained in some form while at the same time having the distinction between persons convicted of having drugs for their own use and those convicted for drug pushing.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy O'Mahony on the thrust and spirit of the 1977 Act.  Uniquely we still retain the prospect of the medical report being obtained prior to conviction. Admittedly it is being changed from being mandatory to one of discretion but it is important to bear in mind that in most cases after conviction representatives of those up for sentence will enter a plea that it would be wise to get such a medical report prior to sentencing.  A medical report is either given there and then or had been given already in the course of the defence.  If it is not available an accused is invariably put back for sentencing until it is produced.  The Judiciary and the Garda have found it difficult in that hardened known criminals involved in straightforward drug pushing have availed of this section extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable difficulty in terms of appeal as to what constitutes a medical examination, a medical report and the presentation of such a report on a certified basis to the court.  A hardened criminal will not have any difficulty spending thousands of pounds securing the best legal brains in the country to pose the requirement that a consultant who may have carried out an examination should be brought before the court prior to sentencing.  A virtual second trial on the medical evidence may take place. That is purely a delaying tactic.  In that context a number of individuals have posed considerable difficulty and it is why the courts should have discretion to decide whether the obtaining of such a report is appropriate.  I have no doubt that the Judiciary, bearing in mind that there will be specialisation in this area, when sentencing people for possession <Col N="1237" /> and pushing will exercise their discretion.</P>
    <P>The only exemptions are first and secand offences for the possession of cannabis for personal use.  The 1977 Act was all-embracing in that respect.  If we had made the distinction then about drug pushing we might not now be in a cleft stick in taking on board the recommendations of the task force, who examined this matter at considerable length and spoke to the law officers of the land prior to making that recommendation.</P>

      <P>Detection is obviously vital in the area of drug abuse and I welcome the extension of powers of search contained in this section.  I understand that most of the big pushers are now off the streets but there is a host of small pushers who must be detected and brought to justice.  Given the relatively free movement of people and goods between Ireland and Britain it is not feasible to examine everybody moving between the two countries.  Information is vital and in this connection I have a specific suggestion to which I should like to have the Minister's reaction.  The drug and intelligence information unit in Britain is likely to have information on Irish drug traffickers.  I would therefore suggest that the time has come for the closest co-operation between our Drugs Squad and the unit in Britain which would be mutually beneficial.  Such an exchange of information would be particularly beneficial to us in detecting the smaller drug pushers who come across the Irish Sea, bringing with them their lethal merchandise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to the Garda in this <Col N="1238" /> section gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to the Drugs Squad and the excellence of their work and to Inspector Denis Mullins in particular.  He has done an exceptional job and I understand he was promoted recently to the rank of superintendent.  I congratulate him on his appointment but must immediately express the hope that he will not as a consequence of his promotion be assigned to duties other than those in the drugs area.  I recognise that this is the responsibility of a different Minister but I think this man's very valuable talents and experience should continue to be used in a drugs area.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Hillery that there is very considerable co-operation between the Drugs Squad in the Republic and the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  There is also very considerable co-operation between the Drugs Squad and Interpol.  Many of the seizures made in the Republic have been directly as a result of liaison and the transmission of sensitive information from authorities in other countries to the authorites here.  There has been a considerable improvement in liaison and I hope between now and December to have the first ever meeting of EEC Health Ministers.  This is one of the topics I hope to raise.  A good deal of work has already been done at what we call the &ldquo;Pompidou&rdquo; level and I hope to develop and extend within the Ten the system of communication between the various drugs squads.  There has already been a great improvement and our work has benefited considerably as a result.</P>
