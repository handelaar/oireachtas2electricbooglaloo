      <P>I have notice from Senator de Brún, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The existing support arrangements for Irish cultural organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the basis on which grants are allocated.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make strong representations to the British Government over the continued occupation by their forces of the GAA grounds in Crossmaglen County Armagh, and the harassment by these forces of the members of the GAA club there.</P>
      <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator de Brún's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Kiely may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 2.  I refer my colleagues in the House to the supplementary Order Paper which is being circulated and which contains Nos. 2a and 2b.  It is also proposed to take Nos. 3, 5, 4, 1 and 6 in that order.</P>
      <P>With reference to the supplementary Order Paper there is a further supplementary item which will be known as No. 2c, that is the Irish Shipping Ltd.  Bill which it was intended in the other House to have completed.  Because of the suspension of the sitting of the other House to allow Members to attend the inter-denominational service they were unable to conclude that part of the business of the House.  We had expected to be able to introduce it in the supplementary Order Paper before Senators.  I would like the House to give me permission to introduce it at a later stage in the day when it becomes available.  I apologise for the fact that it is not on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I also want to apologise to the House for not having the facility available to me within Standing Orders to suspend the sitting of this House to allow everybody to attend the inter-denominational service.  As the House had adjourned until 2.30 today it would have had to meet to readjourn and, by the time we would had done so the service would have been over.  I propose the Order of Business in that order and I trust the House will understand that it is my intention to get through as much business as possible.  I also intend to adjourn for tea between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Immediately after that we will take the remaining 1½ hours on motion No. 5 and carry on with the rest of the business as it arises.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, it is intended to take item No. 3.  I presume we are just taking the Second Stage of item No. 3 today.  What is the <Col N="829" /> situation regarding item No. 1?  What is the intention of the Acting Leader of the House on item No. 1?  Is the Shipping Bill a Money Bill?  What is the intention in regard to No. 2c when it comes up?  Do we intend to take Second Stage only?  Is it the intention of the House to sit tomorrow?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>One question which Senator Lanigan raised was in connection with item No. 1.  It is ordered but I cannot see us reaching it.  It will probably be after the Easter Recess that we will reach it.  It is a very important Bill.  It is being initiated in this House.  It is appropriate to order it with the intention of taking it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>No. 2c is the Bill in connection with Irish Shipping.  It is not a Money Bill.  I hope we will get through all Stages today as it is a matter of urgency.  That is why I adopted this strategy, to try to accommodate the situation which has arisen. We have a statutory obligation to deal with Irish Shipping.  I know I have the approval of the House.  I discussed it with the Whips and they have agreed to facilitate the passage of that Bill.</P>

If the business is not completed I have an obligation to the Government and we will sit tomorrow. We will sit all day and late tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is no doubt briefed on section 3.  A point raised on Second Stage last week was the question of the differential with regard to the number of replacement candidates envisaged under subsection (3), paragraph (a) of section 3.  The Minister undertook to consider the differential which would arise as between a non-party candidate on the one hand and a single candidate of a registered political party on the other hand, whereby the non-party candidate would be entitled to nominate three replacement candidates but a registered political party sending one candidate would be entitled to nominate four replacement candidates.  The Minister undertook to look at that to see if there was any difficulty in any constitutional requirements with regard to fairness or any matter like that.  I ask the Minister to indicate what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I said on Second Stage that I would look at it and I have looked at it.  I take the Senator's point, but there is no conflict whatsoever.  There is no degree of unfairness.  The Independent would have three candidates and the party would have four.  Rather than splitting hairs with regard to parties, it is better to establish on day one that the political party have this number whether they run one, two or three.  The Independent is a single entity and will be running only one.  We will determine that, but we are not able to determine what the political party will do.  In the interest of fairness and of having <Col N="831" /> criteria on which we can go, I believe what we are suggesting is a better arrangement.  I propose to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all concerned with the question of fairness because, as the Minister has said, nobody can seriously, objectively consider the question of fairness.  What I am concerned about is whether it could be considered to be in conflict with the equal treatment of individuals under the Constitution.  I am not concerned about whether it is fair or unfair in that sense.  I do not think anybody will be put at a disadvantage.  I am worried in case the letter of the law will be seen not to be applied fairly to two situations which are clearly identifiable and comparable.  Obviously if a political party have three candidates, under this legislation they would be entitled to a total of seven on the list, that is, three plus four.  Obviously they must be entitled to some excess because, of course, any number of those candidates, up to and including three, might be elected and, therefore, they would need a greater reserve to draw on.  I understand and appreciate that that differential must come about.  I can see that an argument could be made in the case of a registered political party standing only one candidate who would be entitled to be the one candidate and another additional four, as compared to the Independent candidate who will be entitled to himself plus three.  Is the Minister satisfied that it is not in breach of any individual's constitutional right?  That is the kernel of the question rather than whether it is fair or unfair from a political point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the people to decide in a referendum whether the Constitution should be amended to enable the right to vote at Dáil elections to be extended to persons other than citizens by legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, proposed to confer on British citizens resident in this country the right to vote at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda on conditions identical with those applying to Irish citizens.  The President referred the Bill to the Supreme Court and the Court ruled that the Bill was repugnant to the Constitution.  Following that decision I announced that the Government had decided to bring forward a Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the right to vote to be determined by legislation.</P>
      <P>The right to vote at Dáil elections is conferred on citizens of Ireland by Article 16.1.2 d of the Constitution.  The Bill proposes to replace this provision by a new subsection.  The new provision, while retaining the citizens' right to vote, will make it possible to extend this right to such other persons in the State as may be determined by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment is approved by the people, the Oireachtas will be empowered to enact legislation granting the right to vote at Dáil elections to such categories <Col N="833" /> of non-citizens in the State as it may decide.  The selection of categories will be a matter for the Oireachtas which may extend the categories concerned from time to time by fresh legislation.  It will be open to the Oireachtas to take account of special circumstances.  It could for example, decide to grant the right to vote at Dáil elections to citizens of any country which granted reciprocal rights to Irish citizens living in that country.  At the present time, Irish citizens resident in Britain have full voting rights at parliamentary and other elections.  None of the other EEC member states grants the right to vote to Irish citizens at parliamentary or local elections but this position may, of course, change in the future.</P>
    <P>The constitutional constraints which apply in relation to the grant of the Dáil vote to Irish citizens will apply also in relation to non-citizens.  In other words, a minimum age of 18 years will apply; there can be no discrimination on grounds of sex; the persons concerned must be free from legal disqualifications in relation to voting and they must comply with the provisions of the electoral law.</P>
    <P>A definite connection with this country will be an essential condition of the grant of the Dáil vote to non-citizens.  It is considered appropriate that this should be a constitutional requirement and should not be left to statute.  For this reason, the proposed amendment prescribes that the vote may be extended only to those non-citizens actually in the State.  Non-citizens will, of course, be required to comply with the normal statutory provisions relating to voting and to registration as electors, including the requirement to be ordinarily resident in a particular constituency on the qualifying date for registration.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Constitution proposed in the Bill does not extend to granting voting rights to non-citizens at Presidential elections and referenda.  The import of the advice available following the Supreme Court decision on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, is that the basic concept of a Constitution is that of a fundamental law given by citizens to <Col N="834" /> themselves.  To give non-citizens the right in the Constitution to change the fundamental law enshrined in it would be contrary to this basic concept.  To do so would be inappropriate and could constitute an in-built contradiction in the Constitution itself.  Similar considerations apply as regards Presidential elections. The right to vote at such an election, which is a special election of the Head of State under the Constitution, is a right appropriately reserved to the people who gave themselves the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Senators will welcome the proposal contained in this Bill.  The principle of extending the right to vote at Dáil elections to persons other than Irish citizens has already been endorsed by the Seanad in approving the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983.  That measure applied to British citizens only.  Now that it is clear that an amendment of the Constitution is required, I am sure Senators agree that the amendment should be couched in such terms as will allow the Oireachtas to extend the vote to such categories as it may consider appropriate from time to time.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is approved by the Seanad, I would propose that the referendum be held on 14 June which is polling day for the European Assembly elections.  The Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1984, which will also come before the Seanad will enable steps to be taken to assist voters in their understanding of the issues involved as is customary in the case of constitutional referenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve in principle of this Ninth Amendment to the Constitution Bill.  I understand that problems arose after the legislation was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and that following the Supreme Court decision a referendum is necessary.  What I am concerned about is the fact that, when the referendum is carried, as I believe it will be, we will give the right to vote to British citizens and non-citizens of the State while, at the same time, disabled people who are not deprived of the right to vote by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament are deprived of their vote due to the fact that we have not initiated or <Col N="835" /> implemented legislation to provide postal voting facilities for them.</P>
      <P>Many people are up in arms because we are to have a referendum to give voting rights to non-citizens while, at the same time, we are depriving disabled people of their vote.  They have the right to vote in principle but they cannot do so because of their circumstances.  They cannot exercise that right due to the fact that they cannot get to the polling booths. Legislation to give them postal voting facilities has not been passed.  I appeal to the Minister to think of the people who have been left out in the cold for far too long and to initiate legislation and have it enacted to give to these people their democratic right to vote in all elections. At present postal voting facilities are available to the Garda and the Defence Forces.  Disabled people have plenty of time to reflect on many matters to which other people with busy schedules cannot devote much attention.  They have time on their hands.  Many of them take a keen interest in politics and many of them would be very able politicians if they could get elected to their county councils or to either House of the Oireachtas. Here we are granting voting rights to people who are non-citizens and at the same time we are depriving disabled people of the vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Senators in the House I should like to welcome the proposal to amend the Constitution in this fashion.  As the Minister has pointed out, the principle of enabling non-citizens to vote in our elections was accepted by this House and by the other House when we passed the <Col N="836" /> Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983. When we passed that Bill we proposed to confer on a narrow range of people who are not citizens of this country, that is, British citizens, the right to vote not only in Dáil elections but in Presidential elections and in referenda.  The arguments used in this House at that time are equally valid now.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the fact that the President in referring the matter to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court in making a decision on the constitutionality of that Bill expanded our understanding of the Constitution and gave us this further opportunity to consider what should be done.  In accepting that further opportunity the attitude being adopted by the Government in proposing this amendment is a wise one.  It would be quite improper to seek to mention in our Constitution a particular nationality, both from the point of view that it would not fit very comfortably with the concept of ourselves as a free and independent nation, and for the very practical reason that the nationality of another country can be subject to change by that country.  We might find that people who were entitled to vote at our elections were dependent on the action or inaction of the Legislature of another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By adopting the approach which the Government have proposed, that is, to make this an enabling piece of legislation, we will be in a position to consider from time to time and in a calm and considered way the categories of people to whom this right should be extended.  We will also be in the favourable position of being able to delimit those in a fairly accurate way.  For example, if it were decided to extend this right once again to British citizens, we will be able to define what we mean by a British citizen by reference to some existing piece of British legislation. In the event of that piece of legislation changing that would not necessarily mean that our definition of what a British citizen is would automatically have to change.  Therefore, we will be able to establish a more sensible set of criteria in determining what we mean by a British citizen or a citizen of any other <Col N="837" /> country.  In addition to the solution to that rather thorny problem it would enable us to consider, at an early date, whether the right should be extended to the citizens of each of the countries of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the relationship between ourselves and the United Kingdom, in an electoral sense and in many other senses, is very close.  The right which our citizens have to vote in all elections in the United Kingdom &mdash; on proof of residence there &mdash; is a right which we must recognise as being particularly valuable to those many people who retain their Irish citizenship and live on the mainland of Britain.  Some reciprocal gesture on our part is, therefore, overdue. This reciprocal gesture was agreed to as long ago as 1980 between the then Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  The series of legislative proposals, culminating in this legislation, this proposal for the amendment to the Constitution, are to be welcomed.  We have a duty to respond in a generous way to ensure that British citizens, who have residence in this country, are extended the same facilities in so far as it is practical, recognising our different constitutional framework, and are treated as favourably as are our citizens in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The advantage of this proposed amendment to the Constitution is that we will be able to consider, simultaneously with that, our attitude in time, whether such voting rights should be extended to the many people who are resident in this country and who are citizens of countries other than the United Kingdom, which are members of the European Economic Community.  As the Minister said, these citizens are entitled, as of right at present, by operation of law, to vote in local elections. That is a right which is widely used. I should like to pursue with the Minister, perhaps on Committee Stage, the question of who is entitled at present to vote in local elections.  It is appropriate in the context of this legislation to extend the franchise to include not only the citizens of the United Kingdom but also the citizens of the other countries with whom we share membership of the European Economic <Col N="838" /> Community.  It is true to say that in those cases there is no immediate possibility that we will be entitled to or will get a reciprocal right for our own citizens, but I think that will not be delayed for too long.  Whether we postpone the decision until those reciprocal rights are available or whether we go ahead unilaterally and grant it to those citizens is something we can consider later.  In the event of such proposals being made it is right that all constitutional prohibitions to the Legislature considering such an extension should be removed at this stage.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is passed and the referendum is held I hope that the people will give it enthusiastic support.  It is important that the consideration of matters such as this should be taken out of the area of irritants which might arise from time to time between the Government in Ireland and the Government in the United Kingdom.  We should consider this as a right which we are proposing to confer on individual people who represent a community and who are making substantial contributions as citizens of the United Kingdom living in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the positive attitude the political parties have adopted towards this proposal, both in respect of the previous Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983 and in respect of this amendment to the Constitution, will be retained and that citizens will be encouraged to exercise a franchise and to give a clear indication that we are not afraid of including other people in our electoral process, that we welcome them as a constructive addition to the political life of the country.</P>
    <P>I will give Members an example of the kind of problem that can arise.  In the mid-sixties I was aware of an English citizen who had lived in this State since 1927.  Her husband had come here and started an enterprise which had given employment to more than 300 people consistently for between 35 and 40 years. He was dead at this stage but the company were still employing some hundreds of people.  Because this woman had retained her UK citizenship she was not entitled to vote at general elections.  That did not make much sense.  The legislative <Col N="839" /> rules which apply in the United Kingdom make a lot more sense.  So long as a person resident here is paying tax and expected to obey the laws of the country, he should be given some say in the manner in which it is governed.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some change in the Government's attitude concerning the entitlement of non-citizens to vote in referenda and Presidential elections.  The Minister, in his helpful explanatory memorandum, reminds us of the proposal in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which was declared unconstitutional to extend to British citizens the right to vote not only in Dáil elections but in Presidential elections and in referenda.  On this occasion it is proposed to delete that the latter two.  I listened carefully to the explanation by the Minister of the reasons for the omission in this Bill in that regard.  I see his difficulty and I am convinced of the merits of his argument with regard to referenda.  In other words, I think that if the Irish people take unto themselves a Constitution, it is only right that exclusively it should be theirs to amend or not amend as the case may be, just as we are now seeking that they should amend it to expand the categories of people who are entitled to vote in an election.  At some time in the future they may consider it wise to withdraw that.  I do not think that will come about but it is right that it should be reserved for the citizens of the country.  However, I cannot understand at all &mdash; although it is not a major issue &mdash; why the vote should not be extended in the case of Presidential elections.  So far as I am concerned the President, while he is the embodiment of the State, is basically only another House of the Oireachtas.  He is only another part of the legislative process.  He has additional powers and he forms an essential bridge between the Legislature and the Judiciary.  He has certain other functions of a constitutional nature.  But in regard to who should occupy that position, I do not see that there is any great difference between the election of a President and the election of a Government. For that reason I am not wildly enthusiastic about the decision not to include <Col N="840" /> Presidential elections.  However, it is not a very significant item.  It will not give rise to great difficulty.  In those circumstances, and with that one minor criticism, I welcome the legislation.  I think it is deserving of our support and we should not only ensure its passage through this House but use our good offices to ensure that it will be passed by a good majority when eventually it is put to the people.</P>

      <P>When we discussed the other Bill earlier this year I said that it would be found to be unconstitutional. That was my humble opinion at that time and it has been proved to be right.  Consequently, the Government have now had to come back to this House, after the legal teasing out by the draftsmen and legal advisers, with a Bill that would include people from other EEC countries living here.  To propose, as was proposed then, to extend the franchise to British citizens living here and to exclude people from other member states was not logical. It is only right that we include all EEC nationals who are living here and contributing to this nation, whether in the industrial field, the educational field or any other field of activity.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary has said rightly that the President has a very important role to play.  He played a very important role in that other piece of legislation we passed here some time ago and which has been found to be unconstitutional. Fianna Fáil will support proposals to amend the Constitution to give power to the Oireachtas to extend the right to vote in Dáil elections to persons who are ordinarily resident here but who are not Irish citizens.  The Irish people ultimately will decide whether we give this extended voting right to non-nationals.  In the event of the result being in favour of giving that right we are reserving our position to some extent until the other Bill is before us because we may not be entirely in agreement with some of its provisions.</P>

    <P>In agreeing to extend the right to vote in Dáil elections to citizens of the EEC countries we would welcome an arrangement whereby reciprocal rights be granted to Irish citizens resident in other member states.  The Minister would be <Col N="841" /> wise to include such a provision in the Bill that is to come before us later.  If such a reciprocal arrangement can be brought about the Bill may go through with very little opposition from this side of the House but it is necessary that we get that type of arrangement.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator O'Leary regarding referenda and Presidential elections.  When we are amending our Constitution, the Constitution for our own State, the people resident within the State are the people best geared to frame legislation to suit their requirements.  No foreign element or group of foreign people should have the right to decide the legislation that goes on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to the selection of our President.  Because of the importance of the Presidency it is essential that there is elected to that Office a person who is capable of carrying out his duties, both at home and abroad, properly. Apart from the task of examining and scrutinising legislation, the President plays an important role as an ambassador for this country on his trips abroad.  I submit that the Irish people should retain the right to choose their President, regardless of what conventions or legislation may be considered necessary within the EEC.</P>
    <P>I just wish to endorse the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Lynch, as regards incapacitated people.  I know this is not within the terms of the Bill but as we fought dearly for the right to vote we should ensure that all our citizens who have reached the age of maturity be enabled to exercise that right.</P>

      <P>I am just supporting Senator Lynch's comments and I am sure they are your own views as well, indeed that they are the views of everyone here. We should facilitate those who are incapacitated in relation to voting.  Those who are not incapacitated in any way become very frustrated if they find on polling day that because of a clerical error or for <Col N="842" /> some other reason, they cannot exercise their right to vote.  It is only right that we ensure that everybody who is entitled to vote is enabled to do so.  When we are changing legislation to give foreigners who are resident here the opportunity of voting within our State we should take cognisance of the fact that there are a number of Irish people who are unable to go to the polls to vote.  I hope that the legislation that will be necessary to give them that power will be forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I have spoken on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill already and have expressed the view that I consider it to be an extension of democracy that no matter what a person's nationality is, if he is resident in the country he should have the right to express an opinion at election time as to who should govern the country.  The other Bill was giving to non-nationals who were resident in Ireland the right to vote in general elections. They already enjoy the right to vote under the Local Government (Electoral) Act.</P>
      <P>It is only appropriate that they should have the same right to express a view as to who should govern them if they are living in the State and subject to its rules and regulations.  When the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn, was introducing the previous Bill he almost asked the President to refer it for a constitutional opinion to the Supreme Court which, of course, the President did.  As a result of that, we are faced with this Bill.  That was necessary because in the event of that other Bill not having been referred to the Supreme Court and if an election had taken place, a case could have been brought to the courts which could have resulted in that election being declared null and void, a situation which would have created a dilemma for the Government of the day, particularly if there was a hung Dáil.  One constituency could be very relevant depending on the number of British citizens who had voted.  It was appropriate, therefore, that we got a Supreme Court opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of principle, the Constitution <Col N="843" /> should be subject always to review and to amendment if necessary.  I would support the removal of certain sections of the Constitution.  Times have changed since it was written.  It has served its people well but attitudes have changed. We should not have our heads in the sand as legislators and not be prepared to look at the Constitution with a view to further amendments.</P>
    <P>The advantage also that I see in this amendment is that it is a reciprocal arrangement with our people in England who have the right to vote in elections there.  Irish people resident in Britain have never conceded their birthright to anybody.  They still regard themselves as Irish citizens and rightly so.  They have the opportunity, because Britain does not have a Constitution, to use the franchise to determine what Government should govern their daily lives in Britain.  If this can be seen by those people as a reciprocal arrangement it will go a long way towards healing any divisions that might be in people's minds about how we treat people in any particular situation.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is passed by the people, and I hope it will be, it will confer on the Houses of the Oireachtas certain powers to decide to whom this additional right of voting should be given and what special categories it can be extended to.  It will allow us in the next stage of the process to discuss the right to vote here of non-British people, people from within the European Community.  It would be appropriate, too, that members of other EEC countries who have been resident in this State for a long time should be able to vote here.</P>
    <P>This amendment will be put before the people on the same day as the European elections.  We must ensure, if we are to live up to the spirit of this constitutional amendment, that those who will be given the right to vote in the European elections will not also be given a ballot paper to vote in referenda because it would be in contravention of the spirit of the Constitution.  I have an open mind as to whether they should vote for a Presidential candidate or not.  I expect many of the existing population in the country <Col N="844" /> would feel already disenfranchised because of the arrangements being made to nominate Presidents without reference to the will of the people as provided for in the Constitution.  We should look at our own house and make sure it is in order before we have regard to British people living here and who might consider themselves disenfranchised because of not having the right to vote in Presidential elections.  However, it is not something that I am unduly worried about.</P>
    <P>An extension of the various categories may not necessarily include an extension to provide facilities to enable disabled persons to vote.  That is not a requirement in a constitutional amendment.  Constitutionally, disabled people are at present entitled to vote.  The problem is the physical difficulty they have in getting to polling stations.  I hope the Minister and his Minister of State will look at this problem.  He should look, too, at the anomalies that have arisen in the postal vote system and if a ministerial order is being made to grant an extension of a voting system to other people who are disadvantaged by way of physical or other incapacities, we will then have an opportunity in this House to decide on the method by which we extend that facility. I would not like it to go out from this House that we were having a constitutional amendment to allow British people to vote and not doing something about disabled people who are not, as I say, precluded constitutionally from voting. There is required only a ministerial order to facilitate them if we cannot deliver the ballot box to where they are.</P>
    <P>I said most of what I wanted to say on this legislation at the time we were discussing the previous Bill.  I hope that the Bill will pass with the agreement of all parties in the House and that the country will accept it in the spirit in which it is offered, that is, as an extension of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris mentioned something to which I should like to refer, that is, the question of our priorities. Quite rightly, we are facilitating the Oireachtas to extend to certain people <Col N="845" /> resident in this country the right to vote. Our reasons for doing this could well be subject to some scrutiny.  It all goes back almost as far as Sunningdale and the attempts made then to bring ourselves and the United Kingdom closer together. That of itself is a very good idea but it also raises a question because it has to do with a reciprocal arrangement based on the fact that Irish citizens in Britain currently have the automatic right to vote.</P>
      <P>It needs to be said that there is something sad in the history of this country that we should have a huge number of our people resident in Britain and voting in Britain.  When we get involved in the niceties and analysis of constitutions we should remember that there are other fundamental needs which we as a community failed to meet, even during the history of our present Constitution when close on a million Irish people emigrated at the same period as this Constitution was being tested.</P>
      <P>This Bill raises yet again the point that our Constitution is rapidly becoming so antiquated that it is virtually creaking at the joints.  There are omissions in regard to what I would regard as almost fundamental rights, such as the right to shelter. There are omissions of issues that are now much more important, like neutrality and there are unevenesses in areas where certain rights are delineated almost to the point of tedium and which have been elaborated on by the courts, that is, the area of property.  Personal rights and the right to freedom are apparently very easily circumscribed.  Therefore, we need a reforming Government to look at the fundamental question of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The central thing that bothers me is the extraordinary haste in which something like this can be brought about.  I would hate to have a reforming Government simply seen to be reforming by doing that which is easy and speedy rather than devoting resources to doing that which is fundamental.  I am thinking, for instance, about the facilities for handicapped people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill and the proposal are very worthy though why it is suggested that it be confined only to citizens of the United <Col N="846" /> Kingdom I do not know.  I welcome it more than anything else because it will underpin the rights of Irish citizens in Britain to be treated equally and will not give some people on the extreme right of British politics an excuse for starting yet another tirade against the Irish in Britain. On that basis alone it is welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish that the same urgency and speed were devoted to dealing with the increasingly apparent problem of handicapped and housebound people who do not have access to the polls.  I trust the Minister will be able to give us some assurance that this matter will be before us quickly. There is one small thing the Minister could clarify for me &mdash; perhaps this is my ignorance &mdash; and that is what are the processes of law by which a person can be deprived of his right as a citizen to vote?  What categories are excluded by law from this right to vote?  It is an area that has all sorts of implications.  I am sure we are well protected but it would be interesting to know what categories are or can be excluded.  In principle the Bill is welcome.  I just wish that the fundamental questions of what is wrong with our Constitution could be addressed with the same speed and vigour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  It is necessary because of the process that the Minister described in his Second Stage speech, that the previous legislation, the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1983, which sought to extend voting rights to British citizens was declared not to be in conformity with the Constitution when it was referred to the Supreme Court.  That may seem a very cumbersome and untidy process but there are very considerable strengths in it.  It was clear when the 1983 Bill was brought before both Houses that there was considerable doubt about its compatibility with the Constitution.  It was felt that the appropriate course to take was to bring it forward and then indicate that the Government felt it was a Bill which the President might, after consulting the Council of State, refer to the Supreme Court, as he did.  It confirms the maturity of our system that we have very interesting checks and balances and a procedure <Col N="847" /> whereby a Bill can be examined in that way to see if it is compatible with the Constitution.  I am happier with the present approach.  I prefer the approach of an amendment to the Constitution which is the only approach open to us following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the reference case.  It is a preferable option to provide for a possible extension by the Oireachtas of the categories of persons resident in the State who will be qualified and eligible to vote in Dáil elections.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not made it clear to whom it is envisaged the vote will be extended following the referendum on this constitutional amendment.  He raises the possibility of the Oireachtas deciding to extend the right to vote at Dáil elections to citizens of any country which grant reciprocal rights to Irish citizens living in that country.  Then he points out that the only country which does this is Britain.  Britain grants voting rights both at general elections and local elections to Irish residents in that country.  No other member state in the EEC grants this right.  I put forward the submission that it would be a very narrow base to approach the possible extension of the right to vote in the Dáil elections here purely on the basis of a guarantee of reciprocity.  We did not do that when we decided to extend the right to vote in local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked the question as to who is entitled to vote in local elections. I think I am correct in saying that since 1974 that has been open to any people of any nationality provided they are resident here on the qualifying days and put themselves on the register for voting at local elections.  Anybody of any nationality &mdash; EEC, Americans, Third World &mdash; who is resident here can not only vote in local elections but can stand in local elections.  I am speaking from memory, having looked at this, but I think that is the position.  We have been very open in the way in which we have given residents in this country the right to vote in local elections.  Similarly, we have not demanded reciprocity in extending the right to vote in our European Parliament, <Col N="848" /> the European Assembly elections. Ireland has given an example to other member states of the European Community by opening that, without requiring reciprocity, to nationalities of the EEC who are resident in Ireland.  Again, I welcome that.  If and when this is approved by the people by way of referendum, the approach to be adopted by the Oireachtas should be one of deciding on the basis on which we as a country wish to extend to residents who are living in this country and who should be enabled to participate in elections to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The opportunity exists for Ireland to take an initiative particularly in the context of the EEC.  We have already done this for the European Parliament elections and it is a logical, reasonable and innovative measure which would be scrutinised very carefully by other member states.  If Ireland did extend the right to vote in Dáil elections to nationals of other EEC countries this would certainly create waves in other countries because issues of this kind are examined in a Community context.  The rights of aliens in member states of the EEC are examined on a Community-wide basis and already Ireland has been more open and more prepared to grant voting rights than other member states of the European Community. We grant local election rights on a much more open basis to anybody resident in this country, the right to vote and the right to stand at local elections and we also have been very open in relation to the European Assembly elections.</P>
    <P>I believe we should adopt a similar approach in relation to Dáil elections because we do not have a major problem in doing this.  We do not have very significant numbers of foreign residents living in Ireland.  The numbers are relatively small and they would not upset any balance or change the character of the electorate. They would not disturb normal, predictable voting patterns.  Therefore, it would not cost us a great deal to take this step, but it is a commitment to the reality of the vision of the European Community and a necessary component of the whole philosophy of free movement of persons. There is a commitment to facilitating and <Col N="849" /> guaranteeing equality of access to social security, equal treatment, equal benefits to both workers and self-employed moving from one member state to another. As a country with a very young population, whether we like it or not, we are likely to see an increasing number of young Irish people seeking employment in other member states of the European Community.  It is in our interests to take an initiative in improving the quality of contribution which nationals of other member states can make in coming to reside in Ireland, that provided they satisfy the qualification conditions, they would be entitled to vote in the Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>This would create a useful pressure on other member states of the EEC to look at the rights which they give to nationals of other countries, nationals initially, perhaps, in an EEC context and then the logical follow-up of that is that it should be possible to grant voting rights to any long-term residents of a country.  Unless there are very serious problems in relation to either the numbers involved or serious apprehensions about what effect this would have on the system and situation in a country it is desirable from a human rights point of view and from an individual point of view that a person who is a long-term resident, who has made a commitment to and has family links and other strong bonds with a particular country should have the opportunity to exercise the democratic right to vote.  Therefore, I urge that the legislation which would follow this constitutional amendment would be on the basis, not of looking for reciprocity of voting rights being guaranteed to Irish residents in that country, because that would confine us purely to British citizens, but should be more open to the nationals of other member states of the EEC, as we did for the European Parliament elections without seeking reciprocal rights from those countries for Irish citizens resident in those countries.</P>
    <P>Finally, although as has been pointed out this does not really arise directly on this amendment, I support the views that have been expressed urging the necessity for measures to be taken to ensure that <Col N="850" /> anybody who is suffering from a disablement or condition which prevents him or her from voting in the normal way, will be enabled to vote.  Again, it is sad that we who have always emphasised the importance of the vote are so behind in doing this.  We have nothing to be proud of in our tardiness in this respect.  It is a sad reflection that an individual had to bring a case right to the Supreme Court asserting and seeking that right to vote and being effectively told by the Supreme Court in its judgment that although there is a right to vote it was one which required that the Legislature or the administration of the day make whatever provisions would be necessary for the exercise of that right.  It could not be asserted in a simple way as something that was guaranteed to be facilitated.  So the onus is back on us and I join with those who have already raised this in urging that we bring in as quickly as possible measures necessary to enable the disabled to participate in the franchise in like manner to any other citizens.  I, too, welcome this measure and I hope it will have a successful passage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House but there are a few remarks I want to make.  I welcome the Bill although I regret that it has taken so long to get it to this stage.  I sincerely hope that when the people are asked to vote on it on 14 June next they will quickly give their approval to extending the vote to non-citizens.  I am not so sure, however, we should be extending the vote to citizens who perhaps reside in this country for short periods.  I would like to hear from the Minister the length of time a person would need to be resident in the State to be considered eligible to vote. There is no indication in the explanatory memorandum or in the Bill as to the length of time a person needs to be a resident to be entitled to vote.  Would it be necessary for one to be resident continuously for an entire year?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point for us when he is replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now extending the vote to non-citizens and while I believe that returning officers in the main have bent <Col N="851" /> over backwards in providing polling stations for local or general elections or referenda, succesive Governments have given little attention to facilitating those who normally cannot vote despite the fact that they are on the register.  I join those who advocated here today, and on other occasions, extending the postal vote to other categories.  Members of the Garda, the Defence Forces and, I think, the Diplomatic Corps are entitled to the postal vote.  Perhaps this could be extended in a limited way to commercial travellers, patients in hospital, and those confined to nursing homes either for the day or for long periods.</P>
    <P>I know it is not possible to do so this year but I would ask the Minister to give consideration to extending the postal vote to the categories mentioned.  Perhaps there are others also that he could consider.  I know it is something that lends itself to abuse when it is extended and we had an instance of that a few years ago although it was never conclusively proven that it was abused to any great extent.  I do not think that one instance is sufficient to stop us from helping those who cannot get to the polling station.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum it states that the polling card is issued to the person who is entitled to vote in a particular constituency and I hold the view that in areas where you do not have a vote in a constituency &mdash; in other words where the vote is nationwide &mdash; it should be possible on that occasion to permit, say, commercial travellers who would have their polling cards with them from Cork and are doing business in Dublin or, <i>vice versa</i>, people from Dublin who are in other parts of the country, to vote.  It may lend itself to some abuse but it is something that I would like the Minister to consider so that we could extend the vote on occasions when we have a vote for a President or a referendum.</P>
    <P>People who must be away from their normal place of residence should be able to exercise the franchise.  Many people who work on polling day must move from the constituency in which they are entitled to vote.  My reading of the Bill is that if a person moves from one street to <Col N="852" /> another and is not in his constituency he cannot vote.  There is no justification in that.  Provision should be made in the Bill for a person who moves from his normal district to another to vote provided he is within the constituency and has his polling card with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for its reception of this Bill and to thank the individual Senators for their very good contributions.  As indicated in my opening statement, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Constitution to enable the vote at Dáil elections to be extended to persons other than citizens by legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The necessity for the amendment of the Constitution arises from the fact that the Electoral <Col N="853" /> (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which proposed to extend full voting rights to British citizens resident here, was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  That Bill, which was supported by all sides of the House, had been referred to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution.  If the Bill is approved by the referendum the vote may, at the discretion of the Oireachtas, be extended to all residents irrespective of citizenship whereas the Electoral Bill provides for votes for British citizens only.  It seems appropriate that the constitutional amendment should make provisions for a general extension of the franchise rather than extending it to a particular category and perhaps having to come back in a few years' time to seek further authority for the extension of other categories.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary referred to Presidential elections and referenda.  The Constitution Bill deals only with the Dáil vote whereas the Electoral Bill dealt also with the vote for Presidential elections and referenda.  This aspect has been commented on by a number of the Senators and, in the light of the Supreme Court decision, it is considered that it would not be appropriate to provide in the Constitution for voting by non-citizens at Presidential elections and referenda.  The basic concept of the Constitution is that of the fundamental law given by citizens to themselves.  The citizens themselves enacted that fundamental law.  It follows that only they should have the power to amend it, and if the Constitution were to give persons other than citizens the right to change this fundamental law or indeed repeal it there would be a basic contradiction in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of a Presidential election, the President holds a special position under the Constitution as Head of State.  He takes precedence over all other persons in the State and, in a special way, is the direct representative of the Irish people.  Having regard to the nature of his office and his role under the Constitution, it would seem inappropriate that he should be elected by anybody other than citizens of this country, and indeed the weight of opinion following <Col N="854" /> the Supreme Court decision bears this out.  We could be in trouble if we pursued any other course.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is approved by the people on 14 June the provisional certificate showing the result of the referenda will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, if not contested, will become final after 21 days. The Bill will then be signed by the President towards the middle of July.  Given these requirements it is likely that the implementing Electoral Bill will be introduced in the autumn and the extension of the franchise would be tied in with the ordinary registration procedure.</P>
    <P>The question of the categories of people to which the vote will be given was raised by Senator Mary Robinson. This will be a matter for the Oireachtas to decide in due course.  The choice would seem to be to extend it to British citizens only or to all EEC citizens.  Senator Robinson questioned reciprocity and said it would be a rather narrow approach.  I mentioned this in my speech, but I want to make it quite clear that it is not necessarily the view that will prevail eventually.  Obviously we have time to think about this and possibly giving it to one section only might seem to be narrow. We now have the opportunity if and when this legislation is passed to look at this broadly as I believe we should.  This legislation enables both Houses of the Oireachtas to extend the vote and gives us the opportunity to be able to think about it in a mature way.  I take Senator Robinson's point that if we want to get closer to the EEC it might be one way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan wanted to know who is disqualified by law from voting.  There is no legal disqualification for voting people into Dáil Éireann.  The question of postal voting was raised by a number of Senators.  This is being examined at present by the Government and it is their wish to bring something forward as soon as possible but it is something that has to be examined, not in the narrow context but in the broader context of looking at the postal vote to see who would or would not be entitled to it, not necessarily picking one section as against another.  We <Col N="855" /> have to look at it broadly rather than narrowly because if we decide on the facility of postal voting naturally those who will be deprived, other than the disabled, will want the same facility.  It is better, whatever we do, to think it out and to come up with as broad an answer as we can.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon asked what would be the qualifying time for a non-citizen after this Bill is passed?  Once the Bill is passed a citizen may apply in the normal way when the register is being compiled and will then appear on the voting register on the next occasion and will be eligible to vote in subsequent elections.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary asked who is entitled to vote in local authority elections.  Since 1963 all non-citizens, whether they are from the EEC or the Third World or wherever, are entitled to vote in local elections.  That covers the points I wanted to make and it covers the points the Senators raised.  Again, I would like to thank the House for the speedy way in which the Second Reading went through.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify for us the length of time a person is required to be in the State?  The time of registering for ordinary citizens of the State is 15 September, and I take it is the same for non-citizens.  If a person arrives in this State on 14 September is it possible for that person to be on the register on 15 April of the following year? I am concerned about the length of residence within the State of a non-citizen.</P>

      <P>There is no legal time during which a person must <Col N="857" /> be resident before he goes on the register. The question is if he is ordinarily resident. If he appears in the country on 14 September and he puts his name down he can go on the register or, indeed, it can be appealed against.  At the time of the hearings for registration of voters, somebody may object on that occasion and the deciding officer may or may not allow a voter to go on.  These questions will be teased out when the electoral legislation is going through both Houses.  This is only enabling both Houses of the Oireachtas to confer on non-citizens the right to vote.

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to assist voters at the referendum on the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill by making available to them a statement explaining the issue on which they are being asked to vote.  It also proposes that the poll at the referendum be taken on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies as the European Assembly elections which will be held on the same day as polling at the referendum are organised on a county and county borough basis.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill explains the purpose and content of this measure in some detail and it does not appear necessary for me to make a lengthy statement on the matter.  Briefly, section 1 provides that a polling card, containing the statement set out in the appendix to that section, must be sent to every elector, including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed on posters in, and in the precincts of, polling stations.  Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voters' answers.  These arrangements are identical with those made in relation to previous referenda on Bills to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the taking of the poll at the referendum on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies.  This change will apply only to the forthcoming referendum and is being made because of referendum is to be held on the same day as the European Assembly election which is being organised on a county and county borough basis.  Having the two polls taken by reference to the same areas will <Col N="859" /> facilitate the work of the returning officers.</P>
    <P>The information arrangements provided for in this Bill are additional to the permanent provisions of the referendum law under which copies of Bills to amend the Constitution are made available in post offices for inspection, free of charge, and for sale at a price not exceeding two and a half pence.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a technical one, identical in form with previous similar measures.  The important part of the content is the statement set out in the appendix to section 1. I am sure Senators will find this a reasonable description of the proposal contained in the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>

      <P>There is very little to ask the Minister in connection with this Bill.  There is one very important point that he could probably hazard a guess at. I asked the same question when the Government decided to defer the local government elections and I estimated at that time that there would be a saving of £1 million to the State by having the local elections on the same day as the European elections.  It has been mentioned already in the press and other places and figures ranging from £500,000 to £750,000 to £1 million have been mentioned. Would the Minister give us any indication of what savings will accrue as a result of holding this referendum on the same day as the European elections?  When I mentioned that there would be a saving of £1 million when the local government elections were postponed I was told that nobody could be accurate about that.  Is there any accuracy since then, now that we have reached a figure of £500,000 to £750,000 to £1 million?  Could the Minister tell us what saving there will be in having this referendum on the same day as the European elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the electorate do not get as mixed up as I did a few minutes ago.  I think I am on the right Bill this time.  Having made several pleas &mdash; once in this House and several times in the other House &mdash; I sincerely hope the <Col N="860" /> Minister will have a look at the regulations governing returning officers, not so much in regard to issuing polling cards &mdash; that end of it is quite in order &mdash; but when it comes principally to personnel being appointed by the same returning officers.  It is not possible for a person who is appointed to be a presiding officer or a polling clerk in one constituency to vote in a neighbouring constituency.  This happens a lot in Dublin.  I am quite sure it happens in Limerick, Cork and the other major centres of population also. It is not possible for the person, despite the fact that he has his polling card with him, to cast his vote if he crosses the boundary from one constituency to another.  In Dublin alone this could involve a few thousand people.  Certainly it involves hundreds of people.</P>
      <P>In the constituency for which I would be standing for election, or as far back as when I was working in elections, I found personnel being appointed from neighbouring constituencies and they lost their vote.  Likewise there were personnel appointed from my constituency to act at polling stations in other constituencies and they also lost their vote.  It is a great pity, seeing that we have just passed the other Bill to extend the vote to non-citizens, driving home the fact that we are democrats in extending the vote to other citizens that we so easily deprive citizens of our own State who are entitled to vote, are on the register and would be able to vote if they had been appointed to another polling booth, in some instances only a couple of hundred yards away, from voting.  I have mentioned this on a number of occasions.  It would appear that while the Minister of the day has always expressed concern about it, nothing was ever done.  I would ask the Minister of State to have a serious look at this and if he can go no further, at least to make a request.  I am sure the Minister would be concerned about it also. Although he would not have the same problem in his own constituency I am sure he is aware of it in the Dublin constituencies and in the other major centres of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity that we have gone to such lengths today to extend the vote to <Col N="861" /> those who are non-citizens of the State that we do not take a little more trouble to ensure that people who are being appointed outside the constituency in which they normally vote are not prevented from voting.  I have found this even in national elections, not only in Dáil and local government elections where one could find a reason for them to be confined to their own constituency because the candidates would be different in the constituency in which they were serving for the day.  In national elections, where the ballot paper is the same right across the country, I have found people being refused the opportunity to exercise the franchise.  I ask the Minister to have a serious look at this while he is in that Department and not let it slip on into the terms of some other Minister.  It has been tossed around for long enough and he will have done a good days' service for democracy if he will enable more of our citizens to cast their vote.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Members for their contributions.  I would also like to thank my Minister of State for being available to be here for most of the discussion.  This Referendum Bill, which is consequent on the passing of the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, is just putting in order what will happen on the day and the type of approach to the general public, to explain to them the question they must consider on election day.  The actual question will be circulated on the polling card.  The same polling card will operate for the European Assembly elections.  Therefore, there will not be any undue cost in that respect, in having to send out two different polling cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the additional election will be in the region of about £500,000.  This comes about because the count has to be carried on in each county and county borough area.  Counting staff will have to be provided in all of those areas, as is normal in a general election situation.  The same number of people will be required. Therefore it is not an election that can be run for the same cost simply because it is held on the same day.  There are obvious <Col N="862" /> savings by holding this on the same day as the European Assembly elections but there are additional costs which have to be met by the State.  We estimate that additional cost to be in region of £500,000.  It would be almost double that if there was no other election on the same day.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon showed his knowledge of the electoral situation by raising a point about the presiding officers and their poll clerks and their ability to vote. Almost without any exception the poll clerks and the presiding officers will be from their particular European electoral constituency and, therefore, it will be possible for them to vote for the particular candidates of their own area and, of course, it will be possible for them to vote in the referendum.  Arrangements can be made for them to do that.  Unfortunately there may be the exceptional case where somebody may be very close to the border of one constituency in the European Assembly elections and live outside the European election constituency where he is presiding.</P>
    <P>In that case I would have to be quite honest and straightforward in saying that on this occasion this particular person will not be able to transfer a vote but will not be deprived of a vote.  He will still be able to vote for the particular candidate in the area in which he is presiding. Because of the huge extent of the constituencies and the number voting in them, the effect of that would be very minimal indeed.  I hope it will not get down to a situation where the difference in the two remaining candidates perhaps for the last seat will be in the region of single figures. I believe that this is probably the type of figure we are talking about.  From my own experience in that particular previous election I think the smallest margin was in the thousands rather than in the hundreds.  The effect on this occasion will be very minimal indeed.</P>
    <P>These were the points that were raised that might be the cause of some contention in the debate.  I would like to thank the contributors for what they have said. We will certainly be looking at the points made and taking them into consideration to see if anything can be done to meet the <Col N="863" /> points that have been raised.  I would like again to thank the Members of the Seanad for their contributions on this very important Bill.</P>

      <P>This will form a somewhat different pattern from what we had at the last European elections where we ran them with the municipal elections.  Do I take it that when ballot boxes are collected within a Euro constituency &mdash; we will take our own constituency of Mayo, Galway or Sligo &mdash; that all of them will be brought to the one centre?  I take it that there will be a different coloured ballot paper for the European Assembly elections and the referendum.  Is it at that point that segregation of the ballot papers takes place?  I am sure the scrutineers would like to know for statistical, political and many other reasons, how regions voted, on the one hand, for the referendum and, on the other hand, the result a county gives to their European candidates.  If they are taken to a central location and there are all the boxes from a whole constituency with a geographical spread like Connacht/Ulster, one can see no way any scrutineers can get this information.  I am sure political parties will be entitled to have their scrutineers there to observe the counting.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any proposals to meet this type of situation?  It is the first time it has happened in the history of the State that this type of an election has been held, when a referendum has been held with the Euro elections.  We have had a Presidential election and a referendum but this is the first of its kind.  If the Minister has not the answer I will wait until another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer it fairly adequately. The boxes will be collected in the county boroughs which the presiding officers cover.  The boxes will be taken to a central place in those counties, not in the full constituency of a Euro constituency <Col N="864" /> but in the actual counties or county boroughs.  There the votes will be sorted because we will be using one box with obviously two different coloured ballot papers.  They will be sorted into bundles for each of the different counts for the referendum and the European Assembly elections.</P>
      <P>The checking of the papers which will probably have more interest for people will be the European Assembly election papers.  They will be checked against the returns of the presiding officers to see that the actual count in the boxes agrees with the numbers in the returns of the presiding officers' sheets.  That processing is the area the Senator is concerned about.  The normal presence of the parties&rsquo; agents will be there to scrutinise at that stage the upturn in the ballot papers, in other words the ballot papers will be faced up with the names of the candidates facing upward.  It will be possible within each county or county borough to carry out the usual scrutiny that happens at general elections for the various purposes for which it is used.  The main one is to give some indication of where the first preference ballot has gone in each area.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that in the European Assembly elections these ballot papers will be face upwards in each county or county borough.  They will then be checked and returned to the central counting area where the election count is normally held for the European elections or where it was held on the previous occasion.  There the full count will commence in those areas.  The checking of boxes will be done in each of the county areas under each presiding officer appointed for that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether happy with the Minister's reply to the point I raised, because he has stated that the difference in a candidate or candidates, if I got him correct, will not be as narrow in this election and will likely be greater than in other local or Dáil elections. That is not my concern.  It is not really that the casting of a vote or a number of votes would make a difference as to which candidate was elected.  My concern is that a person who is entitled to vote is able to vote, because there are very many people who in fact refuse positions on polling because they are being denied their right to vote, even though in elections the eventual figures would prove that their vote made no difference to candidate, party or whatever. People like to be able to exercise the franchise when their neighbours are so doing.  This is my concern, not that it makes a great difference to the result of the election.  We should endeavour to make it possible for all those on the register to vote, and nothing that the State or the returning officer does should prevent them from casting their votes.  I am not so sure that it will not happen on this occasion, even though it will happen to a lesser extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it will happen because, as I read it, the city of Dublin will be one area for voting and the county of Dublin will be another.  Many of my constituents were appointed to city constituencies.  I have been concerned about that for a considerable time.  It is not only a question of leaving my constituency and going into city or other constituencies, but it is also the reverse.  I find there are electors from city constituencies working at polling booths in my constituency.  They have <Col N="866" /> also been denied the right to vote in the past.  My reading of this Bill is that the elector will be confined to the county or county borough in which that elector is normally entitled or registered to vote. The elector can vote there, despite the fact that the ballot paper is the same all over the country.  In the past in a presidential election or a referendum such electors were denied the right to vote simply because they took up a position outside their own constituency and in this case it will be outside their own county or county borough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Ceist amháin.  This business of sending out cards has become slightly mixed up with elections.  Up to two elections ago, if people had not got their voter's card they felt they were not entitled to vote.  During a postal strike one year, cards were not sent out.  The Government should do something to ensure that people know they do not actually need the voter's card to vote.  It is a help in cities to enable people to know where exactly to vote.  A special effort should be made to emphasise the fact that, if people have not got their voter's card, they can still vote as long as they know where their vote is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say to Senator McMahon unfortunately that some people will not be able to vote if they are presiding in areas which are not in the county where they are registered, if they are presiding in another county, which would be very unlikely.  In the city of Dublin they might be in areas outside their normal constituency.  In that event, I have to say they will not have a vote in the referendum.  In the wider European election constituencies I cannot see them being deprived of their vote.  Should they be on the borders of Leinster and presiding in Dublin or in the Leinster constituency and presiding in Dublin County they might not be able to vote in either election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would imagine the practice will be followed by county registrars in various areas of using presiding officers from within their own county where possible. <Col N="867" /> Generally they do not move outside and bring people in.  I accept the fact that in Dublin this is not always the case.  I have to say there will be casualties in that respect and people will not be able to vote in the referendum because they come from outside a particular constituency area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the polling cards, on this occasion a very special effort will be made to see that polling cards will be delivered to every elector on the register.  It is important that the terms of the referendum will be outlined to every individual and be sent personally to him or her.  An effort will be made to make people aware of the terms of the referendum on which people will be asked to make their choice. This will be done in the obvious ways, in newspapers and in the polling stations. The wording will be there.  I accept that on occasions people do not get cards and are of the opinion, therefore, that they cannot vote irrespective of the number of times they are told that they do not require these cards.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senators that we will be using the media to inform people that they are entitled to vote as long as their names are on the voting register.  I am sure the publicity both of these elections will receive will acquaint everybody of the issues involved.  I hope that a special effort will be made to ensure that polling cards are delivered more effectively than in the past and, therefore, more people will have a personal indication of the terms of the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has highlighted the anomaly we are likely to have in this election.  Granted that it will be much less than in other elections but, at the same time, I understand from what he has now said people who will be appointed to a polling booth in the city of Dublin from the county, or vice versa, will be entitled to vote provided they have their card with them in the European elections because they will be within the same European constituency, but they will not be given the other ballot paper.  Neighbours of my own have been appointed to polling booths in Ballyfermot. <Col N="868" /> I am sure the same thing happens in Cork, Limerick and the other major centres of population.  To me it is an unusual situation.  I ask the Minister to request returning officers to ensure that the personnel they appoint are within their own area and entitled to vote.  Returning officers work from a list at one election after the other but we must have regard to the movement of constituency boundaries.  A person could be appointed, say, from Tallaght, Saggart or Clondalkin to a polling booth in Terenure, the city end of Templeogue, Ballyfermot or any part of the city.  He will have his polling card with him and he will be entitled to one ballot paper but not the other.  To say the least, it is a most extraordinary situation for any voter in this State to find himself in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation.  I cannot change it at this stage.  The Electoral Act, 1963, is there and the arrangements will be made in accordance with the Electoral Acts.  The problem can be very much minimised by the proper selection of presiding officers who will be within their own electoral county or borough area.  This would certainly minimise the difficulty which I accept will occur.  I hope it will be minimal if a sensible approach is taken to the selection of both presiding officers and poll clerks to make sure that everybody can vote in the elections.</P>

      <P>Could I say something that might be helpful to the Minister in this regard and which follows up the very <Col N="869" /> valid point made by Senator McMahon? This anomaly will exist even within a Dáil constituency because, if a Dáil constituency extends over both a country borough and a country area as, for example, in the constituency in which I live, Cork South-Central, and if a person living in one part of that constituency is appointed as presiding officer in the other portion of the constituency, he will not be entitled to a vote in the referendum.  It does not apply only in respect of that situation. The same thing applies in Senator McMahon's old and future stamping ground of Dublin South-West which covers part of the city and part of the county.  There is an additional problem there.  The Minister might see if anything could be done to change this.  A new definition of &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; might solve the problem. Anybody who can understand section 2 is a genius.</P>

    <Title>Dentists Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I said I did not think I would get my teeth into the Bill.  Today I am a week older and have grown longer in the tooth since then &mdash; unfortunately I have not got all of them.  I should like to deal specifically with section 7 of this Bill because it will be very important for the future of children's teeth.  Many children, unfortunately, are eating the wrong food and as a result they are losing teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of hygienists is a very important part of this Bill.  They will serve <Col N="870" /> a double purpose.  They will advise children as to what is good or bad for teeth, and they will give time to dentists to deal with the problems that have arisen.  It is very important that we have as much preventive dentistry as possible.  It is shocking to see what used to be described as toothless terrors &mdash; young people with their teeth extracted and nothing to be done for them except to provide them with dentures.  I suppose that, in its own way, is a good thing if the crisis has arisen. Section 7 which provides for hygienists could be a major step in the prevention of tooth decay where young children are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that dentists are not as plentiful in the public health scheme as they should be.  There is quite a queue for this service.  Many times when children visit a dentist they go simply to have an extraction done.  That is a sign of defeat of the whole system.  We should be able to get them there in time to have fillings done to ensure that their teeth are saved.  Schools must play a very important role, as well as hygienists, in helping to get across to the younger children the idea of teeth preservation.  Charts are sent around to schools and are put on display.  Many teachers have regular talks on the care of teeth.</P>
    <P>For that reason the suggestion that a member of the INTO should be on this committee is a very important one, because they are dealing with the problems of teeth, perhaps in an impersonal way.  They are not dentists but they see what is happening.  No matter what advice children get in school, and no matter what publicity is given to it, children still eat crisps, lollipops, and so on, all the wrong foods.  I ask the Minister to accept the suggestion that a teacher should be on that committee to advise on the whole question of the Dentists Bill.</P>
    <P>Ordinary drinking water seems to have a disadvantage as against fluoridated water.  Statistics prove that there is a 50 per cent drop in teeth decay if fluoridated water is used.  A special effort should be made to provide people who have not got a public water supply with some system &mdash; I know different tooth paste manufacturers claim to do the same thing &mdash; to <Col N="871" /> prevent tooth decay.  Some people have private supplies of water which tastes much nicer but in actual fact has no protection for teeth.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why dentists are so scarce in the health board areas.  I know there is a cutback on money, and everything else takes priority.  Many parts of medicine do not seem to have the same devastating effects as the lack of dental treatment.  I should like to see this question of dentists getting priority in health board areas and particularly in my own area, because we are short of a dentist. The two there work almost night and day in an effort to keep up with their work. Unless we employ dentists who are trained to look after teeth we will have an on-going problem, and we will only be catching up on the harm that has been done.  Instead of preventing the loss of teeth we will be extracting teeth that have decayed.  That is a pity, and I appeal to the Minister, if possible, to impress on health boards in particular that they should not cut back on the supply of dentists.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of the hygienists because they will play a leading role in leaving dentists free to do the jobs for which they are trained.  I would like to see teachers encouraged to implement more of the advice they get in circulars, and so on, to encourage children to avoid eating some of the awful &ldquo;goo&rdquo; that they eat which does harm to their teeth.  I should like to see the fluoridation of water as an ongoing thing and in particular for those who have their own private supply.  It would be nice to think that dentists who cost the State a lot of money would give a certain amount of service to the country before leaving us to gain experience and share their skills in foreign countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief contribution in support of the contents of this Bill and, at the same time, to put one or two questions to the Minister whom we welcome here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparison with most other countries the percentage of money we spend on dental care is very low.  I understand it represents not more than 2 per cent of <Col N="872" /> the total expenditure on health care.  This compares very unfavourably with Austria, 11 per cent; Denmark, 8 per cent; Finland, 7 per cent; Iceland, 6 per cent; Norway, 7 per cent; Sweden, 9 per cent; Switzerland, 9 per cent; and the United Kingdom, 5 per cent.  Compared with those countries it would appear that we are not prepared to spend in terms of our total resources sufficient money to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate the Minister's mind for a few minutes on the people for whom we have prime responsibility.  If we take pre-school children, primary school children, adolescents between 12 and 15 years, and the adult population who are eligible for medical cards, they total about 1.5 million.  It seems to me on the best evidence that I can get, that not more than half of the people in all of these categories are actually treated each year.  In some of our schools the position is considerably worse than that.  For the age groups below pre-school level the position is even worse.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea particularly for the less well off and disadvantaged groups, some of them in some of our long-stay hospitals, some in mental handicap institutions and many others.  I do not even know if we have any statistics as to the depth of their problems in this regard.  They do not have a strong voice to represent them.  As such, they form a part of society who have to undergo an awful lot of neglect in this area.</P>
    <P>In essence, what I am saying is that we have a paper eligibility for a great number of people who do not have available to them any satisfactory service.  The previous speaker made reference to a number of positive areas where we can try to encourage people in so far as preventive medicine is concerned to highlight deficiencies in our food and diet, and so on. Human nature being what it is, many people will have to rely on the actual service itself.  This will inevitably involve on the one hand, the employment of more dentists and orthodontists and on the other hand the whole dentists' profession.  They will have to come out of isolation and provide more of a total community service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> With these few brief remarks, because we are under pressure for time this afternoon, I should like to welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to indicate to us if he can hope to make any strides in dealing with the huge numbers of people, and particularly young children, who are without any adequate service in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Members of this House who contributed to the debate on the Dentists Bill.  Some speakers drew attention to various deficiencies in the health board dental service.  The Dentists Bill is not about the delivery of a dental service.  It is primarily concerned with the regulation of the practice of dentistry within the State.  Nevertheless, it does contain certain provisions that would have implications for the quality of the dental service that can be made available by the health boards for eligible persons. In particular, the establishment of classes of auxiliary dental workers who might be employed by the health boards could have a very beneficial effect on the quality of the health board dental service.</P>
      <P>Although there are waiting lists in some areas and screening of school children is not always carried out as frequently as one would wish, the fact remains that the level of the service being provided now, in terms of manpower, is as high as it ever has been.  There are difficulties in some areas in recruiting staff to full-time posts but, whenever possible, temporary staff are engaged in order to maintain the service.  At present there are over 260 dentist posts in the health board service.  In 1970 the number of dentist posts was only 116.  Due to the embargo on additional posts in the public service it is not possible to recruit additional dentists at present but the approved manpower level is being maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon suggested that there should be special provision for the treatment of handicapped and institutionalised persons.  The handicapped and the institutionalised are among the categories of patients who figure on the priority <Col N="874" /> lists of health boards for dental treatment purposes.</P>
    <P>It was Senator Lynch who commented on the salaries of public dental officers and said that the poor salary level was the cause of recruitment difficulties. There have been recent arbitration proceedings in relation to the salaries of public dental officers and the recommendation of the arbitrator should be available shortly.</P>
    <P>What is known as the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme, under which dentists in private practice treat eligible persons on behalf of the health boards was introduced in 1979 to supplement the service provided by the health board dentists.  About £1.5 million is now being spent each year on this scheme.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that prior to 1979 there was no <i>ad hoc</i> scheme at all and the dental service for all eligible persons had to be provided by the health board dental staff whose numbers were then considerably lower than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The orthodontic service for eligible persons is the most criticised area of the public dental service.  In nearly all health board areas there are long waiting lists for treatment.  This is due to the increased demand for orthodontic treatment in recent years coupled with the absence of qualified orthodontic staff in the health boards and the shortages of money for the engagement of orthodontists in private practice.  Also there is a problem in relation to complicated orthodontic treatments, involving the use of fixed appliances, which are carried out on behalf of the health boards by orthodontists in private practice.</P>
    <P>The Department have been endeavouring for a number of years to get agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of fees for this type of treatment and for more than three years only a few extremely urgent cases have been authorised to proceed.  Recently a scale of fees acceptable to both sides was arrived at but the orthodontists wanted assurances from the Department that the health boards would each make specific allocations of money annually for orthodontic services provided by the private <Col N="875" /> orthodontists.  The allocation of money for specific purposes is entirely a matter for the individual health boards, so the Department could not give the assurances sought by the orthodontists.  Discussions are continuing and I am hoping for an early settlement of the fees issue. One thing to be borne in mind is that when this matter is resolved the health boards will still have the problem of finding funds to enable them to avail of the services of private orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of five full-time consultant orthodontists should greatly improve the orthodontic service for eligible children.  Applications received for the five posts advertised in October 1983 are being processed at present by the Local Appointments Commission and it is expected that some appointments will be made soon.</P>
    <P>I feel it necessary to say a few words here about the greatly increased level of demand for orthodontic treatment.  A good deal of this is arising, it seems, from pressure from parents to have relatively minor defects or anomalies in the alignment of their children's teeth corrected. Most of these do not interfere with function, nor do they damage other structures in the mouth, and treatment is therefore sought for purely cosmetic effect.  One must seriously question this.  Could it be held, for instance, that on the medical side a public health service should meet the cost of the alteration of facial features of children which are not fully acceptable to their parents, such as the shape of a nose or the set of ears?  I think not.  I am having the question of the criteria which should apply before orthodontic treatment is undertaken examined with a view to issuing guidelines to health boards which will ensure that only real treatment needs are met.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that in the case of dental disease prevention is far more cost effective than treatment.  The fluoridation of water supplies, which was raised again this afternoon, has been proven to be an effective means of reducing the incidence of dental decay.  The maintenance of the correct level of fluoride in the water supplies is, therefore, of <Col N="876" /> paramount importance.  Traditionally the installation and replacement of fluoridation plant have been a charge on the revenue allocations of the health boards and the boards have been inclined in recent years to cut back in this area as a means of cutting their costs.  I am at present examining the possibility of funding fluoridation schemes from the Department's capital programme.</P>
    <P>During the years there have been many calls for the extension of eligibility for State-funded dental services.  The wives and other dependants of insured workers are groups for which there have been calls to extend eligibility.  It is easy to extend eligibility, but unfortunately it is not so easy to find the funds to provide an adequate service for those who are eligible.  The Joint Working Party on Dental Services which reported in 1979 recommended that those adolescents, those between the ages of 12 and 16 years, who do not have eligibility at present should be given priority if any extension of eligibility was being considered. The working party indicated, however, that no extension of eligibility should be contemplated until such time as there was an adequate service available for those who were already eligible.  I am afraid that the service available at present for eligible persons could not be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Lynch how many dentists are being trained in the country at present.  In the next few years a total of approximately 80 dentists will graduate each year from the Trinity College and UCC Dental Schools.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the poor dentist-population ratio in this country, and various figures for other countries were quoted.  First of all I would like to clarify one matter, and that is that there is no internationally recognised dentist-population ratio.</P>
    <P>The appropriate dentist/population ratio for any particular area would depend on the dental health status of the population, which would in turn depend on a number of factors such as whether water supplies are fluoridated, the type of diet followed and the level of oral hygiene practised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> In this country we could do with more dentists in the health board service, but it is doubtful if private practice could sustain any significant increase in the number of practitioners.  The shortage of dentists in the health board service is not due to any shortage of graduates from our dental schools.  It is due to the lack of finance and to the embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service.  Also, there are some locations in the country which, due to their comparative isolation, have always given rise to great difficulty in attracting dentists to take up full-time posts.  It was suggested that graduate dentists should be compelled to give a specified period of service to the health boards before being allowed to emigrate or to enter private practice. Although this may sound an attractive proposal it is not really practical.  The question would undoubtedly be asked as to why doctors, engineers, architects and members of other professions should not also be compelled to give a period of service to the State upon graduation.</P>
    <P>To get back to the general provisions of the Bill it has been suggested by a number of Senators that the INTO and indeed other teachers' organisations, should have representation on the Dental Council in view of the role they can play in encouraging preventive dental care in school children.  While I appreciate the valuable contribution teachers can make in this regard, representation on the Dental Council would not necessarily help. The Dental Council are, after all, primarily concerned with matters relating to the regulation of the dental profession, the education and training of dentists and the standard of dentistry, rather than with the delivery of dental services.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked if I would indicate to what extent graduate dentists are being attracted into the health board dental service through sponsorship, as recommended by the Joint Working Party on Dental Services.  As the Senator said, the North-Western Health Board have sponsored a number of student dentists in the past few years, though none is being sponsored at present.  Last year the board sponsored four and the year <Col N="878" /> before three students, all of them in their final year.  Sponsored students were paid £1,500 per year plus their course fees by the health board.  In return the students are committed to one year's work for the board for each year of sponsorship. Apart from this scheme, the restructuring of the health board dentist grades, which also followed on recommendations of the joint working party, provided for a new grade of dentist &mdash; clinical dental surgeon, grade I &mdash; which would be recruited from newly-graduated dentists who would not have had any work experience. Due to the general embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service it was not possible to recruit dentists to this grade since it would have involved an overall increase in staff numbers. Nevertheless, a number of graduates have been employed in this grade, notably by the Eastern Health Board, but they are occupying full-time posts, which, for one reason or another, are unfilled and they are not increasing the overall staffing level of the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge had a number of queries in relation to the provisions of specific sections of the Bill.  He mentioned that the reference in subsection 2 (e) of section 27, which deals with eligibility for registration, to a provision contained in the 1928 Act is the one blot on an otherwise excellently drafted Bill.  This reference, however, he points out makes it necessary for one to consult the 1928 Act in order to understand what is provided for under section 27.  The provisions in the Bill relating to eligibility for registration are the subject of detailed consultation with the Dental Board and I will probably have some suggestions to put forward on Committee Stage which could take care of the point made.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked why the council are not being required to produce an annual report as well as annual accounts. Normally annual reports are required of bodies, such as health boards, which are engaged in the delivery of particular services, and the annual reports serve as a measure of their performance during the year.  The functions of the Dental Council, on the other hand, are primarily regulatory and could be held not to warrant <Col N="879" /> this type of accountability.  I am not, nevertheless, opposed to the idea of annual reports and will consider this further on Committee Stage to meet the wishes of Senator Dooge in this regard.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised as to the power to be given to the Minister under section 15 to direct the Dental Council to discharge a function assigned to them under the Bill.  It was suggested that use of this power could mean that the council would lose their autonomy, particularly in relation to their discretionary powers.  While it would be possible for a Minister to issue a direction to the council compelling them to exercise a discretionary power, I cannot envisage a situation in which section 15 would be used for this purpose. The power is intended to enable the Minister to deal with the situation which could arise were the council to refuse to carry out a function which they were obliged to exercise under the Bill, and which should clearly be exercised in the public interest.  Such a situation could come about if the council were, for instance, to refuse to carry out the mandatory functions assigned to them in relation to &ldquo;fitness to practise&rdquo; under Part V of the Bill.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about the giving of such a power to the Minister in regard to this type of body.  Section 22 of the 1928 Act gave the Minister powers in relation to the Dental Board similar to those proposed in section 15 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that no Minister for Health has ever found it necessary to use the powers conferred on him by section 22 of the 1928 Act.  Other Acts give the Minister similar powers to direct the carrying out of functions by regulatory bodies. Examples are powers given under the Opticians Act, 1956 in relation to the Opticians Board and under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, in relation to the Medical Council.  In these cases, also, no Minister has had to invoke the powers.  I must emphasise that I would only consider doing so if a situation seriously affecting the public interest were to arise, and I am confident that any future Minister would do the same.  But because of the possibility that such a situation could <Col N="880" /> arise, however unlikely, it is necessary to take the power to deal with it.  I do not consider that it would be a practical proposition to make the exercise of the power by the Minister subject to annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It was asked whether, under Part IV of the Bill, consideration had been given to the establishment of internship for dental students before registration, as in the case of students of medicine.  I am aware that there are moves in this direction in Britain.  The new Dental Council will have responsibility for ensuring that the education and training of dentists, including practical knowledge and clinical experience, are adequate and suitable. The question as to whether internship is necessary, desirable or practicable in our circumstances will be one for the council to consider in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The need for the provisions relating to setting up of a register of dental specialists was questioned.  As I said on the introduction of the Bill these provisions do not compel the Dental Council to set up such a register but give them the facility to do so at some future date should this become necessary or desirable. While there is an EEC Directive concerning the mutual recognition of specialist qualifications there is no directive under which registration of specialists is required.  Some member states do already register their dental specialists and the tendency is for this practice to spread.  The whole question of the training of dental specialists is being considered at EEC level.  It would be only reasonable to expect that specialist registration may well become necessary in the future under the terms of a directive. In the circumstances it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to give the council an enabling power in this area.  There is also a public interest aspect to this matter.  Registration of persons in establishing specialties would be indicative of special qualification and would be of considerable interest to members of the public requiring specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked if there was any significance in the change of wording which in section 31 of the 1928 Act reads &ldquo;felony or misdemeanour&rdquo; and which in <Col N="881" /> section 42 of the new Bill reads &ldquo;an offence triable on indictment&rdquo;.  The change of wording, I am assured, has no significance other than to bring the legal wording into line with modern practice in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Senator inquired about the numbers of dental surgery assistants in the country and whether it is intended formally to recognise and register them as a class of auxiliary dental workers.  I do not have any accurate figure on the number of dental surgery assistants as many of them work in private practices.  Since they are normally employed on a one-to-one basis with practising dentists, I would expect, however, that the number is something in the region of 900.  The question of registration will be one for consideration by the new Dental Council in the first instance.  They will have to face the difficulty posed by the absence of a nationally recognisable qualification for the grade which could provide a basis for registration.  While our two dental schools operate training courses at the end of which a qualification is awarded, those with this qualification represent only a minority of dental surgery assistants.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked also what the present position is in relation to the training of dental mechanics, with which AnCO were involved, and what future developments ought to be expected in this area.  Again this will be something for the new Dental Council to tackle.  The trade of dental craftsperson is a designated trade within the meaning of the industrial training legislation, and as such the training of apprentices is the responsibility of AnCO.  The apprentice mechanics who complete the AnCO course do not sit any examinations nor do they receive any certificates or similar evidence of qualification.  It would not be possible to use this Bill as a vehicle to alter this situation.</P>
    <P>If a new class of dental auxiliary is established under the provisions of section 54 of the Bill with a standard of education and training that would make its members competent to supply dentures direct to the public, this would not affect the status of those who remain as <Col N="882" /> dental mechanics and do not choose to qualify for any higher duties.  The problem at present is that among those who have undergone training by AnCO some have attained a formal qualification but many have not.  There are quite a number with no formal qualifications or training whatsoever.  I would expect that the Dental Council would seek to develop proposals for necessary improvements in this unsatisfactory situation in conjunction with the other interests involved.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have asked for clarification of what is intended under sections 54, 55 and 56 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 54 empowers the council, with my consent, to make schemes for the establishment of certain classes of auxiliary dental workers.  These schemes can determine the qualifications required for membership of a particular class and the nature of the dental work a member of any class may undertake, as well as the circumstances in which any such work may be undertaken.  I think this section of the Bill is largely self-explanatory. Section 55 in effect sets out the parameters of the dental work that a dental auxiliary will be permitted to undertake. It provides that the limit to which an auxiliary dental worker will be permitted to go is the extraction of deciduous teeth, that is first or baby teeth, and that this work or the filling of teeth can only be done by an auxiliary when working for a health board or under the direction of a registered dentist.  This will prohibit the carrying out of this type of work in private practice.  Under section 54 (2) (b) of the Bill there is provision for determining the type of work any auxiliary may undertake and the circumstances in which it may be undertaken and this could, for instance, be used to specify that members of a particular class of auxiliary dental worker, such as hygienists, would work under the supervision of a registered dentist.</P>
    <P>It was again Senator Dooge who drew attention to the fact that the Joint Working Party on Dental Services were against the introduction of denturists in this country.  The working party report referred to the declining demand for dentures as more people tend to retain their <Col N="883" /> natural teeth.  However, I think it is necessary to take account also of the findings and recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission following their inquiry in 1982 into the supply of dentures. The Commission found that the existing legislation confining the right to supply dentures to the public to registered dentists constitutes a restrictive practice.  In making provision for the introduction of denturists, I am only providing for the implementation of one of two alternatives listed by the Restrictive Practices Commission in their report. The other alternative, some Senators will be aware, and the one that the commission recommended was that the supply of dentures to persons of 18 years of age or older be subject to no restrictions whatsoever. I have accepted that.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the general public and after prolonged discussion at Government level, the Government decided to opt for the establishment of fully-trained denturists rather than for the complete de-restriction of the supply of dentures.  The extent of the market for dentures in future years is something that those who would consider qualifying as denturists might be advised to take into account.</P>
    <P>Section 56 gives me the power to direct the Dental Council to exercise their functions in relation to the establishment of any particular class of auxiliary dental workers or to establish a particular class of dental auxiliary workers for a trial period so that its value to the public might be assessed.  While I think this section gives the Minister reserve powers that are necessary in the public interest I would not envisage the provisions of this particular section having to be invoked in the normal course.  I would expect that schemes to establish classes of auxiliary dental workers would be initiated by the Dental Council with my consent, as provided for under section 54.  I cannot be any more explicit than that on the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan queried my intentions in this regard, but I assure her that it is my intention that schemes for the establishment of classes of auxiliary dental <Col N="884" /> workers are introduced under the provisions of section 54.  That is perhaps the most contentious section.  It has been discussed at great length at Government.  I have received numerous representations regarding this whole matter and I have adopted at this stage a firm view in relation to these provisions.  Reference was made also to section 62 and it was suggested that a list of the statutory instruments made under the 1928 Act might be made available.  In fact no such instruments as such were made under the 1928 Act.  The provision in section 62 is a routine one in legislation of this type.  It seeks to ensure that any mention of the Dental Board set up under the Act of 1928, in any other existing Act or statutory instrument will be taken in future as referring to the Dental Council which will replace the board.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank all the Members of the Seanad for the exceptional attention given to this Bill and for the thorough way in which the Bill has been examined by them, as evidenced by the many relevant points made by the speakers.  I trust that my replies have served to clarify matters and, dare I say it, to pave the way for a speedy Committee Stage and an early passage of the Bill by this House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to extend from £15 million to £45 million the limit on the amount of borrowings by Irish Shipping Limited which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The enactment of this Bill is necessary in order to make provision for the probable financial needs of Irish Shipping Limited in the next two years.  The opportunity is being taken also to extend to Irish Shipping Limited certain statutory controls relating to remuneration, allowances for expenses and superannuation.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited were established in March 1941 to ensure the availability of vital supplies during the Second World War and, as Senators are aware, they did an excellent job in keeping our links with other countries open during a critical period.  Indeed I should like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great debt we owe to the heroic endeavours of Irish seamen, many of whom lost their lives serving their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to their deep-sea shipping operations, the company have over the <Col N="886" /> years diversified into other areas including insurance, car ferry services, property development, stevedoring, ship management services and other activities.  These ancillary activities have provided the company with a profitable cushion against losses incurred periodically in the very volatile deep-sea shipping business.</P>
    <P>The Irish Shipping Group have enjoyed 15 consecutive years of profit to 31 March 1982, but in the following year 1982-83 they incurred net losses of £14 million.  Losses on the deep-sea sector, which is the company's principal sphere of activity, amounted to £20.1 million offset to the extent of £6.1 million by profits on the sale of ships and from ancillary activities.  Further substantial losses of the order of £22 million are estimated in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 1984, just 11 days ago.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited are, therefore, in a very critical financial position, due primarily to the collapse of the world deep-sea freight market.  The tramp shipping market has always been subject to cyclical slumps.  Following the world oil crisis of 1973, uneconomic freight rates were a feature of the years 1975 to 1977. Rates improved in 1978 and this trend continued through to January 1981. Rates commenced to decline in February 1981 and later in the year the market disintegrated completely.  By December, 1982 average rates for a &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessel of 27,000 tons had fallen from $8/9,000 per day at the peak to about $3,700 a day and for a Panamax vessel of, say 65,000/70,000 tons from $18,000 per day to $3,500 per day.</P>
    <P>The catastrophic decline in freight rates is due basically to the world economic depression, resulting in a growing excess of shipping supply over demand. The market situation throughout 1982 and 1983 has been extremely difficult with world-wide heavy losses by shipowners, bankruptcies, debt rescheduling, deferred delivery of new vessels and increased laying-up of vessels.</P>
    <P>Even if the activities of Irish Shipping Limited had been confined to the operation of their wholly-owned fleet of four vessels totalling about 153,000 tons deadweight, the collapse of the freight market <Col N="887" /> would have posed serious problems for the company.  These problems have been seriously aggravated by the fact the the company had chartered-in nine vessels, foreign owned and with foreign crews, totalling 393,000 tons dead-weight to cater for expected increases in coal, steel and lumber shipments which never materialised. The vessels were chartered-in under separate agreements terminating on various dates from 1986 to 1990 and comprise four Panamax-type bulk carriers of from 59,000 to 64,000 tons dead-weight and five &ldquo;handisized&rdquo; vessels of from 27,000 to 32,000 tons deadweight.</P>
    <P>The decision of Irish Shipping Limited to enter into long-term charter agreements for nine vessels has proved disastrous. The agreements were entered into without the knowledge or consent of either the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Finance and were made on the assumption that market freight rates would be significantly higher than the fixed rates for which the ships were chartered. The company's expectations were not, however, realised.  What happened in practice is that the market collapsed, leaving Irish Shipping with nine vessels earning only a fraction of the cost of the company under the charter agreements.</P>
    <P>Since 1973, Irish Shipping Limited have been a partner with the Cardiff Shipowners, Reardon Smith Line, in an operating pool or consortium of vessels known as Celtic Bulk Carriers.  The creation of the pool enabled Celtic Bulk Carriers to quote for business which neither party alone would have had the capacity to handle.  Celtic Bulk Carriers were successful in obtaining substantial time-charter business for bulk cargoes, particularly steel &mdash; Europe to East Coast US &mdash; and timber &mdash; West Coast US to Europe &mdash; and before the world freight market collapsed was the biggest single operator in these two trades.  Unfortunately, the Reardon Smith Line have themselves run into financial problems. This has compounded the difficulties facing Irish Shipping Limited, because Reardon Smith are not at this time in a position to meet their share of the joint <Col N="888" /> commitments they had entered into with Irish Shipping under the Celtic Bulk Carriers pooling agreement.</P>
    <P>Faced, therefore, with an increasingly critical financial situation, Irish Shipping Limited recently entered into negotiations with the foreign owners of the nine chartered-in vessels with a view to seeking some reduction in the financial burdens of the long-term charters.  As a result of the negotiations significant concessions have been obtained from the owners concerned.  For obvious commercial reasons, the details cannot be disclosed, but I can say that they mean very substantial cash savings to Irish Shipping up to the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>It was part of the agreement with the largest shipowner concerned from whom the greatest concessions were obtained, that the company would purchase for $42 million two of the chartered-in vessels, the <i>Slaney Venture</i> a Panamax vessel of about 62,000 tons deadweight constructed in 1982 and the <i>Celtic Venture</i> a &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessel of about 32,000 tons constructed in 1983.  The company's position is such that they have little choice but to purchase the two vessels under long-term financing arrangements if their short-term financial commitments, which are at present extremely onerous, are to be reduced to tolerable levels.</P>

    <Title>Education Initiatives: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes and supports the recent initiatives taken in relation to education, in particular the publication of the Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 and the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Burke.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my name to this motion together with Senator Ulick Burke because it is a very important matter and because I hold the view that it is right that this House should give some time to discussing a matter of such great importance.  My only regret is that we are limited to a three hour discussion on the establishment of a Curriculum and Examinations Board and an Action Programme for Education.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her initiative in getting this work done after such a relatively short time in office.  The five people who already spoke on this matter, Senators Burke, Howlin, Mullooly, Higgins and Fallon welcomed the introduction of this action programme and the establishment of a Curriculum and Examinations Board.  I read their contributions this morning and each was well worth while.  It is a pity that more Senators will not have the opportunity to contribute although even those who did found themselves limited to time.</P>
      <P>It has been obvious for some time that changes in the curriculum are necessary and, because of the changes in technological advance and so on, it has become even more necessary.  For some years the transition from one level to another caused upset.  There was a difficulty in the transition from first level to second level and probably an even greater difficulty in the transition from second level to third level.  Careful planning of the curricula of the different levels should have resulted in a transition from first level to second level being as easy as a transition from fifth standard to sixth standard or from second standard to third standard.  A transition from leaving certificate level to third level &mdash; university or otherwise &mdash; should be as easy to accomplish as the transition from intermediate certificate level to leaving certificate level.  Failure rates at third level and the huge drop out numbers clearly indicate that these transitions present great problems.  That is a question that has been with us for some time and, regrettably, we did not solve it earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the world and technological advances mean there is an even greater <Col N="890" /> need for the examination of the school curriculum.  If it achieves no other purpose than that the Minister would be entitled to congratulations.</P>
    <P>I am sure members of the House will have read a statement in yesterday's evening papers and again in this morning's papers by the Chairman of AnCO when he said that many young people leave school today with few marketable skills or qualifications to show for their ten years in the educational system.  Many of them would not be accepted in most of AnCO's mainline training courses.  A number of 40,000 trained this year will get special training to bring them up to the levels needed for mainline training. The number leaving the system with few marketable skills present a problem to educationalists and trainees alike and calls for serious thought.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the Chairman of the FUE listed about 20 skills that were in short supply.  He went on to say that it became necessary for industrialists to recruit people from England where they had acquired these skills.  I hope it happens again that we can call on the services of emigrants who have acquired skills in England to help us develop our industries and businesses.  At the same time it is a reflection on us that we were not turning out people with skills to meet the requirements for the age we live in.</P>
    <P>In order to present a balanced view it would be wrong to maintain that this shortcoming was confined solely to us.  A couple of years ago I heard a former British Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, say on television that the educational system in Britain was not turning out young people with the qualifications which industrialists and business people needed.  He went on to say that he thought it was absolutely necessary &mdash; in the interests of the people and of maintaining a foremost place in industrial development &mdash; that the school curriculum should be altered in order to meet the challenges and needs of the time. Currently, the Minister for Education, Sir Keith Joseph, is engaged in the matter.</P>
    <P>Further afield I read quite recently that in the Soviet Union the late leader, Mr. <Col N="891" /> Andropov, decided that the education system was not turning out the type of young people able to meet the requirements of the present day industralist.  He ordered a changeover in the curriculum. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> today his successor, Mr. Chernenko, has decided to continue with the same policy.  It is a deficiency that is not confined to this country.  It is good to see a curriculum board set up which will give serious thought to these points</P>
    <P>It is true too that in the past we have had too much emphasis on academic subjects rather than on technical skills.  The ratio between academics and technicians is wrong compared with the ratio which exists in West Germany, Japan, the United States and other countries in the forefront of industrial development. Because we are on the perimeter of Europe and our shortage of raw materials, it is necessary for us to develop great skills.  We should model ourselves on the Swiss who some years ago realised that importation of heavy raw materials was out of the question if they were to be competitive.  They confined themselves to the importation of small amounts of raw materials that demanded great technical skills which led to the production of watches, barometers and so on.</P>
    <P>Some approaches which we adopted in the past, even in the academic line have been proved wrong.  We did not make a success of reviving Irish as the spoken language.  Part of the reason for that was an over-emphasis on the written language and an over-insistence on correctness of usage and so on.  If the approach had been to develop the spoken language first we would have made greater headway. However, we should learn from our mistakes and realise that it is necessary to get away from the approach of teaching living languages in the same way as dead languages are taught.  I know that there have been changes in that regard but the pace of change is not rapid enough.  I understand that the Minister's approach will be to speed up the changes and give more marks for proficiency in oral language rather than the written language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> The more haste she can make in that field, the better.</P>
    <P>Leaving certificate results in mathematics, physics and chemistry are disappointing as they will be essential subjects in the years ahead.  That is something to which the curriculum board will have to give attention.  I do not want to be overcritical of the system because it did a great deal of good too, but at a time of review and embarking on change it is right to draw attention to deficiencies in the past.  Our educational system does little or nothing to generate initiative. There is a tendency to develop memory and there is no scope for the promotion of initiative.  The greatest single contributor to the recovery taking place in the United States of America is due to the small industrialist not to the big international complex.  The man who left school with skill and initiative successfully set up small industries.</P>
    <P>We had a tendency, perhaps arising from our history and the difficulties that confronted our people in the past in earning a living and getting into a secure job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Probably for historical reasons and poverty we had a tendency to send the best brains in the country into secure jobs, like the Civil Service, banking, CIE and so on, when they should have been in fields which would provide greater challenge.  Now we find that much of the work these people do is being taken over by computers.  We will have to provide new channels for people's ability and this Curriculum and Examinations Board will help to achieve that.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Action in Education which is the subject of this debate identifies many problems and needs in our educational system but I am afraid it goes virtually no way in acting on them.  The cost implications of the programme are, of course, vital and I do not think they are realistically faced.</P>
      <P>The programme affords an opportunity to discuss our educational system and my remarks will be concerned in the main with university education where I work and which of course is discussed in the chapter on third level education.</P>
      <P>I share the view expressed in the programme that the greatest demand for increased places will arise in third level education in the coming decade.  It is a matter of fact that costs of third level are greater than either first or second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comparison of unit costs between the different levels will show of course that costs are greater in third level.  This is not surprising when we consider the objectives and requirements of the different levels although I want to say something quite specific about unit costs as they apply to university education.  Paragraph 6.3 of the programme says that it is recognised that the system must become more cost effective and that productivity must be improved.  I agree with this statement and higher education institutions should, of course, be publicly accountable.  However, the figure for unit cost of university education which are quoted from time to time seriously distort the picture.  In addition to teaching, universities provide research and community services, the costs of which should be subtracted before unit teaching costs are computed. Research, of course, is a vital part of university work which not alone preserves the quality of the courses being taught but, in addition, contributes directly to the benefit of the community. For example, existing products can be improved and produced at lower cost by using the most advanced research findings in technology with the obvious contribution to our competitiveness.  Furthermore, new products are developed through research with the potential to improve exports which are vital to our <Col N="894" /> small, open economy.  Research is also very relevant to policy-making.  Policy-makers, including public policy-makers, are too often constrained by short-term decision making and are forced to rely to a great extent on intuition.  The use of research is a cost-effective means of guiding and correcting decision-making and policy rather than the all too prevalent tendency to learn in the school of mistakes.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, due account should be taken of the value of university research in computing unit costs.  On the question of costs, the contribution of universities to community service is very relevant.  University personnel carry out applied research in, for example, engineering and agriculture.  They produce studies in economics and sociology for the State.  These community services, together with research <i>per se,</i> make a very significant contribution to Ireland's economic and social development and must be taken into account when university unit costs are being computed.</P>
    <P>On the question of national manpower projections which was raised in paragraph 6.1 of the programme, it must be noted that, unlike several other countries of the European Community who have to struggle with an ageing labour force becoming redundant, half of our population in Ireland is under 25 years of age. Our population is growing by one and a half per cent per year.  Within the next 20 years, it is likely that the EEC countries will be turning to Ireland for graduates. Any manpower planning, therefore, should take population trends in the EEC as a whole into account.  In the same European context, the Minister's personal commitment to the further development of modern languages in our schools is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I warmly support the view expressed in the programme that access to university education should be provided to all those who have the will and the ability to benefit from it.  A source of concern in this connection, however, is the low participation rate at third level by students from lower socio-economic groups.  The increases in fees in recent years from 13 per cent of total cost in 1979-80 to 17 per <Col N="895" /> cent in 1982-83 reduce even further the prospect for participation at third level by students from the lower socio-economic groups.  A means test obviously has a place in the grant system for universities but it is no substitute for an equitable taxation structure which, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the promise in the programme to provide third level education to all those who are willing and able to benefit from it, however, I feel that additional places should be made available in universities only if existing standards can be preserved.  It is most likely that additional resources, for example, more academic staff and extra library facilities, would be needed if additional university places were made available and academic standards were preserved at the same time.</P>
    <P>On the question of academic standards, extern examiners from the United Kingdom universities are the norm at Irish universities.  For example, the current extern examiner to my own Department of Industrial Relations in UCD is from Oxford University.  These United Kingdom examiners consistently confirm that we, in Ireland, maintain comparable standards with universities in the United Kingdom.  I hasten to point out however that Irish universities compared with UK universities cost very substantially less and have substantially poorer staff student ratios.  Irish universities, therefore, are providing far better value for money than their British counterparts.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.7 of the programme states that the academic year in third level is short.  What I now have to say about the staff load and calendar in UCD in connection with this very point should not in any way be construed as a defensive approach but rather as an objective description of the situation.  The staff annual calendar in UCD is organised as follows.  The first term runs from October to Christmas, the second term from January to Easter, then there is an Easter break for conferences and research.  The months of April and May constitute term three.  The months of June and September <Col N="896" /> are both devoted to examinations in most departments.  There is a holiday period in the months of July and August but these months provide the opportunity to engage in research which is vital to the university.  As I have said, in most Departments the months of June and September are taken up with the marking of scripts, and the marking of dissertations for honours and repeat examinations.</P>
    <P>Board meetings are a requirement in university life.  This year in UCD, for example, the boards will not be completed until 11 July.  Many staff, furthermore, are involved during July in marking the matriculation examination. University staff conduct research which is vital to the function of the university and which contributes in a very significant way to our economic and social development in Ireland.  For example the report of the President of UCD for the year 1981-82 shows that 571 papers were published.  This is, of course, an impressive research output by any standards.</P>
    <P>In concluding these points about the staff load and calendar, I hope that due account will be taken of the load factor and the constraints that prevail on university staff.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to a few aspects of primary education.  Clearly the key to improving primary education, especially for the disadvantaged, is a substantial improvement in the teacher pupil ratio.  There are 70,000 primary pupils in classes of 40 or over, and 75 per cent of all primary pupils are in classes of 30 to 44.  While the programme states that the funding of national schools will be a major priority of the Minister and the Government, I find it very disappointing that the tackling of the poor pupil teacher ratio is not seen as a major priority.  I would also urge that a mandatory upper limit be placed on class size.</P>
    <P>The programme correctly points out that it is at age eight or nine that the problems of those pupils who fall behind the normal level of development in respect of literacy and numeracy should be identified.  It is at that stage that remedial action should be taken.  Remedial teachers are obviously required.  There <Col N="897" /> is, however, no formal psychological service for primary schools.  Surely such a service would be of great assistance in identifying problems at this early, critical stage.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the question of in-service training which gets considerable attention in the programme. Clearly in-service training courses for teachers are of crucial importance in a period of rapid social change such as we have been experiencing for many years past.  Casual summer in-service courses are quite inadequate. The present in-service arrangements are of the hit and miss variety.  It seems to be bordering on the crazy to have teachers 15, 20 and 25 years trained, who have never had in-service training and therefore have never had any real opportunity to get on top of the new curriculum or to formally develop the range of skills so necessary today.  The costs are substantial if in-service programmes are to be conducted properly. Teacher release is necessary and, therefore, replacement teachers are necessary. This will cost money but it will be money well spent.  I would like to know if it is the Minister's intention to provide funds for replacement teachers, especially school principals, who play such a vital role in our primary schools?  I would point out that capital cost does not really arise, because there is scope in the colleges of education at present to provide in-service training without any capital outlay in new buildings and so forth.</P>
    <P>My last point on primary education relates to educational broadcasting.  The Educational Broadcasting Committee, which presented a copy of their report to the Minister for Education in March 1983 concluded unanimously that educational broadcasting had enormous potential for enhancing the scope and the effectiveness of Irish education.  The report also concluded that even in difficult economic times &mdash; we have such times at present &mdash; money spent on educational broadcasting was a cost effective investment in the context of the educational budget as a whole.  About half a million children are in primary schools and a further half million are in full-time education.  My <Col N="898" /> information is that for as little as £5 million, which is a tiny sum in the context of the total educational budget, an educational broadcasting programme could be set up.  It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the value of the impact of radio and, in particular, television.  Could I ask the Minister what her attitude is now to investment in broadcasting education?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue in relation to Senator Ulick Burke's contribution last week.  I regret that Senator Burke used the privilege of the House to denigrate a fellow member of his own union.  This person was very careful to wait until her term of office was completed before expressing her political interests.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion which welcomes the recent initiatives in education, that is, the Programme for Action and the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  It is very important that this House should debate these initiatives and developments.  All of those who are involved in our education system will find themselves involved in a national debate on education, because a great deal of interest has been stimulated and generated by the publication of the four year plan and by the setting up of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
      <P>It is a good idea that education, and all of those involved in it, should be debated publicly and with vigour over the next year or two.  For far too long education has been a victim of <i>ad hoc</i> decision making and stop start policy making.  At last we have something cogent and progressive and a clearly charted action plan for education which the Minister stated can and will be acted upon in the next four years.  It is significant, and it must be noted that the plan represents the culmination of much work and a great deal of consultation.  It has been welcomed by various educational bodies in this country and it has generated and will continue to generate much debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is so much in the plan and there is so much to say about so many diverse elements which affect education that those of us who have the opportunity of <Col N="899" /> speaking on this find ourselves somewhat constrained, because each item in the programme represents enough material for an entire debate in itself.  I propose, in my small contribution, to make a few observations on certain aspects of the programme which need highlighting and which have a particular interest for me.</P>
    <P>When the new curriculum was introduced for primary schools it was a great pity that it was not possible at the same time to introduce a new curriculum for secondary schools.  The new curriculum for the primary schools did its own thing very well.  The fact that it had been introduced and taken root in the primary school system gives us an opportunity to examine how it fared and how teachers coped with it.  Some teachers, many of whom are still in service, found it difficult. Nobody likes change.  Some of us find it very difficult to adapt to it.  Some of these teachers probably found the changes unacceptable and extremely difficult to cope with.  Most of them demonstrated good-will and enthusiasm and made the necessary adaptations.</P>
    <P>It is true that most of our children in primary schools are happy and enjoy the new curriculum.  That is important.  Children should be happy in school and happy in a learning situation, and we do not stress that often enough.  Learning and the whole process of education should be a joyous experience for children.  Children are now more inquiring and more worldlywise.  Sometimes they are a little too much so for their parents, which is a cause for anxiety.  It is true to say that children's horizons have widened.</P>
    <P>There is a caution here.  It is important to make the point that in the vast majority of our primary schools the three Rs, the very basis for education, have in some way been neglected.  Recent surveys show that two-thirds of children going into our secondary school curriculum read poorly, write badly and their spelling is very often deplorable.  One interesting statistic has emerged for me.  I am privileged to be a member of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown, and that has received up to 500 submissions from the general public.  I am perhaps a bit of a pedant in the area of spelling, but I <Col N="900" /> have noticed that over and over again two words are constantly misspelled by the Irish public.  One is &ldquo;marital&rdquo; which tends to emerge over and over again as &ldquo;martial&rdquo;, which may or may not be a Freudian slip.  The other is &ldquo;separate&rdquo; and &ldquo;separated&rdquo;.  A lot of people do not seem to be able to cope with either of those two words.  It is intriguing, and it is a little sideline, but it is indicative of the fact that spelling in Ireland badly needs a good shake up.  Sentence construction has also suffered.  The old disciplines of Latin and Greek, which had a great deal to recommend them in this area, in making people aware of sentence construction, have disappeared and nothing seems to have taken their place.</P>
    <P>In our secondary school system our pupils are feeling a sense of despair because the depression, the micro-chip and the technology, which makes employment more daunting and challenging, give the impression to young people that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  We are faced with overcoming this feeling of despondency which is in the air.</P>
    <P>Second level education is the beginning of a new system instead of the continuation of the primary systems.  It is a great pity that there is not a smooth transition between primary and second level systems. This has been referred to by Senator O'Brien.  A gradual transition is essential between primary and secondary but of course this is only effective if the primary system is sufficient and good.  I feel a deep look at the primary system of education is essential.</P>
    <P>It interests me that industry will be harnassed in our second school system. A feature of the four year plan which I welcome recognises the need to encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship.  This has been frowned upon in the past by classical educators.  I feel that the spirit of entrepreneurship has been depressed in our school system.  Ireland has produced very few entrepreneurs, and those who have been produced have been extremely good and extremely talented. There are a lot of would-be entrepreneurs in our second level and third level systems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Perhaps the traditional teacher is not the best person to spot the budding entrepreneur and to give that person the necessary encouragement.  Ireland needs these people as it never needed them before.  Our future in great part depends on them.  We have frowned on them in the past and we have failed them.  We should have an open mind on this, and we should expose this talent to leading business people while our pupils are in school.  The youngster of independent mind has ample opportunities in literature, the Arts and creativity.  I say give the potential entrepreneur the same opportunity in the classroom.  I welcome links between industry and school and all that that means in terms of contact and in terms of stimulating children.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Department of Education in this programme will take action on the proposals contained in Bord na Gaeilge's plan gniomhaíochta don Gaeilge, that a task force will be set up to identify areas for action in relation to the teaching of Irish.  Ten years ago a Coalition Government abolished the need to pass Irish to obtain a pass in the leaving certificate.  This also applied to the intermediate certificate.  That was a brave step and it was welcomed at the time.  We must ask ourselves has the language benefited as a result?  Do more people speak it?  Do more pupils enjoy learning it?  I am not so sure that the answer to those questions is `yes'.</P>
    <P>Who is to blame and how can the damage be repaired?  The percentage number of our pupils who actually sit in the Irish class but do not take the examination, particularly in leaving certificate, continues to grow.  I am not so sure that we are being honest in continuing with this system.  It is interesting to note that the Shannon curriculum development has taken a very brave step in this area.  It has developed a very realistic programme in relation to Irish for remedial pupils in 16 first year post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Shannon curriculum development programme is on the spoken word.  The teachers and the pupils participating in it are, I believe, very happy with the course.  I have been told <Col N="902" /> by those who have been fortunate enough to observe this that it is a delight to see pupils hurrying enthusiastically to Irish classes and enjoying their work.  That is a far cry from what I experienced, both as a teacher and as a pupil.  There is a message here.  We must not overlook it. I hope, if this pilot scheme at the end of the day is deemed successful, that it will not be abandoned as has happened in other successful pilot schemes.  It makes those who have taken part in them lose heart.  I feel at the end of the day it is to the detriment of the language or whatever the pilot scheme has been set up to examine.</P>
    <P>Something I found lacking in the programme, which is something I feel quite strongly about, is any reference to inter-denominational education.  There may have been a small reference to it but I looked through it, and perhaps my eye did not light on it.  I feel, of course, that inter-denominational education is an ideal.  Perhaps it is more appropriate to the North of Ireland where the two communities are numerically more equal.  We need it in this country, north and south, to dispel ignorance and prejudice.  We have to be carefully taught to hate, and I feel we cannot soon enough get going on the business of bringing together people of all faiths and beliefs.</P>
    <P>In many ways, because of our numerical imbalance in the Republic, to talk of inter-denominational education can very often be a pious platitude because the school-going population is probably about 2 to 3 per cent.  It may be attractive in a few selected schools where a reasonable balance can be struck, but to talk of it in national terms is perhaps to do a great disservice to a dwindling minority where two out of every three marriages are already inter-church and where, sadly, the <i>ne temere</i> decree and all that that implies still remains.  A few middle upper schools of Protestant tradition attract a fairly large percentage of Roman Catholic pupils but the reverse is not true. It is a great pity that many of our established Roman Catholic schools are not attracting Church of Ireland pupils.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the Republic has been very generous to its minorities.  To <Col N="903" /> continue to treat children of the nation equally, the minorities in Ireland need special consideration.  I know that the Minister is very aware of this and that in the past she has been an enthusiastic supporter and, indeed, continues to be so, of the Dalkey and Bray school projects and indeed of a similar type project which I understand is active on the northside of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I will leave that then and make a brief comment on the disadvantaged, which have been referred to in the action programme for education.  I am very pleased to note that special resources will be made available for those national schools which cater for socially and economically disadvantaged children and that priority will be given in the area of allocation of additional teaching posts for these children, which I think will take care of some of the anxieties expressed by Senator Hillery in his contribution.  Up to now pupils from the lower socio-economic groups have benefited much less than pupils from other groups, and strategies must be devised to rectify this imbalance.</P>
    <P>I could not let my time for speaking pass without making reference to what have been called &ldquo;the new poor&rdquo; in educational terms.  These are very often the middle income earners, especially the PAYE sector who are not eligible for any grants and do not live in a centre of third level education.  I can quote a specific example of a family with three children. The eldest child has just completed university and the two younger ones are presently in university at a total cost of £7,500 per annum.  Surely there is a case for some tax allowance against their education, taking into account the enormous expenditure which the PAYE earner &mdash; the father of this family &mdash; must bear.  I know that third level education is very heavily subsidised, and I appreciate all that as do parents of third level students, but there must be a case for alleviating the burden or in any event allowing a system of deferred payment which would extend the burden and stretch it over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by once more welcoming the plan.  It does not surprise me that <Col N="904" /> our Minister has produced in a relatively short space of time a plan which is cogent, which is a plan for action, and I think we are going to see action.  It is realistic in that it refers to the fact that these are only possible if the resources are there to enable them to be achieved.  I welcome that kind of realism.  I welcome the plan and I look forward to its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. G. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Seanad has had the opportunity to debate the recent initiatives which have been taken in education.  It has been one of the major objectives of my policies that there should be widespread debate among interested parties with regard to educational development.  It is thus most appropriate that this House should participate in this debate.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House refers both to the publication of the Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 and to the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  These two items are, of course, directly related to one another.  The need for major curriculum reform is recognised as one of the central issues addressed in the action programme. I am glad to see the general welcome which these initiatives have received in this House and I have noted carefully the different points which have been made in the course of the debate so far.  I am very grateful to all the Senators who have contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action programme does not purport to be a statement of educational philosophy.  It recognises, however, the importance of the educational system as a means for the transmission of a system of values.  Although it is not a philosophical treatise as such many important issues of principle are raised in the programme and there is general support for the maintenance of the key traditions which are inherent in the system. Through the general promotion of what may be termed the pastoral side of education, and through the strong emphasis on the need for education to be a broad preparation for life, the importance of these traditions and of the underlying value system is implicit in many of the <Col N="905" /> proposals.  The educational system has an essential role in fostering virtues such as honesty, integrity, tolerance, justice and love.  The desire of the vast majority of our people that the education system will reflect a rich Christian ethos is fully respected in the programme.  It was felt that these matters would be generally understood and, therefore, it was not necessary to have them spelled out explicitly.</P>
    <P>The first of the programme's principles states that:</P>
    <P>The education system should, as far as possible, enable all citizens to have access to an education which is relevant to their needs and which will assist them in seeking to fulfil the potential of their abilities and talents.</P>
    <P>This principle recognises the unique worth of each individual and seeks to ensure that talent is fostered to the greatest possible degree.  It also implies that stumbling blocks which may stand in the way of participation in education must be removed.  Furthermore it raises the issue that access to education alone is not what is required.  Rather there must be a serious questioning of the relevance of educational courses which are on offer.</P>
    <P>Over recent years the very face and character of education has changed. Thankfully, education is no longer seen as the preserve of the privileged but the right of all.  If I may digress for a moment I should like to mention one of the references made by Senator Hillery to third level education where he discussed the rise in fees in recent years and concluded that this would lead to fewer people from the lower socio-economic background going to university.  It is necessary to point out that 35 per cent of all students in third level education have their fees paid by the State and any increase in fees for those who are getting grants or scholarships is paid automatically by the State so that a fee increase does not affect them.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that it is a general experience in European countries that despite very high levels of grants in some other European countries there remains the problem of the lower socio-economic <Col N="906" /> groups not participating at third level.  I believe that one of the problems there is inherent in the experience of the disadvantaged child at primary level.</P>
    <P>Ideally we want all our children to have the opportunity of staying within the educational system for as long as it is useful and meaningful for them to do so. For those who for one reason or another are forced to or choose to drop out early we want to have the opportunity of `second-chance' access at a later stage in their lives.  Aspirations to achieve equality of opportunity in education can only be realised where there is positive discrimination in favour of those who are disadvantaged or for whom access to education is difficult.</P>
    <P>The principle of special aid for the disadvantaged features prominently among the pillars of the action programme. I am pleased to note that so many speakers have already referred to this point of the plan.  Senator Howlin last week emphasised how important it is that this should be picked out for special emphasis.  I am afraid I cannot accept Senator Fallon's contention that our actions do not bear out our commitment to the disadvantaged.  In our estimates this year we have made specific provision for primary education in disadvantaged areas and through decisions we took in modifying the Fianna Fáil expenditure cuts which they planned for 1983 we demonstrated this commitment quite clearly. The fact is that we have proved our commitments and the actions we have taken stand in stark contrast to the lack of commitment shown by Senator Fallon's party when in Government.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, as a recent research study has confirmed, that educational disadvantage occurs in the earliest years at school and, therefore, it is at this point that major interventions must be made. Emphasis must be placed on laying firm foundations in the primary school in basic skills of language, literacy and numeracy.</P>
    <P>Problems must be detected in time and appropriate remedial action taken as necessary. This is, therefore, the approach adopted in the programme as far as the establishment of priorities is concerned. This is why it is recognised that primary <Col N="907" /> education and, particularly, the crucial early years, must receive special attention.</P>
    <P>Educational disadvantage is not, of course, an isolated thing.  It is related to social and economic disadvantage.  It must, therefore, be recognised that although education has a role to play, its work must be complemented by other agencies &mdash; those coming under other Departments such as Health, Social Welfare and Labour, for instance.</P>
    <P>Some communities have very particular difficulties to overcome, especially those in the major urban centres with high rates of unemployment and other social problems.  A fund of £500,000 has been created this year to provide special help for schools and in aid of the services which they provide for children in such areas.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that this programme should be extended as quickly as circumstances allow, and I accept the fact mentioned by Senators Howlin, Mullooly, and Fallon that disadvantaged pupils can be found in all parts of the country.  However, as a first step we will make interventions in the major urban centres in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The second principle of the action programme states:</P>
    <P>Education should be continuously updated to make it relevant to the modern world, to developments in technology, to changing employment opportunities and patterns as well as to increased leisure time.</P>
    <P>This principle poses a major challenge to all involved in education.  It stresses the need to adapt our educational programmes to ensure their relevance to an age of technology and to rapidly changing life styles and employment patterns. There are, of course, major implications here for the work of the Curriculum and Examinations Board, about which I will have more to say later.</P>
    <P>There have been in recent times changes in approach to education and training adopted at EEC level, where as an expression of the social guarantee provisions, a new emphasis is being given to <Col N="908" /> the 15-18 year old age group.  The action programme indicates that proposals for new senior cycle courses are being presented for European Social Fund support which would give expression to the emphasis on courses linking the school more closely with the world of work, a concern which has been expressed by various Senators including Senator Bulbulia.</P>
    <P>At third level, too, it is necessary to promote the development of technical and technological education.  This will be crucial to our economic and industrial development and to increasing opportunities for our young people to gain employment. The programme also stresses the importance of links between education and industry, This is obvious in areas such as science and technology, but it is also important from the point of view of marketing Irish products abroad that the whole position of art and design education be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Mention of third-level education brings me to one of the most complex and challenging areas of all: indeed the contribution of Senator Hillery illustrates some of those complexities and challenges. The scale of expansion in second-level education, which we witnessed throughout the seventies, has yet to make its full impact at third level.  We can anticipate a very great increase in demand for third level places between now and the end of the decade.  All of us who are Members of the Oireachtas, as indeed society at large, must face up to the major problems which this situation poses.  We are talking of an area where the recurrent cost per student to the State is estimated to be of the order of £3,000 per annum.  Thus, any expansion has major implications in cost terms.  Yet it has been estimated that numbers could increase by 20,000 by the end of the decade, as mentioned by Senator Burke.</P>
    <P>The action programme puts on record the Government's commitment to provide third level education for as many young people as possible.  This is extremely important both from the point of view of the benefit to the community generally and also for the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>The extent of what is possible will be <Col N="909" /> affected in large measure by the degree to which those engaged in third level education can find ways of increasing the throughput of students in existing facilities. I was glad to note Senator Howlin's comments in this regard.  I would like to assure Senator Hillery that the research cost element and other factors which he mentioned will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This new look at third level may mean taking a radical look at some of the practices at present operated and demonstrating a willingness to be flexible in considering alternatives.  For instance, the action programme suggests considering using third level facilities for four terms in each year.  It has been suggested that one group of students might attend for one full term per year and supplement this by a combination of distance education and attendance for specific short-term periods throughout the year.  I do not think that sort of idea is in conflict with what Senator Hillery was discussing.</P>
    <P>Other suggestions in the action programme for meeting accommodation needs relate to various rationalisation proposals to achieve greater cost effectiveness. Such measures will be essential if the numbers are to be provided for, which provision will only be feasible if it can be achieved at less than full incremental cost.  The scale of the problem can be appreciated when one realises that a capital programme to provide 20,000 additional places would cost in the region of £240 million at current price levels.</P>
    <P>Clearly expenditure of this order is not feasible in present circumstances and thus there is is an onus on us all to face the alternatives of a restriction in numbers entering third level education or a means of achieving an increase in the use of existing facilities.  This is the stark choice and one which must be faced up to.  It is not a matter for me alone to decide.  This is why it is particularly important that the debate be conducted on a wide plane.  It must also be emphasised that we must be just as concerned about the qualitative aspects of education as about the quantitative.</P>
    <P>Our situation of having such a young population makes us unique in Europe. We must not think of this situation as a <Col N="910" /> problem although the financial implications pose difficulties.  We should welcome the promise that it offers for the future and do all in our power to make our education system successful and relevant.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned two of the fundamental principles which underpin the programme for action.  I would now like briefly to refer to a third.  The programme states:</P>
    <P>Responsibility and authority should be delegated as far as feasible, subject to necessary controls, with a view to achieving a full partnership between all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>This principle is important because of its emphasis on partnership.  In education we must always work to achieve consensus and the maximum degree of collaboration between the various agencies. There can be no place for a narrow protectionism of vested or sectional interests. There is a complex history of different school structures which have grown up over the years.  In this lies one of the great virtues of our system &mdash; the richness of diversity.</P>
    <P>The programme seeks to foster the harmonious and complementary development of the various school systems.  This was emphasised by Senator Howlin.  The aim is to draw on the best of experience from each.  We do not aim to make all our schools the same any more than we want our children all to be the same. However, we must nurture trust and collaboration.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important to give parents a full part in the formulation of policy. We must pay more than lip service to the constitutional guarantees of the primacy of the parents' role in the education of their children.  There need be no conflict between the professional role of the teacher and the special role of the parent.  They must combine for the ultimate benefit of the children.  The proposal to facilitate the establishment of a parents' council is significant in that it aims to give a forum through which the voice of parents may be heard.  Although there are some parent organisations already in existence, they each represent <Col N="911" /> only a minority of parents.  I am anxious that the new council to be established will represent parents as a whole.</P>
    <P>The principle of delegated authority must go wider than just to give a greater role to parents, important as that is.  A study will be undertaken of the extent to which decision-making can be delegated to the lowest institutional level at which it can be exercised effectively.  Such delegation must of course be counterbalanced by appropriate procedures to ensure accountability.</P>
    <P>Anyone concerned to improve the equality of education must look to the question of the professional development of teachers.  This can be achieved in various ways.  Principally, there is the very important matter of pre-service and in-service training.  I consider that in the past there has been insufficient attention given to these aspects in educational policy making.  However, any successful curriculum development or progressive change in schools will depend in large measure on the extent and quality of in-service training.  In 1984, despite the major constraints on expenditure it has been possible to increase spending on in-service education by more than 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is also recognised that practising teachers will benefit professionally from sharing more fully in the responsibilities of school management.  To this end, the programme proposes a review of the system of posts of responsibility in schools. It also proposes that teacher representation be included on boards of management of comprehensive schools and in the membership of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Another important dimension of enhancing the professional standing of teachers is seen in the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  One of the major aims in setting up the board is to allow a greater flexibility to teachers and schools in determining curricula which will be relevant to the needs of children.  Teachers feature prominently in the board's membership and in the membership of the various committees which the board have set up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> I cannot accept Senator Mullooly's comments regarding the membership of the three sub-committees which the board have so far established.  While the choice of members is a matter for the board, I am satisfied that they fully recognise the importance of having teachers prominently involved in their work.</P>
    <P>An important debate was conducted in this House in November 1981 when Deputy John Boland, then Minister for Education, made a major speech suggesting the establishment of such a board. The dream became a reality in January last when 19 members of the board held their first meeting.  The board have now embarked vigorously and enthusiastically on their work and are undertaking a major review of curricula and assessment systems.  It spans both primary and post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see such a wide degree of interest expressed in what the board are doing.  Senator Burke and Senator Higgins in particular have addressed the subject in detail.  Although Senator Mullooly and Senator Fallon have expressed anxieties about aspects of the board's operation I am glad that they, too, welcome their establishment in principle.</P>
    <P>The members of the board have been appointed in their personal capacity and were selected on the basis of representation of a broad range of educational interests and expertise.</P>
    <P>I have just announced a list of what are to be known as &ldquo;designated bodies&rdquo; who will work in close association with the board.  Such bodies will be in a position to make a valuable input into the board's work.  They will have a right of access to the board and will be consulted by the board on all major proposals which are being considered.</P>
    <P>The recommendations which come from the board will of course be subject to the approval of the Minister for Education. However, it is intended that the board will have the greatest possible degree of operational freedom and be subject only to the ultimate authority of the Minister and Oireachtas.  The Department of Education are represented on the board by two &ldquo;advisers&rdquo;, who participate fully in the work of the <Col N="913" /> board but do not have voting rights.  The aim is to ensure that there is good communication between the board and my Department.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the board, now established on an interim basis, will be set up statutorily in approximately two years time.  Following that time the statutory board will assume responsibility for the operation of the State examinations at present conducted by the Department of Education's examinations branch.  I can assure Senator Fallon that the staff of the examinations branch in Athlone need have no anxieties about their future working with the board and that they will be fully consulted about all developments.</P>
    <P>In establishing the board one of the major aims in the long-term is to free the inspectorate from having to spend such a large proportion of their time on examination work.  In this way inspectors will be enabled to spend more time in schools, acting as advisers to teachers and monitors of standards generally.  They will also be able to provide information for the Curriculum and Examinations Board about what is actually going on at school level and in relation to the evaluation of curricular projects.</P>
    <P>One important aspect of the Curriculum and Examinations Board's work is that the board will work in close association with other agencies such as curriculum development centres, the educational research centre at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the university departments of education and the colleges of education.  The aim is to complement the work of these agencies and not to duplicate it.  In this way the board can play an important co-ordinating role in education.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board have been given terms of reference which assign to them tasks of fundamental significance.  In particular they have been asked to devise a new unified assessment system for the junior cycle to replace the present group and intermediate certificate examinations.  They have been asked also to examine the role of the leaving certificate as a measure of general education with a view to broadening <Col N="914" /> the range of skills and qualities measured.  In this latter connection they will also consider the desirability and feasibility of introducing a national matriculation examination separate from the leaving certificate, to be used as the principal selection instrument for entry to third level degree courses.</P>
    <P>A further part of the board's brief is to formulate proposals for alternative senior-cycle programmes, including programmes geared to preparation for work and those incorporating work experience and/or work simulation.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from these assignments that the board have a serious, urgent and major job to do of a very fundamental nature.  Over the years there has been much background work carried out relating to new curricula, and major reports have appeared on the need for reform in assessment procedures.  The board can now draw on this wealth of experience and ideas.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Burke, Senator Howlin and Senator Higgins that the points they made concerning the limitations of existing examination systems will be very much to the fore in the board's deliberations.  The board will also consider the experience that can be drawn from programmes such as the transition year to which Senator Burke referred and, indeed, other Senators, including Senator O'Brien.</P>
    <P>In considering their major tasks the board have been asked to take special account of several important issues, and I would like to refer briefly to some of them.  Perhaps the overriding one is the need to ensure that school curricula make adequate provision for the personal development of the individual student.  I fully agree with what Senator Higgins had to say about this.  Whatever other goals we set ourselves, we must never lose sight of this one.  We must tap all the talents and draw out hidden strengths and gifts.  Any educational system which seeks to achieve mere conformity among its students will fail most seriously to meet the terms of these criteria.</P>
    <P>Another important issue, as recognised by Senator Mullooly, is the need to achieve curricular continuity and harmony <Col N="915" /> between the first and second levels. There can be major problems here.  The full potential of the primary curriculum cannot be realised if it does not dovetail neatly with the work of the early years in the post-primary school.  The board, whose membership includes representatives of both the primary and post-primary sectors, is in a good position to look at this problem and to take account of the findings of a special committee which examined this matter a few years ago.</P>
    <P>A further item urges the board to consider:</P>
    <P>...the importance of combining the transmission of received values with the development of a capacity for critical thought on the part of students and within this context, the importance for young people of acquiring a critical understanding of the political, social and economic system.</P>
    <P>We want our young people to understand and be able to play a full part in the democratic processes of this country. They should see democracy at work in schools and, in the course of their schooling, be made fully aware of the political and social institutions which will play such an important part in their lives.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of sexism and sex-stereotyping in education and the steps which need to be taken to eliminate this.  The board have been particularly asked to take account of the findings of the Hannon Report and of the recommendations of the Employment Equality Agency in this regard.  This was referred to by Senator Higgins.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the need to ensure that through the school curriculum the highest educational standards and the pursuit of excellence are encouraged.  Contrary to what is sometimes feared, curriculum development should not lower but rather raise standards generally.  The value of study and learning in their own right is even more important today than ever before and must feature prominently in any curricular proposals.</P>
    <P>The board's assignment offers to the whole educational system an opportunity to take major steps forward in educational <Col N="916" /> progress.  I believe that, if the job is properly and thoroughly done, the outcome will be greatly to the advantage of our young people.  There is a widespread feeling abroad that for too many of our children the courses today are no longer relevant and need substantial revision.</P>
    <P>This is not to discard or ignore the traditions and successes of the past.  Here again we must retain all that is best from those traditions, but we must recognise that life in Ireland has changed dramatically over the last two decades and that our education system must reflect this. We are glad that education is highly valued and sought after by increasing numbers of young people.  We must respond to this challenge and ensure that our system, our structures and our programmes are truly appropriate to the needs of Ireland in the eighties and also to the subsequent decade which will bring us up to the threshold of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It is vital, therefore, that we review our educational system with these needs in mind, recognising that the decisions we make now must not only meet today's needs but anticipate those of tomorrow and beyond.  I believe that with our Curriculum and Examinations Board in place and with our Action Programme setting out our priorities for progress, we are extremely well placed to meet these challenges. While I hold this office as Minister for Education I have a particular role to play.  The success of these ventures depends, however, in large measure on the extent to which others respond to what is now being done.  I am confident that, with the extensive range of talent available, Irish education and all our children will surely benefit from the initiatives which we have taken and will continue to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take less than five minutes.  I will leave out a number of matters I was going to mention.  On the <Col N="917" /> major references to the elimination of sexism in the Minister's programme, there is a need &mdash; and I do not know how you can do it within the employment equality legislation &mdash; to preserve some sort of balance of the sexes among the teachers in the primary schools sector, in that we are liable to shift from an overwhelmingly male national school system to an overwhelmingly female one.  In the whole emphasis on sexism there is a considerable need to look at the manner of teaching in boys' secondary schools, the values inculcated in male secondary schools, and how they inculate a sexist approach which is nearly as objectionable as many of the categorisations of women which are usually referred to when people talk about sexism in education.  I suggest to the Minister that, when we are talking, quite rightly, about eliminating sexism from educational work, we should look at this problem not just from the point of view of women but also from the point of view of the pretty painful sex stereotypes given to men.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made so much reference to under-privileged children in the document.  While she has given a commitment, we are entitled to withhold our final approval until we see the scale of that commitment over a period of years.  It would be wrong of me to be critical at this stage.  There is a commitment there which was not there before, and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>In regard to primary education in particular, there will have to be more than just resources.  The whole fundamental question of the sort of curriculum used in primary schools where there is a high concentration of young people will have to be looked at in very pragmatic and practical terms.  We are talking about trying to give children, who will otherwise leave the system functionally illiterate, basic literacy and basic skills which are relevant to the society in which they will grow up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may sound almost pessimistic on my part, but we have to consider where these children live, what they go through, the sort of social environment they come from, and the social background they come from, and devise a curriculum in <Col N="918" /> which the text-books relate to the environment they come from and does not relate to the average middle class home where daddy goes out to work in his car and probably, as most text-books suggest works in an office, or else works on a farm.  We should talk about it in terms of their cultural environment.  Otherwise the whole educational process will be irrelevant.  This is very important &mdash; not just resources, but also a whole re-assessment of the fact that there is more than one culture existing in this country.  That would make an enormous difference.</P>
    <P>On special education I should like to draw one thing to the Minister's attention. I heard some suggestions that a number of vocational schools which deal in particular with travellers have an extremely high proportion of part-time teachers.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that this is not satisfactory and is not the way to develop a proper philosophy or commitment in those areas.</P>
    <P>I have a caveat about computers.  We are liable to tie ourselves up in knots in our intention to get ourselves tangled up in computers and computing.  Therefore, I should like to warn about that.</P>
    <P>On the area of third level education, I have a number of things to say.  In terms of working out who benefits from third level education, we must not forget that in large areas of third level education major manufacturing concerns are the ultimate beneficiaries.  If they employ somebody and pay him £15,000 it is extremely likely that somebody else is making twice that.  If we are talking about making those who benefit from third level education pay, we should look a little further than the individual who is benefiting from it.</P>
    <P>Finally, speaking as a member of the board of management of a regional technical college, there is a lot to be said for many of the proposals for making use of equipment and facilities more efficiently. The Minister should look at some of the accounting procedures of her Department which positively discourage any form of initiative, say, on the part of my own board in Cork, to use their facilities commercially, because any income that <Col N="919" /> we derive from such use of facilities would be subtracted from the following year's grant.  We would be no better off and, therefore, the incentive is, in fact, to do nothing.  There should be an incentive to all decentralised agencies in education to use the equipment they have to the maximum possible efficiency.  That should represent not just a standing still but an increase in our ability to do things financially without having whatever extra revenue we generate deducted from the grant.  That is the sort of decentralisation we need where we would have the flexibility to use our facilities.  Thank you, Senator Loughrey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to thank Senator Burke for allowing me some of his time as one of the two movers of the motion.  On his behalf I should like to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  Again on his behalf and on my own behalf I should like to thank the Minister and her Department for producing the document and to congratulate her on her critical analysis of her own document.</P>
      <P>I welcome the programme, I believe it is excellent.  The review of curricula and reform of the examination system are especially to be commended.  As a former teacher I believe that the curriculum does not always lend itself towards the betterment of all our pupils.  For many of the lower achievers the largely academic curriculum is irrelevant and gives them little preparation for the world around them. Years can be spent preparing for examinations which are beyond attainment for many and the frustration of constant failure must be damaging.  We must reform the curricula with imagination and flexibility, allowing for regional differences and interests, and ensuring that the less able are catered for as well as the gifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the reform of the examination system continuous assessment and project works should be carefully considered.  In languages an even greater emphasis should be placed on oral work.  An alternative terminal examination should be provided for those not wishing or able to proceed to third level.  Heading for a <Col N="920" /> terminal examination that will be of no use to them after spending five years in secondary education is damaging to young people.  It is damaging in the sense that it is a non-achievement at the end of the five years and it is no preparation for what they are heading for.</P>
    <P>As a former national teacher I think the curriculum and the examinations deserve more examination.  I was trained in 1965-67 and some time later we were told about the introduction of the new curriculum.  We did some in-service training &mdash; I may add at no expense to the State despite the fact that salaries were quite low at the time.  We never really got down to thinking about what the new curriculum involved with regard to secondary education.  I believe the new curriculum as an end in itself was preparing children for life, but was not preparing them for secondary education.  We, as primary teachers, were using it as a continuing assessment.  It was my experience in the area in which I taught, and in the secondary schools in that catchment area, that the teachers and the principals of those schools were deliberately not using the assessment from the primary schools in their schools.  I believe, therefore, that from the point of view that they were preparing children for third level education, they would have preferred us to prepare children for second level education which in turn would prepare them for third level education.  I do not believe that was to the benefit of the majority or, indeed, many of the children in the area in which I taught.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to discriminate positively in favour of the disadvantaged pupil.  To attain any semblance of equality or of a just society, we must discriminate in this way.  Any economies made here are false economies and will prove expensive to the State at a later date. Better facilities must be provided for special education.  Children with learning difficulties must be identified as early as possible and remedial education provided. If basic literacy and numeracy skills are not acquired at primary level they will never be acquired.  I note that the director of CERT said recently that a large proportion of applicants for <Col N="921" /> CERT courses after the leaving certificate lack these basic skills.  Many teachers, particularly at post-primary level and, indeed, in the senior strata of primary level, are not equipped to deal with literacy and numeracy problems.  In-service training is needed, or the appointment of extra remedial teachers.  A guidance and counselling service on a much more comprehensive basis should be provided. Many of today's social problems are reflected in the student body and trained personnel must be available to offer help. The psychological service of the Department should be extended, and I urge the Minister to be as generous as possible in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to give special attention to primary education and to post-primary education up to the age of 15 years.  This is the period of compulsory education for all and a period when good or bad foundations are laid.  As resources become available, the pupil-teacher ratio must be improved, and I realise that funds are scarce at the moment.  I believe that if this ratio is not improved and if the overall performance of our children leaving school is not improved as a result, the resultant cost to the State will be much more than the cost of reducing the ratio. There is need for greater liaison and consultation between primary and post-primary schools to facilitate the transfer of pupils from a child centred curriculum to a subject centred one.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to develop the health education programme.  It is necessary to devise a programme for all schools and at all levels, this programme to include training in hygiene, health hazards, road safety, drugs, relationships, sex education, and so on, and at senior cycle level training in citizenship, political awareness and our democratic institutions. At the moment there is a lack of understanding of and, therefore, sympathy for our political institutions.  Teachers should be given special training for such courses.  Such a programme, and I am proud of it, is already being offered in most post-primary schools in Donegal in association with the North Western Health Board.  Class teachers who have volunteered for the course have had in-service <Col N="922" /> training, and parents and school principals have been consulted.  In some respects this is a difficult and sensitive area.  It must be approached with caution but, in view of the many developments in our society, it must be approached with urgency also.</P>
    <P>I note the reference to consultation with parents.  Again as a former teacher and as a former secretary of a branch of the INTO, I welcome it.  It must not be mere lip service to parents.  One of the most regrettable trends in recent years has been the lack of communication between schools and parents.  It is to be hoped that union policy in this area will soon be changed for the better.  Union policy was always reasonably good but there was a fear, sometimes genuine, sometimes not, on the part of teachers &mdash; and this was shown through the unions &mdash; of parents over-interfering in education. The Constitution, as we know, makes reference to the special role of parents.  With more consultation and understanding, parents will understand that their role is a big one but that, while the parent is the prime educator, the teacher is the trained educator.  With the Minister's programme for action there may be a better understanding between parents and teachers that it will be for the betterment of the child if parents and teachers act together.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to introduce more PE in schools and to put an emphasis on sport.  In a two-teacher school in Donegal a school inspector &mdash; and that name is inappropriate &mdash; made reference to the programme I had prepared for that week or that month in which I had made no reference to physical education.  He used an Irish term which I cannot recall at the moment.  All I could reply in Irish was, &ldquo;Ní fheiceann tú clós salach ach oiread.&rdquo;  There was no mention in his notes of not only a dirty but a filthy yard. The Minister and her Department should ensure that proper training areas and training facilities are made available at all schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the budget this year of some moneys for the smaller disadvantaged schools, the two and <Col N="923" /> three-teacher schools.  Having welcomed that decision, I would ask the Minister and the Department to ensure that where bigger schools are being built and in particular where amalgamation is taking place, emphasis be placed on the provision of playing areas.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce religious studies as an optional subject for the leaving certificate is to be welcomed.  This has been under discussion for far too long.  In a Christian country, why should religion not be given the status of the other subjects? Like other subjects, it should be optional and it should in no way replace catechetics.  If an amendment to the Intermediate Education Act is needed, then amend it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the pre-employment course to secondary schools.  These courses should be available in all post-primary schools that have open enrolment.  Otherwise parents who exercise the right to choose, perhaps choosing a Catholic secondary school in preference to a vocational school, find that their children are disadvantaged in the area of job training.  We hear a lot about the co-operation between vocational schools and secondary schools but I do not believe that this takes place at the level at which it should take place. Vocational schools in medium-sized or small towns are playing second fiddle to the secondary schools.  Whether this is intentional, I cannot say, but the courses that are available in mechanics and woodwork are available, if necessary, to the secondary schools from the vocational schools.  I am not so sure that the reverse applies also.</P>
    <P>Regarding smaller towns that might be harbouring two to three not very big schools, if the catchment area would not result in too big a school then I think there is merit in what the Christian Brothers are doing in our area &mdash; I do not know the name of the town but the schools in it are amalgamating totally.  Although there is a cost factor involved, this means that there is a general availability of all subjects to all pupils without the resultant loss of other subjects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision regarding the <Col N="924" /> extension of in-service courses for teachers. This is vital in a rapidly changing world with complex demands and in which once-off training is totally inadequate. There have been indications from some areas already that where in-service training is urgently required is in respect of remedial teaching, health education, computer training and use of new technology. As such teachers have frequently to act as clinical psychologists and social workers some training might be given in these areas.</P>
    <P>Opportunities for adult education are to be extended.  I welcome this.  Adult education works towards the attainment of basic skills, towards the enrichment of the person and towards the availability of more leisure time.  With increased demand for adult courses more use can be made of school buildings and facilities to serve the community in this area. Courses for parents could be organised in liaison with the schools.  I would welcome further use, not only of school buildings but all buildings of a public nature.  Our buildings are totally under-utilised. I would make reference to a town like Milford.  It has a primary school, a vocational school and a secondary school.  Rooms in those schools are closed from the end of school time until the following morning.  Yet the town has been crying out for the past seven years for a library.  More utilisation of the buildings would lead to the betterment of the community.</P>
    <P>Much lip service is paid to the ideal of preserving our language, our heritage and our culture, but little is done about this at a practical level.  Our education system has failed us miserably.  I recall at Saint Patrick's Training College in 1967 where the person teaching me to be a teacher came in to view my teaching a lesson in geography.  The lesson was on the mountains of Ireland.  My preparation was not quite as good as his preparation. I needed an excuse and I thought of one quickly.  I pointed out that the teacher in whose class I was giving my sample lesson was teaching geography through Irish.  Then I heard the most serious thing that was ever said about Irish in my presence when the teacher <Col N="925" /> who was my teacher said: &ldquo;That teacher is not teaching geography through Irish, he is attempting to teach Irish through geography&rdquo;.  I learned a lesson from that.</P>
    <P>I can remember my own experience in St. Eunan's College, a very fine school. Its catchment area had both Gaeltacht and Galltacht.  I came from a non-Gaeltacht area and I can remember how difficult it was for me as a person whose parents had sent me, deliberately and specifically, at the age of nine to a Gaeltacht to learn some more Irish than I might otherwise have learned in a Galltacht school.  At St. Eunan's I found it almost insufferable to have to try to learn Latin or Greek, history or geography through the medium of Irish because I was not competent in Irish.  There was a 10 per cent advantage at the time in doing subjects through the medium of Irish but these other subjects suffered and Irish did not benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited also find it necessary, as a temporary expedient, to continue the foreign crewing of the two vessels as at present.  The company have informed me that the replacement of the foreign crews by Irish crews would involve the company in conversion costs amounting to about £500,000 and additional operating costs of £1.6 million a year.  The company simply cannot afford these additional costs at present. When the freight market returns to normal, the company's intention is that Irish <Col N="926" /> crews will be employed on the vessels.</P>
      <P>The loan on the two vessels being acquired by Irish Shipping Limited will be secured partly by way of a mortgage on the vessels and the balance by way of a guarantee of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Following the negotiations with the foreign shipowners, the board of Irish Shipping Limited submitted a report to me in relation to the company's overall financial situation and having taken account of the substantial concessions secured from the shipowners, have requested limited support from the Government by way of Exchequer guarantees of borrowings.  As I mentioned earlier, the company require an Exchequer guarantee of $12.5 million or about £10.7 million at current exchange rates towards the cost of purchasing the two vessels.  In addition, the company estimate that they will need further guaranteed borrowings of slightly more than £12 million to meet their projected cash deficit in the period up to the end of 1985.</P>
      <P>The company's hope is that the freight market will recover more rapidly than at present expected.  If their hopes are realised, their projected cash deficit will be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that Irish Shipping Limited face a very difficult time in the next few years.  There is no point in my speculating at this stage on market rates in 1986 or beyond or on what the company's financial position will be in those years.  There are too many imponderables involved such as the progress of the world economy, future oil prices and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been recently a slight improvement in market freight rates, it is as difficult to predict when a real recovery will occur as it would have been to envisage three years ago the depth of the present shipping recession.  It has to be assumed that the present recession will not continue indefinitely and that rates will return to commercial levels in due course.  The problem faced by shipping companies during a recession is that of staying in business in order to be able to benefit when the inevitable upturn in trade and market rates occurs.  Irish Shipping Limited believe that the market will <Col N="927" /> have recovered sufficiently by 1986 to enable them to resume viable operation.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that Irish Shipping Limited have had an enviable record of profitable operation in one of the world's most competitive market places. The company are now facing the most serious challenge in their history and the Government believe the company should be given the limited Exchequer support they are now seeking.  Before this can be done, however, it is necessary to extend the statutory limit, which has already been reached, on guaranteed borrowing by the company and, as already indicated, that is the main purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also that the remuneration and allowances of the Chief Officer of Irish Shipping Limited will in future be subject to my approval given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  Similar provisions operate in many other State bodies.  Changes in the company's superannuation provisions are also being brought under control in line with the situation in other State bodies.</P>
    <P>The company are being required also to adhere to Government guidelines and policy on pay and conditions of employment and to comply with directives in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank Senators for taking this Bill at short notice and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping have had a excellent record.  I recall that, when Irish Shipping were examined by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies some years ago at a time when we examined 20 of the 25 bodies, of all those we examined, they were the ones who came through with little or no criticism. They seemed to be an outstanding body who had been making profits for many years.  They had been doing an excellent job from their inception and in every respect we found them a body that we could commend and approve of in every way.  Obviously they have run into difficulty since that time.  They have had very difficult years.  The background to that <Col N="928" /> was very largely the world conditions, a situation they had no control over.  It seems on the other hand that perhaps they had been a little too ambitious and speculated in a very big way and in a way which quite simply did not work out.</P>
      <P>One must criticise the company for their judgment in this respect.  Nobody can criticise a shipping company for not knowing what is going to happen in regard to rates in the future, but one can criticise them for being quite as speculative as they were in this situation.  They certainly deserve some criticism for what they did.  Nevertheless, by and large, having regard to their record over the years, their record has been a very good one and they should be supported in these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan began by paying tribute to Irish Shipping Limited. I should like to start by paying tribute to the Minister who I think has very fairly put the problems of Irish Shipping before the House here today in seeking an increase in the guarantees which he may give in respect of the company.  We are lucky to have in the Department at present a Minister who is as determined as he to grapple with the problems which have been created in this area.  I should like to commence by paying a special tribute to him in that regard.</P>
      <P>The reason I consider it necessary to do so is that many of the other things I have to say will be critical.  I want to make it quite clear that while I might be bound by the rules of this House to direct my criticism towards the Minister, he will no doubt realise that I am governed in that regard by procedure.  He no doubt will know the particular places to direct the criticism to, using him as the only conduit available to me under the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the recent performance of Irish Shipping Limited has been disastrous and worthy of a full investigation by the appropriate committee of this House and of the other House.  The circumstances behind the placing of the contracts outlined by the Minister in his Second Stage speech must be fully investigated by the Houses of the <Col N="929" /> Oireachtas.  Those who have day-to-day responsibility in that regard must be held accountable for these actions.  It may be considered bad luck to make a decision to charter nine vessels with a gross tonnage of 393,000 tons.  When I say chartered, I mean including their crews also. That a decision of that magnitude could have been made without the approval of the Minister of the day is beyond belief. It is an unacceptable exercise by the executives of a company of the authority which they were given.  I am not saying they did not have the authority, but authority is given on the basis that it will be exercised prudently.  In this case the authority was anything but prudently exercised.  In that regard these people must be held accountable for their actions, just as a semi-State body that produce a surplus or provide a service of outstanding merit to the community will be the subject of praise in this House as many such bodies have been.  Conversely, a body that behave in this way collectively must be the subject of the most severe criticism.  I am not going to oppose the Second Stage of this Bill because no doubt the Minister has information available which he cannot make available to me.  I accept that.  The Minister has information available which leads him to the conclusion that the action he is now taking to remedy the situation is the correct action.  Because I have such confidence in the Minister I can accept that that is the case but what I do not accept is that those who made those mistakes should be left unpunished by the Minister.  I must put to the Minister that the disapproval and the wrath of this House must be conveyed to those who have the day-to-day responsibility for this.  What we are asked to so in this Bill is to transfer out of this country substantial sums of money to foreigners on the basis of contracts which should not have been entered into and were not entered into with the approval of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely imperative that the Minister examine the role of the board of directors in this case.  I am not privy to it. I do not know what their role was.  Were those contracts entered into without the <Col N="930" /> approval, either the active approval or the passive approval, of the board of directors, there being a substantial difference between the two?  I would define it as follows: the active approval of a board of directors would come about where a direct board of directors would decide to approve a course of action, having been fully informed of the consequences of their action.  The passive approval of a board of directors would be by way of their merely nodding through something which was not properly explained to them.  I have not got that information.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill and in giving the Minister the authority he seeks I am asking him to exercise his power to investigate these matters fully.  What needs to be investigated also is whether the present members of the Board of Directors of Irish Shipping should continue in office.  My belief is that those members who were members at the time this contract was entered into <i>prima facie</i> should not continue in office.  They should be invited by the Minister to resign, and if not, they should be dismissed by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just like anybody else.  What other business would lose £24 million and no change be made at the top?  It just would not happen anywhere else.  The Minister should not stand for this and I know that other Ministers of other administrations would not have stood for it either if they had been fully informed about the position as time went on.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely imperative that the circumstances surrounding the signing of the accounts of Irish Shipping, dated 31 March 1982, and laid before this House would be fully and carefully examined.  It is absolutely imperative that the directors would be called to give a full account of why these sets of accounts were laid before this House without any indication as to any future losses which might be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there has been a change in the chairmanship of the Board of Irish Shipping since that date.  The <Col N="931" /> Minister will no doubt take that fact into account but who are the executives for whom the Minister ultimately must accept responsibility?  Who entered into this contract?  What positions do they hold, if any, in Irish Shipping now?  Do they hold executive positions or do they hold positions on the board of the company? I have no personal animosity towards or knowledge of, in the vast majority of cases, members of the Board of Irish Shipping.  I am quite sure they are wholly honourable but there must be some relationship between result and reward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the slightest.  The Minister, in the consideration of these matters &mdash; I emphasise again that I am not criticising this Minister or indeed either of his immediate predecessors &mdash; should now consider to what extent the purchase of these vessels will give rise to the possibility of continuing losses as a result of the operation of these vessels, whether they are operated by foreign crews or by Irish crews.  Would it be better, having purchased these vessels, to sell them again even at half the price or even to give them away?  Would such action result in less money being lost by the Irish people?  That is what we should examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, these vessels are involved, not in the transportation of goods to and from our country, but in the transportation of goods between two foreign ports.  There must be consideration of the likely cost of running these ships as against the cost of writing off the £24 million and just forgetting about it.  I cannot judge that as I do not have the information in regard to any contingent liability there may be concerning the staffing of those ships.  It would not be reasonable of me to expect the Minister to give me that information today.  The Minister should examine the position of responsibility in this matter most carefully. <Col N="932" /> He would also examine whether a payment of a lump sum of money now would cure this problem in a way which would be less expensive to the Irish nation in the long term.</P>
    <P>The problems I have outlined could not possibly be examined or answered by the Minister in reply to a Second Stage speech.  I look forward to the Minister indicating what mechanism he has in mind to enable Members of this House and of the other House to examine the circumstances which surround this debacle.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to wait until the Minister has completed his investigation and until such time as he has taken whatever action is considered necessary but ultimately the loss of some unascertained amount of money &mdash; it is in excess of £30 million anyway and indeed may be considerably more that that &mdash; cannot be left unexamined by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The people who are responsible must be called to book for their actions, not only privately but also publicly.</P>
    <P>In passing the Second Stage of this Bill, we should like to indicate to the Minister our expectation of some major shake-up in Irish Shipping.  If the Minister is of the opinion that that shake-up must extend beyond Irish Shipping to his own Department, that is a matter for him.  It is something of which I have no knowledge but I am confident that I can leave it safely in his hands.</P>
    <P>We must give the Minister time to solve this problem.  We must encourage him in the difficult job he has to persuade people to take action.  The advice the Minister will receive is that it is all right now, money will not be saved by taking action and therefore nothing should be done about the situation.  No private enterprise would operate on that basis.  Even if it had profits for 15 years in succession it could not wipe out £30 million, £40 million or £50 million without any change taking place at the top.  Why should it happen in Irish Shipping?  It is important that the Minister indicate what proposals he has to enable this House and the Dáil to examine the problems of the last few years of Irish Shipping and to come to a <Col N="933" /> conclusion, not primarily at least, from the point of view of penalising anybody involved, but with the objective of ensuring that no State-sponsored body in future incur liabilities of this magnitude without the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a unique opportunity to do something for Government control and Government influence on State-sponsored bodies, an opportunity which he should grab with both hands, to ensure that losses of this magnitude do not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a number of specific questions.  Firstly, based on the information available at present and assuming the transactions and concessions which have now been negotiated, including the purchase of these ships, what is the best estimate of the total cost to date, next year and every year up to 1989?  If the information is not available in respect of some of the later years he should give it in respect of the early years.  Would the Minister, in addition to that, indicate the value of the concessions which have been won, which is very important?  The Minister might also indicate the net value of Irish Shipping now, having regard to their losses.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary in his excellent contribution torpedoed some of the Irish Shipping fleet, and I concur with everything he said.  I discussed this Bill today at a meeting of my own parliamentary party and we are unhappy with this semi-State body, not alone because of the way they have run their business in recent times but in their accountability to the Minister responsible and indeed to the Minister for Finance.  We realise that at present Irish Shipping are in a critical financial situation, which is one of the reasons that this House facilitated the <Col N="934" /> introduction of this legislation &mdash; to stop all our ships being torpedoed for lack of finance.  In doing so, it is appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas who pass legislation involving a considerable amount of taxpayers' money should express our reservations about the way this company have been run, especially in recent times.  I am concerned because taxpayers' money usually refers to the PAYE sector, who seem to carry a disproportionate amount of taxation.  They would like us to be responsible when we pass an enabling Bill to allow additional borrowing in the sum of £45 million.  I agree with Senator Ryan in his comment about the original success of Irish Shipping and I also join in commending them for their previous performances.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said that when they had been investigated previously by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Semi-State Bodies they were perfectly happy with the running of this company.  But it is almost three years now since they have been subjected to the critical eye of the Joint Oireachtas Committee which have responsibility to the Houses to see that all bodies under our control are subject to the correct spending of money or in the management of the companies for which they are responsible.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee that they would invite representatives from these various companies on a twice yearly basis, I hope that that committee &mdash; I do not know if it is appropriate to call on them to do so &mdash; should investigate Irish Shipping Limited as a matter of extreme urgency as many people on both sides of the House would like to see the decisions made accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The decisions that they made regarding long-term charter agreements in the Minister's own words proved disastrous. The facts alone speak for themselves. Whereas we have possibly a total of 12 ships carrying the Irish flag we discovered that nine of them are foreign owned.  They are manned by foreign crews and carry out a lot of their business in foreign waters at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the company <Col N="935" /> informed him that replacing the crews of these vested ships would incur an additional expenditure of £500,000 and additional operating costs of £1.6 million.  At least we could stand over that kind of expenditure on the basis that not alone would they be providing employment for all the unemployed crews at various ports throughout the country, particularly in Cork, and could justify the expenditure on social and economic grounds.  It certainly would be much more acceptable to have a deficit incurred because of that and the creation of employment.  Irish Shipping create very little employment in our economy and it is unacceptable that a large amount of this money which is now being made available to them will be spent for the benefit of other people.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that they have at least made an effort to renegotiate some of the contracts they had entered into and whereas we may not be privy to the total amount of money involved in these previous commitments they had entered into I have no doubt that it runs into possibly a hundred million pounds.  I am glad they showed some initiative in renegotiating these contracts because otherwise bringing in a Bill like this would be unacceptable.  If Irish Shipping want to act in a responsible manner and if they are accountable to the Minister for the kind of money they require or are spending we must ask serious questions of the management, the chief executive officer or whoever made these decisions in the past.</P>
    <P>Whoever makes the decisions should be responsible on a commercial basis. Any other commercial organisation who conducted their business in this way would have to answer to somebody.  As Senator O'Leary said, we are asking that they should be answerable to the Minister for Finance and, indeed, to Deputy Mitchell, the Minister present.  That is the least we would expect.  What worries me about the intolerable decisions that were made is that the first people to suffer were the employees at the lower level in this company, the crews working on the ships on rates of remuneration that could, at least, be called questionable.  As the <Col N="936" /> Minister has extended the limit of credit to this company, we are expecting the chickens to come home to roost or the ships to come into port and that their crews and management will be counted.</P>
    <P>The decision to purchase the hydrofoil was most extraordinary.  It may have been made by B &amp; I and not by Irish Shipping but these are the kind of decisions we must question.  A child could prove that it is not possible to float that kind of ship, boat or whatever one likes to call it, in the waters for which it was purchased.  I hope that when the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State Bodies have an opportunity to investigate the workings of Irish Shipping someone will be held responsible for the errors, deliberate or otherwise which have been made over the past couple of years and which have cost the taxpayers so much.  The crews who have been probably the hardest working people in Irish Shipping should not suffer, as indeed they have suffered, from redundancies which have taken place arising from some of the decisions.</P>
    <P>I realise we have a statutory obligation to ensure that until such time as we can investigate the workings of this company we have aresponsibility to ensure their survival.  It is important to have a shipping company which will carry our flag with pride throughout the world in trade and commerce.  Because of that, I lend my support to the Bill, on the understanding that the Minister will be passing on our comments.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the remuneration of the chief executive officer and other employees of the company.  Do I take it from this section that it is possible that heretofore other levels of remuneration had been decided without the decision or permission of the Minister?  If so, I welcome this section and I hope it will benefit crew members who I hope are getting the proper remuneration for the kind of work they do and that they will be appropriately compensated under this section. Possibly the Minister can outline for me whether in fact the reason for putting this section into this Bill is because these people were obviously making decisions on the amounts of pay which they were <Col N="937" /> able to give themselves without recourse to us.  In view of some of the decisions made, those payments would be questionable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his forthright speech on this subject.  I am also confident he will use the enthusiasm he has shown in his dealings with semi-State bodies in trying to make them as self-sufficient and commercially viable as possible, taking into account the social factors from an employment point of view and the economic factors which obviously the board of management had not taken into account in the past.  Normally I would be a defender of semi-State bodies on principle; they are the nearest we have to public ownership in this area and people are often very quick to condemn the public sector in this regard for making decisions which cost the taxpayers a lot of money.  This company come into that category and I am not slow to criticise them because I feel it is justifiable.  It is a pity that we have arrived at that stage, that we should have criticisms of this nature being levelled at a company who are directly responsible to us but, as the Minister said, they have ignored their responsibility to us.  Indeed, some of the people involved have publicly denied any responsibility to us.  I should like to remind them &mdash; because this is the only forum in which we as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas can remind them &mdash; that they have a responsibility to us, to the Minister and to the taxpayer whom we all represent.  We would be neglecting our duty if we did not spell out to people who run boards like this on our behalf that if they run them on a commercial basis they must accept the commercial consequences.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary has called for their dismissal and for other stringent measures to be taken.  The Minister should not be slow to look at it because if that is justifiable he will have the support of the House in doing so.  Other people are very quick to condemn the public sector and most of the problems in the public sector can be traced back to management and the workers often come in for criticism although nine times out of ten they are <Col N="938" /> not responsible.  Management are generally responsible for some of the decisions. The workers are the first to take the stick from the public and the first to suffer in disastrous economic and critical financial situations as Irish Shipping have found out.  The first person to suffer there is the man on the deck, I resent that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I have noted the very severe criticisms that Senators have made of Irish Shipping for this mistake. It was a very serious mistake.  I have noted the points that have been made. Senators will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State bodies have a facility for deciding to summon any particular company at any time to examine their affairs.  I, as Minister, would not be opposed to such a decision if the committee decided to take it.</P>
      <P>In relation to calling people to account I have noted what Senators have said, though my first duty was to see how the very severe crisis into which Irish Shipping had got could be averted.  As I said in the other House the crisis was only resolved in the dying seconds of the last hour because the Government were determined not to accept huge liability for a decision about which they were not even informed.  The decision was taken in late 1979 and early 1980 and neither the then Minister for Transport nor the Minister for Finance was informed, Given the extent of the risk involved that was a very serious omission.  The decision taken clearly did not have any regard for the extent of the downside risk.  Indeed that risk turned out, even with hindsight, to be much greater than most people experienced in business and, indeed, in shipping would have thought possible because the tramp shipping rates hit rock bottom, in fact went far below anything that could reasonably have been predicted. Nonetheless, the risk was enormous and a very grave mistake was made which threatened and almost brought about the end of the Irish Shipping group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are still determined not to accept liability for a decision in <Col N="939" /> which they took no part.  However, given the fact that in the circumstances the charterers saw fit to negotiate with Irish Shipping and to allow concessions both in terms of reduction of the cost of charters and in terms of time for repayment the Government felt it right to give Irish Shipping the necessary respite in order to allow them time to seek to retrieve the awful situation into which they had got. I can only hope that the deal that has been negotiated and which will be finalised with the enactment of this Bill will be sufficient to allow Irish Shipping to survive beyond the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything else I can say.  It would certainly be inappropriate for me to give any details as to the deal done or anything that might be reasonably considered as commercially confidential. Senators will understand that. I would like to thank the Senators again. They can rest assured that the views expressed here will not only be taken into account by me but will also be noted by Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister like to indicate what the total exposure of Irish Shipping was in each of the calendar years of 1973, 1974 and 1975 prior to the negotiations to which he has referred?  In the absence of the negotiated improvement, part of which is the basis of the document before us, what was the exposure of Irish Shipping Limited? Was it £20 million or £30 million? By exposure I mean potential losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the prevailing <Col N="940" /> tramp shipping rates, which are very cyclical. Indeed, because of the very cyclical nature of the shipping industry, not just for years but for decades, that makes the decision in this case all the more difficult to understand.  If tramp shipping rates continue over the next three years at the rock bottom rate that existed a couple of months ago and which have only slightly improved since, the losses over that three year period could have been very extensive. I do not think it would be wise of me to put a particular figure on it.  We are certainly talking in terms of somewhere between £50 million and £100 million.</P>

      <P>I want to inform the House that I propose to cross the political divide with this matter, that is to share the time of 20 minutes between three of us, Senators McDonald, Hanafin and myself.  I am glad that there is such unanimity with regard to this matter.  It does not happen very often in the House and I am glad that we have it on this occasion.  That is, of course as it should be because music and our culture know no bounds.  They belong to the nation.  They do not belong to any party, individual or group.</P>
      <P>The existing support arrangements for Irish cultural organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, on the basis on which grants are allocated, is that most cultural organisations engaged in the promotion of our national culture are grant-aided by the State.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are one of these organisations. Founded in 1951, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are now the premier cultural organisation in Ireland.  They are indeed an international movement, having organised branches throughout the 32 counties, 40 branches in Britain, 25 branches in the United States and there are branches also in France, Germany and Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are grant-aided from two sources, the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Arts Council.  The initial grant from the Department of the Gaeltacht many years <Col N="942" /> ago was the sum of £10,000.  The value of money has changed considerably since then.  That grant now stands at £110,000. In 1978 the grant was £100,000, in 1981 it was increased to £125,000, in 1982 it was reduced to £110,000 and it has continued at that figure ever since.  That means that since 1978 the grant has remained static except in the case of one year, 1981.  If the grant had increased proportionately in relation to inflation it should now have reached at least £200,000.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have grown enormously in that space of time and, therefore, it was necessary to extend the headquarters of the organisation in Monkstown.  This was something Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann decided to do four to five years ago.  When that proposal was first made the cost of building was at a much lower rate than it is today. Because of that building costs increased enormously and the cost of the building extension doubled from what the original estimate was.  Therefore, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann got into financial difficulties and are in that position now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I should give the position regarding that situation at the moment.  The present financial problems of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are not attributable to the movement but are traceable to two main factors, (a) the non-payment of a Government capital grant which was promised in 1982 and (b) the reduction of the annual organisation grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta, which was reduced in 1982 from £125,000 to £110,000 and has been kept at that level since.  This is unprecedented treatment for a cultural movement, particularly one whose success is a matter of record.  It is this withholding of grants and not the building of our new theatre complex which is causing the financial problems of Comhaltas.  If the capital grants had been paid on time and the level of annual funding maintained Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann would have been in an overdraft situation instead of being in a debt situation.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has contributed to the financial problems of Comhaltas has been that the entertainment grant of <Col N="943" /> Comhaltas from the Arts Council has remained static at £59,000 out of a budget of £5½ million for three years.  Last year a survey requisitioned by the Arts Council and carried out by the Landsdowne Marketing Research Limited showed Irish traditional music in a premier position among the arts in Ireland. Yet only 2 per cent of the accounts in the budget is allocated to native art form.  It is worth nothing the figures paid to other art forms, namely ballet £400,000, opera £350,000 and other organisations paid proportionately less figures.  We do not begrudge such payments but we believe that the native art form at least is entitled to parity with these.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that only £22,000 was collected by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in membership fees.  A sum of £22,000 was received by the Ard Chomhairle but the branch also receive a proportion of the membership fees, the county board receive another proportion and the provincial council receive another proportion, so the £22,000 referred to is only part of the allocation of the branch membership fees.  While we welcome the announcement from the Government recently that the long awaited capital grant first promised in 1982 will shortly be paid the amount of £250,000 is £100,000 short of the equivalent sum promised.</P>
    <P>The second area to which we now request the Government to address themselves is the annual organisation grant to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which was reduced in 1982 from £125,000 to £110,000 and has been kept at that level since.  The work programme of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann covers three continents, has 42 branches, 600 classes, 45 festivals which 750,000 people attend, three annual tours and the entire functions are attended by approximately one million people.  The Minister will possibly say &mdash; I welcome the Minister in the House to listen to this discussion &mdash; that part of our grant is a capital grant and that the other part is another type of grant.  I would say, in anticipation of what the Minister is going to say, that that does not really matter.  It does not matter <Col N="944" /> whether part of the grant is capital or whether it is current.  It is the amount of money that we receive at the end of the day or at the end of the year that matters and not the terms of the various allocations in the grants.  What matters to us is that in 1978 we were receiving £100,000 and in 1984 we are receiving only £110,000 despite the depreciation in the value of money, inflation and everything else.  I may add that it is disappointing to us to learn that further organisations have been given increases during those years, at least inflationary increases, and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have not been given any.</P>
    <P>I will now concede to Senator McDonald and I will ask him to continue for five minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Senator de Brún's plea for greater recognition of the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  In doing so I can only rely on my own experience and knowledge of the role of this important cultural movement in my constituency of Laois-Offaly and in my county of Laois in particular.</P>
      <P>I believe that our generation have an obligation to foster, pass on and encourage our traditional cultures, our songs and dance.  As a member of the movement I must admit that my branch is the youngest one in County Laois.  Nevertheless, the branch has 60 young people regularly attending classes of Irish music. That is an indication in one corner of the country that if the services are provided people will attend them, certainly get great benefit from them and will enjoy them.  The movement in my county includes people from all walks of life, business people, farmers, members of the forces, the Army and the Garda, skilled workers, a full cross section of the public, people who come together and enjoy traditional music and dancing, whether it is in the seisiúns or in both watching and learning the set dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise the importance of the work that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have undertaken so successfully over the years in this tremendous Irish tradition.  We should also bear in the mind the cost of the great training programmes <Col N="945" /> that they undertake.  The teacher diploma training course in music is of the utmost importance in the entire scheme, because the organisation successfully organise over 600 music classes throughout the country.  This is an important imput into the fabric of our country if we are going to hold on to and cherish our tradition.  Irish traditional dancing, if we compare it with what goes on at discos, is in a completely different field. Nevertheless, if we watch the faces of people who may be enjoying themselves at a disco, and then we see the people dancing a set, it is absolutely in a different era, it is a different source of enjoyment. Too few people have the opportunity to experience involvement in our traditional way of life.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will do all in their power to ensure that the organisation which is so important to preserving our individual identity as a Celtic race can continue.  I believe that if the promised grants are made available as quickly as possible, this will give the organisation a great boost.  It is important that greater emphasis should be laid on the provision of Irish classes. When people are attending school and have got to learn the Irish language as part of their intermediate or leaving certificate, they are under tremendous pressure and they do not enjoy perhaps the literature, the stories or the culture. When one goes back and gets a second chance education one has the opportunity to open up a whole new culture and a whole new medium for enjoyment. From that point of view it is important that some organisations should be there and that there should be some group to provide this kind of experience to ever wider sections of our community.  I wish to commend the proposal by Senator de Brún.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very emotive issue.  I know Senator de Brún would want the Minister to understand that no finger is being pointed at him in this matter. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann cater for all the people of Ireland.  It is of some significance to mention that in north Antrim one of the most flourishing <Col N="946" /> They need assistance very badly.  They groups of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have amongst their members people of all religions who are joined together in a common bond of love for Irish traditional music.  They are the only group I know &mdash; perhaps there are others &mdash; with this great common bond in the North and the South between people of all political views and religions that must be of great significance.</P>
      <P>In dealing with a certain number of statistics which are absolutely true, one is tempted to toss out the fact that 750,000 people are recorded as having attended Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann functions last year.  That is something which cannot be ignored.  The main point at the moment &mdash; and it has to be stressed &mdash; is that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are in extreme difficulties.  I know the Minister is very sympathetic about this.  I know something of his background.  Recently I saw a programme on television about his own county in the early days when Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann started and how they flourished.  No Irish person wants Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to die.  I could not believe anyone would want them to die.  There are two things that make any movement die.  One is lack of interest and the other is lack of money. In this case it is not a lack of interest but a lack of money.  It does not matter how the money has been spent.  I was out there last week because I was particularly distressed when I looked at the television programme and saw the difficulties they are in.  I studied the accounts and saw that the money was spent wisely and prudently. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann gave great pleasure to young people in particular who attended classes and learned how to play pure, beautiful Irish music.  Surely it is not necessary to stress here or anywhere else that Irish music is as much a part of us as we are part of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that the Department should grant-aid ballet and opera societies. I am not unreasonable in suggesting that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who cater for Irish traditional music should get more or at least the same.  They should be treated very sympathetically. <Col N="947" /> deserve it because of the service they have given and their great, beautiful movement throughout the country which joins people together in this great common bond of Irishness that brings out the best in all Irish people, whether Protestant or Catholic, and irrespective of whatever political views they hold.  It brings out the best in them, the great common bond and the love of Irish traditional music which is love of Irish history and love of the Irish people themselves.  Irish music is what we are.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this whole situation. From my viewing of the books &mdash; and I have examined and studied them; I have spoken to the people &mdash; this is an emergency situation.  It is almost a case of the last letter from the ESB and the last letter from the telephone authorities.  It is a fire brigade situation.  I think I know the Minister's feelings.  I know his love for Irish culture.  I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not add my voice to the voices of Senators who have spoken on this matter. My fellow county man, Labhrás Ó Murchú, who is president of this magnificent movement, has done much work in this area.  He has been an ambassador for us at home and abroad in the sphere of culture, music, song and dance which we all enjoy.

Outside of that capital allocation a genuine case is being made to nurture and maintain Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in everything they stand for and do.  I hope the Minister will be as generous as possible.  He will never regret it and our children will be forever grateful to him because they are the people who will benefit in the long run.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht seo agus le Séamus de Brún <Col N="948" /> a chuir síos an rún.  Ba mhaith liom a rá chomh maith nach bhfuil aon ghá le brú a chur ormsa aitheantas óifigiúil agus aitheantas ó chroí a thabhairt do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Tá siad ansin leis na blianta.  Tá fhios ag chuile dhuine go bhfuil an-obair á déanamh ag comhaltas agus go bhfuil na mílte duine san tír seo agus go deimhin thar lear atá ag baint suilt agus taithnimh as na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh acu chun ceol, damhsa agus cultúr na tíre seo a chur chun cinn.  Tugadh aitheantas oifigiúil, leanúnach do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann ó 1968 i leith agus ón am sin tá suas le milliún punt curtha ar fáil ag rialtais síos ón am sin i leith.  Agus bhí an ceart ag an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún nuair a dúirt sé go mbeinn ag rá cúpla focal faoin airgead caipitil agus faoin airgead reatha a cuireadh ar fáil.  Ní ceart a rá gur gearradh siar san bhliain 1981 ar dheontas CCE. Sé do tharla ná i 1978 nuair a bhí an comhaltas ag iarraidh áit a cheannach amuigh ansin shocraigh siad leis an Roinn agus bhí an Roinn sásta ag an am deontas £90,000 a chur ar fáil ar bhonn caipitil agus íocadh é sin i 1978, 1979, 1980 agus 1981 i gceithre thráthchuid i dteannta le deontas i leith airgid reatha agus san mbliain 1981 íocadh £105,000 mar airgead reatha agus íocadh an tráthchuid dheiridh den £90,000 airgead caipitil.</P>
      <P>Anois tá fhios agam agus tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir nuair a deir sé gur cuma sa donas an airgead caipitil nó airgead reatha a íocadh.  Is í an fhadhb atá ann anois nach bhfuil go leor de cheachtar den dá chuid ar fáil.  Sin í an chaoi ina raibh rudaí agus níor gearradh siar ar an deontas reatha.  Ardaíodh é sa bhliain ina dhiaidh sin go £110,000 agus tá sé ansin ó shin.  Caithfidh mé a rá nár árdaíodh é ó shin, rud a chuireann díomá ormsa mar Aire a bhfuil a Roinn ag cur airgid reatha ar fáil don chomhaltas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois i 1980 shocraigh an comhaltas ar leathnúa dhéanamh ar a gcultúrlann agus foirgneamh nua a chur ar fáil tar éis deis a bheith curtha ar áit a bhí amuigh ansin roimhe sin mar chultúrlann.  Sé an costas measta a bhí ann ag an am ná £350,000 Anois bhí an comhaltas ag an am i gcomhairle le mo Roinn agus go deimhin ó na nótaí a tógadh ag an am cuireadh comhairle <Col N="949" /> ar an gcomhaltas nach raibh sé róchiallmhar dul ar aghaidh le caiteachas an-mhór, caiteachas caipitil, gan fhios a bheith ag chuile duine cá as a raibh a leithéid de chaipiteal le teacht.  Ar aon nós chuadhas ar aghaidh leis an obair agus faoi Mheán Fhómhair 1981 bhí ardú de leath chéad míle punt agus costas measta £400,000.  I ndeireadh na dála lean an obair ar aghaidh go dtí gur chosain sí £740,000.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá ag an bpointe seo go bhfuil an-job déanta agus go bhfuil foirgneamh álainn mar chultúrlann náisiúnta ag CCE amuigh sa chathair ansin.  Tá bród orm féin as.  Ach ní féidir a rá go raibh sé ceart dul ar aghaidh ag an am toisc nach raibh réiteach déanta ar cá as a raibh costas an fhoirgnimh le teacht as.  Nuair a bhí an áit seo á tógáil tháinig CEE chun an Rialtas ag an am agus socraíodh go gcuirfí deontas caipitil ar fáil as Chiste na nAgróirí &mdash; the Funds of Suitors &mdash; agus socraíodh suim áirithe ag an am.  Thángamar isteach ina dhiaidh sin agus ghlacamar go raibh an gealltanas seo tugtha agus dúramar go rabhamar sásta seasamh leis, agus go deimhin tá.  Ceann de na rudaí a bhaineann leis seo ná sular féidir an t-airgead a scaoileadh ar ais chuig Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann go gcaithfear Bille a cur tríd an Teach seo agus an Dáil agus tá mé cinnte nach mbeidh aon deacracht ansin agus go mbeidh lán-tacaíocht ag teacht ó chuile thaobh den dá Theach nuair a bhéas an Bille seo á phlé.  Bhí deacrachtaí faoi leith ag baint leis agus go deimhin sular tháinig mé anseo anocht dúirt an tAire Dlí agus Cirt liom go mbeidh sé ábalta é a bheith aige taobh istigh de choicís.  Chomh luath is a thiocfaimid arais tar éis na Cásca beimid ábalta an Bille a chur tríd an dá Theach le cúnamh Dé agus an t-airgead seo a íoc le Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua, agus ní chuireann sé áthas ar bith ormsa seasamh anseo agus é a rá, nach bhfuil sé in ann &mdash; taobh amuigh don deontas caipitil sin ó Chiste na nAgróirí &mdash; nach bhfuil aon chiste agamsa lenar féidir liom teacht i gcabhair ar CCE ag an am seo.  Ba mhaith liom a rá gur scríobh mé ag an gcomhaltas ar an 28 Márta ag rá go raibh sonraí uaim ar chaiteachas na bliana 1983 le go <Col N="950" /> bhféadfainn cuí síos leo siúd agus leis an gComhairle Ealaíon &mdash; a bhfuil suim acu sa rud sin chomh maith mar chuir an Chomhairle Ealaíon beagnach £60,000 ar fáil i mbliana mar dheontas reatha don chomhaltas &mdash; agus go bhféadfadh an triúr againn suí síos &mdash; mo Roinn féin, an comhaltas agus an Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; le bun-fhadhanna an chomhaltais a phlé agus, mar a deirim, sula bhféadfaí an chruinniú sin a bheith eagraithe agam bhí an t-eolas seo ag teastáil.  Scríobh mé litir ag iarraidh an eolais seo agus idir an dá linn ansin cuireadh amach an ráiteas go raibh droch-bhail ar chúrsaí airgid an chomhaltais agus go deimhin tá daoine sa Teach seo &mdash; bhuail mé leis an Seanadóir de Brún agus leis an tUasal Labhrás Ó Murchú cúpla uair i rith na bliana agus ní raibh iontas orm &mdash; bhí díomá orm mar a déarfá &mdash; nuair a chuala mé seo.  Bhí fhios agam go raibh droch-bhail ar chúrsaí airgid an chomhaltais.  Bhí mise ag cur brú ar an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt nó ar an Aire le go bhféadfadh sé an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.  Tá sin á dhéanamh anois.  Ní réitíonn sé sin fadhb CCE agus mar a deirim chuaigh siad i mbun oibre áras álainn a chur ar fáil: cultúrlann go bhfuil bród agamsa as. Tá an-obair á déanamh acu ach ní haon mhaith é sin dóibh siúd a bheith ag rá na rudaí seo.</P>
    <P>Tuigim é sin go maith.  Ceann de na rudaí nach ndearna siad i gceart &mdash; agus ní dhéanann aon duine gach rud i gceart gach la dá shaol &mdash; gur lean siad ar aghaidh air agus go ndeachaigh costais in airde agus go deimhin ní orthu siúd a bhí an locht mar gheall air sin ar chor ar bith. Chuaigh costais chuile rud in áirde agus i ndeireadh na dála tá siad i bhfiacha suas go £700,000.  Ní réiteoidh deontas caipitil as Choiste na nAgróirí an fhadhb.  Cuideoidh sé le réiteach na faidhbe.  Ní réiteoidh sé an fhadhb in iomlán. Bheinnse sásta go deimhin suí síos leis an gComhairle Ealaíon agus leis an gcomhaltas le hiarracht a dhéanamh fáil amach céard is féidir a dhéanamh le réiteach na faidhbe a fháil, mar ceann de na rudaí a chuirean an-díomá ormsa agus a lán bróin ormsa go dtitfeadh sé amach go mbeadh orthu an cultúrlann álainn sin a chaitheamh i leataobh nó é a thabhairt suas do <Col N="951" /> dhaoine toisc nach bhfuil siad in ann fanacht ann agus íoc as.  Mar a deirim tá mise báúil d'obair an chomhaltais agus bhí i gcónaí agus tá súil agam go mbeidh.  Tá sé seo ráite agam cheana agus dá mbeinnse i mo thost bheadh an comhaltas molta.  Tá an-tacaíocht ag an gcomhaltas mar a deir Seanadóirí anseo, ní amháin sa tír seo ach i gcéin, san Astráil, i gCeanada, i Meiriceá, sa Bhreatain, sa Ghearmáin agus áiteanna eile ar fud an domhain.  Tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh fhios ag na daoine seo an droch-bhail atá ar an gcomhaltas ó thaobh airgid go mbeidís sásta rud éigin a chur i leataobh le cabhrú leo agus iad a thabhairt as an fhaopach ina bhfuil siad.  Mar sin, mar fhocal scoir, níl aon chiste agamsa gur féidir liom teacht i gcabhair ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann faoi láthair.  Déanfaidh mé chuile iarracht agus go deimhin tá an tAire Dlí agus Cirt sásta a dhícheall a dhéanamh scaoileadh leis an airgead seo chomh luath agus a bhéas an Bille tríd an dá Theach agus beidh sé sin ann tá súil agam an chéad tseachtain tar éis teacht ar ais i ndiaidh na Cásca.  Tá mise sásta suí síos agus an cheist seo a phlé leis an gcomhaltas agus leis an gComhairle Ealaíon mar a mhol mé cúpla seachtain o shin sula bhfuair an comhaltas an phoiblíocht seo le cúpla seachtain anuas.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom chomh maith a rá go bhfuil aiféal orm go raibh mé déanach ag teacht chun an Tí.  Ní raibh fhios agam cén t-am a bheadh chuile rud eile glanta agaibh agus is cosúil go ndearna sibh bhur gcuid oibre go han-tapaidh.  Ceapadh mise i lár mo chuid tae agus is oth liom nach raibh mé anseo in am leis an díospóireacht a thosú.</P>

      <P>Focal an-ghairid.  I know it is late.  Just a word of explanation to the Minister.  The Minister said that he has written to Labhrás Ó Murchú for consultation in regard to a meeting.  The <Col N="952" /> reason he has not had a reply is that Labhrás was away in the United States. He came back this morning and an answer will be on the Minister's desk very soon.</P>
      <P>Just another word of explanation if I may.  The Minister said we went ahead with the building without knowing where we were going or what we were doing and without foreseeing where we might get the money.  That is not quite true.  I am not saying the Minister is telling a lie. We went ahead with the building in the knowledge that we would do our very best and get the best co-operation possible from the State.  We generated £250,000 through our own organisation. That is literally true.  That is an achievement of which we may well be proud, and of which we are proud.  I just wanted to comment on those two things.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I want to thank him also for the many times he received Labhrás Ó Murchú and myself in negotiations. I want to thank Senator Ferris, Senator McDonald and my colleague on this side, Senator Hanafin, for co-operating with me on this matter.  I am glad, as I said initially, that there is such a spirit in this House tonight.  We have crossed political divides and we have possibly created a precedent.  Our music belongs to the nation.  It does not belong to any group or any party.  It belongs to the nation and to the people, and long may it live.  We may get an increase from the Department.  The Minister may yet change his mind.</P>
