      <P>I have a notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The implication for Senators in the public apology of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the American people over the purported presence of Senators at the alleged burning of the US flag outside Leinster House on 4 June 1984.</P>
      <P>In considering a matter for the half-hour adjournment, I must take into account that the procedure provides only for a very limited debate on matters of administration relevant to a Minister's Department. In my opinion the matter does not come within this procedure.  I must therefore rule that the matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>Though I am not questioning your ruling, I want to say that by inneundo especially in view of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition here on this subject yesterday, by dissociating his party from this incident that by remaining silent, the public might assume that I or any member of the Labour Party was involved in any way in this flag burning incident.  I want to refute <Col N="610" /> that.  In regard to any utterances that have been made by members of my party &mdash; many of us have adopted different attitudes on this problem of the visit of the President.  I realise this may be out of order &mdash; the chairman of my party, Senator Michael D. Higgins, was at pains to explain that he never at any stage wanted to show any disrespect to or have any objections to or any controversy with the American people and would not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is proposed to sit until 12.30, then suspend the sitting until 1.30 and to sit until 4.30.  It is proposed to take items 1, 2 and 3.  These are all matters concerned with the operation of Joint Committees of the Oireachtas; then to take Nos. 4, 5 and 6, which are three small Bills all concerned with agricultural matters.  In connection with Nos. 4 and 6, we are still on Second Stage, and I would suggest that a separate Committee Stage is required and that could be taken this afternoon after the resumption.  I suggest that the Committee Stages of Nos. 4 and 6 be taken either immediately after the Second Stages or else taken this afternoon.  I do not think that in any of these Bills there would be a justification for adjourning until next week.  It is then proposed to take Items Nos. 7 and 8: these are concerned with developments <Col N="611" /> in the EEC up to the end of 1983.  It is only proper that the House should dispose of this question before adjourning for the summer rather than let it drag over more than six months beyond the period under discussion.  Also we should order No. 9.  We should leave ourselves flexible and decide after the luncheon suspension as to how we would proceed this afternoon in regard to Nos. 8 and 9.</P>

      <P>My memory may be defective &mdash; perhaps there are many other things about me that many Members might regard as defective too. I recall the Leader of the House saying he would be able to give us some indication today of the business we would have before the summer Adjournment.</P>
      <P>As regards item No. 19 on the Order Paper, which is a motion on the assault on the people of Nicaragua by the present United States Administration, since it is neither an Independant Member's motion nor a Labour Party motion I was wondering when or if we might be able to take it.  There are those of us who believe that there are more profound issues to be discussed in the world than the admittedly objectionable burning of a flag, like the assault on a small nation by the most powerful nation in the world. I would wonder under what time and business we could take that motion since it is both topical, alive and very relevant to a small and very brave people.</P>

      <P>In relation to next week's business, we will be taking that business which is passing through the Dáil.  We can only take that business if it passes the Dáil this week.  We already have on our Order Paper the Copyright Bill and the Road Traffic Bill.  It is definitely proposed to take those next week and No. 12 on our Order Paper, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill which is an extension of the present scheme enabling people to <Col N="612" /> purchase their ground rents.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned yesterday, the Irish Steel Bill is a Money Bill and therefore we will have to deal with it.  There are a number of other Bills.  There is the Air Transport Bill, there is the Misuse of Drugs Bill, there is the Criminal Justice Bill.  In all of these cases there is a possibility but until we know how the Dáil disposes of them today it will be impossible to say.  If there is any further hard information in the course of the day I will give it to the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to Motion No. 19, as Senator Brendan Ryan has noted this is in a sense a hybrid motion in that it is down in the names of Senator Brendan Ryan and three members of the Labour Party.  The manner of dealing with Private Members' Motions is that they are taken in rotation among the four groups in the House.  It is for each group when their turn comes to say what motion they wish to take.  If either the Labour Party or the Independent group indicate that their priority is Item No. 19, the motion in relation to Nicaragua, then it will be taken when the turn of that group comes.</P>

    <Title>Delegated Legislation: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Joint Committee on Legislation, or a sub-Committee appointed by it, review the exercise of existing statutory powers of delegated legislation in the light of the various reports on statutory instruments made by former Select Committees of the Seanad on Statutory Instruments and the Joint Committees on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and its own examination of statutory instruments over the initial two years of its operations; and that the Joint Committee report on whether, in order to maintain appropriate balance between the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas and the needs of efficient Government, any special safeguards are desirable in regard to the future exercise of those powers and the delegation <Col N="613" /> of such powers in future legislation.</P>
    <P>Just about 12 months ago this House appointed a number of committees. Included in that number was the Joint Committee on Legislation.  This was a new committee which was in a sense an experiment and which has been operating under the terms of reference which we gave it 12 months ago.  One of the matters that was referred to that Joint Committee was the question of delegated legislation. On the occasion on which the Seanad approved the establishment of that committee, quite naturally, reference was made to the fact that the review of delegated legislation was passing from the Seanad Committee on the Review of Statutory Instruments to this new Joint Committee on Legislation.</P>
    <P>This motion, which is being brought forward now and which has already been agreed to by Dáil Éireann, asks the Joint Committee on Legislation, or else a sub-committee appointed by it, should review the exercise of existing statutory powers on statutory legislation and should report, within a period of two years, about our experience in regard to this and make recommendations, if necessary, in regard to the future exercise of these powers.  We have, of course, had a good deal of experience in regard to the review of delegated legislation.  A Seanad committee operated from 1949 to 1983. We have had our Joint Committee in regard to the effect of EEC legislation on our domestic law from 1973 until now. As I mentioned earlier, the Legislation Committee itself has been in operation now for 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a fact of political life in this modern age that delegated legislation is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>It is unavoidable because of the manner of the detail with which certain matters must be regulated, a degree of detail well beyond what can, with convenience, be encompassed inside statutory legislation. It is also necessary, because the nature of the modern policy is such that it is impossible to anticipate in a world which changes rapidly, not only technologically <Col N="614" /> but also politically, but perhaps unfortunately not quite so rapidly socially, there are unanticipated effects. Also, delegated legislation is necessary because the borderline between legislation and administration is by no means a sharp divide.  And so we have this problem that must be met.</P>
    <P>In attempting to make a disposition of this particular problem we must take account of our constitutional position and indeed the fundamental principle which underlies the constitutional arrangement in regard to the various powers.  Personally, I do not like to use the term &ldquo;separation of power&rdquo; because I think this is a false abstract academic principle.  If we refer to &ldquo;the balance of power&rdquo; we are perhaps coming closer to what is reality. Indeed I would suggest that what we have in operation under our Constitution or any similar constitution is the question of an interaction of powers, a dynamic element in which the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive are interacting with one another.  Certain areas clearly belong to one but there are interfaces between the three powers in which there is interaction.  We are not concerned here this morning with the question of judicial review but we are concerned with the question of parliamentary review.</P>
    <P>It is clearly laid down in Article 15.2 of the Constitution, as it was in Article 12 of the 1922 Constitution, that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.  That, of course, has been adapted in relation to EEC legislation and adapted by judicial review, but it does remain a fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>How then, given that fundamental principle, are we to make the best possible arrangement in regard to the parliamentary review of legislation?  Here we have some help.  I think it appropriate that on this occasion, which we are setting up this particular review, that I should put on record the position as I see it.  It is a matter in which this House should take a particular interest because this House, which is relieved from the necessity of dealing in detail with financial <Col N="615" /> matters, is relieved of the necessity of dealing with matters of treaties with other countries, should properly take other areas in which it should express a particular concern.  That indeed was done when the Seanad Select Committee on Statutory Instruments was established.  I do not believe that this House, just because it is now the concern of the Joint Committee on Legislation, should now cease to take a particular interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that the position in regard to the relationship between legislation and delegated legislation is reasonably clear, and we are lucky that there have been a number of judicial cases.  I would refer in particular to a case under the 1922 Constitution, the case of The Pig Marketing Board <i>versus</i> Donnelly, in which Mr. Justice Hanna laid down the principles under Article 12.  I do not want to read this <i>in Extenso</i> but merely to quote as follows &mdash; I am quoting from page 75 of the second edition of <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by Professor John Kelly.  Mr. Justice Hanna laid down:</P>
    <P>It is axiomatic that powers conferred on the Legislature to make laws cannot be delegated to any other body or authority.  The Oireachtas is the only constitutional agency by which laws can be made but the Legislature may, it has always been conceded, delegate to subordinate bodies or Departments not only the making of administrative rules and regulations, but the power to exercise, within the principles laid down by the Legislature, the powers so delegated and the manner in which the statutory provisions shall be carried out.  The functions of every Government are now so numerous and complex that of necessity a wider sphere has been recognised for subordinate agencies, such as boards and commissions.</P>
    <P>Again we have had relatively recently, in the case of the Richview Press <i>versus</i> AnCO, which is reported in the <i>Irish Law Reports</i> for 1980, a fairly clear definition on the authority of the Supreme Court. Again, I would like to place on record as <Col N="616" /> the background to any discussions we would have here this morning and to any investigation that would take place under the Joint Committee on Legislation the judgment of the Chief Justice on that occasion which was unanimously assented to by his colleagues.  I quote from the case of the Cityview Press <i>versus</i> An Comhairle Oiliúna in the <i>Irish Law Reports</i> of 1980:</P>
    <P>The giving of powers to a designated Minister or subordinate body to make regulations or orders under a particular statute has been a feature of legislation for many years.  The practice has obvious attractions in view of the complex, intricate and ever-changing situations which confront both the Legislature and the Executive in a modern State.  Sometimes, as in this instance, the Legislature, conscious of the danger of giving too much power in the regulation or order-making process, provides that any regulation or order which is made should be subject to annulment by either House of Parliament. This retains a measure of control, if not in Parliament as such at least in the two Houses.  Therefore, it is a safeguard.  Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility rests with the courts to ensure that constitutional safeguards remain, and that the exclusive authority of the National Parliament in the field of law making is not eroded by a delegation of power which is neither contemplated nor permitted by the Constitution.  In discharging that responsibility, the Courts will have regard to where and by what authority the law in question purports to have been made.  In the view of this Court, the test is whether that which is challenged as an unauthorised delegation of parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself.  If it be, then it is not authorised; for such would constitute a purported exercise of legislative power by an authority which is not permitted to do so under the Constitution. On the other hand, if it be within the permitted limits &mdash; if the law <Col N="617" /> is laid down in the statute and details only are filled in or completed by the designated Minister or subordinate body &mdash; there is no unauthorised delegation of legislative power.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Legislation or its sub-committee will have before it this clear exposition of the law.  There was a further case in December of last year, the case of Cooke <i>versus</i> Walsh of 16 December 1983 as yet unreported.  This relieves the House from having to hear me through a further quotation.</P>
    <P>The history of the parliamentary review of legislation goes back well over 100 years, as does the power to annul, which goes back just over 100 years.  If one looks back at the history of delegated legislation, one of the first cases, if not the first case, of giving the power to either House to annul was in regard to the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act, 1871. Looking at the Order Paper and the matters laid before us that are subject to annulment and looking at the jungle of statutory legislation, we may well believe that the power to annul has been well fathered by the Lunacy Regulation Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of review, we still find after 100 years and after the enactment of a Statutory Instruments Act in 1947, a wide variety of practices in regard to delegated legislation and in regard to statutory instruments.  There are statutory instruments properly made but which can be certified by the Attorney General to be of such a local or a personal nature that there is no need to give notice of them in any form whatsoever. We have a second class of statutory instruments of which notice must be given in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and which must be deposited in certain libraries.  The list of libraries, incidentally, does not include the Oireachtas Library.  The Limerick Chamber of Commerce is entitled statutorily to receive a copy of all statutory instruments, as is the National Library, the Legal Libraries but not the Oireachtas Library.  It seems to me that this is something that might well be looked at.</P>
    <P>In many cases there is a requirement that the statutory instrument be laid on <Col N="618" /> the Table of each House of the Oireachtas, thus constituting a third group of statutory instruments.  Among these there is a fourth group which are subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas &mdash; the so-called statutory orders subject to negative resolution. Finally, there are statutory instruments which require positive approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and belong to the group of affirmative resolution.  We have a wide variety of provisions.  Anyone who looks at the statutory instruments as they pour fourth will agree that it is not always a consistent division.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for having a diffuse variety of provisions, but it is well worth the time of the Joint Committee on Legislation or its sub-committee to look at the question of whether they are dealt with consistently or whether there should not be criteria in regard to this.  It is only by looking at this matter in general and only by establishing criteria which can be recommended by the Joint Committee on Legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas, debated by them, approved or amended by them, that we will bring order to this.  Because the volume of these statutory instruments now runs something over 400 per year, it is obviously impossible for an individual Member, no matter how enthusiastic, to be able to keep track of these, to evaluate them not only for form but also for content. It is for that reason that this House, as I have already mentioned, established the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments in 1949.</P>
    <P>I want once again, as I did 12 months ago when this function was passing to the Joint Committee on Legislation, to express appreciation of what was done by that committee, words of appreciation to the late Senator Luke Duffy, former Secretary of the Labour Party and a distinguished Member of this House.  I would like to pay a tribute also to the late Professor George O'Brien who was Chairman of that committee for 14 years.  I would like to pay a tribute to the then Senator Bill Sheldon who succeeded Professor George O'Brien and was Chairman of that committee for a further eight years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> All of the chairmen of this committee not only approached this task with energy and with discrimination but they laid down a model standard of how such work should be approached.  But they were hampered throughout that work by a number of difficulties.  One of these difficulties was, of course, the inevitable difficulty of staff.  It was not until adequate staffing was available that it was possible for the committee to do other than reach on a sample of the statutory instruments with which they were concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not need to quote the terms of reference of that committee except to say that, in fact, those terms of reference, with one or two small changes, lasted right through the history of that committee from 1949 to 1983.  They stood the test of time in this regard.  I think they were taken over virtually <i>in toto</i> in the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation.  There has been, in addition, the experience of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which has been operating now for over ten years.  I will leave it to Senator Mary Robinson, who is with us this morning, to speak of her experience of that particular committee.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Legislation, which we established just over one year ago and to whom we are now giving this additional charge of making a review, was in its terms of reference 1 (f) asked to examine and report to each House on any statutory instrument laid or laid in draft before either House other than regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972 and to recommend, where it considered such action was warranted, whether the instrument should be annulled or amended.  The Joint Committee on Legislation has been given many other tasks to do.  During the past year it has been asked to look at certain legislation and at certain proposals for legislation and is being asked at the moment to continue in that particular task.  When we today ask the Joint Committee on Legislation to review this matter we should ask it to review itself and <Col N="620" /> to ask the question whether, along with all the other duties it has, it can do justice to this topic.  I am sure I speak for Members of Seanad Éireann when I say that, if the Joint Committee on Legislation feels that it has, apart from this duty, enough work to keep it fully occupied throughout the year I think Seanad Éireann would be prepared to resume the particular task of the review of statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a thorough review, not an exhaustive examination, but there is a need for a review.  The guidelines of the Seanad Committee are there and they should be reviewed.  The format of various Acts and instruments could be reviewed.  Some of us would like to know exactly what are the differences between Orders, Rules and Regulations.  When we are reviewing legislation in this House we find all these terms being used.  There may well be distinctions based on fundamental principles.  If so, this is not readily apparent.  There are other questions that must be examined.  I tend to speak every two or three years in this House on the question of the consolidation and adequate publication of Army Regulations which are a particular form of delegated legislation.  I get the answer that this is being pursued actively.  This is something to which the Joint Committee on Legislation or the sub-committee appointed by it should give their attention. There is a substantial body of law here.  The Army regulations constitute a body of law.  It is a body of law which is largely the concern of the Army authorities and the Minister for Defence but not solely their concern.  That law should be available, not just to the Joint Committee on Legislation, but to the Houses of the Oireachtas in such a form that it can be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Legislation in making this review will have the advantage of the reports of the Select Committee of Seanad Éireann and the reports of the EEC Committee.  It will also have the value of its own experience over the past 12 months.  While the subject of delegated legislation has not been a subject of study or academic review by scholars in this country, I understand that Professor <Col N="621" /> Stout who is Professor of Political Science in Albany in the State of New York has just completed a review of Administrative Law in Ireland.  This work is now in manuscript.  This review, if available to the committee will certainly give them a very good starting point.  Really they will have quite an amount of working material.  It seems to me that there is absolutely no excuse for them not being able to report within two years.  Indeed, I wonder if in fact that time which is being given to them in this regard is not too long.</P>
    <P>If the committee feel that with their other work they can only occasionally give time to this question, I suggest that they face this question squarely.  If the Joint Committee on Legislation felt that it was impossible to do this work through a sub-committee of their own, I suggest they should have no hesitation in coming back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and seeking a change in their terms of reference and in the particular charge under this motion today whereby a sub-committee could be established which would have a core of members of the Joint Committee on Legislation but could also draw on other Members of the Oireachtas who would be interested in serving on this particular sub-committee in this <i>ad hoc</i> effort.  I do not think it was the intention when the committees of the Oireachtas were established 12 months ago &mdash; the new committees &mdash; that their membership should remain rigid.  This is a case in which we could apply a flexibility of membership, a flexibility of operation, which is certainly called for.  This reconnaisance, this study, should be made. When that is done we will have the opportunity in this House of having a well-informed debate on what is a critical problem of modern political life.  I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion and, as invited by the Leader of the House &mdash; I was going to do it anyway &mdash; I will confine my remarks largely to the part of the motion which calls for the examination of Irish Ministerial Regulations made under the European <Col N="622" /> Communities Act, 1972 and the Committee on Legislation to look at the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I very much welcome this because the power given to Irish Ministers under the European Communities Act exceeds the pre-existing powers of delegated legislation under domestic law and therefore they are powers that go beyond the particular extracts from the Irish cases which Senator Dooge has put on the record of the House, because a Minister is given power to implement the EEC provisions, whether it is necessary to implement in some manner the full application of a regulation or whether it is for the purpose of implementing a directive or other binding measure, through statutory instruments, to repeal or modify or change in any way in which it is deemed necessary an Act of the Oireachtas.  A statutory instrument can amend an Act of the Oireachtas, repeal, modify by changing interpretation or changing the pre-existing thrust or meaning of an Act of the Oireachtas.  This has been happening for more than a decade now, and it is urgent that we review the exercise of this power and whether there are adequate checks and balances in it.</P>
      <P>I would agree with Senator Dooge that either the Joint Committee on Legislation or a sub-committee appointed by them should not just confine themselves narrowly to the wording of the motion and should not just look at existing reports whether of the Select Committee of the Seanad on Statutory Instruments or of the Joint EEC Committee but should have discussions with members of those committees who have had experience of the kind of work which is involved and should look more broadly at the capacity of the committees to get on top of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of the sub-committee of the Joint EEC Committee known as the Oireachtas subcommittee which has been set up to examine the statutory instruments under the European Communities Act.  We have had considerable problems of keeping up-to-date with the backlog of these statutory instruments.  This is partly because of the <Col N="623" /> successive general elections, which meant that there was not a committee sitting for a sustained period.  Even without that there has been considerable difficulty in ensuring that we examine in a well-ordered way the statutory instruments under the European Communities Act.  This is very serious, because the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation has a special statutory function under the European Communities Amendment Act, 1973.  It is empowered to recommend the annulment of one of these statutory instruments.  That can cause a motion to be tabled in either House seeking the annulment of the particular statutory instrument, but that must be done within a year of when the statutory instrument was enacted.  There have been occasions when a motion to that effect has been tabled although there has not been any example of a statutory instrument being actually annulled by a vote taken in either House.</P>
    <P>It is important that we realise the very broad scope of the power given to Ministers in the European Communities Act, 1972.  It was deemed necessary at that time because there was a backlog of measures which would have to be introduced and adaptations to be made because of our membership of the European Community.  It was somewhat difficult to predict what the future volume of European Community provisions which we would have to enact would be. We are now in a better position in that we can reflect back on more than a decade of membership.  I would hope that this committee when it reviews the powers will set out criteria for the use of primary legislation in implementing the obligations of membership and complying with the terms of membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee itself has expressed the view on a number of occasions that certain measures should not have been introduced by secondary legislation but should have been introduced by primary legislation, by an Act of the Oireachtas, and has sought to establish, if you like, informal criteria.  It would be possible for this committee, in seriously reviewing the matter, to actually set out <Col N="624" /> strict criteria whereby it would be necessary for Ireland in complying with the obligations &mdash; and in particular of implementing a directive which had important implications in the area of company law or some other area &mdash; to do it only by primary legislation in order to give both Houses of the Oireachtas a full opportunity to examine the implications for Ireland of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I endorse what the Leader of the House has said about the importance of this subject matter.  I welcome the fact that there is to be a review of this kind.</P>

      <P>That the Terms of Reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation, constituted pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 6 July 1983 and the Order of Seanad Éireann of 7 July 1983 and subsequently amended pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 15 December 1983 and the Order of Seanad Éireann of 21 December 1983, be amended as follows:</P>
      <P>By the insertion of a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(14)  that the Joint Committee shall be empowered to take evidence in public for the purposes of paragraph 1 (d) and to include with any report which it may make minutes of such evidence&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>Item No. 2 is concerned also with the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation which was set up just under a year ago.  Under paragraph 1 (d) of its terms of reference the Joint Committee on Legislation is empowered to keep the law under review and formulate proposals for law reform and to report thereon to each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas in dealing with legislation the committee was empowered to hear evidence and to print such evidence and report on it to the Houses of the Oireachtas, <Col N="625" /> it was not empowered to do so when reviewing possible legislation.  The purpose of the motion before the House is to amend the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation so that the committee will be empowered to take evidence in public and to include in any report which it may make, minutes of the evidence taken before it in the course of such a review.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee recently decided to review the laws relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor under this paragraph of its terms of reference.  The committee is concerned that the absence of the power to take evidence in public and to include in its report minutes of evidence taken by it would preclude the committee from discharging in an effective or realistic manner its functions in regard to such a review of the state of the law.  Under Standing Orders of this House a committee has power to send for persons, papers and records and is empowered thereunder to take evidence in public but this particular Joint Committee does not have the powers.  The motion seeks to give it such powers.  The committee itself has specifically requested the amendment of its terms of reference in accordance with Motion No. 2 which is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee I would like to speak in support of the extension of the terms of reference in the manner already described by Senator Dooge.  If the Committee on Legislation is to perform a useful function it is important that for a substantial proportion of its time it would direct its efforts towards the area of law reform.  The proposal at present agreed or under discussion within the committee for the investigation of laws relating to intoxicating liquors is one good example of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of a greater degree of autonomy and independence to these committees by the Houses of the Oireachtas is also very important.  By that I do not mean a further extension of the terms of reference as envisaged here.  I believe that the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="626" /> must be willing to meet less frequently so as to allow the committees to examine the legislation and proposals which are under discussion, in an unhurried and appropriate fashion.  Something that has developed over the last 12 months on the examination of the work of these committees is the conflict between the participation in the public debates in the House of the Oireachtas to which a member of the committee belongs on the one hand and attendance at and participation, on a regular and committed basis, in simultaneous meetings of the committees, including the Committee on Legislation which is under discussion here.  That is something which we might, at a later stage, consider and see how we can get that balance right because I think it is not right yet.  This is a necessary prerequisite for the examination of something as complex as the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  In that regard it would be obviously very important to hear the evidence of those who are involved in the trade and those who are not involved in the trade, because of the operation of the law as it stands at present, and who are seeking its change for that reason.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse what Senator O'Leary has said in regard to the conflicts that have arisen between meetings of the committees and meetings of the Oireachtas.  The chairmen of the various committees have met in order to try to ensure that there will not be a clash between the committees themselves.  But even this has proved impossible.  If a committee wishes to meet once a fortnight then there is no real difficulty.  But if a committee meets once a week and wishes to meet within the three days, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, it is virtually impossible to avoid a conflict between the committees themselves.  We would have the position quite frequently of the two Houses of the Oireachtas being in session and two Joint Committees meeting at the same time. This is quite apart from our old standing committees which also have to fit in their meetings.  In their operation the committees have begun to adapt to this but further <Col N="627" /> adaptation is needed.  We are only slowly beginning to realise that the establishment of these committees to my mind, in so far as one can judge after 12 months, has been a distinct success.  But the process of adaptation, the process of ensuring that our whole system remains flexible, has not yet been completed.  We have to be aware of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  One thing that needs to be said is that all the work that the committees are doing will come to nought if there is not an adequate and fairly extensive response from the Government to the recommendations these committees make.  The committees can only make recommendations by and large, and whichever Government is in power we must have some assurance that the recommendations are going to be taken seriously and as far as possible implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>To resume my reply, I would like to say that I agree with what Senator Brendan Ryan has said.  We cannot have Members of the House spending a lot of time on these reports and then have no further action.  But I would say very firmly that there is an intermediate stage between committee proposals and consideration by the Government.  These are committees of the Houses and their reports should come here for debate. After thorough debate here and the recommendations of the Houses, it should then go to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I would like to say that I arranged that an inquiry would be sent to the clerks of all the joint committees asking them what reports would be available in the coming months so that these could be taken into account in planning the programme of this House.  It certainly is my intention that all of the reports should be brought forward for discussion here.  The position is that so far we do not have these reports but my anticipation would be that by September there would be a substantial number of reports from the committees.  My hope would be that these would be thoroughly debated in this House.  Of course that is going to aggravate the problem of finding <Col N="628" /> time and of the conflict of time.  But it must be part of the system that these reports are fully debated, and that question is not being neglected.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the period for reporting back to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown be extended to the 1st December, 1984.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that we have two types of committees under the new system. There are committees which are considered to have sufficient work that they certainly will last until the end of the period of this Oireachtas and perhaps beyond it.  There are also committees appointed to deal <i>ad hoc</i> with particular problems.  Whereas the Legislation Committee that we have been dealing with under Motion Nos. 1 and 2, belongs to the former, the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown belongs to the latter type of committee.</P>
      <P>It was appointed in July 1983.  It held its first meeting in September 1983 but it did not have available to it permanent staff until November 1983.  Anyone with experience of these committees will realise that while a good deal of preliminary work can be done without permanent staff, a committee only really gets a life of its own and only really settles down to make real progress in regard to its work when in fact it gets permanent staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that I think it was unfortunate in regard to all the committees that this particular transitional problem of having staff established did in fact take so long.  In the case of this committee there were six months between the time of its appointment and the time in which staff was available.  That was a transitional problem.  We hope that it will not happen again.  Many of the committees now have a full time clerk as well as occasional expert staff.  In the case of committees that carry on we would hope that the staff will carry on from one <Col N="629" /> Oireachtas to another.  In the case of the <i>ad hoc</i> committees we hope that these people would be available once one <i>ad hoc</i> committee has finished in order to work or be replaced by somebody else in the <i>ad hoc</i> committee that would then be set up.</P>
    <P>There are other problems of this type.  Senator Robinson mentioned them in particular when we were establishing these committees a year ago.  I would like to refer to one of them now.  That is the question of working out how we avoid delay in the establishment of committees when a new Oireachtas is elected.  This is a point to which we could all turn our minds and ensure that we do not have the difficulties which she mentioned about elections rapidly succeeding themselves. We had the position where a committee, as important as the Committee on Legislation under the EEC was not meeting. In regard to this case, the request has now been made by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, which were asked to report within 12 months &mdash; which would mean that they should report next month &mdash; for an extension from 12 months to 18 months.</P>
    <P>They have been working quite hard since November and we have a number of members of that committee present in the Chamber and I am sure they will assure us of that fact.  My understanding is that the committee have already considered the problem of the age of marriage, the question of formalities for marriage and the law of nullity.  At the moment, they are examining the question of judicial separation and they feel that, in order to complete their work, they should consider such questions as the structure of family law courts, the question of maintenance, the questions of trustee and guardianship, the question of family property and the question of foreign judgments.  I think in view of the difficulties of start up in regard to this particular committee as in others that their request for an extension is reasonable. I think that any request for an extension beyond the extension now being made would not be reasonable, and I would hope that the committee would <Col N="630" /> not be encouraged to think that if the House agrees to this particular extension they could come back and look for another one.  My attitude might be quite different on that second occasion.  I recommend that the period for reporting back be extended to 1 December 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply regret the fact that it has been necessary to come to the House and look for an extension of the period of work of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, but as a member of that committee, I can see the necessity for this extension and I agree with Senator Dooge that we must ensure that we complete the work by 1 December next.</P>
      <P>There were two principal reasons why the committee were not able to discharge their very important and very urgent tasks within the calender year, which would have ended next month.  The first was the reason referred to by Senator Dooge, that although the committee were established in July and had their first meeting in September, it was not until November that we had some staffing, and not until considerably later that we had the legal expertise seconded to the committee which was necessary for them to begin to take on the very complex and difficult task of formulating proposals for reform of marriage and family law. I think that was a disgrace &mdash; there is no other word for it.  You a Leas-Chathaoirligh, are also a member of that committee, and you expressed a similar view when the committee were sitting week after week and were not able to make any progress.  This brought into question how serious we were about the role of these committees and what tasks they could perform.  Happily, after far too long a start up period, as Senator Dooge has called it, the committee got the minimum secretarial and legal expertise to enable them to begin to take on and start the tasks set out in their terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason why the committee have taken longer than was envisaged was because of the flood of written submissions. As a member of that committee, I know that of all the committees <Col N="631" /> that I have served on or am serving on, this is the one which takes up most space on shelves behind my desk &mdash; I have now run into another set of shelves of box files of written submissions from groups and bodies and even from individuals, giving very detailed accounts of the difficulties they have had, either in their marriage or in their family situation, and in particular the difficulties they have had in their interaction with the legal system, with the courts and with the law generally. This flood of written submissions has certainly justified the need for a careful and structured examination of this area of law.  If any of us had any doubt, which I do not think we should have had the extent to which individuals and groups within the community have responded and taken the opportunity to make submissions to the committee has justified and indeed reinforced the significance of the work of the committee.  Apart from these written submissions a very large number of groups and bodies wished to make oral presentations to the committee. That required the committee sitting on a weekly basis and on some occasions twice a week, to hear the oral evidence being put forward by these groups. Although there was inevitably repetition and it was a very tedious and time-consuming task for the members of the committee, I think it has been a very helpful and important learning experience for the members of the committee, because the very repetition both of the number of criticisms and the number of proposals for reform will strengthen the hand of the committee in coming up with actual proposals.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge indicated, the committee have already made proposals in areas such as the age of marriage, the formalities in relation to marriage, the area of nullity, and they are at the moment considering the remedy of judicial separation, and next month will look at the area of dissolution of marriage &mdash; the question of whether we should remove the prohibition on divorce.  I hope that the committee will spend considerable time examining all aspects of this subject and will sit regularly during the recess, presumably with the exception <Col N="632" /> of the month of August.  There is no reason why the committee should not sit through the month of July and come back in early September to resume this work if we are going to come up with the well structured, well thought through and well considered proposals for reform in these areas which have been called for.  There is another area which will also require very careful and detailed consideration, that is whether we are going to have, as has been almost universally recommended, a proper system of family courts, conciliation services and how these will operate.  Although I deeply regret that it has been necessary to look for an extension of time, I think the work of the committee is of prime importance. The committee are beginning to produce results in terms of proposals for change. If we are prepared to sit regularly throughout the period when the two Houses of the Oireachtas are in recess, we will have no difficulty in completing our work by 1 December, which is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>In view of the explanation of the position given by Senator Dooge, and expanded by Senator Robinson, I welcome the necessity to have this time extended.  This is a very important committee, perhaps the most important of all committees.  I am glad the work is not being rushed through and that sufficient time is being given to deliberations. I am equally pleased to hear it is expected that no further extension will be needed beyond December and I look forward to the report at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of this committee which was established on 12 July last I support this motion.  Their terms of reference are now widely known but it is important to restate them in the context of the request to extend the date of the report.  The committee have been asked to consider the protection of marriage and family life and to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage.  The terms of reference also require the committee to report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas after one year.  This was an indication of the recognition <Col N="633" /> by the Government of the importance of this whole area and of the urgency attached to it.  It is also a measure of the realism of the Government which established this committee and requested them to make their report within one year.  I regret that it has been found necessary for the reasons already outlined to seek this extension.  As we moved into the work of the committee, it became apparent that to do justice to the subject and to examine in-depth the very complex problems arising from it, coupled with the difficulty in obtaining the necessary expertise in the area of staff, it was necessary to get an extension of the time.</P>
      <P>The motion reflects the complexity and importance of the work which the committee are doing and the need to provide a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the steps which the committee feel are necessary to face up to the profound changes which are influencing marriage and family life in Ireland today.  We met for the first time on 14 September last.  At subsequent meetings we agreed to consider the factors which contribute to the breakdown of marriage.  We had the very great pleasure of inviting a renowned expert in the area of marriage, Dr. Jack Dominian.  He spoke to the committee and we had the pleasure of having an informal discussion with him over lunch.  This was the starting point for the committee because this expert, Dr. Jack Dominian, with enormous compassion, experience and insight, set us off on the train of our work.  Following that we invited interested parties to submit their views in writing to the committee by placing notices in national and local newspapers.  We were quite overwhelmed with the volume of response which this invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the experiences of Senator Robinson in finding space to accommodate all this material and files.  Apart from the submissions made by professionals working in the field and bodies and societies concerned with the area, the flood of personal case histories was a revelation to me because, in my normal work, I do not come up against anything like the volume of human misery which was <Col N="634" /> unfolded in these letters &mdash; many of them bravely and courageously appended their names and addresses, others preferred to remain anonymous.  The welter of unhappiness and distress caused by marital breakdown in our community was disturbing.</P>
    <P>Over 80 representative bodies, including religious denominations, political parties, social organisations and interest groups, made written submissions.  I would pay tribute to them, because they involved themselves in meticulous research and considerable effort.  It is very valuable to members of the committee to have this resource material which will be the basis for some hard information in the area of marital breakdown, because it has been found difficult to actually collate statistics and hard factual information.  Not a great deal of research has been done in this area.  We are really only beginning to face up to the problem. The efforts these bodies made to make the submissions to the all-party committee will I hope form the basis for much needed and valuable research in the area of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>Individual submissions totalled something in the area of 600 and they were quite varied in their approach.  Some of them were closely and well argued, and others were personal accounts of how the law affected them and their own particular marital and personal strife.  We decided that some of the written submissions required oral amplification, and particularly for those of us who are not professionals in the legal field or in the social work field: it was valuable to call in many of these bodies and to have the opportunity of questioning them and probing some of the points they made in their written submissions.</P>
    <P>We invited some 26 organisations to attend our meetings.  The groups which the committee met are: the Presbyterian Church, AIM, the Group for Family Law Reform, the Order of the Knights of St. Columbanus, Dr. Jack Dominian, the Divorce Action Group, the Family Life Research Centre, the Irish Commission for the Laity, solicitors from the law centres, Dr. Barnárdo's, The Workers' Party, the Church of Ireland, the Incorporated <Col N="635" /> Law Society, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Irish Theological Commission, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Gingerbread, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, The Family Law Reform Group of Dublin and Cork, the Irish Association of Social Workers, the Council for the Status of Women, the Dublin Regional Marriage Tribunal, and a new organisation called DADS.  By any standard that is a very wide ranging representative group and there were similarities and differences in the views they expressed to the committee but meeting them was a useful and necessary exercise. It gave members of the committee an opportunity to clarify doubts in the written submissions and to test the credibility of these different organisations in the face of oral examinations.</P>
    <P>This was all extremely time consuming and very often tedious and the substantive work of the committee was set back as a result.  I am absolutely convinced it was worth while in that it gave members of the committee a very sound base from which to proceed in their work.</P>
    <P>In the area of substantive issues, the committee have completed their deliberations on the causes of marriage breakdown, the age of marriage and the law of nullity.  We worked on the law of judicial separation, that is, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> last night.  Next week we will be meeting for a day-and-a-half to consider the area of dissolution, which is really a question of grasping the nettle in this instance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of outstanding issues.  They include the structure of the courts in administering family law.  There is certainly a consensus emerging from the committee that we would like to see the establishment of family courts.  We need to consider the existing remedies of maintenance, guardianship and custody, administration of marital property, barring orders and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in family law cases.  If we are to discharge our brief comprehensively, the date for reporting back to the Houses must be extended, which is the substance of this motion. The date 1 December was selected by the committee as the earliest date by which <Col N="636" /> the committee could realistically address themselves to the remaining tasks and finalise the report.  I would like to assure Senator Dooge that we are working very hard and that we will continue to do so in the months ahead, excluding August.  I am confident we will have our report ready for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 December.  The committee are determined that this urgent and vitally important task will be completed by that date.  I would like to pay tribute to our clerk, Mr. Rory McCabe and our legal adviser, Mr. Durkan, for their invaluable assistance, and our chairman, Deputy Willie O'Brien, whose kind and wise guidance ensures that the committee are kept on the right track.  I support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to break the unanimity of this House but I am afraid I am going to have to do it.  We have been hearing a debate about a committee set up one year ago, with very cosy all-party agreement. There was a great deal of relief in this House when this committee were set up for one reason and one reason only &mdash; and Senator Bulbulia was the only person who touched on it &mdash; because the issue of divorce would be referred to that committee. Senator Bulbulia has just admitted that next month they are going to grasp the nettle of divorce, one year after the committee were set up.  It is an absolute disgrace that this House should congratulate itself on the work it has done in this committee when they have for so long avoided the issue which they were set up to tackle.  I am not surprised.  It was predicted by some of us last year that this was exactly what would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also predicted by us, but diverted and deflected by Government speakers last year, that this committee would come back to this House looking for an extension at this time.  I believe in the sincerity of Senator Dooge when he said that he would not be inclined to give them an extension in December.  I am sure he would not, because it would be embarrassing for them, but I do not see why they should not have an extension in December if they are going to have one now; and I do not see why they should <Col N="637" /> not have an extension next June if they can have one now, because the report they produce at the end will have no legislative effect whatsoever.  The only power the committee have is to report to both Houses.  We saw a 1966 report which made recommendations on marital breakdown and that is still in the Library of Leinster House and in every other library in this country and it still has not been acted upon nearly 20 years later. The committee have a cheek to come back to his House and ask for an extension when, one year later, they have not even tackled what they regard as the nub of the problem.  These committees cost a lot of public money and a lot of public representatives' time, and if they are not going to tackle the nub of the problem after one year they should be abolished. That committee when they were set up were bogus; they are a bogus committee now and will be bogus when they report.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the excuse of Senator Dooge that there had been difficulties setting up this committee.  This committee was set up last July, eight months after the Government came into power. For them to say, having been set up last July, that they had difficulties in setting up again, is absurd.  Why was there no permanent staff?  Who is governing the country?  Why set up a committee before it was decided whether or not there should be a permanent staff?  It is no good saying we set it up after a long time and then we had difficulties.  These difficulties should have been anticipated.  There may have been difficulties in actually getting all-party agreement to set up the committee but they had plenty of time to decide the terms of reference and whether they were going to have a permanent staff.  It is a very weak excuse. This extension is purely a dodge in regard to divorce.  The other problems which the committee have considered are subsidiary, and although the terms of reference of the committee do not mention divorce deliberately, this committee were set up purely and simply to dodge that subject.</P>
    <P>Let me anticipate something else.  They will successfully dodge that subject because whatever recommendations they <Col N="638" /> make the Government in power, will sit on them, even if they can agree, for a very long time.  It is indicative and symbolic of the attitude of this Government to the liberal issues that they are now asking for more time.  What happened to this so-called liberal, left, radical Govrernment when they got into power? They ask for an extension on divorce and produce a sectarian amendment.  What has happened to the Bill on family planning which was promised, and two years later has not been seen in either House of the Oireachtas?  This is a question to the Government and not to the all-party committee: if this all-party committee are doing such important work, why can we not have a referendum on divorce parallel or before they report?  Would it not be more powerful and more useful to that committee &mdash; if they are going to make recommendations of any value, which I doubt &mdash; if they knew what the result of a referendum on divorce was before they produced their final report?</P>

      <P>I am discussing the reasons which I think are very relevant why the committee should not be given this extention. If the committee are doing so much work and if they knew they would be asking for an extension, which has been quite obvious for at least three or four months, why did they not do the House the courtesy of producing an interim report on the work they have done, instead of coming blandly to the House knowing full well they would get an extension by an all-party conspiracy?</P>

      <P>I support the request for an extension of the time limit on this committee to report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not accept, as Senator Ross claimed, that this is a bogus committee because those of us who are members of that committee realise the volume of work they have undertaken, the huge pile of submissions, both oral and written, they have examined, and all the other matters which the committee have been dealing with since they were <Col N="639" /> set up last year.  We got off to a bad start because we did not have the required staff, but that problem has been overcome.</P>
      <P>It is important that the committee discuss in detail every aspect of marriage breakdown.  It is a very big problem as we know from the submissions which have been made.  It is not something on which the committee should rush to produce a final report and for that reason it is important that we be given a little extra time to prepare our report and to submit it on 1 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to Senator Ross' comments.  Obviously he did not look at the original terms of reference of this committee.  In the Seanad debate of 6 July 1983, at column 831, the membership of the committee was decided and the terms of reference included the consideration of the protection of marriage and family life, the examination of the problems which followed the breakdown of marriage, and the committee were to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a little bit naive to think that this committee should confine itself to one particular area in this vital social problem area.  I agree that there are major problems in this area, but to suggest for one moment that just the narrow area that the Senator has defined is the answer to all the problems is naive.  The people of Dublin decided that was their attitude to the problem also in a recent poll which was carried out.  It is unfair to this committee, which have been working extremely hard.  I am not privy to the committee's work because I am not a member but I have read with interest many of the submissions that have been made and the way they have handled them.  The question of divorce will be discussed by them and, as has been outlined by Senator Bulbulia, it is a problem. It may not be the answer to many of the problems that are involved in marital breakdown.  It certainly is not an answer to the problem of the protection of the marital state and family life.  Because of <Col N="640" /> that this committee should be given every facility by this House to ensure that when they do report to us, which they are required to do by order of this House, then we will have an opportunity as a House of the Oireachtas to discuss the total implications of their work and what legislative measures will be necessary to overcome the problems.  It is in that spirit that there is unanimity on all sides, with the exception of Senator Ross, that this committee should be allowed to have sufficient time to do this job.</P>

      <P>I would like to respond to a few points that have been made.  Firstly, there has been some discussion about the question of the start-up problems of this committee.  There was a very real problem in regard to all the committees.  Senator Ross indicated that could have been avoided but we must face the reality.  He indicated that it should have been possible to ensure that staff would be available even before the committees had been set up.  That is completely unrealistic.  It was a tough job to get the Department of the Public Service to agree to staff after the committees had been set up.  Those of us who are members of these committees were of one mind in regard to the necessity of having permanent staff dedicated to the committees set up without delay.  We had a real battle.  Ultimately we got the staff. If we had said: &ldquo;We should not set up the committees, we should not pass motions in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, we should go along to the Department of Public Service and say we are thinking of setting up committees, we are going to set up committees, we are going to bring in a motion in one month's time to set up a committee, please give us staff,&rdquo; we would have got absolutely nowhere.  The only way of achieving what was ultimately ahcieved was to get agreement, and in regard to this particular committee it was not easy initially to get all party agreement in regard to the scope of the committee.  That was the first hurdle that was overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hurdles in regard to staff were <Col N="641" /> overcome.  Maybe we knocked the hurdle a couple of times but ultimately we scrambled over it.</P>
    <P>What we want to do with these committees is to make sure this does not happen again.  Already the Leader of Dáil Éireann is taking up the question of trying to ensure that there is a permanency in regard to these committees, that the transitional problems do not occur as we go from one Oireachtas to its successor. I will be joining with him in urging the Government to ensure that this is rectified.  We need continuity of committees, we need continuity of staff.  That is what we should be turning our minds to in this regard.</P>
    <P>The request of this committee is a reasonable one.  Senator Robinson and Senator Bulbulia mentioned the volume of submissions which have been received. Senator Bulbulia stated that the volume of these submissions was a reflection of the volume of human misery.  Everyone on all sides of this House is concerned about the volume of human misery, in regard to the strains on families, strains on partners, in the modern world.  Quite naturally there are differing views as to how this problem should be met.  There are differing views as to what is the balance between the alleviation of this human misery and the general social effects of a change in regard to what has been for many hundreds of years the traditional view of the vast majority of the people in this country in regard to marriage.  Incidentally, it was not always so.  If one looks back over the history of divorce it is a most interesting one.  Prior to the 11th century when the situation in regard to divorce in the Catholic Church was not the same as it has been in recent centuries, it was very often said in Ireland that one should seek an Irish divorce rather than a Roman divorce because an Irish divorce was easier to get.  In this context Rome has conquered and we have taken the Roman view of divorce in latter centuries.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made two specific suggestions. He made the suggestion that this committee should have brought in an interim report and that we should have <Col N="642" /> an immediate referendum on divorce. The first of those suggestions is inadvisable and the second suggestion could possibly be disastrous.  My position on divorce has been clear for many years.  I signed the report on the review of the Constitution in 1967 which was the first time that public representatives, of all parties, unanimously declared that the constitutional prohibition on divorce should go.  I make no defence of the substitution that was made at that time. I supported that report on the grounds that it was for more important to break through the psychological barrier of removing the constitutional prohibition, that was the primary thing, and accordingly I was less concerned about what was agreed as a substitute.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the reality.  Senator Ross says there should be an immediate referendum on divorce.  To my view the probable result of doing this would be to postpone for ten years the removal of the prohibition in the Constitution.  The people of Ireland are compassionate people.  When the reality of the present position in marital breakdown is brought home to the Irish people, I believe there will be &mdash; it may be slower than many of us would like &mdash; a substantial shifting of opinion which will result in the removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce and subsequently the enactment of carefully limited divorce legislation. But an attempt to do that before a substantial majority are convinced of its necessity is to copperfasten the present situation.  I think that would be utterly disastrous.</P>
    <P>Equally, it would be highly inadvisable if the committee had brought in a report on the matter it has been discussing, the causes of marital breakdown, without going on to really grasp the nettle &mdash; the phrase has been used in this debate today &mdash; because then there would be a real temptation to postpone that later discussion. I think the committee has made the right decision, saying it has been given broad terms of reference and that it should come in with a broadly based report.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that I believe the committee should be given these extra <Col N="643" /> months to allow it to complete its work over the whole front.  As I said before, if the committee show signs of delay &mdash; the proposal is the committee will meet during July and will meet during September &mdash; and if the committee do so and honestly set down their views I believe they can produce a report by the end of the year.  I will guarantee that if that report is produced there will be no delay in debating it in this House.  It is a question with which I think all public representatives are concerned, but in regard to it it is foolish to think that all the Government have to do is to decide there should be an immediate referendum on the question of divorce and that this is going to solve the problem.  It will solve nothing.  It will make the task of social advancement in this regard more difficult rather than easier.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned yesterday evening I had almost completed my remarks on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I outlined &mdash; very briefly &mdash; our opposition on this side of the House to the dissolution of the Wool Council.  Because this council have done such a good job over the past 15 years in promoting Irish wool, in improving the quality of the fleece, in improving the marketing of wool, I think it is a very retrograde step now to have this body dissolved.  There is still a job for this council to do.  I would prefer to see their responsibilities broadened rather than to have them dissolved altogether.  I outlined a few areas where I thought the council could become involved, in promoting the sale of Irish woollen garments, Irish carpets, Irish tweed and all the other things that are so well known worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheep industry and the wool industry have become very important in terms <Col N="644" /> of national income.  There is an opportunity there for strengthening that, particularly with the entry to the French market of our Irish lamb.  It is obvious that with a little bit of encouragement the sheep flock will increase over the next few years, because when farmers and producers see an opportunity of increasing their profit margins naturally they will turn their eyes towards that particular area.  Sheep in the last few years have proved highly profitable.  There is a lot of work to be done in the area of increasing our flock numbers, and here An Foras Talúntais have done an excellent job in helping to produce more lambs.  They should be encouraged and helped in every way by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I am opposing the dissolution of the Wool Council.  Even at this stage perhaps the Minister and the Government should have a rethink on the whole matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is necessarily much conflict between what the Minister said in introducing this Bill and what Senator Hussey has said now. In saying that he opposed the abolition of the Wool Council Senator Hussey referred to the great work which they have done.  But when he went on to speak about it he was talking about the work of establishment.  He talked about the way in which they had gone into a situation, where the wool marketing trade was badly organised, they set down standards, they looked for markets and they transformed this sector of the agricultural industry.  There is nothing in what the Minister has said which denies that.  The question is not whether An Chomhairle Olla did a good job when they were established. There is absolutely no question about that.  Everybody acknowledges that, in fact, they did a splendid job.  The real question here is whether, having transformed this sector of the agricultural industry, in maintaining things is best done under an independent council or under the Department.  Let us look at the situation.  In fact it has been operated inside the Department for the last 12 months.  Has there been a falling off?  Has <Col N="645" /> the good work of An Chomhairle Olla been undone?  No, the situation is quite otherwise.  The situation is that production is up over the last 12 months, prices are up over the last 12 months, exports are up over the last 12 months.  The transfer back to the Department has not resulted in any falling off.  It may well be &mdash; I certainly would hope it would not happen &mdash; that this will not be maintained. But I submit that if we look at it there is no evidence that the change &mdash; the Minister is now giving legislative effect to what has already happened administratively &mdash; is a change for the worse.  I do not think the Minister or anybody on this side of the House would hesitate if, in fact, in the future we saw the wool industry which is vital to the west of Ireland &mdash; Senator Hussey knows this far better than I do but I agree with him &mdash; and it is an area in which we have high class production and we all hope that now with what we hope is the final solution to the problem of breaching the illegal defences of the French in regard to lamb there will be a further advance in regard to the wool market.  I do not want it to be indicated that because we support the Minister on this particular Bill that that is, in any sense, a criticism of what An Chomhairle Olla did during their first two years.  They did a splendid job.  That must be acknowledged. But the job that has to be done now is a different sort of job from the job they did so well.  The signs are over the past 12 months that this job can be done more economically inside the Department. If that ceases to be true the Minister will get plenty of criticism from this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with Senator Hussey.  In the distant past I was involved in sheep herding and sheep shearing and I recall that at that time infestation was a very big problem.  It posed a serious threat not only to the wool but to the health and lives of the animals.  The fact that this problem has been solved and is under control may be due to the work of An Chomhairle Olla. I recall also that at that time the warm <Col N="646" /> summers were a contributory cause of the problem and it is new to me to learn that the good weather this year has resulted in a good clip of wool.  It shows how people can lose touch and the relevance of continuing education, which we spoke about on the Dentists Bill yesterday. In any profession it is important to keep in touch with developments and this also applies to farming.  It is necessary to apply at least a half day every week to new developments and new trends to keep abreast of developments.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand how one man can adequately replace An Chomhairle Olla.  The sum of £100,000 saved seems very little by comparison with the £11 million income which the Minister spoke about.  New spheres should be found for An Chomhairle Olla and one of them would be in having more of the Irish clip used in the country.  The Minister told us that over 70 per cent of the Irish clip is exported, 65 per cent going to Great Britain.  Much work could be done in this area.  I have said that instead of abolishing the Land Commission, who have done their work well over the years, new work could be found for them and one of them would be in the land leasing area.  Instead of abolishing An Chomhairle Olla new work could be found for it within this area.  I am opposed to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Dooge I feel that An Chomhairle Olla served their purpose well and have made a big improvement on the quality of the wool because of the information they gave to farmers on how to handle wool.  At this stage, farmers are fairly well educated and will be able to carry on.  I would like to compliment the Department on the information they give with regard to prices. Every farmer in the country is now well informed about the market and knows the prices in Bradford where the big sales of wool are held and knows what he should be getting from his local merchant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have a look at the question of sheep scab.  We still have outbreaks in different parts of the country.  I would also like him to look at the question of identification of sheep at <Col N="647" /> marts for dipping.  One certificate is given to the flock at dipping time and that does not necessarily say that all the sheep have been presented for dipping.  The question of a dye or some form of identification to prove that sheep had been dipped should be examined.  It is not a good system where it is left to the local authority.</P>
    <P>We have sheep dipping committees and I am a member of one of the sheep dipping advisory committees.  Nothing concrete is being done apart from talking about it.  I do not agree with too many inspectors but we should have a better inspectorate to look at sheep scab and some of the money that is spent on what I consider to be a waste of time by sheep dipping committees could be spent by the Department on the inspection of sheep at marts.  The sheep area is one of the few areas where we can expand in agriculture. We are coming to the end of the good times for beef and we are almost at the end of the line in dairying but in the sheep trade we can go a long way.  The EEC are only 70 per cent self-sufficient in lamb and if more effort could be concentrated on our breeding policy we could improve the lambing rates and bring it up to one lamb per sheep.  Our hill flocks have a lambing rate of only 50 per cent.  If we could get the percentage up to 80 per cent we would be going a long way towards improving the lot of farmers.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Senators for their contributions on this Bill.  I do not propose to spend too much time on a speech at the end of Second Stage but there are a number of factors I would like to place on record.  Like all Senators in their contributions I would go to great lengths to pay a very sincere tribute to the outgoing members of An Chomhairle Olla.  I think it is only fair that we should roll back the record and the history that was involved and the environment in which this board was formulated some years ago.  At that time, our sheep industry, particularly our wool industry, was absolutely in a shambles. That was the time when Irish wool had a bad name all over the world &mdash; it had a bad name in Ireland for that matter. We were producing an inferior quality product that nobody wanted and it was displayed in the worst conditions.  For that reason all the interests involved then were brought together, primarily for an education process.</P>
      <P>I would agree with all Senators that the role of the Wool Council at that stage has been fulfilled.  Now, the basics involved in the promotion of wool, market intelligence, etc., are on a par with anything I have seen in any country in Europe. That is not that the learning process should not continue.  Through a job I had ten years ago with Macra na Feirme I had the pleasure or organising two or three all-Ireland sheep-shearing finals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Wool Council were concerned there was a huge educational job to be done.  I am of the opinion that there is not a sheep farmer in Ireland who does not understand the problems that will beset him if he decides to present wool of inferior quality for sale.  It will hit him in the pocket, which is something <Col N="649" /> that appeals to all people irrespective of what line of business, agricultural or industrial, he is in.  There is a premium for good wool, and it is against that background that the Wool Council have been fulfilling the functions for which they were established.  Certain important functions which were performed by the Wool Council should be continued.  I will outline them briefly.  One of the most important things in the entire wool business over the years &mdash; it always reminds me of the stock exchange &mdash; is that the world market for wool always has been a most remarkable place to trade, with ups and downs and for no apparent reason most of the time.</P>
    <P>Until the market intelligence reports of the Wool Council came into operation the problem was that many things could have happened in Bradford and, indeed, in other centres in England and all over Europe and if, for instance, there was a good steady trade at an upward level of prices, that information did not percolate back to the Irish sheep farmer until it was too late.  On many occasions down through the years farmers sold wool under its true value.  Because of market intelligence we have now adopted and which was pursued by the Wool Council through news bulletins and newspaper reports what happens in the great sale in Bradford today will be transmitted through the airwaves in Ireland that evening. That is a very important service and I propose to continue it.  Yesterday and last week it was transmitted on the airwaves that the wool trade in Bradford was on a rising trend.  That manifested itself at many of the wool buyers' premises in Ireland 12 hours later and the price of wool jumped by 2p per lb.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of wool handling facilities around the country is concerned it is not enough to say, nor is it true to say, that now it is a one man band.  The one man in question is an expert on all matters relating to wool, but when you consider that there are many agricultural officers around the country who carry out <Col N="650" /> inspections of wool buyers' premises it can be seen that there are many people involved in the whole area of the wool industry.  From an education point of view, new courses are being organised in the sheep areas by ACOT.  I had the pleasure a couple of months ago of presenting certificates at Maam Cross to people who had completed a 60-hour course on sheep husbandry.  This course obviously incorporated matters relating to wool.  This type of activity is an extension to the work done by the Wool Council.  In that sense the great work carried out by the Wool Council has been completed in that sense.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of their work that should be continued.  I agree with what Senator Dooge said and I guarantee to the House that if we find for one reason or another that the best interests of wool producers are not being met, I will seriously look at the situation that may develop to see what would be best in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to place on the record of the House that the sheep industry is on very firm footing.  We have access to the lucrative French market.  We must ensure, of course, at all times that we have the type of quality the market requires.  With a 6 per cent increase in sheep numbers this year we will have more wool to sell in the future.  I am told by my advisers that the increase we now see in the national flock will continue.  In the future wool will be of more significance and importance to the incomes of many small farmers around the country. It is against that background that I believe the Bill before us will not mean in any way that any sheep farmer will be worse off.  Because of what has happened in the last 12 months the sheep trade is in good condition.  I will give the House the undertaking that in the years to come, if for any reason we find that the best interests of the wool producers are not being served, I will look at it.</P>

This has brought about a high risk of death or injury particularly to children.  The illegal blocking of entrances to the estates and side roads has interfered with the rights of both residents in the area and the travelling people.  The mass rally planned for Saturday could further escalate tension and the risk of violence.

      <P>On the Business of the House, I promised to give the latest information that I had in regard to the business for next week.  It is proposed to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.  In regard to the business which we will have there are two matters which must pass before the recess.  One is the Irish Steel Bill which is a Money Bill and the other is the reference of the Bankruptcy Bill, which was circulated quite a long time ago, to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  It is necessary for that to be done so that the Joint Committee on Legislation can consider the matter during the recess.  In regard to other legislation it is thought appropriate that the following Bills should be dealt with by the Seanad before the recess: the Funds of Suitors Bill, 1984; the Landlord and Tenant Bill and the Road Traffic Bill. There are four other Bills which may or may not fall to be dealt with before the recess.  One of those is the Copyright Bill which is on Committee Stage.  There is some difficulty in regard to Government amendments on this.  If the difficulties are overcome the Copyright Bill would be taken before the recess.  There are also at the moment in the Dáil three Bills which might possibly come to us.  Those are the Air Transport Bill, the Criminal Justice Bill and the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  If these Bills come to us, in the case of the Air Transport Bill, it might well be disposed of.  In regard to the Misuse of Drugs Bill, the Seanad might well think that the urgency of the matter here would also suggest that it be disposed of.  With regard to the Criminal Justice Bill, I do not think there would be any question of that being completed by the summer recess.  The only question then to be decided is whether the Second Stage, or indeed part of the Second Stage, should be taken before the recess.  That is the position as I know it at the moment. Also, it would be appropriate if the House completed the debate on the motion on developments in the EEC before the recess.</P>

The Criminal Justice Bill should be left until the autumn.  I cannot see the relevance of bringing it in and spending a half a day or one day on it if we are not going to complete Second Stage.  We should come back early and discuss it and give as much time as possible to it so as to do justice to that Bill. It is a complex Bill.  It has been amended in the Dáil.  We will not know until Report Stage has been completed what the final Bill will be.  I do not think that we should attempt to start a discussion on that Bill until we have had a recess to give us time to have a look at it and the changes that have been made so that we could decide on our attitude to them.  It seems as if somebody is trying to push through the Air Transport Bill.  I sincerely hope that it does not go through in this session of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>One question in regard to the motions on the EEC, I have been asked whether people who have spoken on item No. 5 will be able to come in again since there has been a change, in other words there has been an amalgamation of two motions.  If people who have spoken on the first one would like to speak again, will they be allowed to do so since there has been an amalgamation of two motions?</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for being as forthcoming as he can possibly be on the business. I am very grateful to him for an indication that the Criminal Justice Bill is not going to be rushed through or used to keep us here for the whole summer.  I fully agree with Senator Lanigan that it is far too important and complex an issue to be dealt with until we have had time to reflect on it.  It has been substantially amended and I understand that it is going to be further amended in the Dáil. Therefore we need a considerable amount of time to discuss it.  I am grateful to the Leader of the House for the amount of information he gave us.  He <Col N="655" /> has obviously worked very hard to get that amount of information.</P>

      <P>In regard to the points made, I would like to take up first of all the point on the sittings next week. It has been impossible to find a consensus in the House as to what should be the appropriate sitting days when we sit for more than one day.  This week we met on Wednesday and again today.  The proposal for next week was to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.  This was so that we would give equal justice or injustice to all those who have difficulty on Tuesday and those who have difficulty on Thursday.  I would consider the question of sitting on Thursday but to sit on Friday might create difficulties for a number of Senators because there are a number of public bodies who meet on Fridays.  I certainly will consider the matter and I will discuss it with the representatives of the other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Criminal Justice Bill, Senators should realise that if the Bill passes the Dáil either next week or the week after, this House must deal with it within 90 days.  That would mean, for example, if it passes in the first week of July in the Dáil, then we must complete our discussion on it by the first week in October.  The reason behind the suggestion that we might start the discussion on the Bill is that the Minister's opening speech, the opening response of the Opposition and the opening speeches of the Government parties could be made and that much time would be saved from September.  We would not then find ourselves having to crowd the Committee Stage or Report Stage because of the necessity to complete it early in October. I have discussed with the Minister the question of coming back early in September. But one must appreciate the Minister's position.  Ireland is now assuming the Presidency of the EEC.  August is a blank month as far as the EEC, as an organisation, is concerned.  In fact the first and second week of September will be very busy weeks for Irish Ministers who will be holding the chairmanships of the individual Council of Ministers.  So <Col N="656" /> the Minister might well have difficulty in coming in in the first or second week of September.  There are many complex factors here.  While I would say that it might be looked at in the abstract, the best thing might be to leave it over and for the Seanad to resume in the first week in September so that it would then have a month in which to do Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage. There are in fact advantages from the point of view of this House in devoting one day or portion of a day to the opening of the Second Stage.  None of this can be made any firmer until we know whether Dáil Éireann is going to complete its consideration of the Criminal Justice Bill next week or indeed the week after.</P>
    <P>There is one other question in regard to whether we should try to sit next week and wipe everything off.  This might make it difficult for us to take the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  Some Senators would be anxious that this Bill might become law.  This Bill has been ordered in the Dáil for Committee Stage next Tuesday.  It will in fact be taken when the Dáil comes back in order to deal with the Criminal Justice Bill.  Even if it is taken next week we will be in difficulty.  If the Dáil does not reassemble until the week after, we are faced with a difficulty if not an impossibility of handling the Misuse of Drugs Bill even at short notice.  The Seanad will appreciate that the situation is still complex; indeed it is liable to change from hour to hour.  I was in touch with the Government Whip's Office immediately before coming into the House so I have the most up to date information and I am sorry it is not more exact.</P>

      <P>I am sorry about that. It is really a matter for the Chair rather <Col N="657" /> than for me.  The situation is that we have had the debate opened on one motion. The Senators who spoke in that debate spoke about all the matters that are in the particular reports.  It can be argued that there might be information in these reports which would have made one say something different or something supplementary. I do not see that the whole thing could be opened up again.  In fact, the only purpose of putting down the second motion was that the House would have formally noted the reports.  My hope would be that the debate should continue on Motion No. 7, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of developments in the EEC during 1983&rdquo; and following conclusion of that debate, that No. 8 would be moved and agreed without further debate.  I would equally express the hope that when we resume in September or October, but certainly before the end of October, a further report would be available so that we would not have this disjunction that we have now which is entirely due to the lateness of the report which has been deplored from all sides of the House.</P>

As a matter of fact for practical purposes we are talking about some of the very high intensive poultry units and that sort of recording is done as a matter of course by employers.  Employees do these inspections.  All it would mean is a simple chart system whereby they tick off that they have inspected the various units and that everything is in order.

    <Title>Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Board was set up under statute in 1940 at the request of the Irish livestock trade.  The Bill now before the House arises from a request from the trade and from the board itself to wind up the board because of the decline in live cattle exports to <Col N="661" /> Britain.  The basic legislation contained no provisions whereby the board might be dissolved and winding up, therefore, requires enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Acts, 1940 to 1950, exporters of cattle, sheep and pigs are required to pay into an insurance fund a levy in respect of each animal exported direct, or via Northern Ireland, to Britain.  The fund is administered by the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Board, which is a statutory body set up under the Acts and appointed by the National Executive of the Irish Live Stock Trade.  Payment of the levy entitles the exporter to compensation for damage to, or loss of, animals from the time of shipment, or from the time of entering Northern Ireland, until up to 84 hours after release from the landing place in Britain.  These statutory insurance arrangements were set up at a time when livestock exports were almost exclusively to Britain and they were designed to be entirely self-financing.</P>
      <P>In the past ten or 15 years there has been a sharp downturn in live cattle exports to Britain and in recent years disbursements, mainly administrative expenses, from the fund have exceeded receipts from the levy.  In the forties exports of live cattle to Britain, and Northern Ireland, were running at 430,000 head per annum.  In the late fifties they exceeded 700,000 head but by 1983 they had fallen below 24,000 head. Exports of live sheep and pigs to Britain over the years have not been significant.</P>
      <P>The balance in the fund is presently less than £10,000 and consequently the board is operating under the threat of possible insolvency.  The National Executive of the Irish Live Stock Trade and the board have indicated that the possibility of regaining a situation of financial viability either by extending the compulsory insurance arrangements to cover exports to all destinations or by increasing the rates of insurance levy would not be acceptable to the livestock trade generally. I think that is the crucial statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current non-UK trade, which is mainly to North Africa, involves a much <Col N="662" /> greater insurance risk and would call for very high premiums.  The exporters involved in that trade prefer to make their own insurance arrangements, as would exporters to Britain if faced with substantially increased rates of levy.  The National Executive and the board, therefore, see no option other than to wind up the activities of the board.  Exporters of livestock to Britain will then have to make their own insurance arrangements in the same way as shippers of livestock to other destinations do at present.  In view of the precarious state of its fund, the board has taken steps to have the risk of possible claims arising during the winding up process underwriting by a commercial insurance company.</P>
    <P>In addition to the fund balance of under £10,000 the only capital asset which the board owns is an office at North Circular Road, Dublin, which was acquired in 1972.  The Bill proposes that the disposal of these premises should be subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>The board currently employs two officers who have service of 41 years each. Two other officers who had service of 39 years and 32 years were made redundant in March.  The board has been contributing to a pension scheme with a pensions firm on behalf of the staff and the determination of final pension and other arrangements for the staff on the termination of their employment is a matter for agreement between them and the board management within the resources of the board.  However, there is a provision in the Bill whereby the Minister for the Public Service will be the final arbitrator in the event of any dispute on pension or other terms between staff and management.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill contains a provision whereby the disposal of any residue after all claims and liabilities have been discharged will be subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>Because of the precarious financial state of the board it is important that the possibility of claims should cease as soon as possible.  Dáil Éireann passed this Bill yesterday.  I would like to thank this House for agreeing to deal with the matter quickly so that the winding-up process can be concluded as soon as possible.</P>
    <Col N="663" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be the week in which we see the abolition of State boards.  Yesterday we had the dissolution of An Chomhairle Olla which we objected to very strongly.  Today we have the winding up of another State board, the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Board.  While we objected yesterday and today to the abolition of An Chomhairle Olla, I can see the point in the Minister bringing this legislation before the House.  Certainly I have no intention of opposing this Bill, particularly since the request has come from the exporters themselves that this board should be wound up because, as the Minister has rightly stated, the statutory insurance arrangements were set up at a time when livestock exports were almost exclusively to Great Britain and they were designed to be entirely self-financing.  The situation has changed in the intervening years. We are not exporting the same volume of beef on the hoof and we are not exporting store cattle to Great Britain, as was the case in the past.</P>
      <P>Last year we exported 200,000 head of cattle live and 231,000 tonnes of beef. This is where the change has come about, and this is as it should be.  We have been requesting for some time that more cattle be slaughtered here, that more processing take place here and, consequently, more jobs would be created for our young labour force.  While we all want to see this happening, we do not want to see the live export trade eliminated altogether because it is very important that there be an element of competition there.  We know what happened in 1973 when the factories had a monopoly of the trade. The people who suffered were the poor farmers who unfortunately had to sell their cattle to the factories.  We do not ever want such a situation to arise again. For that reason, it is very important that we have competition between live trade, exports of vac-packed meat and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we have a good trade to North Africa.  I am sure that has contributed significantly to the prices that have been obtaining in the cattle marts in this country for the past couple of years, and I hope that trade will continue.  Perhaps we could make greater efforts to get <Col N="664" /> more cattle into Great Britain.  It has been our traditional market down the years and there is no reason why we should not explore it still further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the processing of our meat, much can be done on the European market.  In Germany, Irish beef is known to be of a high standard and is advertised there as Irish beef and under an Irish label.  This does not happen in Great Britain, because for political reasons the Irish label is not used.  The Irish label is not used in France either.  This is a pity, but one can understand the reasons for the France farming organisations insisting on this.  They do not want to see Irish meat promoted in their country.</P>
    <P>The export of cattle and beef is making a very significant contribution to our balance of payments and I hope every effort will be made by our Government to improve that situation.  For the past few years we have been trying to increase our cattle number but we have not made any great progress.  I hope that a renewed effort will be made to increase our cattle numbers.  I do not know what scheme might be introduced, but I am sure this is something the Departments are monitoring at all times.  Some of the schemes which exist at the moment do not seem to have any great impact.  I thought the payment of cattle headage grants, the calved heifer grants and all the other support schemes that have been made available to our farmers would help to increase the cattle numbers but that does not seem to be the situation at present. The Government's decision last year to reduce the ceiling of off-farm employment from £5,000 to £3,500 is not going to help the situation either because farmers who had part-time employment and who qualified for these grants under the old system will no longer qualify and therefore they will not be producing the extra cattle we hoped for.</P>
    <P>This is a narrow, technical Bill and we on this side of the House fully support it. I hope that the people working in the insurance board will be compensated.  I understand some people have been employed there for a long time and I hope they will be adequately compensated. The fund is not a very big one and <Col N="665" /> I am sure the Minister will find somewhere to dispose of the £10,000 and I am sure he will find use for the office in the North Circular Road.  I support the Bill and realise the need for bringing it to the House at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The board have outlived their usefulness because the export of live cattle to Great Britain and Northern Ireland has diminished over the years.  Like Senator Hussey I know how important the live cattle trade is to our farmers.  Most of our live cattle trade is with North Africa and people trading with North Africa can arrange their own insurance.  Much is said about the added value of killing and processing our cattle at home, but we still depend on the live trade.  We know we could break into good markets in Europe but the danger there would be the upsets caused by strikes in factories.  A few weeks ago the meat trade nearly collapsed and this is still affecting prices.  We have the potential and it is a pity that we cannot look after our beef so that we will not be vulnerable to upsets.  I agree with the principles of the Bill and I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can run down the stream as simply as my colleague, Senator Hussey, and the other speakers on the termination of this board.  This move is a continuation of the spate of the winding up of boards as Senator Hussey said.  I do not want to doubt what is in the Minister's speech but insurance is more necessary now than ever before because we export livestock to destinations in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1941 the board were set up to deal with the export of cattle, sheep and pigs to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and the board have given a very worth while service.  I am a livestock exporter and during that period I availed of the insurance services whenever an animal died or was injured because of stress.  They have paid out approximately £4 million to £5 million on claims to date. The Irish livestock exporters were always secured because they knew they had insurance cover.  Every time we have a <Col N="666" /> change of Government we have a spate of closures and redundancies and this is happening now at a time when job creation should be our first concern.  The number of cattle being exported to Britain at present has decreased, but not enough to warrant the closure of this board.</P>
    <P>I would like to see legislation introduced updating this board to include countries outside the United Kingdom. That would stabilise the insurance board rather than terminating it.  Thousands of cattle are exported to the eastern bloc and to countries outside the United Kingdom. Because of the long sea journeys involved, sometimes more than seven days, and the animals suffer a lot of stress, the livestock exporters should have independent insurance cover. The Minister has a responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the modernisation of transport.  People sell their horses and send them by air because of the long distances involved.  Some farmers experimented and sent their sheep abroad by air rather than by sea.  Many new boats plying between Ireland and the eastern bloc have been reconditioned but the air conditioning in these boats may not be suitable for the transportation of animals. There is a great need for an extension of the insurance board rather than its termination. However, it is on the cards to terminate this board and nothing I say can change that but I will have something to say about this on Committee Stage. There are some Deputies, Senators and officials of Departments who would love to see the live export cattle trade abandoned but there are other Members of the Oireachtas who would not like that to happen because the day that happens will sound the death knell of our farmers. If the live exporters do not compete with the fresh meat exporters there will be a drastic drop in trade.  If all these facilities are taken away there will be a break down of the organisation.  I would not like to see this happen.</P>
    <P>It is said if no livestock is exported, this would lead to more employment at home.  But it does not work that way.  We are exporting most of our beef as forequarters <Col N="667" /> and hindquarters but it is not processed here.  That argument does not hold up, because the fresh meat exporters are not processing their meat here, and they are not giving employment.  I will be asking questions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions although some of the arguments were not directly related to the Bill.  The livestock people have asked to have this insurance board terminated.  This is not something we are imposing on them.  The board were set up for a specific purpose which no longer exists.  This type of insurance became too expensive for the few people involved.</P>
      <P>I would like to sort out any confusion there might be about the shipment of animals to eastern bloc countries or to North Africa.  The people involved have stated quite categorically and unequivocally that they wish to have their own insurance for these animals.  We have no hassle with that.  If that is the way they want it, then so be it.  It is important that we inspect these boats.  Our veterinarians travel on the boats.  We insist that the boats are properly ventilated.  The customer is always right and it is in our own interests and in the interests of our exporters, that the animals arrive at the other end in good condition.  There is no argument about that.</P>
      <P>In the past we exported a lot of forequarters, hindquarters and carcase beef. There is an increasing volume of vac-pack trade and processing.  This is something I welcome.  While I agree that the live end of the business is very important, and is something I have had to defend from time to time, we have to be thinking more and more in terms of processing.  I would like to see inter-factory competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was worried about somebody having a monopoly of the processing industry.  That would worry me.  In the Cork area there is a new group engaged in a very big operation.  They will be processing with special reference to the eastern bloc countries.  They will be in competition with Cork Marts and with everybody else.  That is the sort of <Col N="668" /> competition I would like to see eventually. On the North African side, I think it is well to be involved in the live trade and to develop it further so that when these countries are ready to accept processed frozen products we will be the obvious people to turn to.  We have to keep a foot in the market, as it were.</P>
    <P>The trade have asked us to wind up this board in a responsible and amicable way and we are doing this.  This was a self-financing operation but the danger is that it will not continue to be so.  The few people who are exporting to the United Kingdom have indicated quite clearly that they would prefer to make their own insurance arrangements because they would work out a lot cheaper, and we are complying with their wishes.</P>

      <P>This section requires the board to wind up their affairs and to provide for the termination of the employment of the officers.  I understand that the ordinary statutory redundancy payments will obtain.  Does the Minister intend to supplement that redundancy payment?  I have heard of boards that were terminated quite recently &mdash; I do not want to start quoting off the record because I may not be accurate &mdash; but a nominal redundancy payment was mentioned, perhaps £30 or some such thing for 30 or 40 years' service.  It would be disgraceful if that happened in this case because three of the four employees have been working over 40 years in the live stock insurance board.  Is there any compensation forthcoming for these people, <Col N="669" /> other than the statutory redundancy payments?</P>

      <P>No, we do not envisage getting involved.  It will be between the two remaining employees, the two people who retired and the board.  The Minister for the Public Service will act as arbitrator.  As I pointed out in my opening address, on behalf of the staff, the board have been contributing to a pension scheme with a pension firm.  The determination of the final pension and other arrangements for the staff on termination of their employment is a matter for agreement between them and the board of management within the resources of the board.  However, there is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister for the Public Service will be the final arbitrator in the event of any dispute of pension or other terms between the staff and management.</P>

With regard to the matter that we want to discuss on the Adjournment, because of the meeting today of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and our impending Presidency, both the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment are out of the country and consequently neither of them is able to appear.  Because of the large crush of business occurring in the other House and other commitments there is some difficulty in getting a Minister who would be responsible as it were in some way cognate to this problem to appear.  I suggest that we suspend the sitting until 3.15 p.m. and it is hoped that a Minister will be available then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am very grateful for this opportunity to debate this most urgent social problem and to draw attention to the high risk of injury or even death to members of travelling families in the Tallaght area.  I am glad the Minister for Defence is present for the debate.  I note he has come in because the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State are absent from the country <Col N="671" /> because of our Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  I have to comment at this time and with the urgency of the problem one might question perhaps the priorities of the two Ministers in that Department, but I am grateful to the Minister for his presence and to the Cathaoirleach and the Seanad for allowing this debate to take place.</P>
      <P>I felt it necessary to put forward this motion as an urgent and an emergency motion and to raise it in this way because what has been for some considerable time an urgent situation is now becoming more critical, particularly with the proposal for a mass march or rally on Saturday.  I will be referring to other possible incidents which could put at very serious risk either individual families, vulnerable children, or the community members in Tallaght. This is a matter of great concern to this House and one which warrants the adjournment of our other business to consider it.</P>
      <P>Of course, this problem did not spring up overnight.  The elements of it have been festering for years.  We must in all honesty admit that a large share of the blame for the recent events which have so heightened the tension must be borne by politicians at both local and national levels.  Instead of dealing with the problem and having the courage and commitment to ensure that a full-scale and balanced programme of settlement of travellers got under way, we have seen politicians run for cover or support the establishment of halting sites anywhere else but in their own electoral areas. There are honourable exceptions.  There are some politicians who have taken a very courageous stand notwithstanding the cost to them in their own electoral areas but, by and large, we cannot be proud of our record in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal first with the absolute urgency of the problem&mdash;it is an urgency which has prompted the tabling of this motion&mdash;and then trace the background and what has led to the kind of incidents and tension which we have seen in the past few weeks and, finally, put forward some proposals which might help to defuse the tension, reduce the bitterness and allow the acceptance of travellers <Col N="672" /> and create respect for their culture and their way of life.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the present situation in the Tallaght area.  It is a situation which we are all aware of from reading the national newspapers, looking at television in recent weeks, reading comments in editorial columns and so on.  I want to refer to my own experience of travelling around the Tallaght area for a number of hours last night and looking at the situation first hand.  I was appalled at what I saw and I was extremely concerned about the urgency of the situation and about the tension, which was almost tangibly in the air, and the expression of it by residents whom I met.</P>
    <P>The first thing that strikes anyone driving around the Tallaght area or the people who live in Tallaght is the barricades, the barrels and watches which have sprung up at the entrances to estates.  Five roads have either been completely blocked off or blocked off in such a manner that you can only enter or leave if you are allowed to do so by the people who are manning the barricades.  What is evident there is a breakdown of the rule of law and that power and command have been taken over by self-appointed residents in the various estates.  This is so serious that it is important for us in this House to reflect on it.  We are seeing the blocking off of public roads, residents who cannot enter or leave their estate unless permitted to do so by those who are manning the barricades and we are seeing certain people being prevented from moving in or out of the estate.  That is happening with a great deal of tension and a great deal of rumour, fear and apprehension which heighten the tension.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious issue because if gardaí locally, either of their own initiative or under instruction not to interfere in the matter, allow illegal activity of this kind to continue and appear to be quasilegal, then it will be very difficult at a later stage to try to redress the situation. It is a very serious challenge to the norms of our society, to our very democracy, that there can be an assertion of local power, the illegal establishment of barricades of this kind, done it would <Col N="673" /> appear, to some extent certainly, without objection from and to some extent with apparent approval by some of the local representatives.  That is a very worrying aspect to which I would like to draw attention.</P>
    <P>A second immediate problem in the area is on the Tallaght by-pass itself.  As Senators will be aware, part of the section of the by-pass which had been closed and which could not be opened because there was families of travellers parked on the by-pass &mdash; that gave rise to recent court proceedings &mdash; was opened recently by the moving of certain families off the by-pass entirely into fields nearby and by approximately 30 other families moving to the side of the roadway.  I looked at the area again last night and I was shocked to see how dangerous the situation is.  It is a dual-carriageway with traffic travelling very rapidly, and on one long section of it there are approximately 30 caravans, some with very small children in them.  They are barely on the side of the road.  The possibility of real risk and potential loss of life or limb to young children is very grave indeed.  It is not a situation that can be tolerated.  It is one which we should take urgent stock of.</P>
    <P>The third matter which was very much in the front of my mind in looking for urgent consideration of this was the proposal mentioned to me by a number of residents last night for the holding of a mass march or rally in Tallaght on Saturday. This was mentioned to me by a number of different residents in different estates.  They were not clear in their minds precisely where the rally would go to.  It is to be a major mass march or rally in the Tallaght area.  There is great fear about what the result of that kind of activity would be and whether it might give rise to certain incidents.  There is talk about a counter rally of a smaller number of residents who are dismayed and alarmed by recent developments, who want to stand out for the right of travellers and who want to join with the travellers in solidarity.  There is a very great risk of extreme tension, possibly leading to violence, from these incidents.</P>
    <P>I want to turn briefly to the background <Col N="674" /> to these events.  As I have already said, the problem did not grow up overnight. There is a great deal of confusion, lack of information, and apprehension, both about the number, about where they came from and the number there are in the Tallaght area.  Even last night a number of residents referred to the fact that a considerable number of them are traders, who are very wealthy, who are living on tax-free bonuses, that they have no status or special need for consideration by the community.  But the reality is different. It is a reality that was very well summarised in an article in this week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> by Emily O'Reilly in which she referred to studies that have taken place of families in the by-pass area.  She wrote, and I quote from a passage in her article:</P>
    <P>The reality is very different.  A picture of poverty and neglect.  According to the County Council, of the 120 families who lived on the by-pass no more than 15 were traders.  The rest live on social welfare and begging.  A survey carried out last March showed that out of 300 travelling children in Tallaght of school-going age, only 93 or 31 per cent were enrolled in schools.  Of those, 56 had to be bussed to schools outside the Tallaght area.  Only two non-housed itinerants attended local schools.</P>
    <P>In March 1983 a survey on the health of the travellers showed that 45 children belonging to the 83 families then on the by-pass were in hospitals around Dublin, most of them suffering from either gastro enteritis, chest infection or &ldquo;failure to thrive".  Another survey carried out in Dublin's north side revealed that every traveller child in the first year of its life would be admitted to hospital on three occasions.  The infant mortality rate of travelling children is three times that of the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>Whereas undoubtedly there is a percentage of traders among the travelling community, there are also families with urgent housing and family needs and with grave under access to education of their children.  It is horrific that in Ireland in <Col N="675" /> 1984, 31 per cent of children of a particular group in an area would be the percentage who would be attending any form of schooling and the rest would be denied access to literacy, to what we take for granted in modern Ireland.  There is a very real social and human dimension to what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise what came out in evidence in the recent by-pass case: a significant number of the families are Tallaght families, not by any means all of them, but a significant number have been Tallaght families for generations, who indeed could be called the first Tallaght residents because they were there when Tallaght was a green area before the housing estates were built.  But what has happened &mdash; and I am only summarising it &mdash; is that because there has been this urban spread and development out from the city into the county area, particularly to Clondalkin and Tallaght, the travellers have been pushed further and further out to the perimeter.  There is no doubt that a large number of travellers were moved from the Dublin city area.  In 1979 there were 170 families living on the city perimeter. Now there are only 20 families. They have been moved out and they are part of the increased number who are in Tallaght.  Undoubtedly there was also some movement of families from the North or back from England during the seventies.</P>
    <P>But by and large what the travellers have found is that the traditional halting sites, the side of the road sites, have been removed from them by having trenches dug or large boulders put in to prevent them parking there.  They have been squeezed until they found that one of the few areas where they could remain, because there were large tracts of local authority land, were the areas of Tallaght and Clondalkin.  That is why in that haphazard and unplanned way they have mainly congregated in that area.  It is fair to say, and is true, that the settled communities of Tallaght and Clondalkin have had to bear too great a share of the social problems which surround this whole question.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that they would have a sense of both grievance and of <Col N="676" /> isolation in relation to their problems, but the neglect has now led to something much more serious than that.  The nearest I have seen to racism in Ireland in my life is now beginning to emerge in the Tallaght area in relation to travellers.  It is not a question of not wanting a halting site here or there &mdash; it is not wanting travellers at all in the area.  It is hard to distinguish that from what we would characterise as racism in other countries. The problem is an extremely serious and urgent one.</P>
    <P>I should refer briefly to the legal position. Following the McDonald case judgment of the Supreme Court in July 1980 it became clear that local authorities, and specifically Dublin County Council, could not move families who had ascertained housing needs, who had nowhere else to go and clearly had housing needs from local authority, without making some effort to meet those needs by some offer of alternative accommodation or an alternative site, and therefore it became more difficult to take the easy way out and move travelling families.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, Dublin County Council did not rise to the political challenge and responsibility and ensure that they brought on stream the necessary programme of halting sites.  Therefore, the residents in areas where there were larger numbers of travellers, particularly in Tallaght and Clondalkin, had become increasingly frustrated and bitter at the way in which they pay the price for political inactivity and for political cowardice in not being prepared to take the necessary action.  We have seen this in the last couple of years in Tallaght, boiling up to the present crisis.  In 1982 there was evidence of frustration on the part of the people in Tallaght who decided at that time, led by the Tallaght Action Group, to take matters into their own hands, to have a march on to the by-pass and to inform the families there that they would have to go or they would be moved.  That was defused at the time and it never came to the kind of confrontation that we are seeing at the moment.  The warning was there once again for politicians but that warning still was not properly taken or <Col N="677" /> appreciated.</P>
    <P>Now a new body has emerged, the Tallaght New Town Action Group, which has constituted itself as a populist movement in Tallaght which appears to be very widely supported in the estates. Certainly the message that I got was not to underestimate the extent of the support for this action group and the extent to which it is felt by residents on the ground that all else has failed, that the political process had completely failed to meet their problem and that there is an unwillingness at both central and local government levels to take on the necessary responsibility and to show equity in the matter, and to do it fairly, to have an even spread of halting sites throughout the greater Dublin county area and into the neighbouring counties.  Parts of Tallaght are only a couple of miles from County Wicklow and it should not be confined artificially to the area of greater Dublin county and it should be more evenly spread throughout Dublin city and county and not be bearing down so intolerably on communities such as Tallaght and Clondalkin which have many of those social problems &mdash; they already have a great absence of the supports and community centre youth group activities which would help them to cope with their particular problems and with the very young population and very high unemployment they have.</P>
    <P>So what have we seen in very recent times?  Dublin County Council procrastinated for an appalling length of time on taking a decision on the programme of halting sites which had been put before them and which had been before them with some amendments for a number of years.  On 10 April last the county council adopted proposals to establish 12 halting sites throughout the county, and three of these would have been in the Tallaght area.  It appears now that even that programme is in cold storage because of the very sharp reaction there has been to the actual sites identified in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>I now come to the part of my contribution in which I want to suggest some proposals for action.  It appears at this stage that it is not a problem that can be <Col N="678" /> left purely to the local authority, Dublin County Council.  It is one which has to be coped with now by a combination of local and general government.  It cannot be confined in a narrow way to the borders of County Dublin, and therefore it involves the necessity for planning which includes the central Government.</P>
    <P>I believe funding has never been the real problem.  Money is there all right; it is political will and political courage that are needed.  The funding would be there for the proposals, and that has been shown.  At this stage it is extremely important that a planned programme of halting sites and group houses be brought on stream.  It would be a grave mistake to try to focus on just one halting site or, as has been proposed, to attempt to have a very large halting site to meet part of the problem.  To have a halting site of 40 families is unacceptable.  It could not work from the point of view of the whole culture of the travellers themselves; their fears of living together in a large group of that kind make it simply something that would not work.  In fact it would retard the acceptance of halting sites for travellers, because it would be a battleground and source of great enmity as between the travellers in a very large halting site of that kind and local residents in the area, and they would be able to point to the fact that it was not acceptable.</P>
    <P>So the halting site to be proposed must be small and well planned.  We have all the information we need.  We have had all the reports and all the committees we need.  The report of the Government task force was presented to the Government in February 1983.  They have it for nearly a year and a half, giving them a very detailed assessment of the housing needs, the predictions of needs both for the greater Dublin area and for elsewhere in the country.  The numbers involved are not that substantial.  In fact the numbers of families to be housed either in houses or in halting sites would be possible to accommodate if there was a will to do it. It is extremely important that the halting sites or group housing schemes be small. Basically, they should try to accommodate the extended families of travellers, <Col N="679" /> three to five families.  They should be very well spread throughout the area so that there would be fairness as between communities, so that communities in other parts of the greater Dublin area also would adjust to and absorb and, we hope, welcome either group housing or halting sites for travellers in their areas with travelling children being integrated in the schools and so on.</P>
    <P>Another approach that I think is urgently needed is that the quality of the housing must be of very high standard, both group housing and halting sites.  One of the associations of residents with halting sites is that they are human tips and they quickly become centres of appalling pollution.  Some of the resistance to the location of halting sites is precisely because they are seen to be rubbish tips for human beings which will depreciate the whole of the amenities of an area. Now that we have waited so long and moved so slowly I think that we must move with equality and with care and attention and in close consultation both with travellers and with the very significant number of people who work professionally and in a voluntary capacity with travellers.  The problem is very well known and very well understood by these people.  They must be enlisted to help us to cope very urgently.</P>
    <P>The reason I sought to raise this matter is because of my own conviction that it is one of the most urgent social problems facing us.  It is Tallaght today, it is almost Clondalkin now and may be Clondalkin tomorrow.  It is a problem that is of the utmost urgency and requires the greatest patience, skill, commitment and, above all, courage at both national and local level to cope with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of one of our largest cultural minorities and the problem of our inability as a society to adapt to their cultural needs is one that normally I would talk about in very emotive terms, but at this stage the issue has become too serious to allow any of us to be too free with the sort of words we would use.  I would like to reiterate that I am not talking about the problem of the travellers: I am talking about the problem <Col N="680" /> of Irish society that is not able to adapt itself to the culture of a small minority.</P>
      <P>There is a convention that the appropriate response, as the Minister in a memorable phrase described it, or the expression, as a liberal would say, on an issue like this is that one would be carefully balanced about it.  There are two sides to problems, but what Father Travers said needs to be repeated here, and that is that by comparison with the problems of the settled community in the area where the travellers are experiencing so many difficulties, the travellers have suffered far more, and if choices have to be made, then, as Father Travers said, the choice must be to support those who have least. Senator Robinson has fairly effectively scotched the myth of the wealthy travellers living in luxury who are unwilling or unable or unprepared to pay their share of support or sustenance to society.</P>
      <P>It is of fundamental necessity that the scale of the oppression of travellers in Irish society should be fairly well recorded.  Oppression is not something that one can entirely measure by objective criteria.  What is important is that we see how travellers perceive their own oppression, because it is only from the perception of people of their oppression that one can build a proper response.</P>
      <P>The first thing we must always remember is that travellers are not individuals who happen to live in unfortunate conditions: they are a culture, with their own values and in some cases with their own language and their own traditions and pride.  Any accommodation must recognise all of that.  Among the traditions that the travelling community claim and defend, and claim to be entitled to maintain, is the right to move and the right to stop.  Like all rights for any group or any individual, that is not an absolute right. Neither do we as a society have any right to decide that it is a right that can be dismissed out of hand and say that what we want to do is to persuade all travellers to settle and then the problem will be solved.  The problem is not a problem of travelling people but of Irish society unable to adapt to a cultural minority with its own needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One should list the range of deprivations <Col N="681" /> from which travelling communities suffer, ranging through accommodation into inadequate income and the perceived hostility of many people within the State welfare services on the income support side to travelling people as travelling people see it, on to the inadequacy of a health service which is based on the assumption that people stay in one place to respond to the needs of people who choose to travel.  The horrific fact needs to be reiterated again of the extent of illness among the children of travelling people and the horrific fact of the infant mortality rate, which is three times the national average.  Far more travellers die young and from accidents and other matters than do in the settled community. The average life expectation of the travelling community is considerably less. There is the extraordinary irony of travelling families being moved on because they are alleged to be a health hazard, and the process of their being moved on does fundamental damage often to their health, particularly of pregnant women and small children.</P>
    <P>We could also talk about the travellers and the inadequacy of the education system to respond to and sustain their culture and to support their perceived values as a culture in our society.  One would have to mention the travelling community's perception of the law.  One would be avoiding a fundamental issue if one did not mention the apparent extraordinary uneveness of the administration or the enforcement of the law in Tallaght and the surrounding areas in recent weeks, where barricades reminiscent of no-go areas in Northern Ireland were apparently being tolerated indefinitely and the blockading of roads have been tolerated indefinitely without any apparent action by the Garda.  On the other hand, apparently a traveller does no more than take off his coat and he is charged promptly with a breach of the peace.  People who have complained about this obstruction of the law and this breach of the law have been ignored by the Garda.  Other people in large numbers have been allowed to obstruct traffic and to take the law into their hands.  One <Col N="682" /> cannot help wondering how you can have respect for law among all sectors of society if the noise and the numbers of a group determine the extent of the response of the law enforcement agencies to their breaches of the law.  One has to address oneself to whether those who are given the duty to enforce the law have the sensitivity or perceptiveness required to deal with such a problem.  I will quote from a Garda superintendent who was interviewed on an RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on the travelling people.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The itinerants are a fairly big problem and are pretty difficult to deal with because they are very mobile.  A lot of them have similar names.  They look very much alike, a lot of them, because they are related family-wise and so on. In the cities, particularly, the crime is committed by the juvenile element mostly.  The adults have a tendency to move out the country into the rural areas in remote places and commit very serious crimes, particularly on old people living alone and so on.  All the counties of Leinster are affected and they have gone as far as Galway and Clare, and they can do all this in one day, be gone in the morning and be back at night.</P>
    <P>If that had been said by a member of the RUC about a section of the Catholic population in Northern Ireland, every political party in this State would have risen up in outrage.  It is impossible for anybody to believe that travelling people could every believe that they have the support and the sustenance of the law if that represents the view of the senior Garda officer responsible for the area in which this problem now presents itself. For me it is even more difficult.  For various reasons I will refrain from publicly commenting on that because I thought it was a very serious matter.  I engaged in correspondence with the Garda Commissioner. His final letter to me simply said that the Garda Commissioner did not have an opportunity to see the programme and therefore could not comment on what the superintendent in question had said.  That does not reassure me <Col N="683" /> about the capability or, even worse, willingness of the Garda to enforce the law impartially.</P>
    <P>One could pursue all the other areas &mdash; the lack of political rights, the extraordinary decisions that were taken in the case of Mrs. Nan Joyce when she was arrested and charged with very serious offiences; half the offences were withdrawn on the first adjournment and on the second adjournment the remainder of the offences were withdrawn.  Many of the travelling community have said over and over again that the Criminal Justice Bill is nothing new because matters have been operated like that for years anyway in their perception of the law.  As many of us here have often said it is on the capacity of this country to operate under the rule of law, it is on that capacity that our civilisation is based and our ability to work with each other is based.  Therefore there can be no exception and everybody must have an equal perception of their own equality before the law.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues to be discussed. Senator Robinson has given a quite restrained and balanced set of proposals on how to deal with the problem. But first it must be said that in the short-term those who are most in danger and those who are most threatened and most vulnerable must be the first concern of the State.  Quite clearly the children of the travelling community living on a dual carriageway with no place to go, and those communities who are threatened by outbreaks of local hostility, must be the first concern of the State.  Their protection, their safety and their security must be the first concern of the State. Their protection, their safety and their security must be the first issue, and then we can begin to develop a proper programme for proper sites and facilities for our travelling community.  There can be no other basis for that long-term progress than the defence of the most vulnerable, who clearly are our travelling community.</P>
    <P>I will quote one very eminent individual who gave his analysis of how this problem could be solved:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The settlement problem would not be solved either by trying to create large ghetto-type settlements or by putting individual travelling families in a community in isolation without moral support and people to whom they could relate.  There needed to be a number of travellers together and yet not so many as to appear a threat to the settled community.</P>
    <P>The same speaker went on to say, and this is of fundamental importance:</P>
    <P>What was now needed was not more research but resources, political commitments and the application of Ministerial skills.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the Taoiseach on 14 October 1983.  I enthusiastically endorse that statement and hope that the Government's proposals to deal with the travelling community and our inability to cope with their culture will reflect that commitment by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that we will have a fairly clear assurance here that no Member of the Oireachtas would condone the widespread flouting of the law of this land that has occurred in Tallaght in recent weeks.  I hope we all recognise that the basic principle of the law is that we are all, whether we like each other or not, supposed to be equal before the law. Therefore, I would urge the Government in the short-term to ensure that adequate resources and adequate commitment are available to ensure that those who are most vulnerable in our society are not threatened by prejudice, fear or indeed downright racist bigotry and that in the long term what the Taoiseach described as the resources and the political skills will be applied to this problem so that those who are among the most vulnerable in our society can at last live in some sort of peace and harmony with those of us in the community who find it so difficult to adopt to their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is indeed a very sensitive matter, and one has to be careful, as some previous speakers have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to reply to <Col N="685" /> Senator Ryan who it might seem obviously directed some of his remarks to me when he said that he would hope that no Member of the Oireachtas would condone the flouting of the law in the last few weeks in Tallaght.  I want to assure Senator Ryan and anyone else who wishes to listen that I have never condoned the flouting of the law in Tallaght or anywhere else.  I do not condone but I am afraid that some of his words here today have condoned the flouting of the law in Tallaght over the last few years.  I am sorry that he is not fully briefed as to the situation.  However, I will deal with that later if time permits me.  There are some more important matters at this stage to be put on the record of this House, because the impression has been given by the mover of the motion, Senator Robinson, that politicians and public representatives have run away or hidden from this problem.  I want to put on the record of this House the programme which has been embarked upon by the local authorities in the Dublin area over the last few years, and indeed if it can be matched by any other local authority in the country then I will be willing and ready to recognise the efforts of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>Dublin city and county have co-operated in this problem for six or seven years.  We have a joint committee dealing with the travelling people and over the last five years there have been settled in the city and county 210 units of chalets or bungalows on settled sites.  Six further sites in the county are in course of construction and six further sites in the city. That brings it to a total of 222.  In standard housing, Dublin Corporation have housed 93 families and the county council have housed 123 in four years.  The corporation figure might date back a year or two further.  That gives a total of 226 housed in the Dublin area, city and county.  Tallaght, which was a small town ten years ago, has now risen because of development to a size greater than four times the size of Limerick city.  One can imagine all the difficulties and problems which this has brought on a settled community who were settling in to building <Col N="686" /> their own units and sections of the town and trying to knit themselves into a community, coping with enormous problems with little or no Government assistance for most of those years of building up.  In Tallaght alone, a new town in a small part of County Dublin, the local authority has housed 40 of these travelling people in standard housing.  Did Senator Ryan or Senator Mary Robinson know that, and, if they did, why did they not say it?  If they did not know that, they are further from the situation than they claim to be.  Dublin Corporation housed in the Tallaght area 25.  That is a total of 65 in standard housing.  There is a halting site in the centre of Tallaght for five and Dublin County Council are now in the course of erecting a group housing scheme of 12, a total of 82 families being settled in this town of Tallaght, where we are told that politicians and public representatives have run away from the problem.  I would ask the proposer of this motion if there is any other town in Ireland which can match that record in providing for the travelling people.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the history of this.  I would like the House to appreciate that I live in Tallaght and have lived there since 1932, when Tallaght was a small village, so I think I am pretty <i>au fait</i> with what has happened to date.  I am afraid what I am going to say will not compare in any way with what Senator Robinson has said here this afternoon. When the town of Tallaght began to develop away back in the late sixties and the early seventies the county council were charged with responsibility for providing for the new expansion and explosion of population in that area.  They zoned a considerable amount of land because they were under pressure from industrialists and others, who were ferrying in people from as far away as Navan and Naas for the jobs in the factories at that time.  I, along with other public representatives, including the late Seán Dunne, a member of the Labour Party, attended more than one meeting of industrialists in Tallaght who were urging us to do this very thing, which we did. Having zoned the land, Dublin Corporation had an enormous housing problem <Col N="687" /> in the city.  They proceeded&mdash;as they are entitled to do, as is any other local authority &mdash; compulsorily to acquire large tracts of land in County Dublin but particularly in Tallaght.  One of these CPO's extended to 1,500 acres in west Tallaght.  I knew the farmers and landowners who were caught in that CPO.  It is the land which now houses the large Dublin Corporation estates of Fettercairn, Brookfield, Jobstown, Killinarden, Knockmore and the county council area of Kilclone.</P>
    <P>It was in 1971 that Dublin Corporation first purchased some of these large tracts of land.  From that day to the day the machines moved in &mdash; even to today &mdash; not one acre of that land was ever let to a contractor or farmer to bring some return to the national Exchequer or to bring some contribution to the national effort.  It was allowed to lie barren.  If Senator Robinson suggests politicians are running away from the situation then she has to look at her own local authority because it was nothing short of a scandal that a local authority in Ireland during those difficult years could hold on to large tracts of land with no income to that local authority; the lands were allowed to lie barren for travelling people to move into. I paid four visits to the City Hall during that time.  I implored successive city managers to find some method whereby they could let the land more quickly before it would be taken over by people coming into the area to get the easy pickings.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from the city manager which I would have brought here to put on the records of the House if I had known this motion was coming up, saying that in an attempt to let the land they were unsuccessful because it went to auction and there were no bidders.  Why? There were no bidders because Dublin Corporation insisted that this land be let through an auctioneer who is named by the corporation, that it be advertised and that a public auction be held.  By the time that happened the travelling people had moved in to graze the land, which meant that naturally nobody wanted it and there were not bidders.</P>
    <P>During that time and in recent times <Col N="688" /> when all the travelling people were in Tallaght, Dublin County Council acquired 163 acres at Fortunestown in the middle of where the travelling people were congregating at the time.  Today we still hold that land, undeveloped; no machine has gone on it to develop it. There is not one itinerant caravan or travelling person's home on it nor is there one travelling person's horse or goat or hen on it.  Why?  Because two days before the county council were given possession of those lands, they got in touch with an auctioneer; they cut all the red tape and asked him to have it let within 48 or 72 hours, which he did.  It is bringing a return to the local authority, the Dublin County Council.  I do not see why Dublin Corporation could not do the same thing and why they insist on the lands they acquire in the county going through this rigmarole, advertising, going through auctioneers' books, waiting for weeks on end. These travelling people are quickly informed as to where local authorities acquire land and they move in.</P>
    <P>It is a problem that has to be faced at national level.  Until it is, it cannot be solved and it will not be resolved.  There are people living in squalor in the centre of Tallaght and they have been doing so for three and four years now.  I moved among them and I found families who had been allocated houses, one in Limerick, another in Tipperary.  There were others who left standard housing allocated to them by a local authority. When I inquired from them as to why they had left good standard housing and had come to live in what I termed squalid conditions they told me simply that the pickings were good.  They had free grazing for their horses.  That same day I counted 93 horses grazing free of charge on the southern side of the Tallaght by-pass. On the northern side there were far more.  I saw machines moving into the site where Knockmore estate is now and the hay was being harvested there on a Friday and it was gone on Tuesday.  When I phoned the corporation on Tuesday they did not even know about it.  I would lay the blame at the doors of Dublin Corporation for the way in which they <Col N="689" /> have handled their land purchases in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not condone the breaking of the law in any sense.  I do not condone the blocking of the roads that took place some time ago; I do not condone the holding up of anyone who wants to travel the roads, but we must have a certain sympathy for the people who are living in these estates, who have purchased their homes, who have seen the law flouted for the last four or five years by people who have been trading in the centre of Tallaght and who had the refuse &mdash; 600 cars &mdash; removed last July and August from that site.  I am sure many of you saw the aerial photograph last week or the week before in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of a site that was cleared last August of 600 car wrecks by the local authority, at our expense.  Can you imagine the frustration of traders in the area, who are now even being refused admission to the tipheads at Bohernabreena to dispose of their refuse?  They are paying rates and taxes and they see their neighbours trading without paying rates or taxes and having their refuse removed at the expense of the small traders in the area. There is no expense whatever to the travelling people, who are reaping all the benefits.</P>
    <P>Of course there is discrimination in Tallaght and there has been discrimination in Tallaght over the last four or five years, but it is in favour of the travelling people.  I live with it; I live right on their doorsteps.  I have lived there from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and I failed to find among them any Tallaght families, as has been stated by Senator Robinson.  I would like her to name those who claim to be old Tallaght residents, because I was with the travelling people when Tallaght was a town of 1,000 people.  Today it is a town of 80,000 people, and I have been living with it ever since.  Surely we must have some sympathy with the people who are not blockading the roads, but are holding watches at the entrances to their estates. Why?  Because many of them might feel like moving too.  Can they move where they like?  Try to sell a house in Tallaght today.  Put an advertisement in the paper <Col N="690" /> and put your telephone number on it for the sale of a house in Tallaght and see the answers you will get.  Nobody wants to buy a house in Tallaght today because of the terrible conditions that exist in the centre of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Of course I agree that there is danger to life and limb, to have people in 29 caravans on the Tallaght by-pass today, living alongside the dual carriageway, but it is no worse than the Naas Road; it is no worse than what I saw in Cork last week; it is no worse that what I saw in Galway a month ago where they were living on the side of a busy road.  So why the fuss about Tallaght where they have Garda protection 24 hours a day, which the others do not have in Galway?  I did not see any gardaí protecting the children or reducing the speed of the traffic.  Every step has been taken to ensure that injustice was not done to the travelling people in Tallaght, and I refute any allegation that suggests otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Garda have been kind to the travelling people, because I have had innumerable complaints &mdash; and I can see it myself &mdash; of new cars, and they are not minis and they are not Morris Minors &mdash; appearing untaxed on the Tallaght by-pass for the last four years.  I do not know if they are insured but they are certainly untaxed and parked illegally.  Has any one of the travelling people in Tallaght been charged with an untaxed car or with illegal parking?  The gardaí have been exceedingly kind and generous.  One garda told me of a case where there was a charge and when he went to serve the summons &mdash; I forget the name but let us say it was Tony McMahon to use my own name &mdash; and when he approached the site he asked for this Tony McMahon.  A man said &ldquo;Yes, that is me&rdquo;.  The garda produced the summons and then the man said &ldquo;Oh, that is not me, that is my cousin. He has moved to Limerick".  So they flout the law.  That garda knew that was the man he wanted, that he was the man he should have served the summons on, but his hands were tied because there are many of the same name.  You saw on the newspaper the other day that there were charges arising out of the activities last week and there were two people of <Col N="691" /> the same name charged with only three or four years difference in age, 32 and 35 or something like that.  The Garda position is impossible, as I have been telling many people who have said to me: &ldquo;Why are they not charged with crimes that if I committed I would be in the District Court or in some instances in the High Court, but they are getting away with it?" There is discrimination in Tallaght. There has been discrimination in Tallaght over four years, but I am afraid it is in favour of the travelling people.</P>
    <P>No politician in County Dublin and no public representative &mdash; I speak for all shades and all parties &mdash; has run away from this situation.  But it has become impossible to handle because successive Governments have been unwilling to tackle the problem.  The present Government set up a committee of Ministers who reported over a year ago.  We have seen no action since.  I hope there is something coming from the Cabinet in the immediate future to have this matter dealt with at national level.  The local authority now find themselves unable to deal with the situation. They tried to open the road on 26 October last when there were 23 caravans on the by-pass.  Today the road is open with 29 caravans on it but there were 23 on it on the day the council had the road ready for opening.  The council kindly informed these people that they were going to open the road and would be obliged if they moved off it.  What happened? We had some people who were supposed to be protecting the travelling people and looking after their welfare, who organised an application to the courts for an injunction to prevent that £4½ million roadway being opened so as to have easy flowing traffic for last Christmas. They were successful in their application to the courts.  But this same committee ensured that the 23 caravans increased in number to 80 overnight.  If those people are supposed to be helping the travelling people, then I am getting the wrong end of the stick.</P>

      <P>It has not been easy for any public representative in County Dublin to cope with this problem over the last few years because we have been battered from both ends, out in the field with the voters and those who were choosing to come to live in Tallaght. There are not many people choosing to come to live in it today; they will not until this problem is resolved.  Surely Senator Robinson does not want the town of Tallaght to accommodate a further 130 travelling people?  Where would the balance be if that were to happen?  It would be far more helpful if some of the people who are supposed to be helping the travelling people realised that they too, the travelling people, have a responsibility: today they are living in squalid conditions in the centre of Tallaght, a danger to themselves and to the settled population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three days ago I was on the site at Newtown, where those who chose to remain on the by-pass are living.  I pass that site two and three times a day.  I stopped my car and walked, and I found such appalling conditions that the travelling people must realise they are endangering their own lives.  Their health and lives are in danger not from the traffic but from the pollution and stench in that <Col N="693" /> area.  The settled population moved because they could see that neither central Government nor local government were making any headway in relieving the terrible conditions that existed in the centre of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Senator Robinson, who seems to be in daily touch with these people to tell them of their responsibility. They ask where they can move to, but they can move far easier than the settled population. Many of them could return to the counties they came from, even if it was only for a short while until we got the problem settled.  I believe a word from Senator Robinson would resolve the matter in Tallaght overnight, if she was willing to say it.</P>

      <P>I am refraining from saying many things because of the delicate situation we find ourselves in, but a plea was made for people who live in poverty in the centre of Tallaght.  I have outlined the steps taken by the local authority and the success we had in housing the numbers I have already put on the record.  I have to live with the situation. No taxes and no rates are being paid by these traders, some of whom have now purchased the best house ever built in Tallaght for £84,000.  If I purchased that house, what kind of a letter would I get from the Revenue Commissioners?  I am not free to move in that way.  Two acres of land were sold in the hill area three and a half miles from the centre of Tallaght and purchased by one of these traders for £8,000 and six acres were sold the week before last for £32,500.  A house was also purchased in Clondalkin &mdash; we saw it in the papers; it got a bit of publicity when the caravans moved in.  Another house was bought in Tallaght for £72,000. All of these were bought by traders from the Tallaght by-pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be poverty there &mdash; we housed one of the poorest families on the by-pass in a chalet &mdash; but they are never let starve, and I hope we never see the day when they will be let starve.  Seldom <Col N="694" /> do they have to call on the agencies the settled community have to call on.  There is less poverty among the travelling people on the Tallaght by-pass than there is among the settled community in the various housing estates in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Senator Brendan Ryan, if he has any contact with them, and to Senator Robinson, to have a serious chat with the people who are not Members of this House but who are listening to me now, and to impress upon them the responsibility they have, not to act as they did previously when they broke down bollards in the early hours of the morning and persuaded travelling people to move to a site they knew would create a flashpoint, because that is what they wanted.  I appeal to all these people &mdash; they may discuss this subject with me if they wish but they never have done so, and I am willing to discuss it with them &mdash; to tone down a situation that might escalate even further into a very serious situation.  That is my last appeal here today.  I hope Senator Robinson will discuss this matter with me and if there is any aspect of which she is unsure or any information she has been fed and cannot be sure is reliable &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me this time.  This is a very sensitive, serious and urgent matter. There is not very much I can say to help the situation, but I hope I do not say anything that would aggravate it because I am very concerned about this problem, as all Members are.  I agree that this problem did not develop overnight; it has been there for quite a few years and it has been getting bigger.  In the old days <Col N="695" /> travellers camped on the side of the road outside a farmer's field.  They used his field and after a few days a garda came on his bicycle and asked them to move, and they moved.  The situation has reached a most sophisticated stage now. The travellers know their rights and they do not move easily.</P>
      <P>I would not agree with Senator Robinson that politicians must bear total responsibility for this problem, or that they always run for cover.  There are more influential people in society than politicians.  I am not sure that politicians can solve this problem on their own at this stage.  Society must play its very important part.  I am in total sympathy with the travellers, particularly those with young children.  It seems strange that today we passed a Bill dealing with the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.  In section 3 of that Bill there is a clause which gives the Minister power to make regulations covering provisions with respect to the dimensions and layout of housing for such animals, the materials to be used in construction any such housing and the facilities by way of lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, regulating the level of humidity, air circulation, drainage, water supply or otherwise to be provided in connection with any such housing.  We appear to have our priorities upside down when we pass a Bill protecting animals while we have travellers living in bad caravans or in tents made of flimsy canvas or sacking.  The comparison seems out of keeping in an allegedly Christian country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have some kind of balance. I have the greatest concern for the people who bought sites and houses and who live in Tallaght because they feel they have to go out at night to man the barricades.  We have all come up against these problems. In my own area some time back, not far from the town a farmer living on a back road had this problem with travellers who camped outside his house.  They used his field; then made a toilet of his garden; and they made it clear they they were not going to move.  I had every sympathy for him.  Many of the people who plead so eloquently and rightly for the travellers <Col N="696" /> might have a more balanced view if they were in the position of that gentleman.</P>
    <P>I know there are many wealthy travellers. They have expensive caravans and cars.  I agree that not all of them come into this category, but to some extent it does influence society.  Senator Robinson said that many of those people depend on social welfare and begging, but it has been pointed out in the media that there is no need for begging in Dublin.  We have all come across a little girl begging on the footpath.  We could afford to throw her 10p or 20p and we would not miss it but we are told there is no need or advantage in that and that it is wrong because we are encouraging begging.  For Christians who regard the Mystical Body as the important element in Christianity it is very difficult to see in these people the person of Our Lord or to know what to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the only solution is to have permanent settlement for these people. That is most urgent.  Society would readily absorb all these people, with many benefits to society.  It would not be one-sided. In the old days the travellers and tinkers were craftsmen of the highest order.  They made items for houses and they made and decorated their caravans. It is tragic to see those skills lost.  There is only one way we can overcome that problem, and that is to settle those people in the community where they could bring up their children in a proper manner.  I have always felt that if a man or a woman want to live by travelling, lying in ditches or under trees, that is their right, but I do not think they should have the right to bring up children in those conditions. Society should make it possible for them to be housed, to send their children to school and to use their talents to the utmost.  A planned programme by the Government and local authorities is necessary to achieve this.</P>

      <P>Meath County <Col N="697" /> Council have done work for the travelling people that is second to none, including the local authority mentioned by Senator McMahon.  We in Meath are rightly proud of this.  The travellers who have been housed are playing their part in the community and their children are being integrated and I have no doubt that the people of Meath will benefit from this work.  I want to thank the Minister again for allowing me those few minutes.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at his Department.  They are both abroad on EEC business on different matters.  One could have got the impression from something Senator Robinson said &mdash; I am sure unwittingly &mdash; that if their priorities were right they would have been here.  I take the spirit of what the Senator says but, of course, the motion we are debating was ordered today at lunchtime, whereas the Minister for the Environment went abroad at the beginning of the week and the Minister of State went abroad this evening.  They did not know this matter was to be debated.  In fact, the House postponed the Road Traffic Bill because of their absence and this was notified to the House yesterday.  I say that in fairness to the two absent Ministers lest the record might be misunderstood.</P>

      <P>The motion we are debating is quite specific in its terms.  Inevitably and understandably the debate has developed into general consideration of the problem of travelling people.  Before considering some of the general aspects I would like to deal with the specifics in the motion.  The motion is concerned about the legal position arising from the present situation in Tallaght and more particularly in relation to the by-pass road.  I would like to assure Senator Robinson and other Members of the House that the Government would be very concerned to ensure that the rule of law is maintained in that area and is enforced with the <Col N="698" /> ultimate objective of ensuring that no harm comes to anybody.  This is the first priority.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to the risk from traffic because of the continued presence of travellers on the side of the by-pass. There is a Garda patrol in that area each day between 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. the following day.  The objectives of that patrol are to ensure that people are safe and that no harm will ensue and that as a consequence of the presence of the gardaí no breaches of the law will be committed and no breaches of the peace will take place.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, with regard to the rally planned for Saturday, the Garda are sensitive to the implications of that rally. They have been in touch with the organisers in advance to ensure that the rally will be peaceful and that it will be an orderly demonstration.  There is a constitutional right of assembly and free demonstration which has to be acknowledged and facilitated, but it also has to be peaceful and orderly.  I have every confidence that the good advice available from the gardaí will be accepted by the residents of the area and that it will not be their objective to have anything other than an orderly rally.  I express a strong wish that that is how matters will turn out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of the rule of law is essential for the continued survival of our democracy and its importance cannot be over-emphasised.  The rule of law has underlying it the requirement that there is a consensus on the part of the population to accept it and obey it.  Sometimes that consensus comes close to breaking and then a serious dilemma arises for the State with regard to enforcement of the rule of law having regard to the fragility of the underlying consensus at a particular time.  In that situation one has to rely on the discretion and good sense of those charged with the enforcement of the law. We have to leave it to their tactical judgment as to how the law should be enforced.  There are various methods which can be employed by the police as to how they should go about discharging their duty, ranging from what one might call a heavy handed approach to a softly, softly approach.  But in the ultimate the <Col N="699" /> main thing we must be concerned with is that the rule of law does not break down and that it gets enforced.  We have to rely on the tactical discretion and good sense of those we have charged with enforcing the rule of law to see that that happens. It is a very difficult situation for the police in the Tallaght area.  So far as I can perceive it as an outsider with no intimate knowledge, I think the matter is being handled with discretion, and the proof of that is that there has been a minimum of violence in that area.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear differing perspectives on the problem as represented by the view of Senator Robinson, and to some extent by Senator Ryan, and the view of Senator McMahon.  Senator McMahon resides in the area and has been imtimately familiar with the problem as it originated and developed.  Senator Robinson is obviously closely involved in the problem and brings a detailed knowledge to it.  I do not propose to make a value judgment as between the two points of view, but what I say is that each point of view has its own kernel of validity.  In saying that, I think I highlight the dilemma that faces society in grappling with and solving this immensely difficult problem.  At the kernel of that problem there are two contradictory things to be achieved &mdash; integration faced at the same time with resistance.  This essential dilemma has been experienced by communities and local authorities all over the country in grappling with the problem of settling travelling people and it is present to an unusually large extent in Tallaght.  The problem has become emotive in recent days because of developments.</P>
    <P>Essentially it is for the settled community to accept the settlement of travellers within their midst.  To get to that stage there has to be either central or local government involvement in arranging the mechanics of the settlement.  The implementation of those arrangements has caused some difficulty in the last decade or so when the problem first began to be seriously looked at.  While there have been difficulties, there has been progress &mdash; it was interesting to hear the progress that has been made in the <Col N="700" /> Tallaght district, and the figures which Senator McMahon quoted were of themselves not insignificant and could be described as impressive and a tribute to the community.  In fairness to the community who might at the moment be the subject of blame for reacting the other way and to preserve the balance, that should be said.</P>
    <P>One thousand five hundred and eighty families have been accommodated in the last decade in housing chalets or halting sites.  In 1983 for the first time in years the number of families on the roadside has reduced.  I hope that is the beginning of a continuing and consistent reduction in the problem.  In the hope that this will continue and in order to give momentum to this downward trend, the Government, having received the report of the Travelling People Review Body, set up a task force of Ministers with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(a)  to ensure the urgent consideration by the relevant Departments and public authorities of the recommendation in the report of the Travelling People Review Body,</P>
    <P>(b)  to identify and implement those recommendations in the report which are capable of implementation in the current financial situation, and</P>
    <P>(c)  to examine the question of whether responsibility for selection of serviced sites should be determined at national level.</P>
    <P>If Senators reflect on those terms of reference they will see how important they are and how critical the successful implementation of them will be to the final solution of this problem.  The ministerial task force will be reporting to Government within the next few days and it will then be for Government to make decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, that is a misapprehension. The review body's proposals came before Government and were referred to the ministerial task force for the nuts and bolts of their implementation. We expect to be presented with the details of those nuts and bolts in the next few days.  We will then hopefully make decisions which can be the start of the final solution to the problem of settling travelling people.  It is an immensely difficult problem.  Even with the most sophisticated machinery that could be devised by government there will still be the underlying bottom line criteria &mdash; the acceptance by the settled communities of certain numbers of travelling people to be settled within their midst whether in houses or on sites.  Until that is successfully <Col N="702" /> grappled with, the problem cannot be successfully concluded.</P>
      <P>I hope that the situation in Tallaght will be defused.  A contribution towards defusing could be made by all public representatives when they are advocating their particular point of view and it should be done with discretion, always bearing in mind that every problem has two sides.  I hope that both the settled community and the travellers in Tallaght will realise for their own sake the importance of the maintenance of the rule of law and will co-operate with the police in ensuring that no breaches of the peace or injury occur.  I want to assure the House that the Government are extremely sensitive about the dimensions of this problem and will treat the matter as urgent when is comes before them in the next few days.  Again, I can only urge public representatives, where they can exercise influence at local authority level or in community groups, to ensure that their voice will be directed towards getting acceptance of what I believe is the fundamental problem, that is, to get the settled community to agree to a reasonable and appropriate number of travellers being settled in their midst.</P>
