      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1 to 5 and to take No. 5 at 6.30, unless reached earlier, which would be most unlikely.  It is proposed to adjourn from 5.30 to 6.30.  I might, perhaps, indicate to the Seanad why the Order of Business is as it is.  Senators will be aware that there is a large amount of Government business on the Order Paper at the moment.  Of that business it is essential that No. 1, the European Assembly Elections Bill, should be passed before the House adjourns for Easter.  Accordingly it is being ordered for today.  Naturally the Minister would like to have this Bill as soon as possible but, if the House desires &mdash; and my understanding is that it does desire &mdash; a separate Committee Stage, this would be possible on the understanding that all Stages would be passed this day week.  In regard to No. 4, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, which is already being debated on Second Stage, I gave an undertaking that if Government business permitted this debate could be resumed in Government time.  Actually the pressure of Government business does not permit it &mdash; there is more Government business to be dealt with &mdash; but nevertheless I think it is appropriate that it should be ordered for today.  It is my intention, if it is not reached today, that it should <Col N="740" /> be ordered higher up on the Order Paper on this day week.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a new method of filling casual vacancies which occur in Ireland's representation in the European Assembly.  The existing procedure is that the Dáil appoints a person to fill the vacancy on the nomination of the party which won the seat at the preceding Assembly election.  In the case of a non-party representative both the nomination and appointment would be matters for the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The system of election used in this country, proportional representation &mdash; by means of the single transferable vote &mdash; is widely regarded as a most democratic electoral system.  It gives electors the widest choice as between candidates and parties and the greatest measure of control in the election of representatives. The system compares very favourably with those offered by neighbouring countries, enabling the elector to make a complex series of choices.  However, there are particular difficulties in devising a method of filling casual vacancies which will complement this process while satisfying the requirements of fairness and simplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Two methods of filling casual vacancies under the STV system are used in this country, by-elections in the case of Dáil Éireann, and co-option in the case of local authorities.  One of the possible effects of a by-election is, of course, the distortion of the proportional representation of a constituency as decided by the democratic vote of the people at the preceding general election.  Many arguments can be advanced both for and against by-elections as a means of filling casual vacancies.</P>
    <P>However, in this instance, I feel we must face the reality of the prospect of by-elections in far flung constituencies, possibly in winter conditions, in a situation in which the European Assembly seems, as yet, to have commanded only limited electoral commitment.  The case against the by-elections approach to filling casual vacancies in the Assembly is pretty strong.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the political composition of the Assembly as established by the people at a general election is regarded as being of considerable importance. In this regard it is highly significant that none of the draft proposals for a uniform electoral procedure prepared over the years, commencing with the draft prepared for the original six members of the EEC over 20 years ago, envisaged a by-election procedure.</P>
    <P>In regard to co-option, the arrangement contained in the 1977 Act is, in essence, a development of the co-option idea.  Obviously straight forward co-option by the Assembly as a whole would not be appropriate.  The present arrangement contains a built-in refinement to ensure that, as far as possible, the political composition of our representation in the Assembly would not be distorted as a result of casual vacancies.  The arrangement had the support of all parties.  It was originally included in a Bill sponsored by the Coalition Government, and following the general election of 1977 was repeated in a Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Unfortunately, because of the reservations of the Credentials Committee, it has become necessary to seek an alternative arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> When the first vacancy was filled under this method, certain members of the Credentials Committee of the Assembly voiced reservations about our system on the basis of Article 1 of the relevant European Community instrument.  This article provides that representatives in the Assembly must be elected by direct universal suffrage.  These reservations were brought to the attention of the Government and the Government indicated that consideration would be given to amending the legislation in order to ensure that the arrangement for filling casual vacancies would be seen to be fully in keeping with the relevant European requirement.  Any new procedure decided on will have effect from the next Assembly elections which will be held in June of this year.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, been left with a fairly complex problem.  We have had to devise a method of filling casual vacancies which would be seen to be in keeping with the requirement of election by direct universal suffrage and, at the same time, would be appropriate in our particular circumstances and would fit in with our unique electoral system.</P>
    <P>Having considered a series of options, the Government decided to recommend the arrangement set out in this Bill. Essentially the proposal is that at an Assembly election each political party and each independent candidate will be entitled to nominate a separate list of replacement candidates who will be available to fill any vacancies arising in the constituency.  The political party or the non-party candidate concerned will determine the order of names on the replacement candidates list.  When a vacancy occurs, it will be filled by the person whose name is at the top of the list presented by the political party or the non-party candidate who held the seat at the Assembly election.</P>
    <P>The replacement candidates' lists will be published in the statutory Notice of Poll issued by the returning officer.  The method of publishing this notice is a matter for the returning officer.  In 1979 it was published in the daily newspapers.  It is likely that this method will be used again on this occasion.  Returning officers <Col N="743" /> will be advised, in addition, to publish it by way of posters displayed throughout the constituency and at the polling station on polling day.  The entry in relation to each candidate on the ballot paper will include a reference to the appropriate list of replacement candidates.  However, the names of the replacement candidates will not be printed on the ballot papers.  This is because of practical considerations which suggest that if we were further to complicate an already complex ballot paper we would risk causing confusion in the minds of the electorate.  It is not difficult to understand the difficulty, if not the impracticability, of adding to an already long ballot paper the names and addresses of all the replacement candidates likely to be nominated under these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The details of how the arrangements will operate are set out in the explanatory memorandum.  I will be pleased to clarify, in my replying speech or on Committee Stage, any points which the House might wish me to deal with.</P>
    <P>I should add at this point that the European Assembly is required to draw up proposals for a uniform electoral procedure in all member states pursuant to the terms of the treaties.  Proposals were drawn up during the present term by the Assembly.  However, agreement was not reached at the Council of Ministers level in time to enable a uniform system to be in operation for this year's election. Efforts to reach agreement are to be resumed with a view to having a uniform procedure in place for the 1989 elections. It is possible, therefore, that the arrangements we are now considering may apply for a single five-year term only.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to make a series of amendments to the First Schedule to the 1977 Act which prescribes the rules for the conduct of Assembly elections. The most important is contained in section 2 of the Bill which provides that a person holding the office of Attorney-General shall not be eligible for election to the Assembly and that holding office as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil, Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach will be incompatible <Col N="744" /> with membership of the Assembly. As Senators are aware, members of the Government may not, under the European Community instrument, be members of the Assembly.  The Government have considered it desirable that the position in regard to the other offices referred to should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Another important amendment of the 1977 Act has been made in relation to the verification of ballot paper accounts.  The Bill provides that the verification of ballot paper accounts will be carried out in each county and county borough rather than at European constituency level.  This arrangement has been provided on the advice of returning officers.  The actual counting of the votes will, of course, take place at a single centre in each constituency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to state that I make no extravagant claims for the method we have chosen.  However, I do think that when the system is implemented we will have a simple and effective means of filling casual vacancies in Ireland's representation in the European Assembly.  We will also have a system that is compatible both with the demands of the European authorities and the structure and character of the Irish electoral system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill.  In the Dáil I am glad that the original intention with regard to the number of replacement candidates proposed by the Government of three was changed to four at the request of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a more acceptable number.  Understandably some people are still confused about the number of candidates, that it is plus four in the major political parties. There may be a slight anomaly percent-agewise where there is one candidate only standing for smaller parties.  That is something we will have to accept.  However, the Bill as it stands is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this Bill we were talking about changes in the electoral system.  I am more than surprised that at this stage the Government can rush through legislation and want the Committee Stage taken here today while at the same time we have been advocating for a number of <Col N="745" /> years the introduction of postal voting for disabled people We are told that legislation is being prepared.  Yet the invalided or disabled are being refused their democratic right to vote because such a Bill has not been introduced.  I appeal to the Minister here today to introduce this legislation. When we can introduce a Bill such as this at such short notice surely the Minister should look seriously at the question of postal voting for the disabled and merely expand the current system to enable postal voting by the Garda and Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should now revert to the provisions of the Bill before the House.  I appreciate what he is saying but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that you appreciate what I am saying.  Under the provisions of this Bill we are talking about changes in the electoral system. My reading of it is that it is the electoral system about which we are talking.  Members of this House should have the right to express their opinion on the electoral system because it is referred to in connection with Dáil or county council elections with regard to replacement candidates. We might well ask ourselves should we adopt the principle of this Bill with regard to elections to Dáil Éireann and have a list of candidates to fill casual vacancies, when the much talked of by-election situation would not or might not necessarily occur.  Indeed, the members of the Government would not then be receiving justifiable criticism about hesitation or running away from their commitment with regard to the Laois-Offaly by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Government introduced legislation to provide for voting here by British citizens.  While we have no objection in principle to the provision of voting rights for British citizens &mdash; after all Irish people have voting rights in England &mdash; yet the Government found that this was unconstitutional and we must now hold a referendum on this issue on 14 June. Reverting to what I said earlier with regard to postal voting for disabled people, certainly that could not be challenged <Col N="746" /> on constitutional grounds.  The only objection I heard voiced by the then Minister &mdash; of my constituency &mdash; who introduced it was that there were allegations of serious abuses of the system.  Any Member of this House would challenge that statement because there were no abuses.  There were reported abuses but where were there convictions?  To my knowledge nobody was convicted of abuses of the system in the 1973-74 period when there was postal voting for local elections in 1974.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to give serious and urgent consideration to the introduction of a Bill that would grant democratic rights for postal voting facilities for disabled people in this country. As I said at the outset, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, we support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcomed in that it proposes minor but essential changes in the electoral procedure under which representatives of the European Assembly will be chosen.  It also includes further amendments of the methods by which the party or independent representation decided on by the electorate will be maintained over the five-year life of the Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we should recognise that the criteria applicable to an Assembly such as this have a certain known life, in other words, irrespective of the change or otherwise in representation from Ireland the European Assembly will last for five years.  The difference between that kind of representation and the situation obtaining in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; whereby a general election can be called at any time &mdash; is a fundamental one.  The  system must recognise that difference.  The people elected to the European Assembly will continue to operate over the whole five-year period.  There is no question of an early election being called.  That does not arise in this case.  Therefore, what is important as far as this country is concerned is that there be the maximum stability of representation, that the views of the people, as expressed through the ballot box, with regard to the proportion of representatives who should be members <Col N="747" /> of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, or Independents, should be maintained during the whole five-year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out a number of options available to this House and to the other House in making that choice.  The simple system of co-option could be used. The system of co-option proposed here has at least the additional value that in so far as it is possible to do so, within reason, all the people who will be used as substitutes during the course of the next five years will have gone before the people by way of being included in a substitute list. That is important because while voters might support a particular political party or might support a particular individual, if they do not like the people on the substitute lists that might be a vital factor in their deciding to vote for another candidate. This element of increased democratic representation and choice in the matter of substitutes is very important.  It is also very important to maintain our high profile and good standing within the European Assembly.  It is most important that the Irish representatives would not only be representative of the people in Ireland but would be accepted by those with whom they work on a day-to-day basis as being so representative.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the proposed system is welcomed by the Fine Gael Members of the House.  There are just a few points I would like to make about it.  We can deal with them in detail on Committee Stage. The Minister has gone some of the way towards expanding the categories of people who are ineligible for election to the European Parliament.  He has included Ministers of State, certain officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Attorney General.  It is only right that that should be the case.  I do not think anybody holding such a position should be eligible for election while he holds that office.  This is not necessarily my party's viewpoint but personally I am sorry the Minister has not gone further and declared that it would not be possible for a person to serve both as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, or in particular the other House of the <Col N="748" /> Oireachtas, and as a member of the European Assembly.  I am not suggesting that the rule should be framed in such a way as to prevent Members of this or the other House from standing for election to the European Assembly.  That is very legitimate and to be encouraged.  There are many people in this House and in the other House who feel they have a contribution to make to our future prosperity in that way.  But, having been successful in that attempt, it would be proper that they be requested to opt immediately for whichever of the two places they wish to serve in.  The mere fact of their names being put forward either on the A list or on B list for the European Assembly elections &mdash; if elected &mdash; should render them ineligible for the period they continue to serve there.  I understand that over the years no political party can contend that they have been consistent in this regard.  I was going to overlook the consistency of the Labour Party because I think it was a most peculiar consistency &mdash; they were consistenly disgraceful in that regard.</P>
    <P>The time has come when those elected to the European Parliament should have to opt between one or the other.  It is not good enough to have a Deputy in Dáil Eireann who has a constituency to look after and also serve in the European Parliament. Certainly I have no objection to any Member of the Dáil or Seanad standing for election to the European Assembly. But, having been elected to Europe, such Member owes it to the people to change then and allow a new person who can devote his or her full time to representing the people in Dáil Éireann. Whatever changes are necessary to enable this to be done in a reasoned and non-contentious manner should be implemented.  It is becoming increasingly impossible for people to do a good job representing our people in this or the other House of the Oireachtas and simultaneously attend the European Parliament. I am a little sorry that section 2 of the Bill has not been expanded to include some provision to reduce the possibility of a dual mandate in the future.  This dual mandate has got a bad name, and deservedly so, and we should be working <Col N="749" /> towards phasing it out.  It would be in the interests of all political parties that that be done.</P>
    <P>The other main bone of contention in the public discussion which has preceded our consideration of this Bill is the question of the number of replacement candidates which should be permitted in respect of both party and non-party candidates. The Bill attempts to solve this problem in a very fair way.  It seeks to lay down, in the case of party candidates, that the number of replacement candidates will be four and, in the case of non-party, three.  In practice that would work out very well.  In the case of a political party which had three candidates standing in a constituency they would be entitled to nominate three candidates and then four additional candidates.  I shall have to pursue the Minister on Committee Stage with regard to the entitlement of the other candidates who are standing to be on that list and the extent, if any, to which they are counted in making up that four.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister, that is the potential problem that might arise in the case of political parties deciding to nominate one candidate only. From time to time some political parties nominate one candidate only.  From section 2 (3) it would appear that four additional names would be the maximum number of names that the party could put forward.  Contrast that with the position of an Independent who stands.  He can put forward only three and that is plenty but I wonder if an Independent would have a fair cause for complaint in that case.  A political party which puts forward two or more candidates is entirely different because they both might be elected. They would have a greater need for a higher number of replacement candidates. A political party which only puts forward one candidate is entitled to four substitutes.  Compare that to the position of an Independent who puts himself and three others forward.  Will the Independent candidate have a constitutional action in that regard in that he is not being treated the same as other people?  Three <Col N="750" /> is quite sufficient for an Independent.  I am not in favour of allowing an Independent a very long list because in that way he can create a caucus which would give him an unfair advantage.</P>
    <P>I am bringing this matter to the attention of the Minister because it is important. No doubt the Minister is satisfied about it and he might share his knowledge with us during Committee Stage. We must find out if it has a secure constitutional basis.  If it has, I am happy to let it go through.  I do not think it is unfair to anyone but it could be represented as being unfair.</P>
    <P>The other amendments which the Minister is proposing with regard to a variation in the number of hours and changes in the rules for selecting a candidate are normal and logical.  I also note that the Minister is proposing a change with regard to the manner in which the votes shall be sorted.  It appears that the votes will be sorted face upwards which I understand to mean with the voting side upwards.  If that is the case the result will be known in advance of the count which I understand will be postponed for a few days.  There is no doubt that in the Munster area where there is a vast reservoir of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter to me because you will find it out in total if you do not find it out individually.  I am a little concerned about the result being known in advance of the count and whether that will look well compared to the rest of Europe.  The purpose of the delay is so that the counting process can commence at the same time in various countries throughout Europe.  Some of them will <Col N="751" /> not be voting until the Sunday after 14 June.  I would like the Minister to satisfy us that these changes are in the interest of democracy in general and in the interest of the European Assembly in particular.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tackled a very difficult problem which has given rise to some considerable aggravation in the European Assembly.  It has been tackled in such a way that any substitutes we send over the next five years will have a mandate from the people.  That is important with regard to their status and self-image.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the general structure of the Bill and assure him of our support and help in processing the Bill speedily through the House recognising the necessity to examine these matters on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my contribution I wish to pose a few questions which I hope the Minister will answer in his reply.  I will also comment on the importance and relevance of the elections.  What arrangements have been made in Northern Ireland for replacing MEPs?  Should we not be aiming at a more uniform electoral system here so that both parts of the island would be in conformity?  As regards the voting day, June 14, for the European elections, it is proposed to hold a referendum on the same day to amend the Constitution in order to enable British and other EEC citizens to vote in elections here.  Is it intended to publish a White Paper in connection with that constitutional amendment?  How is the constitutional campaign to be organised and what will be the cost of such a campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European elections are important and it behoves all parties to make every effort to ensure the maximum poll.  The European Parliament, as an important organ of the Community, is faced with very serious issues, not least the issue of unemployment.  The latest statistic shows that 12 million people are out of work in the Community.  The achievement of a single Community market, made up of 273 million consumers, free from customs duties and restrictive quantitative measures <Col N="752" /> on trade is essential if the European economy is to compete with the US and Japan.  The situation in the US and Japan is that there are millions of new jobs being created and in sharp and discouraging contrast jobs are shrinking in the Community.  I heard a member of the European Parliament, who was not from the Republic, say on a radio programme recently that the European Parliament is a talking shop and does not have any real clout except in budgetary matters.  We all know it has limited powers.  However, it is worth noting that some very useful and relevant work is conducted there.  I propose to give a few examples of such work, particularly as they relate to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is more sensitive and alert now to the Parliament because its proposals are put before the Parliament for discussion and consideration. It is noteworthy that the directly elected parliamentarians propose amendments from time to time to the Commission's proposals and that in several cases these amendments have been taken seriously by the Commission and reflected in the final draft.  These amendments are particularly important when they apply to the Social Fund and the Regional Fund which are of obvious relevance to Ireland.  As regards the work of the Parliament in relation to Ireland and our interests here, the European Progressive Democrats as a group should be congratulated.  In 1983, as a result of the initiative of the EPD, the year was dedicated to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises &mdash; SMEs.  This highlighted the role of SMEs in job creation and led to the allocation of more funds from the new Social Fund to training of employees of SMEs.  Projects aided by the Social Fund in Ireland are reimbursed 55 per cent of the cost.  Also, in connection with the work of the Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mean to move too much off course.  In the context of employment generation, the work of <Col N="753" /> the EPD is of immediate consequence to those who will be elected and to the substitutes should they take their place in the Parliament.  I am referring to the work of one group in the promotion of jobs.</P>
      <P>The EPD group, which is made up of Fianna Fáil MEPs and their French allies, succeeded also through their work in the Parliament in ensuring that all people under the age of 25 years would be eligible to receive aid from the Social Fund for training programmes.  I reiterate the plea I made that all political parties make every effort possible to get the maximum poll on June 14 and therefore support the concept and work of the European Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right and proper that we should set out exactly what the European Parliament originally suggested might be done and how we approached the problem.  In dealing with the Assembly as it was then called because it was an assembly of nations which were, generally speaking, nominated by the various parliaments within the Community.  Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome in 1958 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The Assembly, which shall consist of representatives of the peoples of the states brought together in the Community, shall exercise the advisory and supervisory powers which are conferred upon it by this Treaty.</P>
    <P>Under that article this country nominated ten people.  They were based on the representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was an appropriate norm to use to decide on the number of members that each party would have within the Assembly.</P>
    <P>Article 138, section 3, of the Treaty of Rome states:</P>
    <P>The Assembly shall draw up proposals for elections by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all Member States.</P>
    <P>That was the first challenge of the Treaty of Rome but unfortunately the Assembly did not take that challenge seriously or initiate any proposals until it was further pursued in a Summit conference held in Paris in 1974.  In 1958 they were asked to do it and in 1960 they decided that they should do something about it.  It took another 14 years until a conference in Paris for the heads of governments to notice that the election of the European Assembly by universal suffrage was an objective laid down in the Treaty which should be achieved as soon as possible.  In this connection they awaited with interest the proposals of the European Assembly on which they wished the Council to act in 1976.  On that assumption, elections by direct universal suffrage could take place any time after 1978.  Accordingly in 1975 the Assembly decided that they would have universal suffrage.  In doing so, it was to take into account the electoral voting procedure in each member state. It decided also that it would be improper or impracticable to have all the voting on the same day throughout the Community so it decided on a number of days starting with a Thursday morning and ending on the following Sunday.  I am sorry that we did not avail of the opportunity on this occasion to have the first elections in this country held on a Sunday.  It would have been appropriate to start with the European <Col N="755" /> elections in view of the fact that many of our colleagues in Europe will be voting on a Sunday in this very important electoral campaign.  Two and a quarter million people in Ireland are entitled to vote in the European election and we could have facilitated that many people by having the election on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>In addition to deciding that they would allow each country to pick its date between Thursday and Sunday Article 12 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Pending the entry into force of the uniformed electoral procedure referred to in Article 7 (1) and subject to other provisions of this Act, each Member State shall lay down appropriate procedures for filling any seat which falls vacant during the five-year term of office referred to in Article 3 for the remainder of that period.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the Assembly, which shall take note of that fact.</P>
    <P>It was because of that that we initiated the legislation which was referred to by previous speakers.  We decided to eliminate the possibility of having a by-election. This would be unheard of in a European context and certainly unheard of in the multiple constituencies which are involved in the European elections. Rather than adopt a co-option system, we decided that the party that lost the seat for any reason would have the power to nominate a substitute and that the substitute would be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas and sent to the Assembly.  For a sub-committee of the Assembly to cast aspersions on us for having done that was a little high-handed. I hope that whenever they raise this problem the Credentials Committee will refer to section 12 of the original Treaty which set up the Parliament and gave this country the power to decide on a system of co-option.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows exactly what we said about the European elections.  As a party who are basically European and have <Col N="756" /> many colleagues and political allies in the European and international socialist movement, we wanted to participate fully in the decisions that are made at European Parliament level.  For that reason we sent some of our best people to Europe in the 1979 direct elections.  Our posters stated that Labour were sending some of their best people to Europe.</P>
    <P>Afterwards when ministerial posts were available to our party we had a national responsibility to ensure that the best people available to the Labour Party, who had been democratically elected to the Dáil initially, could return from Europe to take up the challenge.  I see nothing wrong with it.  I defend it and I am sorry other people have criticised it. We did it in the national interest.  Those who returned on the first occasion suffered financially.</P>
    <P>We were criticised by the Opposition party who said we were playing musical chairs.  Every day the nominations came up in the Dáil for verification there was criticism of what we were doing.  Reference was made by Senator Hillery to the excellent work of his political group in the European Parliament&mdash;the European Progressive Democrats.  I do not doubt for a moment that they have contributed quite a lot to the Parliament but they have contributed many substitutes to the Parliament.  In a period of five years their de Gaullist colleagues used the system to change their delegates on an annual basis.  The de Gaullist party have changed almost 60 people during the lifetime of this Parliament.  That should be on the record of this House in case there is any condemnation of us as a small party for having used the system that was legally adopted in the Houses of the Oireachtas as the appropriate way to fill vacancies.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get as close as possible to the European system of elections to the European Parliament.  They use a list system.  They have no qualms of conscience whatsoever because of that. They feel it is an extension of the terminology &ldquo;universal suffrage&rdquo;.  When people are voting for candidates it is important that they know the identity of the substitutes who will represent them <Col N="757" /> in case the original candidates meet with some catastrophe or accident.  I am a substitute but I am only interested in democracy.  Legislation which would bring us as close as possible to the list system would be welcomed by both sides of the House and by our colleagues in Europe as well.  We will, for the first time, be coming closer to the type of system that they operate in Europe.  The difference is that they provide a list of all the candidates and the political aspirations of various groupings.  These are designated by the colours of the ballot papers, and you do not put any mark whatever on the ballot paper with all the names on it.  One is voting for the first person and the number of votes decides the number of people from that list who are elected to the Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is a further extension of our proportional representation system which is more advantageous to smaller parties.  It is more democratic and the Irish electorate understand it.  They cast votes in order of preference even for candidates of different political affiliations.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is the choice of the people.  We should always abide by the people's decision.  I hope people will use the system in the spirit in which this Bill is presented to them.  It provides them with an opportunity for the first time not alone to have a transferable vote but to have an option of candidates in the event of anything happening to their primary candidate.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator O'Leary is valid and must be looked at.  We must not give the impression that this system works more fairly for politicians than it does for Independents.  They should be treated as a separate entity and should have the same power to decide on the number of substitutes that they might require.  This legislation puts a limit on the number that an Independent might nominate.</P>
    <P>I am interested to hear how the Minister responds to that.  If there is an anomaly, the sooner we tidy it up the better. We must remember that in the referendum to enter into Europe we conferred the right on everybody whose country was a member of the European Community <Col N="758" /> to vote in the country in which they are resident.  I presume that there is no question but that people should exercise this right.</P>
    <P>Disabled people are not debarred from voting.  The only problem is one of accessibility to polling stations.  This will be dealt with under different legislation.  In spite of what Senator Lynch said, there were anomalies in the past as regards postal voting.  That is not a matter for this Bill.  I am satisfied that there is an inbuilt right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, could the Senator mention one of those anomalies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will if the Leas-Chathaoirleach wants me to be out of order and discuss voting for the disabled.  Legislation will be coming before us which will give us an opportunity to debate that in full.  I should like to feel that everybody in this country can vote.  I would like to see accessibility to polling stations for people in wheelchairs.  I hope the legislation will be brought in very quickly.</P>
      <P>As regards the dual mandate, people who are prepared to commit themselves to a county council, an urban council, the Dáil or Seanad and the European Parliament and can physically do so should not be precluded by legislation from doing so.  A party can decide what members can contest an election but, constitutionally, everybody has a right to be nominated and to contest an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A perfect example of how well it can be done can be seen in the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, who in his day was originally nominated by Parliament to represent us in Europe.  In the first direct elections to the European Parliament he was elected to Wicklow Urban Council, to Wicklow County Council, to the Dáil and to the European Parliament.  He performed in every one of them admirably and the records will show that.  He did it without any regard for his health or for the problems it might have created for him privately. That was his commitment, and I admire somebody with that commitment. It would be improper to put down legislation <Col N="759" /> that would preclude people from doing so.  You can deal with the financial rewards for doing all that in a different way.  Most of the cricitism about dual mandates relates to the amount of money that people can earn by being Members of the House here and the European Parliament.  I am glad that many members of our party have that commitment. Their voting records and attendance records show that when the national situation at home demands it or when a question of a national nature was being debated in Europe they were present and voted, unlike other people who did not have dual mandates and could not be in the European Parliament for strategic votes on questions which were relevant to this country and which will be the basis of much political argument during the campaign.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has discussed very important things and people with the dual mandate managed to be there.  That is my comment about it.  It might not even be relevant to the Bill as such but I want it in the debate because I think it is only fair and proper that we would put the situation as we see it on our side of the House and as we have worked the legislation which was laid before us.  We have nothing to be ashamed of.  We have done our job as a small party both at national level and at European level.  We will continue to do that and we will still send some of our best people to Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this European Assembly Elections Bill, 1984.  However, I regret slightly that the Government were not more ambitious and did not introduce the real European type list &mdash; the list in the majority of our sister countries in the European Parliament.  It would have been a greater step towards a more unified approach to the European Assembly.  It would also bring us that much closer to the ideal of a fully united Europe.  However, I appreciate all the difficulties that are there. Other speakers have said that perhaps the Minister could have introduced balloting on Sundays.  I assume he considered it.  I suppose it would have been a <Col N="760" /> step towards the European ideal to have voting here on Sunday.  From an Irish point of view the only advantage of that would be to people who are forced to be away all week working: it would give them a chance to be at home for the count.  Nevertheless I welcome section 7, which will certainly expedite the actual count itself by having the ballot papers more or less counted.  The count proper would be able to proceed directly on the Monday morning.  That will mean that our results will be a little earlier than they were on the last occasion.  It is a small step further in that direction.</P>
      <P>Looking at the representation in the European Assembly from an Irish point of view, the Irish constituencies are still rather large, if we consider the traditional Irish way of representing people.  Perhaps it might be an appropriate time to think about the single-seat constituencies for Europe which would reduce the landmass considerably in most areas with the exception of the Dublin city area where you have a huge constituency, but nevertheless you have not got the physical expanse of counties to cover.  This Bill is envisaged to cover and meet the needs of European elections for the coming five years.  The Minister said in his Second Stage speech that it is expected that a unified electoral system will be in operation, or will be accepted or passed by the Council of Ministers in time for the next scheduled European elections in 1989.</P>
      <P>I notice a trend in the elections here. The European election is becoming one in which money is counting and it is fast becoming an arena in which literally millionaires and the well-to-do can obviously spend more and get into the limelight much more successfully.  Many years ago, even in the Dáil elections, there was an accounting system that was changed in one of the electoral Acts back over the last ten or 15 years.  A time might come, at an appropriate future date when perhaps the Minister might look at that trend.  It is important that while we accept that we have free elections, everybody should be able to aspire to representing the people.  The fact of not being a millionaire should not adversely affect somebody's chances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> A greater effort should have been made by our 15 MEPs to lobby their colleagues in the Parliament over the last couple of months on the Irish national interest.  I know that it made the position of the Minister for Agriculture that much more difficult by virtue of the fact that the Parliament did not pass a positive resolution in support of the Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought it was worth mentioning in passing, but I bow to your ruling.  While one could not say that the Bill is entirely technical, the sections are indeed extremely long.  From that point of view, there are many things that need to be explained.  There appears to be some ambiguity about the sections and the problems that might arise in the event of a candidate dying before the actual election.  I know that the Bill provides for that.  It is difficult to understand exactly where the dividing line is because in one part it says that a candidate's death does not necessarily mean that he will not be elected.</P>

      <P>Obviously I support and welcome the Bill because it gives the electorate a choice which did not exist before in so far as a substitute candidate will be deemed to have stood and offered himself before the public.  Senator Ferris covered very adequately the Labour Party position, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dual mandate but if there is one thing guaranteed to keep me in my seat until I get a chance to <Col N="762" /> reply it is when my distinguished colleague, Senator O'Leary, issues an encyclical to the Labour Party rather than Fine Gael.  A man from Mars listening to Senator O'Leary might imagine that you trotted off down to Switzers and picked up a dual mandate.  You have to win a dual mandate: the people have to decide. In our case, in the case of the Labour Party in the results of the last European election, the people made it quite clear who they wanted in the European Parliament and they subsequently made it quite clear who they wanted in Dáil Eireann. They wanted, as Senator Ferris said, one and the same person and the one and the same person had then a dual mandate but got it from the people.</P>
      <P>The situation with the then Senator Halligan and Senator Flor O'Mahony was that it was a Euro-constituency selection process, even more democratic again than the first time we used it when we actually nominated people.  The question of a dual mandate affects us as a small party and, as a party that has been consistent in terms of looking at and acting in the national interest such as when a person like Deputy Eileen Desmond was asked to return from the European Parliament to accept a position in the Government that by no stretch of the imagination could be considered secure; they were a Government without an overall majority.  That required sacrifice and it was subsequently seen that that Government had a very short life.  In the subsequent general election Deputy Eileen Desmond got herself elected handsomely showing that people recognised the fact that she responded to a request from our party to return to take office in a Government which nobody could say were secure.  As regards the dual mandate &mdash; Senator Ferris has said and I will repeat it &mdash; it is given by the electorate and I am happy, as I am sure Senator O'Leary is, to abide by the decision of the ordinary electorate of Ireland and whatever they do.  They are the wisest people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State has stated, the Bill could run out in 1989 if there is a uniform system agreed upon in Europe. I would like to see not just a uniform <Col N="763" /> system of replacements and so on.  Sunday voting is something we have always been interested in; it is time that we looked at the days on which we vote.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Lynch said <i>vis-à-vis</i> the voting for the disabled; it is one of the things we have failed to do.  Successive Governments have failed to vindicate the rights of people who are invalided or confined to hospital and now of people who are four to five miles offshore in some of the most difficult and dangerous jobs the country asks its people to do, on oil rigs and gas rigs.  Suddenly they are disfranchised There is no valid reason why these people should not have the facility to vote, whether is it in national, local or European elections.</P>
    <P>The reservation I have when we are talking about the European Parliament and the system of election is that I truly believe that both Houses of the Oireachtas have failed to come to grips with this third parliamentary tier of 15 MEPs.  An MEP is in a sort of isolation, away from the normal political process.  He has an input into the party but little, if any, directly into Government.  Because of the size of this country and because of the necessity to fight in a united way in Europe for Ireland, whether you are from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, I would have thought that MEPs would have been accorded some sort of privy counsellor status as they have in Britain when they need to convey confidential information in the interests of Britain. The Cabinet could brief our MEPs on matters of vital national interest. Whereas in this case you do not have MEPs being briefed by Government; on the other side they may not get such an adequate briefing especially when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The need to review our existing arrangements <Col N="764" /> in filling the casual vacancies arose because of the reservations expressed by the Credentials Committee.  This problem has been particularly complex since a method had to be devised which would be compatible with our unique electoral system and at the same time it would be seen to be fully in keeping with the requirement that representatives to the Assembly should be elected by direct universal suffrage.  I have already explained that both the by-election and the cooption systems were deemed unsuitable as a means of filling casual vacancies.  We have had to look elsewhere for a solution. The system which we have come up with represents a reasonable solution in the circumstances which we are placed in. The system is scrupulously fair; it preserves proportional representation of the parties as established by the democratic vote of the people at the election.  It is the simplest system to operate and it allows for a reasonable degree of flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of points raised. Senator O'Leary raised the question of replacement candidates particularly of the non-party candidate being at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the party who choose to run one candidate only.  The system originally devised was where a party might have run two; all they could have imposed upon them were two more; the party with the Independents who ran one could have imposed three, so there was an advantage.  This was raised in the other House by a number of people and the Government looked at it and felt some change should be made.  We believe what is there now would not infringe on the constitutional rights of the Independent; we are satisfied it is fair.  Obviously any matter like this is arguable; one has to look at the overall situation.  I am satisfied, and the Government are satisfied that the system we have now devised, where they can nominate three and the party can nominate five is a reasonable approach to the situation.  I do not see any real problem arising out of that.  If some people deem it is unconstitutional there is a recourse.  I honestly think it is not.  We can look at it between now and <Col N="765" /> Committee Stage but I believe it is a reasonably fair situation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary also raised the question of the verification of the ballot paper counts.  I want to stress that the arrangements set out in the Bill are being provided on the advice of the returning officers. I have been assured by them that it would not be convenient if the verification were carried out at county or county borough level rather than at the Euro constituency; in other words, it is better in the way it is being done.  The Senator's main point was that the ballot papers would be turned up: they will and agents of the respective candidates will be there; the agents can, if they look come up with some estimate of what is happening but it will be only an estimate; it will not be an official count.  The official count will not take place until Sunday and will not be declared despite what the pundits might write or what the agents might say that their man is home because they did a tally.</P>
    <P>I want to clear that situation up.  That is the way it is going to operate, as it always operated.  One can say at 1 o'clock in the day on polling day throughout the country there is a reasonable feedback coming in as to what is happening throughout the country.  But no counts have been declared and the tallymen are sending up information to party headquarters and the results are often forecast at early stages like that, without any counts being declared.  This I suppose is an extension except it is by way of days. It has been traditional here that the tally system has operated.  I would be an advocate of it.  People would want to know how their particular area did; somebody may remark how badly one may be doing but the final count will show how good or bad one does at the end of the day.  The system that is there, on the best advice we have, is not infringing on the spirit of the European Assembly elections, and is quite in order.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery raised the question of standardisation and why we could not have the same system as the North and thus have a unified system on the island of Ireland.  They operate the by-election system and they have a by-election.  That <Col N="766" /> is the end of the story with them.  We looked at that position and we felt it was not desirable and we are not adopting it or accepting it.  We believe the system we have is a better system.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned that on the same day as the European election there will be a referendum and asked when the Bill will be available.  The appropriate Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas very shortly, and will give Members of both Houses time to deliberate on it.  He also raised the question of cost and I presume he is talking about the extra cost of the referendum.  It is very hard to give the precise cost of that but one can talk about an additional £500,000.  It would cost around £1 million for the single election so we are talking about an additional £½ million for the referendum also.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary &mdash; and other Senators &mdash; mentioned the dual mandate and particularly the problems that might arise in not being able to serve the two Houses, and he thought we should have included some provision in this Bill.  We could not include it in this Bill because under Article 5 of the European Act of 27 September 1976, there is no conflict: it is compatible to be a member of the European Assembly and a member of a sovereign parliament.  If we enshrined something in an Act here we would probably be in conflict because the European Act specifically states that they can serve both parliaments.  We can argue the point whether it is a good idea or a bad idea but we could not incorporate it because it would not be in conformity with the spirit of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The question of postal voting was raised by Senator Lynch.  We are pursuing this and we hope to have some draft legislation proposals for the Joint Committee on Legislation to examine.  This is something that all parties are interested in and if presented to the Joint Committee on Legislation it can be examined fully to see if there are any problems, pitfalls, or whatever.  There is no general disagreement but there have been doubts about the whole situation.  I want to assure the House that there is no question of stalling on it or a lack of concern for those who cannot vote, like the disabled. <Col N="767" /> There is no question of that.  It is easy to use the disabled in that way to make a point but we have to look at it in the broadest sense if we are introducing any change.  There will be an opportunity for the Joint Committee on Legislation to examine it fully and hopefully to come up with good, workmanlike proposals that will meet the genuine aspirations of the people who have raised these points.  The question of voting on Sunday was also raised.  That always comes up.  We did consult particularly with the Churches, and a few of them indicated that they would rather not have polling on a Sunday. We have a tradition of always having votes on a Wednesday or Thursday and occasionally on a Tuesday.  There was that apprehension by some of the Churches.  Obviously, it is not something that is closed, we all know that these matters can be looked at at any time so we should not worry unduly about it.  It will as time goes on be a matter that will come up again but at this time, after having consultation we feel we were right to respect the views of people. There is not much point in consulting and being sorry for doing so when we get the wrong decision and then go ahead and do what we want to do &mdash; that is not good enough.</P>

      <P>The decision we have taken was the right decision for the moment.  It is something that can be looked at again.  I believe that the Bill provides a satisfactory and suitable method of filling the casual vacancies because it was causing trouble and it was causing remarks across the House for whatever reason and the European people were not happy with it.  I think what we have come up with now will be satisfactory and will meet with the criteria and hopefully it will be what we all desire. It is a good idea.  Obviously, it is only when it is worked on the ground that you will see the effect of it but I am satisfied that it will be a success.  I would like to thank all the Senators for their contributions. <Col N="768" /> They have been very helpful and it is good to get the opportunity to discuss this legislation.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to exclude agricultural leases from certain provisions in the Statue Book which might be regarded as inhibiting the development of leasing as part of our land tenure system. At the same time, the opportunity is being taken to include a group of provisions of a technical nature aimed at tidying up some existing, largely domestic, Land Commission operations and functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme of reform of landlord-tenant relations in Ireland saw the tenant advance from the position of occupation at the whim of the landlord to himself becoming the owner of the land. The process began around 1860 with a series of statutes which granted progressively more rights to the tenant until the balance of advantage lay with him over the landlord.  It is arguable that this development, and the consequent loss of any real control over their estates by landlords, convinced the latter class that ultimate transfer of ownership was inevitable and that their interest lay in securing the best possible terms for the transfer rather <Col N="771" /> than in resistance.  Subsequent to the achievement of tenant-purchase, it became the accepted view that the landlord system should not be allowed to be revived.  The measures benefiting the tenant in an actual landlord-tenant relationship up to now have remained on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The achievement of ownership of his land by the tenant had at least one not too acceptable result.  Possession of land, <i>per se,</i> tended to be regarded as an end in itself and more important questions of user and management tended to be overlooked. The instinctive and basic motivation of landholders was the determination to retain control of the holding and, ideally, to enlarge it.  Because the legislation was so much orientated towards the tenant, the adoption of leases even of a short or medium term nature came to be seen by landholders as a threat to their secure ownership of the land. Having seen the process of dispossession by the former landlords, the native landowner was not disposed to lay himself open in his turn to the same fate.</P>
    <P>I believe that much has been done over the past year or so to change this attitude and to get the concept of land leasing promoted and accepted among the farming community as a way of making better use of our land.  I have had numerous discussions on this theme with farming organisations, with the co-operative movement and with other national and local organisations.  The response has been very encouraging.  All are in favour of leasing and many have shown their willingness to work at developing it.</P>
    <P>There is now a growing awareness that our owner-occupier system of land tenure is rather rigid and inflexible and that it seriously retards the pace of structural change.  Landowners persist in holding on to land long after they are able to work it fully.  It is quite evident that this attitude which attaches unwarranted status to the mere possession of land contributes, to a very substantial degree, to the rigidity of our land structure.  If agriculture is to make its optimum contribution to the economy, then it is the use to which land is put that is of importance. <Col N="772" /> The rigidity in the system must be replaced by mobility.  Since coming into office, I have given particular attention to this problem.  I want to ensure that more and more of our unused land is put into production by being channelled into the management of those willing and able to work it to its full potential.  One of the most promising ways of doing this is, in my view, through the encouragement of leasing.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the fact that the old landlord and tenant laws leaned in favour of the tenant has been one factor which inhibited the development of land leasing on any scale here.  If we are to get leasing established as a normal farm management practice we must allay any fears potential lessors may still have about leasing their land.  Some have fears about the way their land will be used if they lease it.  Some, quite genuinely, are afraid that they would bring themselves to the unfavourable attention of the Land Commission. Others worry that the provisions in earlier legislation could affect their rights, if they lease.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the man who leases his land for a term of years is not only assured of a guaranteed income but is also far less likely to run the risk of having his land exploited than he would if he let it on the 11-month system.  The temporary nature of the latter system ensures that neither owner nor tenant is likely to invest in improvements.  As for any intervention by the Land Commission, I have several times already given an assurance, and I will reiterate it here, that the Land Commission will not seek to acquire any lands which are the subject of a bona fide lease, nor will they accept any claims for tenancies in respect of leases made in recent times or from now on.</P>
    <P>As for those provisions in earlier legislation, it is obviously right that a prospective lessor should have the assurance that, when the lease has expired, he will be able to resume possession without fuss or legal complications.  Any apprehension about claims under law for tenancy interests, compensation, and so on, would present a serious, if not decisive, deterrent for a lessor.  Because of this I considered it proper that those statutory <Col N="773" /> provisions in the old legislation which seem to favour the tenant unduly during the course, or on expiry, of a lease should be identified and revoked.  This course was recommended in the report of the inter-departmental committee on land structure reform and accepted in the 1980 White Paper on Land Policy.</P>
    <P>The effect of the present Bill, therefore, will be to give equal status to both lessor and lessee and to enable them to come together and agree between themselves on the terms of the lease without any overriding statutory provisions.  I might add, in passing, that two model leases are widely available.  One was drawn up jointly by the Irish Farmers Association and Allied Irish Banks working in co-operation with the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.  The other model was drawn up by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society. These documents are, of course, models only.  The precise provisions to be included in any individual lease, will, as I have said, be a matter for the parties concerned in each case.</P>
    <P>The task of identifying the main inhibiting provisions has now been carried out. The enactments concerned are set out in section 3 (1) of the Bill which is before the House.  The intention is that these enactments will not apply to a lease of agricultural land made after the Bill has passed into law.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the sections of the old Acts which are covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 70 and 71 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860, provide for reinstatement of a tenant if he pays all arrears and costs within six months of the execution of a decree for possession and applies to the court for reinstatement.  It is felt that a lessee who is in breach of the terms of his lease and against whom a decree for possession has been executed should have no further claims on the leasehold and that the lessor should be entitled to resume undisputed possession of his land.  Subsequent minor amendments of these provisions contained in section 13 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, sections 7 (3) and 30 (2) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887 <Col N="774" /> and section 16 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, are also provided for.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 7 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, provide for the payment of a compensation for disturbance by a lessor.  There is legal advice that ejectment of a tenant on expiry of a lease could be regarded by a court as disturbance.  As indicated already, one of the main aims of the Bill is to ensure that it will be the terms of the lease itself which will govern the relationship between the lessor and lessee.  If the lessor is forced to take ejectment proceedings in order to regain possession of his property on expiry of a lease, then he should not be put at risk of having to pay compensation to the lessee.</P>
    <P>Section 4, Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, provides for a claim by a lessee, on quitting the lease, for compensation for improvements carried out by him on the leasehold.  Such improvements might have been carried out against the wishes of the lessor, or be of no value to him.  Again it seems much more appropriate that the arrangements for improvements, as agreed between the parties, including compensation, if any, should be determined by the lease agreement itself.</P>
    <P>Section 1, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, gives the lessee the right to sell his interest in the leasehold.  Here, also, I feel that the parties themselves should prescribe the terms of the lease, including any provisions regarding sale, subdivision or subletting by the lessee as they may agree.</P>
    <P>Section 4, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, provides that a lessee from whom a lessor demands an increase in rent is entitled to compensation, to be fixed by the court, in respect of the fall in sale value of the tenancy in consequence of the increased rent.  It is probable that this provision was primarily in respect of tenancies based on the simplest documentary, or even verbal, agreements.  Modern leases would normally make provision for adjustments of the rent during the term of the agreement, so that the questions of the lessor demanding an arbitrary increase would not arise.</P>
    <P>Section 13, Land Law (Ireland) Act, <Col N="775" /> 1881, permits a lessee to sell his interest within six months of the execution of a decree for possession for non-payment of rent.  The intention here is to ensure that the lessor is entitled to regain undisputed possession of his property on termination of the lease for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Section 22, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, renders void an agreement by a tenant to contract out of any rights conferred on him by statute provided the holding concerned has a PLV not exceeding £150.  Because of the Supreme Court decision declaring the PLV system to be unconstitutional, it is possible that this provision is no longer operative.  However, it is included here in order to put the matter beyond doubt.  The intention is that, as already indicated, the terms of a lease will be those agreed between the parties and will not be subject to overriding statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>Before turning from this landlord-tenant legislation I would like to spell out again that what is being proposed in the Bill represents a complete turn around in the basic philosophy of landlord-tenant relations as it has been conventionally accepted here for over a century.  The clear intention is that, as far as possible, lessees will hold land from the owners on the terms explicitly laid down in the lease contract itself rather than on those stipulated by those old statutes.  The original legislation was introduced to protect a particularly weak section of society &mdash; the tenants-at-will &mdash; who had no security in their livelihoods, or, indeed, in their very homes.  The State intervened to support them against exploitation by the dominant class of the day.  The support and protection are no longer necessary in the context of modern day leasing.  What is envisaged now is an agreement between equal partners, freely entered into for their mutual advantage.  As I have already said, the 1980 White Paper indicated that legislation would be brought forward to repeal any existing statutory provisions which might be interpreted as inhibiting the development of leasing as a form of land tenure.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the removal of these inhibiting provisions will not, of <Col N="776" /> itself, succeed in getting leasing established as a normal farm management practice, but it will help clear some of the worries farmers have in regard to leasing their land.  It will now be open to those looking for land to lease and those willing to make land available to come together freely to make their agreement on the conditions which should attach to each letting.</P>
    <P>However, the major task still facing us is to get people to see that the letting of their land for a term of years is a very simple and profitable option for those who are unable, because of age or other reasons, to work it.  There is, of course, an amount of such land available &mdash; the amount has been estimated at just one million acres.  However, almost all of this is let under the 11-month conacre system. We must try to convince those who are letting their land on this seasonal basis that it would be in their own best interest, as well as in the national interest, to adopt a fixed longer term arrangement.  As I said earlier, a term lease should eliminate the risk that is inherent in the 11-months system that the lands will be exploited and rundown.  When the owner gets his land back at the end of the fixed term, it is now likely to go back in good condition. Nor should he fear losing out at a time of rising rents, because any normal lease will provide for periodic reviews of the rent payable.  The lessee, on the other hand, will have a guarantee of possession for a stated number of years, and he can plan his enterprise in a rational and constructive way without the uncertainty of renewal from year to year.  Leasing will both make it easier for newcomers to get into farming and enable the small farmer to enlarge his holding, without the necessity for capital investment in purchase.</P>
    <P>As leasing is a novel concept in Ireland, it will take a great amount of promotion to get the idea accepted.  I have directed the Land Commission to take a positive role in so promoting it.  Area officers of the commission have been assigned specifically to the task of promoting and encouraging leasing in their areas.  They will foster discussion and interest and will co-operate with farming organisations, co-operatives and other national and <Col N="777" /> local bodies who are anxious to bring potential lessors and lessees together.</P>
    <P>I would like here to refer to the very valuable work being done by co-operatives to promote leasing.  They have had, and continue to have, a unique role to play in this area.  Co-operatives are an ideal vehicle for promoting discussion and interest in the subject and for putting potential lessors and lessees in touch with one another.  I would like to express my appreciation for the contribution they are making and to say that the Land Commission are eager to work with them towards attaining wider acceptance of leasing.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about leasing, I would like to mention that the Social Welfare Act, 1984, contains a provision for new rules for the assessment of means for social assistance in cases where land is leased.  At present, income from leasing of any kind of property is based, broadly speaking, on the capital value of the property while income from 11-month lettings is taken to be the actual rent received.  Under the new rules rent received on foot of bona fide leases of agricultural land will be treated in the same way as rent from 11-month lettings for the purpose of assessing income under the Social Welfare Acts.  This has removed what I consider to be a serious obstacle to the adoption of leasing. Before I leave the subject I would like to say that I am at present considering other measures under which leasing would be encouraged.  Of course the budgetary constraints under which we work at present will limit the options to be explored.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with sections 4 to 14 of the Bill.  As I said earlier, the opportunity is being taken to streamline some Land Commission procedures and to facilitate revesting and the exchange of land.  For example, up to now, the Land Commission have had the power, in exchanges, to accept registered land only.  It would facilitate the distribution of lands on hands and, generally facilitate schemes for rearrangement, if the commission's power to exchange was extended to include unregistered land <Col N="778" /> where the exchangee has a right to vacant possession.</P>
    <P>Another proposal is to provide for the dissolution of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, the extinguishing of charges on land payable to that fund and the validation of the ending of payments to the fund as from 28 September 1975.  The history of this fund, very briefly, is that under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, the temporal property of the Established Church, including its revenues, passed to the State.  The Act also set up the Church Temporalities Fund into which the former revenue of the Church was paid.  In 1881 the administration of the fund devolved on the Land Commission.  Over the years the process of compulsory redemption of charges on lands which were the subject of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts brought about a huge reduction in the income accruing to the fund and the collection of rents became uneconomic.  By 1975, the rental income was reduced to about £1,000 and collection of the remaining rents was ceased.  The section also provides that the assets, now standing at about £2.8 million in Government investments, and any future sums that accrue, will be paid into, or disposed of for the benefit of, the Exchequer, as the Minister for Finance may decide.  Section 14 and the Schedule to the Bill provide for repeal of various enactments.  These repeals are required in connection with the dissolution of the fund.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to provide that the term &ldquo;prior mortgage&rdquo; mentioned in section 80 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, does not include charges on land to secure payment of a purchase annuity, a land reclamation annuity or any other annual payment to the Land Commission. Under section 80 of that Act, a building society may not give a loan on a property subject to a prior mortgage unless that mortgage is in favour of the society.  The effect of the present proposal will be that the existence of any land purchase annuity or annual sum or land reclamation annuity will not prevent a building society from advancing a mortgage on a property subject to such a payment.  As a major proportion of land <Col N="779" /> is subject to Land Commission annuities the effect of this provision will be to simplify greatly the process of setting up a building society mortgage.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to emphasise that, whilst the encouragement of leasing is an integral part of a comprehensive land reform programme, it is nevertheless only a first step in the formulation of such a programme.  I have in recent months been examining critically a number of aspects of the land problem that seem to me to be of particular importance.  The problem of late inheritance and the need to give smallholders a fair chance to compete for land coming on the market in their locality are matters of fundamental concern.  Some progress is already being made in encouraging group purchase of land, the rearrangement of fragmented holdings and the division of commonages.  It has been estimated that some 80 per cent of all land transfers take place as a result of inheritance and succession.  What is most desirable here is that successors come into possession of land at an age when they are still sufficiently receptive to the up-to-date ideas and practices that will enable them to work it efficiently.  Unfortunately, this is not what is happening.  In far too many cases, farmers delay transferring their lands until they are themselves aged and their successors are no longer young.  Naturally, individual family circumstances will dictate the time and manner of the disposition of property, but we must seek ways which would contribute towards lowering the average age of succession.</P>
    <P>I am having a look also at the possibilities for partnership arrangements or phased transfer of management between owner and heir.  In general terms, I incline to the view that the problem of late succession and inheritance is not one in which legislation is likely to make a major impact.  Nevertheless, the budget decision to extend for one year the stamp duty exemption for transfer of land to young trained farmers is an example of the kind of positive influence that can be exerted by the State in this area.  I have been considering whether there might not be a case for regulating or controlling <Col N="780" /> the sale of land that comes on to the open market.  In the past the suggestion has been made that land purchase should be regulated by the imposition of a surcharge on the purchase price, possibly on a sliding scale, depending on who buys it. The main purpose of such a surcharge would be to enable the smaller farmer to gain access to land.  Related to this would be the encouragement already being given for joint purchase by small groups of farmers where such land comes up for sale.  By coming together to purchase as a group the individual farmers are given purchasing power they would not otherwise possess.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission will give all the help and advice possible in the subdivision of land purchased by groups and in any necessary rearrangement of holdings which might be required following the purchase.  The lending agencies have promised their support for farmers seeking to join together as a group to buy land.  Land Commission staff will also help farmers to sort out the problem of fragmented farms.  This is work in which they have great experience and they are available to put that experience at the disposal of farmers.  The commission will do all the paperwork and arrange for transfer of ownership of the final holding to each of the occupiers.  The restructuring of holdings can, of course, greatly add to the value of the land and lead to increased efficiency and output.</P>
    <P>I am anxious also to see more progress being made in the division of commonages. Obviously not all commonages are suitable for division.  However, there are areas of potentially productive commonages where division would be a very worth while proposition.  Here, again, help is available from the Land Commission staff.  I have referred very briefly to these matters so that the House would see the Bill that is before it in the wider context.</P>
    <P>Apart from what I have touched upon, there may be other aspects of the land situation which should be considered and I would welcome the views of the Members of this House on these.  Land policy has been virtually unchanged for a long time.  It is clear to me and is, I think, now <Col N="781" /> generally accepted that the aim of future policy must be to create the conditions which will stimulate the optimum level of structural change, thereby ensuring that land is in the hands of those best able and willing to work it to its maximum potential. Leasing will have a very important part to play in this area in the future and I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House as an important measure designed primarily to encourage the wider acceptance of leasing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is more notable for its omissions than for what it contains.  As far as I can see it merely repeals many of the old Land Acts which have been on the Statute Book for the past century and clears the way for land leasing.  While I welcome any effort being made to enable it to make our land more productive and get that land into the hands of progressive young farmers, I am disappointed that this Bill does not go far enough to reform the whole system of land structure and transfer in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State in the past 12 months has been given a great deal of publicity for his efforts in this area.  Our expectations have been built up, but unfortunately what has been produced at the end of the day has been most disappointing. It has been, in fact, a damp squib.  If the Government were serious about tackling the land problems, they would have come forward with a more positive Bill for land reform and would have backed it up with the necessary finance to put their legislative proposals into effect.  Instead, what we get is a very minor Bill which is merely tinkering with our land structure problems.  In Ireland, the major land reforms have already taken place and our concern now must be with improving farm structure and land usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments through various Land Acts have attempted to reform.  The Land Act of 1870 aimed at providing compensation for disturbance of tenure and improvements.  The Act, of course, was too restrictive in scope and achieved little.  It did, however, contain some provisions for State-aided land purchase <Col N="782" /> and marked the beginning of a series of Land Acts by which Irish tenant farmers achieved their rights.</P>
    <P>The Gladstone Act of 1881 established the Land Commission and gave force of law to what were popularly called the three Fs &mdash; fixity of tenure, fair rent and freedom of sale.  In a few years, most tenants had fair rents fixed for their holdings and, in addition, the Act empowered the Land Commission to make advances to tenants for the purchase of their holdings and enabled it to purchase land for resale to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1891 set up the Congested Districts Board which were given the task of relieving congestion in the western counties.  At that time all holdings under the rateable valuation of £10 were regarded as uneconomic.  Of course, for historical reasons those type holdings were very numerous in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1909 marked a significant change in land reform by conferring power on the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board to acquire land compulsorily for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1933 amended the constitution of the Land Commission by providing for the setting up of an appeals tribunal consisting of a judicial commissioner and two lay commissioners to adjudicate, mainly on price appeals.  The Act also defined the powers and functions of the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission and extended the Land Commission's powers to acquire land for the relief of congestion.  It also gave major concessions to the farming community through the reduction of all purchase annuities by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Land Bond Act, 1934 provided that the purchase money for all land acquired by the Land Commission should be advanced in land bonds.  Indeed, this Act has helped the Land Commission down through the years to acquire many of the acres of land which they have acquired and have helped the Government to pay for that land, rather than having to raise loans.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1950 had a provision enabling the Land Commission to pay <Col N="783" /> cash for land offered for sale on the open market, but this facility was limited to the purchase of land required for migrants and for rearrangement of fragmented holdings.  The Act also provided for payment by the Land Commission of market value for lands acquired by them &mdash; a formula by which a price was fixed that should be fair to both owner and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1965 strengthens the acquisition powers of the Land Commission, particularly in regard to land which was non-residential and/or offered for sale.  It included a comprehensive provision for control of sub-division, letting and sub-letting of the land.  It also provides a pension scheme to induce elderly, incapacitated or blind persons, especially those with no obvious family successors, to retire from farming and offer their lands to the Land Commission for structural reforms.  This was a novel idea at the time but, of course, the scheme did not enjoy the success which was envisaged. Another important section in this Act was section 45, which initiated a system of direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of land by non-nationals.  The section stipulates that subject to certain exceptions non-nationals may not require any interest in rural land, save with the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>By a series of Land Acts dating from 1870, the landlord/tenant system which had obtained since the seventeenth century was eliminated and replaced by a system of owner occupancy.  In all, 414,000 tenants became full owners of their lands, totalling some 14 million acres.  The emphasis now must be on structural reform.</P>
    <P>Agricultural land is the country's major natural resource.  Indeed, Ireland is unique among its European partners as regards the extent to which its economy is dependent on agriculture and because of the extent of this dependence it is vital that the agricultural industry should be in a position to make the maximum contribution possible to the country's economic growth and to the generation of additional employment.  As long as a considerable <Col N="784" /> proportion of the country's land resources remains under-utilised and unproductive, the agricultural industry cannot make its proper contribution to the development of the economy.  There is justification therefore for initiating new policies towards ensuring that all land is, as far as possible, productively and efficiently used in future.</P>
    <P>That is why I am so disappointed with the Bill before us &mdash; it does not go far enough to reform the present system. There is, in fact, nothing in the Bill about rearrangement grants, and this could do so much to relieve the fragmentation of holdings, especially in the west where the problem is most acute.  There is nothing in the Bill about our bogs.  The Land Commission put tenants on those bogs many years ago.  Many of the bogs are now being cut out and I would pose the question: should the Land Commission not have the right, now when the bog is cut away, to get those tenants out and arrange for the cutaway bog to be reclaimed?  Neither is there anything in the Bill about sub-divisions.  I understand that at the moment approximately 8,000 applications are being made annually to the Land Commission for sub-division and that about one-third of those are turned down.  What is the reason for this? Are we slowly trying to undo the work the Land Commission have been doing over the years, by again creating uneconomic holdings?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned commonages, and this again is an area that could be expanded and developed far faster than at the present time.  Money was made available under the western package for the division of those commonages and there are many commonages in the west, as Minister Connaughton knows.  I have seen some of those commonages fenced off and fertilised very successfully, and that is the only way in which they can be brought into productive use.  I would like to see far more development in this area because the Land Commission have the expertise, the staff and all they require is the money to do the work.  I would hope that the Minister, in particular, would try to spearhead this drive to have the commonages, <Col N="785" /> particularly in the west of Ireland, fenced and fertilised.  There are many areas where co-operation is forthcoming from the local farmers.  In particular, in those areas where co-operation is forthcoming every effort should be made to utilise the expertise that we have in the Land Commission to advise those farmers, to plan out the divisions for them, and to help them in every way to get those commonages divided.  If they are being used as commonages, they are not productive, they are not being used to their full potential. I would ask the Minister to try to pay more attention to this area.</P>
    <P>I am sure too, that if the Minister and the Government had wished to tackle those aspects of our land policy he would have found a wealth of knowledge in his own Department.  Indeed, he could also have studied the Fianna Fáil White Paper on Land Policy published in 1980.  That White Paper, in which I had an input as the Minister responsible at the time of preparation, set out quite clearly how the Fianna Fáil Government proposed to tackle our land problem.  We proposed to monitor the sale of land, to give incentives to farmers who needed additional land and had not the necessary resources to buy it, and also to penalise speculators and others by fiscal means where their farms were above a certain acreage.  That was a very important decision and was something that I hoped the Minister would have included in the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>Much consideration was given to that White Paper.  A great deal of consultation took place at the time between Department officials and other interested bodies. The proposals outlined were not arrived at lightly &mdash; they were given very serious consideration.  I am disappointed that some of those proposals are not incorporated in this Bill.  There are, of course, many long-term advantages in the leasing system now being proposed by the Minister.  The tenants, first of all, have security of tenure and can embark on a farm development programme.  It gives an opportunity to younger farmers to commence farming in their own right, and that is something that they find very <Col N="786" /> hard to achieve at the present time.</P>
    <P>There are disadvantages also, at which we have to look and to which we must give serious consideration.  Older farmers may view the surrender of their holdings for 12 years or longer as being tantamount to parting with them for life, especially if the contract provides for the right of renewal.  This problem can be overcome by a major promotional effort to sell the idea of long-term leasing to interested farmers.  I am glad the Minister specified this in his speech this evening and that he will use the Land Commission and the co-ops to promote this leasing, because it is only by efforts of that kind that you can really sell the idea.</P>
    <P>The great majority of holdings here are transferred independently of the market, through lifetime successions or inheritance after death.  Unfortunately, very many of these family farm transactions do not take place until the owner of the land is at an advanced age and the successor no longer young.  This has adverse consequences both for farm development and rural demographic vitality.  However, I feel sure that if proper incentives were provided for the retiring farmer he would be prepared to consider handing over his farm at an earlier age.  It is very hard to expect him to do that if proper financial arrangements have not been made.  He is handing over his only means of support, his total assets, to his successor. Of course, there is also the psychological barrier to be overcome.  The fact that the transfer is a total surrender creates these problems for many farmers. Young people now are getting married earlier, and this also creates problems of trying to support two families on the one farm.  Unless the farm is very large, this would be impossible without financial support from the State.</P>
    <P>In general, we agree with the broad principles of this Bill.  Our main objection is that it does not go far enough to provide the structural reform that is now necessary. A new approach to the land problem must be adopted if worth while results are to be achieved within a reasonable period.  The Land Commission have been constrained in recent times, particularly by the lack of financial support.  I pity the <Col N="787" /> people who are working in the Land Commission at the present time because I believe that they are being slowly ground into the floor.  No money is being provided for them to purchase and reallocate land as they did in former years.</P>
    <P>I remember not too many years ago when the Land Commission were acquiring and dividing 30,000 and 35,000 acres per year.  The situation has changed drastically in the meantime.  It is a pity that more money is not provided for those people because land is still going up for sale.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that farmers are still going to the local politicians asking them to press the Land Commission to buy certain farms when they come up for sale.  It has reached the stage now where we know quite well that we have no hope of getting the Land Commission to acquire those lands.  There is still a lot of good work that the Land Commission can do, particularly in the west where the holdings are fragmented or small, and it is a pity that the Land Commission are being starved to death for the want of financial support.</P>
    <P>New measures are required to make more land available to deserving smallholders and young people with expertise in agriculture.  This Bill will go some small distance in achieving this.  However, the Government have lost a golden opportunity in not having more positive proposals for structural reform.  We hope, perhaps on Committee Stage, to put down some amendments to try to strengthen this Bill, and I look forward to the discussion that the Bill before us today will generate in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill here in the House today.  I would like to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, for his initiative in introducing the Bill. It is long overdue, to say the least.  We should look at this Bill in precise perspective. My interpretation of this Land Bill is that it enables a leasing system to come into being, that it formulates a leasing system upon which, up to now, people were deterred from embarking and were <Col N="788" /> afraid from a legal point of view of getting involved in.  Essentially, I believe what this Bill is setting out to do, for which I commend it, is to replace our 11-month system of land letting by a longer period of letting, whether it be five years, seven years, ten years or whatever.  If it does achieve that essential purpose and if it makes longer-term leasing of land more attractive and more acceptable, it will have achieved a great deal.  However, there is a great distance to travel before one will achieve that because matters in relation to land are, indeed, extremely emotive.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the three Fs &mdash; free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent.  A lot of our history has to do with that.  Therefore, one has to be extremely constructive and careful in the proposals put forward to ensure that one brings the people with one in this whole operation. We must bear in mind that two parties are involved.  We have the person who owns the land and the person to whom the land will likely be rented &mdash; the lessor and the lessee.</P>
      <P>We must, by inducement, incentive and a whole lot of other carrots try to sell the idea that the concept of land leasing is a good one and that the people involved will have some benefit from it.  This is extremely essential, because all the legislation in the world will not have the effect that the Minister and we all desire, of greater mobility of land, unless the people themselves go for it.  At the present time, I believe that nobody will disagree that we have thousands of acres, in fact millions, that are not being utilised to their maximum degree.  This is an extremely serious position for a country with very limited acreage of good land. We have a total geographical area of something like 13 million acres.  We have, perhaps, an effective acreage of land that could be used for farming purposes of ten or 11 million acres, so it is a scarce commodity. It is one of our main natural resources.  For that reason, we have no great room to play around with, to misuse or abuse land.  Anything that we can do that will help the greater and better utilisation of land is to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will do that, <Col N="789" /> provided that the persons concerned are going to be attracted towards it.  I would suggest to the Minister that the lessor must be given attractive incentives in the area of taxation, in the area of social welfare.  For example, I would submit that consideration should perhaps be given to the lessor's returns from leasing his land being exempt when social welfare computations and the like are being arrived at.  That is important.  Many of these people that we are talking about who have land that we expect would be put into that pool are on social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>Another important point involves taxation.  The income derived by the owner from leasing this land would be regarded as earned income, rather than unearned income as would be the case in ordinary leasing of land.  I would suggest that there should be a very liberal tax allowance on the leased price for the land.  On the lessee side, I believe also that inducements in the same areas of taxation must be introduced.  I also believe that the stock relief measures which have been brought back to last year's level must be given special relevance and there must be special stock relief measures for persons who are leasing this land.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>On the question of capital allowances, the present restrictions on capital allowances for leasing must and should be abolished.  On a general note &mdash; and it would apply in particular to land leasing because we are trying something that is new, something that people have not embarked upon &mdash; insofar as is possible, interest rates for those leasing land should be at the level of 10 per cent or thereabouts.  In the same context, for agriculture generally interest rates should not be in excess of that figure.  That is the highest figure that agriculture can sustain and give a return to the people engaged in it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to many very important issues here with which one would agree and which need rectification, such as late inheritance.  This seriously affects the better use of our land. All efforts directed towards an earlier inheritance of land are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> I know that the Minister has that very much in mind in introducing a leasing system.  Essentially, what the Minister is trying to do with the Bill and with various other modifications that may be necessary to it, is to make sure that these millions of acres of land, which at the moment are not being used as efficiently or as effectively as they ought, will be brought into a better state of production, give more employment and be used to the best advantage.  This will help in so many ways, in our balance of payments, in the whole unemployment area, in the whole question of providing more raw materials for food processing, etc.  That is the whole scenario and I do not for a moment believe that we can just talk about legislation that is going to enable person A to lease land from person B. There is a lot more involved than that.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that those who are not owners of their land are the exceptions rather than the rule, that practically all who farm own land.  There are, however, some small numbers who only rent land.  Sometimes they rent additional land but, generally speaking, they have land of their own.  A radical departure from that would be something to be welcomed. While ownership of land always has been a very precious thing to our people its ownership and the whole working of land should not necessarily be viewed in the same light.  Very high percentages of those who farm well in Europe do so on land leased for varying terms of say, five, seven, ten, 12 years and so no.  In order to farm land well, to make a living from it does not necessarily mean that one has to own that land.  That is the nub of the problem.  I believe we are moving away from the situation in which the question of ownership becomes an obstacle in that direction.  A lessor must be certain, when leasing his land, that he can and will get back his land after the expiration of the lease and, in turn, the lessee knows that he has that land for that length of time; two important dimensions.</P>
    <P>There should be no possibility or danger that people would fear that a land agency, the Land Commission or whatever, would acquire that land.  That is <Col N="791" /> very important, has got to be stressed and sold loud and clear to people &mdash; that it is a contractual arrangement between two parties and that, on the expiration of that contract, those parties, if they so wish, can renew the contract, or part company, going their separate ways when the lessor can take back his land and the lessee rent land elsewhere or whatever.</P>
    <P>We must not become too confused about the whole question of land mobility. One of the most important criterion of all with regard to land is how it is utilised.  That underlies the whole land situation in Ireland &mdash; land is not utilised fully or to its best advantage.  Ministers and others must critically ascertain how well land is being farmed.  That must be the yardstick for the future as to how land should be held by persons <i>vis-á-vis</i> ownership and so on.  There is no point in large tracts of land going into the hands of people who are going to make less use of it than is being made at present.  So long as there is no congestion involved any land that is being efficiently farmed should be allowed to be retained by its present owner.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of a surcharge on land.  That is an area that must be looked at extremely carefully. One could run into difficulties or interference in the free sale of land.  As well as aspiring land owners &mdash; and we are all hopeful that smallholders will get land &mdash; there is also the person who may be a smallholder and who wants to sell his land.  Therefore that situation must be examined and monitored very carefully and critically as it progresses.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty exemption being extended for another year is to be welcomed. Hopefully this will bring about earlier inheritance than has been the experience of the past.  One would like to think that perhaps the period could be further extended.  However it would be inappropriate at this stage to talk about an extension beyond the period specified. The Government are to be complimented on extending that stamp duty exemption period for one additional year.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of difficulties, anomalies and problems associated with land <Col N="792" /> about which one could talk <i>ad nauseam</i> but they are not related directly to this Bill.  At the same time they have been referred to and I believe must be tackled. The question of commonages and fragmentation of holdings, vital issues, must be tackled in a very sensible way.  I am not so certain that commonages ought to continue to be worked as commonages. I am aware that many commonages will have to remain commonages and be worked on that state.  Regardless of fencing, fertilising or any sort of improvement measures, a commonage will still present a lot of difficulties in its operation.  In so far as such can be done their division should be borne in mind.  On the fragmentation question I believe that some central land agency ought endeavour to have land replaced by other land, in other words, that people will begin to realise that five acres that they own down the road can be matched by another five acres adjoining their holding or whatever, that kind of thing.  The present fragmentation programme is such that it does not allow any type of progressive farming to be carried on.  It is a piecemeal type of effort leaving farmers with very fragmented holdings.  There are holdings of limited acreage, of 30, 40 or 50 acres fragmented in four, five or six divisions and more in some cases.  Such fragmentation is not conducive to any type of good farming practice.  These are some matters warranting attention.</P>
    <P>The Bill deserves all the support it can be given.  Indeed its concept will require all the help that each and every one of us can give when it becomes law.  Otherwise it will not succeed of its own accord. Merely having a piece of legislation enacted will not make any difference.  We all have a responsibility to promote the concept of land-leasing, to get across to people who own land that, by leasing their land for a certain period, they are not foregoing any divine rights.  We must get across to people the idea that it is good business to lease land for a five, six or seven-year period rather than on the 11-months system.  Land leased on the 11-months system is of benefit to nobody, the person who owns it or the lessee.  I strongly commend the Bill and congratulate <Col N="793" /> the Minister on his initiative in having brought it before the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh an Bhille.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an-díomá ar an Aire nach raibh sé in ann na smaointe a bhí aige a chur i bhfeidhm san Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>There are many limiting factors in the development of Irish agriculture today. One of the greatest limiting factors perhaps is the capacity of our farmers to use the land rather than the capacity of land to increase production.  The restricting factors are land usage and management. Obviously there is a productivity problem in Irish agriculture.  There are deep-rooted reasons relating to land structure: age structure, agricultural education and advice lying at the root of the productivity problem.  Sixty-one per cent of farmers have less than 50 acres of land; 25 per cent are over 65 years of age compared with 6 per cent in the European Economic Community; 35 per cent of agricultural land is owned by persons without direct family heirs; 85 per cent of farmers have primary education only; less than 2 per cent of farmers have been to an agricultural college.  This State contribution to agricultural education amounts to about 2 per cent of the value of agricultural production; 3½ per cent only of land changes hands each year and more than 80 per cent of this change is by way of gift and inheritance.  Therefore, we must ask: what can be done to generate a more vibrant agricultural sector?  There are no overnight solutions.  The problems are long-term and the solutions, when fully implemented, will have a gradual, progressive effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because of the statistics I have outlined and the deep-rooted problems &mdash; perhaps of an historical origin &mdash; that we are so disappointed with the contents of this Bill.  We had expected a more imaginative, progressive and enlightened approach on the part of the Minister of State.  We realise that our people's attachment to land &mdash; its emotional and sensitive nature to which Senator Hourigan referred &mdash; is very deep-rooted. One can go back centuries before <Col N="794" /> we had British occupation here and find scholars writing about the attachment to land here.  It takes a lot of courage and effort over time to break down that excessive attachment to owner-occupied farms which, in itself, has inherent strength but which also, in terms of land mobility, usage and getting the productivity of our farms up to maximum levels, carries inherent disadvantages.  This skeleton Bill, stripped to the marrow, heralded for the past year with propaganda flowing life lava from Hawaii, must be a great disappointment to a very flamboyant Minister of State.  The Minister of State was very mute here today.  Obviously he would have wished very much to have been introducing the kind of Bill about which his colleague, Senator Hourigan spoke in terms of the broader incentives and the perspective, that he, like I, had expected.  Though he did not criticise the Bill in his speech he outlined its fairly major defects.  I am not blaming the Minister of State &mdash; his heart is in the right place &mdash; but he, like others before him, fell at the foot of the mountain, failed to jump over the Beecher's Brook of the Department of Finance and came into the House with this tiny measure.  He is a highly qualified train driver without a train, a new train without railway tracks. That is my impression of this Bill.  However, it will not deter us from having a major debate in this House in so far as that is possible &mdash; with all the leniency we can anticipate from the Chair &mdash; to cover a broad range of areas affecting the historical situation in relation to this matter and then move on to improve on what the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years or so there has been much debate about better utilisation of land, land mobility and agricultural development generally.  In the more prosperous years of the seventies emphasis was placed on the question of trying to interfere in the land market so that those people most in need of land, who had extended their holdings to the limit possible, would have an opportunity of competing on the open market to purchase land.  The very high prices obtaining at that time prohibited them from so doing.  Therefore the debate centred on <Col N="795" /> interference in that way.  However, it was realised that interference in the open market which focuses on a small percentage of land in any given year, would not, of itself, resolve the problem.  Of course, it is significant that, during that time &mdash; from such statistics as are available &mdash; more than half the land purchased went to people who were not full-time farmers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in recent times the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, the farm organisations, Macra na Feirme and a number of other interested groups, have pointed to land-leasing as constituting an area where there is potential as far as land mobility is concerned.  I welcome that occurrence. Indeed for far too long organisations like co-operatives, creameries and many organisations whose board membership includes farmers have been lacking and too little involved in overall management and effort to improve agricultural production. Over those years the commercially viable farm has been growing at a fairly fast rate in terms of what is now required to provide a comparable income.  In the early thirties the Land Commission were talking about 25 acres; later it was 33 acres and, in the sixties, it was 40-45 acres.  We must be sensible and say that it is no longer possible on those size of holdings to provide a viable family income unless the land and management is of an exceptionally high order.  We must take the average, that is that it requires now as many as 70 acres of reasonably good land, well managed, to provide a comparable income.  Farm sizes below that level &mdash; without any statistics being available to us &mdash; would indicate that management and production levels have been on the decrease, in fact, one-quarter of all our farmers are in off-farm employment also.</P>
    <P>The raising of the size of farms to provide family incomes has occurred because of ever rising costs.  Relativity between production costs and gross farm output over the years has been changing upwards all the time.  Twenty years ago the total cost of inputs represented about 40 per cent of total gross farm input.  It could now be as high as 80 per cent, <Col N="796" /> leaving a tighter margin, requiring a farm of greater size and putting immense pressure on the smaller farm unit to survive.</P>
    <P>There is one more interesting statistic in relation to the small farm situation. Most of us believed &mdash; and I think I have heard the Minister of State say &mdash; that the best enterprise for a small farmer to engage in is dairying.  If one examines the position, comparatively speaking, over the past 20 years one finds that in 1966, 77 per cent of milk supplies came from holdings producing less than 5,000 gallons annually, representing 41 per cent of all milk supplied.  By 1982 that 77 per cent had dropped to 32 per cent of suppliers under 5,000 gallons, supplying 6 per cent of the total milk output.  Therefore a move away from dairying in the smaller farms into bigger, more intensive units has been developing and enterprises now engaged in on a large number of these farms are not dairying, and are less intensive and productive.</P>
    <P>In the west &mdash; the Minister's own area &mdash; the agricultural labour force has been halved since 1926.  The number of older, unmarried farmers has doubled, this despite efforts made in Knock and sometimes the small contributions we make in Lisdoonvarna in a particular month of the year.  But let us be serious.  These statistics indicate a kind of paralysis difficult to cure.  There are professors in universities who would suggest that they should be moved away.  But one might well ask: where do they go to?  We have now 220,000 people unemployed.  There are no great off-farm opportunities for such older farmers.  One must bear in mind their attachment to the land, the trauma of moving into towns or urban settings which they find hostile and uncomfortable.  While we should all like to see such land being made available for more productive use the Minister will agree that the provisions of the Bill will not deal with that problem, difficult as it is and being of such proportions, particularly in the west.  Our real task at present is to ensure that the potentially viable farm of today does not become the marginal farm of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on to the question of leasing and endeavour to ascertain the <Col N="797" /> kind of impact it can have and where it will have some effect.  Senator Hourigan referred to the eleven months leasing system. I do not know if we have any accurate notion of how many acres are let under that system &mdash; different figures are given of something between 750,000 acres and 1 million acres, a fairly significant proportion of which is consistently let to the same farmers in consecutive years.  In terms of trying to change the deadlock situation that obtained it is crucial we make every effort to ensure that the initial stages of this programme are successful.  I would be prepared to give the fullest possible assistance by way of any potentially realisable scheme that would get this off the ground because I fear the wrong impression might be given.  That is why I am so disappointed &mdash; a disappointment I share with the Minister &mdash; that there is no incentive given here to the promotion of leasing. Obviously we must examine the social welfare and taxation codes.  I know there are difficulties in achieving the proper mix between what is equitable and what is necessary in a given situation if one wants to uproot long-established practices in order to release this land for agricultural production.  One must be courageous.  Along with removing the legal obstacles of past century legislation and its provisions, one must simultaneously incorporate provisions to give the programme an initial boost.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Exchequer should continue, year in year out, to provide massive incentives to people who, comparatively speaking, may be reasonably well-off.  But to initiate that programme, these provisions must be introduced. Normally they do not come within the ambit of the Minister's Department but they do come within the ambit of the principle of this Bill.  To introduce it in isolation &mdash; without such provisions &mdash; is to tie one's hands behind one's back. Every responsible organisation that I know of, committed to this development, have referred continuously to the necessity for incentives of this kind.  Perhaps the whole social welfare ethos should be examined insofar as it relates to agriculture, insofar as farmers' dole has militated <Col N="798" /> against agricultural development, has suppressed people's capacity to develop their resources, has torn apart in some ways the small farm incentive bonus, the payment for production, the production-oriented mentality and replaced it with a less desirable system. The social welfare provisions should be looked at in a more positive and imaginative way.  I do not want to be misunderstood as saying that I am against payments to people with very poor incomes. On the one hand I want to be understood as being compassionate but, on the other, as realising that agricultural production and development, land mobility and social welfare payments &mdash; as we know them in many areas &mdash; are in conflict.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes and supports the recent initiatives taken in relation to education, in particular the publication of the Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 and the establishment <Col N="799" /> of the Curriculum and Examinations Board</P>
    <P>I extend a warm welcome to the Minister. It gives me great pleasure to propose the motion.  The Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 is the first major initiative in the education field since the sixties.  In the sixties a major revolution in educational terms occurred in Ireland with the introduction of free education to all post-primary school students.  Since then we have had an ongoing process of stop-gap measures without any degree of consultation.  More important there was a continuing lack of scrutiny as to where the education plan for the country was leading us.</P>
    <P>This plan will take education through its most difficult period.  Our history shows that we had to fight for everything we got in the past.  The situation today is also a difficult one.  People who go through the educational process from their formative years right to third level have a continuous fight on their hands.  It is even more difficult in this time of recession and scarce resources.</P>
    <P>The return of planning and stability to the educational sector as well as to the other sectors of Government in this country is welcome.  It is interesting to note that the Minister of State here tonight is probably one of the longest serving Ministers in educational circles.  The instability of Government in recent times and the changing of Ministers from one ministerial job to another resulted in uncertain and discontinued educational policies.  There was no concerted effort or continuing policy at all.  The lack of continuity in recent years, much less planning for the future, is reflected not only in the attitudes of pupils but also in the attitudes of teachers and those who plan and run the scheme at departmental level.  We look forward, therefore, to the next four years of progress.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> decisions of the sixties and seventies, some of them for political expediency, left the educational system in a state of chaos.  Planning was on a day-to-day basis and expenditure was closely monitored.  At the end of the <Col N="800" /> financial year resources were running short.  In more recent times, drastic steps had to be taken.  The fuss created last year and the previous year about announcements by the Department to curtail expenditure within the Department was unfounded and unjustified.  The return from last year's measures has been in the region of £14 million which was distributed this year to very needy sectors within the educational system.</P>
    <P>The action programme can be seen to provide a great challenge to everybody involved in education.  It changes the fundamentals of education and we will see the spin-off of this in the years ahead. The action programme provides a priority list for investment and development in the years ahead.  This is important at a time of scarce resources.  The present demand on these limited resources is aggravated by the very simple fact that the population of students attending schools of one kind or another is probably the highest in Europe.  Many of the industrialised countries in Europe have unlimited resources at their disposal while we have very limited resources and a higher proportion of the population dependent on those resources.</P>
    <P>That challenge can be seen in how the Government are to provide for an expected increase of 20,000 extra new places required for third level institutions over the next few years.  How we can best utilise the buildings which have been left idle for a considerable length of time is something that must be faced up to and requires great co-operation between the people running the institutions and those who require the education.  The question is: can we afford this luxury while in other areas we have sub-standard conditions? The most vulnerable section of our population, the very young, have to be educated in classes of 40 or more.  There would be a wide range of ability within that class.</P>
    <P>Can we justifiably sustain spending £11,000 per annum to educate, for instance, a veterinary surgeon over the six years of undergraduate study and, at the same time, tolerate the situation I have just referred to?  Those undergraduate studies are probably the most expensive <Col N="801" /> in the country.  For this reason, primary education has been made a priority in the action programme.  An extra £2 million has been granted to the existing £350 million provided in the budget for the improvement and upgrading of sub-standard buildings throughout the country. Many of these small schools need repair urgently.  In addition to that, the increase of £4 in the capitation grant is important in that it is the largest increase ever provided in the history of education by any Department.  It is important also in that it lessens the contribution that must be made by the local community, many of whom might be unemployed and with pressing demands on their limited resources.</P>
    <P>Another section which needs special attention has been identified and mentioned on many occasions in the House. Half a million pounds extra has been provided for the disadvantaged within that sector.  Perhaps it is small in overall terms but it is an important beginning and shows that this Government have a commitment to provide for the disadvantaged within the primary sector of education in disadvantaged areas.  All fair minded people will realise from what I have just said that this has been a major response to a very urgent need in difficult times.  In the post primary sector where the greatest change is proposed, the need is most urgent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many proposals that the Minister has in mind for the post primary level, in particular the establishment of the curriculum and examination board. When we think of the massive expenditure of £405 million &mdash; an increase of 10 per cent this year &mdash; on this sector alone and realise that probably 80 per cent of that expenditure is spent on teachers' salaries and pension schemes we can see that the funds which are available for educational purposes are limited and there are very many demands on them. There has been small but significant streamlining within this sector so that money and resources are made available for other purposes, even at local level. There is a proposal in the action programme whereby the capitation grant will be paid in future to all pupils enrolling in <Col N="802" /> schools rather than having the long and tedious method by which it is at present calculated by means of attendances during the various terms throughout the year.  There is a high clerical content involved in that and naturally expense at local managerial level.  These changes are welcome.</P>
    <P>The reform of the curriculum away from the totally unrelated job market requirements as of the present to a more relevant and realistic subject content is very important.  The traditional leaving certificate, while it served its purpose at a different time, is no longer relevant. The position of the second level curriculum is put very well in an article in <i>The Secondary Teacher</i> volume 13 No. 1, 1984 where it is stated that the aims and objectives of the senior cycle at second level education in Ireland are decidedly vague and give very little clear guidance regarding curriculum content.  The system, it states, set up by the Intermediate Education Act of Ireland, 1878 established a system of examination which has been, from that time, a central element and a controlling mechanism in secondary education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>All the pitfalls regarding areas where our education has been strangled over the years are outlined there.  I am delighted that this action programme will release the educational structures away from that stranglehold and allow for new thinking and new requirements within education, and particularly as regards subject content.  In an ERSI Report, 1974 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Teachers devote proportionately more effort than they would like to in pursuing the one objective that is publicly evaluated.</P>
    <P>That is the examination system.</P>
    <P>The data provides fairly conclusive evidence that the examination system operates to divert teachers from the objectives that they consider most important.  Teachers not only feel they have to devote their energies to the wrong goals but they feel also that they attain the goals they consider most important very poorly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> In the past the curriculum was geared towards the expectation of many pupils entering university level.  This has bedevilled our educational system.  There is no doubt but that third level institutions, particularly universities, have had their input and dominated the requirements so that the leaving certificate is now nothing more than a certificate of points for entry into university.  It is for that reason that this board has a very onerous job.  They must take that emphasis on third level institutions away from the leaving certificate and provide students with an overall education for life, for living and for the job opportunities that they might seek.</P>
    <P>At second level there is unwarranted duplication between the vocational education committees, AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  Very important and scarce finance is squandered and there is duplication of courses.  Worse still, those organisations and the second level vocational education committee structure are vying for pupils.  I welcome the Ministers and the Minister of State's commitment to examine thoroughly training schemes available to students at school leaving age.  It is important to rectify the current situation and avoid wastage. Very often, ill-feeling creeps in between the vocational sector, AnCO groups and other training facilities.  The vocational schools have to go without certain facilities which are readily available to other groups like AnCO.  It is only the students who lose out in the contest that seem to be going on between them.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to make the question of education for living a priority insofar as she requested the curriculum and examination board to provide, as a matter of urgency, a health education programme at post-primary school level and also at national school level.  This is commendable in that it is the first time this very broad area has been tackled. The need has never been as great as it is at present because of the very great pressures on students.  Not only is there drug abuse at a very young age but also alcohol <Col N="804" /> abuse.  These two areas are a ruination to society.  People must be educated to combat the pressures they will be exposed to during the course of their lives as young people and as teenagers.</P>
    <P>There has been undue pressure on students with regard to final attainment in examinations.  This very often comes from their own desire to achieve but it also comes from the home, the school and teachers.  In that area there is a tremendous need not only for co-operation between the student and the teacher but also between the parents.  This action programme has allowed ample opportunity for this co-operation to be developed. Very often the teachers and school authorities are unaware of a student's background.  A greater rapport between all three would be welcomed.  I hope it will have an effect on schools in future.</P>
    <P>With regard to third level education, it is important that before the floodgates are opened we have a full review of the needs in the various professions and in requirements and job opportunities. Over the past few years there has been a welcome move away from the traditional third level undergraduate courses to the more technological requirements of society. In the past we had to export graduates who were put through the system at great expense to the taxpayer.  They were lost to the country and economy by emigration. At present we have a shortage of professional people within the health and educational structure.  I am talking particularly about dentists.  It is only recently with the dental school in Cork that we have come somewhere near providing the numbers required.  There must be careful monitoring of the needs in the various professions.  We blame the institutions for having high entry standards and for the lack of standardised examinations.  It is hard to know where to turn to rectify that in the future.  However, it must be tackled because of the high number of students who will be available to enter those institutions.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a more flexible examination system.  The intermediate certificate, group certificate and the leaving certificate served their purpose in the past but today they are a qualification for <Col N="805" /> nothing.  A change-over to a system of assessment throughout the school year where we can monitor the attainments and achievements of individual students, not on a once-off lucky day at an examination but on a continuous basis, would be far more rewarding in the long run.  It is cruel to students to have a system where their future is decided by their performance for a few hours in writing down statistics and data on a particular day.  It would be far more beneficial if there was an on-going monitoring of a pupil's ability, development and progress over a long period from entry to school until leaving.</P>
    <P>I read the action programme at fairly great length and regret there is no reference to what is termed the &ldquo;transitional year&rdquo;.  A former Coalition Minister for Education, Mr. Burke, introduced what was known as a &ldquo;transitional year&rdquo;.  That was a year which was post-intermediate certificate and pre-leaving certificate. Students who were unable to make up their minds as to the road they might go &mdash; whether they would choose the academic road or the more technical road &mdash; got a year's break and were introduced to non-academic subjects.  They had an opportunity to avail of a different scheme of education.  It was very worthwhile because they had an opportunity to take stock and see what road they might take. They were all in their teenage years and it was important that instead of drifting within the educational system, as so often happens, they got time to think about the direction in which they might go.  It was an optional extra in many schools.</P>
    <P>The schools that carried out that pilot project over the years found it very satisfactory in so far as the students who availed of it were more mature when entering the leaving certificate cycle and were determined to concentrate on the road they decided to go, whether it was academic or technical.  There must be some place in the action programme where a transitional year could be provided for students at some level.  There will be great hassle within the board in determining whether that transitional year will be on transfer from the primary <Col N="806" /> school into secondary school or at post intermediate certificate or in the third year before they embark on their final year at secondary level.  Attention must be paid to the transitional year.  All students should be given an opportunity to take part in that type of education within the schools environment so that they can take stock of their achievements and decide what they are most suited to do for the future.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that it is my great pleasure to propose the motion. Indeed, I ask that all concerned in this particular action programme be cooperative. The Minister and the board are available, and I believe that it is important that they make themselves available, for co-operation, consultation and also submissions that may come from various interested bodies.  When one sees the history of the last year in education the whole matter was splintered by people who took the opportunity to castigate the Government's actions because of cutbacks.  None comes to mind more forcibly than a fellow member of my own union who brought out through the auspices of the ASTI a full list of the cutbacks and their effect on education as they saw it.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that unions would allow themselves to be politicised to put forward the views of people who are trying to make progress with particular parties in certain quarters.  Margaret Walsh, a former President of the ASTI, has now declared her allegiance to Fianna Fáil and her hope of gaining a place on a Fianna Fáil ticket in the future.  It is regrettable that the union should be used in such a situation to divert the Government's attention from a line whereby progress is made in education.  The savings of last year, through action taken by the Government, have to date been very carefully and very worthily distributed to the most deprived areas within the primary sector of education.  I hope that the action programme will be debated further as it develops within this House in the future.</P>

      <P>It is my privilege to second the motion and to afford this House the opportunity of discussing the initiatives over the last 12 months in education with particular emphasis on the four year action plan in education published recently by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is clear, as I have stated in the past, that there are great inequalities in our society and that sections of our community are gravely disadvantaged relative to others.  I have always contended that education provided a basis of combating this disadvantage and this inequality.  I do not mean to suggest that we can overcome all our difficulties and all the problems of inequality through the educational process alone.  That would be to ignore reality, because anybody who has been in a school recognises the roles played by housing, by nourishment, and so on.  But notwithstanding that, education has a vital role to play in creating a society that is equalised and which affords all our citizens the opportunity of self-actualisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any improvement in our current situation can only be brought about by clear research and planning whereby the extent of the problems is properly and accurately ascertained and the road to progress is properly mapped out and costed.  One of the difficulties that we in education have experienced in recent years has been the rather <i>ad hoc</i> approach to education.  This was partly brought about by the multiplicity of Ministers for Education which we have had over the last decade.  The publication, therefore, of an action plan for education, a four year programme of action, by the present Minister is indeed to be welcomed. Equally, the clear statement by the Minister, Mrs. Hussey, to this House on 30 November last that &ldquo;a major thrust of policy was positive discrimination in favour of the socially and economically deprived and that ways and means of implementing this policy be identified&rdquo; that, too, is clearly to be welcomed.  That stamp of positive discrimination, with the limited resources available to the areas <Col N="808" /> of disadvantage, is to be seen clearly in the four year programme.</P>
    <P>In the preamble the Minister identifies its governing principles.  Among them she specifically mentions access to an education which is relevant to children's needs and to modern society.  She states that education must also be available to all and should discriminate positively in favour of the disadvantaged.  These principles need to be fleshed out somewhat. We need to spell out what we mean in concrete terms by accessible and available and what we mean in real terms by positive discrimination.  Clearly, there are many children who do not find our current system to be available to them.  I will instance one piece of research.  The Wexford branch of CARE carried out a survey of schools in County Wexford regarding the numbers of children who dropped out of school between the ages of ten and 14½ years for the school years 1981/82 and 1982/83.  This particular age group is of course within the compulsory period of schooling; they are required by law to attend school.  Of the 110 schools surveyed 50 replied, 36 rural and 14 urban.  It was found that there were 51 children under the age of 14½ who left school during these two years.  That is 51 children out of 50 schools that replied, less than half.  The magnitude of the problem is far greater than that.</P>
    <P>The reasons why these children dropped out before they were legally entitled to leave are many and varied. Some simply could not cope or did not find the system of education which we provide for them to be relevant to them and their needs and their environment. A co-ordinated approach to education which does not compartmentalise the various much-needed services is required.  The present system whereby various agencies, both voluntary and statutory, contribute to the overall must be rationalised and examined.  Urgent services, such as speech therapy, psychology, must be made available to every community and we should have access in every town to a child guidance centre.</P>
    <P>I will also re-echo the recent submission of the INTO to the Department of Education which stated that disadvantaged <Col N="809" /> pupils and children are to be found in all parts of the country in both rural and urban areas and that support should be directed to schools serving disadvantaged children rather than schools in disadvantaged areas.  There are many who are of the opinion that there are certain deprived areas within the inner city, particularly in Dublin, where all disadvantage resides, but the fact is &mdash; and any practising teacher will quickly tell you so &mdash; that in practically every school in the country we will find individual children and groups of children who are disadvantaged for various reasons, whether economically or linguistically.  Even in homes that are relatively affluent in terms of finance you can often find neglected children who need special help and care.</P>
    <P>The programme for action sets out the framework for advancement over the next four years.  Under the general heading, the establishment of the curriculum and examination board is to be particularly welcomed and I hope that this board will speedily tackle the question of the subject examination centred second level curriculum and no doubt that will be one of the areas where the Curriculum and Examinations Board will focus their attention in the immediate future.  I also welcome the identification of adult literacy. Many children find themselves completely at sea on transferring from the child-centred programmes which are carried on in the primary sector &mdash; carried on, may I add, almost despite the resources that are made available to them rather than because of them &mdash; they are carried on with the dedicated enthusiasm of teachers who are willing to make the best of the equipment available to them. A fresh look must be taken, as the proposer of the motion said, at the murderous examination system which categorises many of our children as failures before they even set out on the road to life.  There are many ideas being floated on alternatives to the present examination system.  I certainly would re-echo Senator Burke's contention that it is nothing less than cruelty or scandalous to judge somebody's entire school career and to map out his whole future role on the basis of one week's or ten days' <Col N="810" /> performance.</P>
    <P>Some form of continual assessment must be brought in as a priority and the advancement of the idea of community education in the broadest sense.  The inclusion of distance learning and second chance education is also of significance. Indeed the use of the media to reach out to people who have missed the boat educationally is something that has not begun to be fully analysed in this country. Our nearest neighbour, Britain, has begun to do it very effectively, and we should use the medium of our State broadcasting agency to reach out in educational terms not only to the young but to the more senior people who want to further their own education and to occupy their time more constructively.</P>
    <P>At primary level, the focusing-in on those children with learning difficulties in literacy and numeracy is to be welcomed. I said on the last occasion when an educational matter was discussed in this House that the most significant improvement that could be made in the primary sector was a reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio.  I re-echo that tonight.  This is especially so in the area of infant education.  More and more research is showing the value of early education and indeed, even in resource terms, it obviously is far more cost effective to take a child early on and bring him into an educationally sound environment than to try to tackle the result of neglect later in the educational process.  The cost to society as a whole of people who are neglected at an early stage is to be seen daily in terms of vandalism, anti-social behaviour such as glue-sniffing and so on.</P>
    <P>At secondary level the action programme supports the complementary development of secondary, vocational and community comprehensive schools. The curriculum will be reviewed to allow greater flexibility, and that is a most important factor particularly in teaching the disadvantaged.  Work done with family support units in the United Kingdom has shown the tremendous improvement that can be brought about with children who have been almost abandoned by the educational system.  Much can be achieved if a teacher is allowed total flexibility <Col N="811" /> and is allowed to bring the school to the home, is allowed to bring the child along totally at his or her own pace, is allowed to modify the curriculum to make it relevant to the environment in which a particular child lives.  I am afraid even in terms of our textbooks many of the images portrayed are alien to many of the children whom we particularly want to reach.  The authors of those books and in many cases the teachers in the classrooms are the products of socio-economic backgrounds that are not similar to that of the children who are most disadvantaged. I would hope that the whole idea of making our particular textbooks relevant to those children would be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister promises that greater emphasis will be given to pupils who are likely to drop out before they complete compulsory education or who terminate schooling at the end of the compulsory cycle.  That, too, is to be particularly welcomed. Third level education is still predominantly the exclusive club of the well-off, with very poor levels of participation from lower level socio-economic students.  I welcome the suggestion of cost analysis in this sector and the making available of third level facilities in terms of buildings, sport facilities and so on to the community at large.  One of the problems we have in that sector is the view of many that the whole third level education sector is an ivory tower to which they can never aspire and into which they can never enter.  However, I feel the importance and value of research must be underlined and not lost sight of in any analysis.  I would also look with great care at the meaning of the particular phrase in the action plan which states that some courses would have to be phased out.  Any rationalisation obviously might find that some courses were simply not desired by students, but I would hope that in our concern for practical improvement &mdash; and indeed obviously most of the new courses are in the technological area, and the great advance over the last decade or so of the original technical colleges bears testimony to this &mdash; we would not <Col N="812" /> sacrifice the more aesthetic, cultural subjects in our striving for practical results.</P>
    <P>In the area of teacher education I note that although the plan envisages the undertaking of a review of the Bachelor of Education course in the colleges of education, it mentions only vaguely the professional training of post primary teachers.  An expansion in the skill training is required together with the provision of ongoing and carefully structured in-service training for all teachers.  I welcome the identification of teacher centres as a resource within the community for ongoing teacher education and the promise of special provision by way of in-service education for teachers in coping with and identifying weaker pupils.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I say that for the first time we have a definite written programme that can be assessed over the next few years with quantifiable measures by which we can judge our progress and concentrate proposals to stimulate debate?  For that alone the Minister for Education is to be thanked and congratulated. Much more needs to be done, not least in the realisation that education is a vital service which demands investment in real terms in terms of resource if we are to offer a real future to the children of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us refers to the recent initiatives taken in relation to education, in particular, the publication of the action programme and the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  The wording of the motion, however, implies that, apart from these two matters there have been other recent initiatives in relation to education.  These <Col N="813" /> are not specified in the motion but it is implied that they should be supported and welcomed.  If there have been such initiatives I am not aware of them.  It may be that the people who drafted the motion were thinking of the events of last year, such as the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, the cutbacks in career guidance and remedial teaching and the decision to phase out school caretakers and clerical assistants.  In case these are the other initiatives which they had in mind, I want to emphasise that I will be confining my remarks to the action programme and the Curriculum and Examinations Board as I want to be clear about what I am supporting or welcoming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Action Programme for Education.  On 2 November 1983 the <i>Irish Independent</i> published details of a programme for development of the education service which it alleged was based on a confidential memo from the Minister for Education to the Government.  From the time that report appeared everyone with an interest in education was anxiously awaiting the publication of the official document. It finally made its appearance in late January when it was laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I do think anybody was too surprised to find that the report which had appeared almost two months earlier in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was substantially correct.  On reflection, the leaking of the memo in question to the <i>Irish Independent</i> could be described as a recent initiative in relation to education.  If so, it is not an initiative that I would wish to support or welcome.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the publication of the official document.  I also welcome the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  Like many others, I would like to have seen a greater representation of presently serving teachers on this board.  I was hoping that the imbalance would be redressed to some extent at least when the board sub-committees would be established.  I was disappointed to learn that this has not happened. I understand that the teacher organisations are very unhappy with the present position in relation to the sub-committees <Col N="814" /> and that they have made their views known to the Minister and to the board.</P>
    <P>I am sure many of the Members of this House would be interested to hear from the Minister the number of sub-committees that have been established by the board and the specific areas with which each sub-committee is dealing and the number on each sub-committee.  I would be interested to know the total number involved in the sub-committee and how many of these are at present serving teachers.  If the situation is as I understand it to be I would ask the Minister to intervene, even at this stage with a view to having more currently serving teachers involved.  At the end of the day, it will be the teachers who will have to implement any proposals for change brought forward by the board.  Therefore, the goodwill of the teaching profession will be vital for the effective implementation of many of the board's recommendations. That good will is much more likely to be present if the teaching profession is given the opportunity of making an input, commensurate with its role in education, into the board's work.</P>
    <P>When the board is being established on a statutory basis the proposed legislation should specify a minimum percentage representation of practising teachers on both the board itself and on all its various sub-committees.  Guaranteeing an equitable representation of the various teaching sectors is essential and should be provided for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the terms of reference of the board encompass the curriculum at both first and second levels. In view of the problems which arise from the transfer of pupils, from the child-centred curriculum at primary level to the subject and examination-centred curriculum at post-primary level, I hope that the board will see the alignment of primary and junior post-primary curricula as an urgent priority.  Major change and reform are needed in the areas of curriculum and assessment.  I wish the board every success in the task which has been assigned to it.  The future direction of Irish education will depend to a large extent on its deliberations and discussions. <Col N="815" /> I will now return to the programme for action in education.</P>
    <P>This document contains a great many praiseworthy aspirations.  It identifies many of the problems in education and suggests remedies and solutions to these problems.  However, it is somewhat of an exaggeration to title it a programme for action, since it lacks a commitment to the positive action necessary to implement its very praiseworthy proposal.  In paragraph 1.4 of the preamble, we are told that the rate of implementation of the proposals in the programme will be governed by two factors, first, the rate of progress in the economy and secondly, the priority which the Government afford to education within their programme of public expenditure.  We read elsewhere that proposals will be implemented as soon as resources permit or as soon as financial circumstances permit.  There are strings and conditions attached to the implementation of the vast majority of the proposals contained in the document. However, there is a very small number of proposals which we are told will be implemented within the period of the programme. I cannot help wondering if this is significant and if these are the only proposals which have a reasonable chance of being implemented within the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to cover all the ground I would like to cover or to refer to all the sections of the document I would like to refer to.  I will only be able to touch on a few of the many sections I would like to comment on.  Other speakers from this side will be dealing with the chapters that time will prevent me from reaching.  Section 2.3 of chapter 2 recognises the need for special attention for disadvantaged pupils.  It is stated that priority in the use of available resources will be accorded to a programme to assist disadvantaged pupils.  While we are told the purposes for which the funds provided will be used, the section is very vague and the number of teaching posts which will be created is not specified. Neither are we told whether or not the aid will extend to disadvantaged areas other than those in the inner city.  Section <Col N="816" /> 2.4 refers to the implementation of proposals contained in Bord na Gaeilge's action plan for Irish.  There is no reference to whether there will be consultation with the teacher interests in relation to the implementation of these proposals.  In my view, such consultation in this matter is vital.</P>
    <P>Section 2.10 states that the nomination of women to selection boards for principals of primary schools will be encouraged. In this regard, I believe that the document should have backed the agreement between the INTO and the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, that each appointment selection panel must have at least one woman member. In the chapter dealing with primary education, it is acknowledged that the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools compares unfavourably with that obtaining in other developed countries.  This is certainly an understatement of the situation in view of the great many over-sized classes which exist in our national schools.  However, the best that the document can offer is, and I quote, that: &ldquo;The Government remains committed to an improvement in the position as soon as financial circumstances permit&rdquo;.  I cannot accept that there is any commitment to the objective of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio when the intake of student teachers into the colleges of education is being reduced each year and when it is stated quite categorically in paragraph 7.3 of the chapter dealing with teacher training that this policy will be continued.</P>
    <P>As far as second level education is concerned the reference to improving the pupil-teacher ratio is just as vague and just as lacking in commitment.  Section 5.11 of the chapter dealing with post-primary education states that the Government are committed to improving pupil-teacher ratios as financial circumstances permit.  It is clear from this paragraph that there is no commitment to restoring last year's cuts.  We must remember that the full effects of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio have still to be felt in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition in section 3.9 that:</P>
    <P>Without regular systematic maintenance <Col N="817" /> of National Schools the fabric of the stock of buildings will seriously deteriorate, leading to a situation where expensive renovations and renewals will be required.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough however, to say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The question of amending the existing financing arrangements for National Schools with a view to making specific provision for internal and external painting on a regular basis will be examined.</P>
    <P>If there was a definite commitment that the financial arrangements referred to would be extended within the period of the programme, I would welcome that very sincerely.  Such a commitment is not given.  All we are told is that the matter will be examined.</P>
    <P>Similarly we are told that the responsibility for national school building will be transferred from the Board of Works to the Department of Education building unit, but we are not told when this will happen.  The sooner it happens the better, and I hope we will get an indication that it will be sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Section 3.11 in the chapter dealing with primary education refers to the phasing out of the schemes for the appointment of caretakers and clerical assistants.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>When it is possible to consider the re-establishment of these schemes, a higher priority will be attached to caretaker appointments in schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I could not welcome anything less than an absolute commitment to the restoration of these schemes as a matter or urgency and priority.</P>
    <P>The document referred to in section 2.16 concerns educational broadcasting, and it effectively rejects the report which recommended the provision of an educational broadcasting service.  I regret that this is the situation.  The provision of an educational broadcasting service is worthy of a separate debate and I hope we will have the opportunity to debate <Col N="818" /> this very important issue fully in this House at some future date.</P>
    <P>Section 5.8 of the programme refers to guidance posts.  It states:</P>
    <P>In future the allocation of guidance posts will be made on the basis of school needs and taking account of the range of programmes available in the school.</P>
    <P>It is not very clear to me what exactly is meant here.  It would appear that there will be no increase in the number of guidance posts in our schools.  Again, this is very unsatisfactory.  Neither is there any commitment in the programme to any real expansion of in-service education for teachers.</P>
    <P>One other question that I would like to hear answered during this debate concerns the position in connection with the proposed loan scheme for third level pupils. It is referred to in section 6.18.  Has this idea now been abandoned?  It would appear from recent newspaper reports that the idea has been abandoned for the present.  If that is the situation I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the <i>Programme for Action in Education, 1984-1987.</i> I regret that it contains so little in the way of positive commitment to the implementation of the proposals and aspirations contained in it.  The proposals and aspirations are in themselves very laudable and very praiseworthy, but only time will tell whether the document itself is anything more than just another exercise in window-dressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I would like to issue a very sincere welcome to the action plan.  I support the motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes and supports the recent initiatives taken in relation to education, in particular the publication of the Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 and the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document is a very thorough appraisal of what we have.  I do not agree with the atmosphere of pessimism that is so prevalent on the other side of the <Col N="819" /> House, or concur with their view that the document is vague and does not contain a positive commitment for the future development of education.  There are a number of very positive aspects to the plan.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must welcome the fact that there is a definite time span, target or achievement date &mdash; a period of four years.  Within the four-year period a certain amount of what is envisaged in this plan will have to be realised, otherwise we as education administrators &mdash; I am speaking as a teacher &mdash; the Minister and the Department will stand indicted for introducing a plan which did not reach fulfillment.  I am not saying that everything in the plan is realisable or achievable, but there is a great deal of merit in what we have before us.  One of the primary purposes of the whole exercise stated quite clearly in the preamble is that this document, as well as setting out very definite goals and charting the educational path for the next four years, is intended to stimulate and generate debate of the type that we have initiated in this House, that we have heard recently on radio and on television, and that will undoubtedly come from the many strands and various interested parties who have a very positive contribution and input to make to the formulation of our educational system and ideas for years to come.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should go into the theme which is re-echoed on five or six occasions in the document, that many of the desirable objectives which it sets down are dependent on the provision of necessary resources.  It ill behoves the other side of the House to go into the whole issue of the provision of resources, because were we to do so we would end up in an endless whirlpool of trying to establish and apportion blame for the present economic crisis.  Suffice it to say that the Minister said that she will do anything in her power to ensure that the objectives that are set down here are attainable and that the priority ones will be afforded the necessary finance in order to make them a reality.</P>
    <P>The document is realistic and pragmatic. <Col N="820" /> It states quite clearly that quick, easy solutions are not readily available. It also sets out to establish the main goals and objectives of education.  Despite the fact that these have time and time again been reiterated, when we are looking forward and planning it is good to reaffirm what the fundamental purpose, aims and objectives of any educational system must be.  As the document has said, they must be the development of the human being, the person, the child, in the spiritual, moral, intellectual, aesthetic and physical senses.  If we are honest &mdash; politically we must all share responsibility for this &mdash; we must admit that there have been some varying defects in our educational system, with the result that those five areas of development have not always been catered for by our schools and schooling system in the past.</P>
    <P>The education plan also identifies the need to eliminate sexism in education, to eliminate the type-cast role into which females have been set, the need also to eliminate the very clear strictures that prevail and operate in relation to defining certain subjects as being boys' subjects or the male preserve and other subjects as being the preserve of females.  If the education plan achieves the breaking down of these barriers alone, it will be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 mentions curriculum and syllabus development.  I quote from section 2.1:</P>
    <P>Curricula must, therefore, reflect intellectual, social, cultural and economic needs and must provide for the personal development of individual pupils.</P>
    <P>If we are honest, particularly in relation to the post-primary curriculum, we must admit it has not done this.  It is somewhat out-moded; it is archaic; it is too streamlined, too strait-jacketing and, far from stimulating personal development, to an extent, has stifled it.  How can people honestly say that the post-primary syllabus, made up of a stated number of subjects, which is essentially the same since the foundation of the State, can today cope with the challenges of modern, second-half twentieth century living? <Col N="821" /> There will have to be a complete reappraisal of the curriculum a thorough reexamination and a deal of soul-searching as to what is worth retaining and what is worth discarding.  In relation to the whole area of the curriculum and examinations, mention in the motion of the examination board is very worth while.  There is no doubt that the time is long overdue for the introduction of ongoing and regular assessment.  It is ludicrous to establish a person's right to a job, category or role on a 20-hour examination.  After spending one's life from the age of four years to 18 years, the final arbiter as to what one should do or the role or niche that he or she is to file in society is to rest on a 20-hour examination with no cognisance whatever of personal development, character development or achievement in the recreational or social spheres. Assessment is very worth while.  In this regard I would urge the Minister not to allow financial constraints to impose any further delays in this area.</P>
    <P>The section which mentions curricular initiatives is well worth while.  Here we must allow schools, vocational educational committees and educational authorities at local level to decide what is best for their own area.  Education, like any other area, should develop areas of curricula which would be based on the thesis &ldquo;horses for courses&rdquo;.  A number of the educational developments, for example, the pilot scheme in north Mayo, are showing quite clearly that vocational education committees, teachers' groups and parents' groups have a very valuable input to make and have devised quite innovative, imaginative and worthwhile curricula.</P>
    <P>The roles of parents, teachers, teachers' unions and other education groups have been well defined in the document. One section of the document which causes me some worry is section 2.25 which mentions new accommodation and the desirability &mdash; we would concur with this &mdash; of providing permanent buildings. It also states that where permanent buildings are not provided, good temporary accommodation is envisaged.  I urge the Minister to clarify this.  If the intention is to go back to the provision of prefabricated <Col N="822" /> buildings, the Minister would be well advised against this.  Prefabricated buildings are demoralising, look shabby, have a limited life-span and in terms of cost are in the long run far more expensive than they would seem, because they are simply a short-term financial expedient.</P>
    <P>I agree with another sentiment in this section in relation to new accommodation. It states:</P>
    <P>...new schools in urban areas will not be provided where it is evident that sufficient suitable accommodation is available in existing schools within a reasonable distance.</P>
    <P>I would not confine this to urban areas. Every single catchment area should be looked at with a view to appraising precisely what facilities and accommodation exist therein.  We can all quote example after example of where one post-primary school in an area is in the process of closing down or about to close down or the danger signs loom very ominously and on the other hand sanction is given to another school less than half a mile away to go ahead with a grandiose, elaborate building programme.  Furthermore, each and every area must be looked at very thoroughly to see what degree of co-operation can take place.  Education is a very expensive business: there is a great deal of duplication, overlapping and schools within a limited area running parallel and offering parallel courses, where co-operation could achieve a great deal, in addition to the subject range it would offer, to erase the tensions that arise between different categories of post-primary schools, particularly at enrolment time.</P>
    <P>The school transport service is approaching the critical stage that the Minister warned about last year when she introduced some limited charges.  Politically I am saying something that may not carry favour with the electorate, but a number of people would be prepared to pay provided they were asked to pay a small amount.  There is a general air of gloom in relation to the recession, which is not as bad as people make it out to be. People for the first time are being asked <Col N="823" /> to pay for things which previously they enjoyed free, gratis and for nothing.  We have a free education scheme, a free transport scheme, a free health scheme and so on, and one wonders how we have existed for so long without having to impose charges for such services.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the plan is worthwhile in that it writes into the education plan the whole role of the mentally handicapped. However, I do not agree with the section which deals with the mildly mentally handicapped in that it seems to refer to special schools.  There is a very thin borderline between a mildly mentally handicapped child and a slow learner.  Physically there is no difference whatever between a mildly mentally handicapped child and a normal child.  The proper environment in which to educate such children is within the conventional school using special teachers, rather than special schools.  In relation to the moderately and severely handicapped I accept that one must avail of special schools.  Here, we should pay a very sincere tribute to the work done by the staff of such schools on a voluntary basis over the years.</P>
    <P>This is a very worthwhile document, and I welcome it.  The section in relation to second level education should deal fundamentally with what second level education is about and should be achieving. Far too much emphasis is put on using second level education in order to groom people for university, and the majority of people who are non-university and non-third level contenders are being discriminated against by being channelled into the narrow strait-jacket curriculum which is essentially geared to obtain matriculation.  There is much merit and positive thinking in the document. If it did nothing other than stimulate debate, which is part of its stated objectives, it will have been well worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Higgins in my opinion misunderstood Senator Mullooly, who clearly welcomed the publication &mdash; he underlined the word &ldquo;publication&rdquo;&mdash; of this Action Programme for Education 1984-1987 as indeed I do <Col N="824" /> and this side of the House generally would welcome its publication, but that does not mean that we welcome all that it contains.  It is no harm to have a plan for the future.  We should have a programme to give us positive guidelines to tell us where precisely we are going in the field of education.  Plans generally are important and necessary not just in education but in other areas of Government, in social welfare, health, agriculture and so on.  Like so many other areas of government, all of these plans show commitment, concern and that something is being done, but the real, practical commitment must come in the form of financial commitments.  That is where this plan falls down because it is riddled with phrases like &ldquo;review&rdquo;, &ldquo;when finances permit&rdquo; and &ldquo;when resources permit&rdquo;. When a plan is riddled with phrases like those one can expect very little action. When we talk about a plan, we know that it is an action plan.  We know that action means movement, full of life, dynamic. Without proper organised funding a plan cannot be successful, and &ldquo;action plan&rdquo; is a misnomer.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years there has been a great increase in practical development in our education system.  Successive Ministers should be congratulated in that they played magnificent roles in the whole development of the educational system, going back to the late Deputy Donough O'Malley when he started the famous school transport scheme.  This momentum must be allowed to continue.  More than ever in the history of the State we need an educated young people and a proper educational system.  So many young people are, unfortunately, out of jobs, and this is creating problems, particularly at the higher education level, and the demand for higher education is increasing more rapidly than places are available.  We must continue with this programme from the Minister which I hope will set out a basic requirement, a continuation of what we had in the past, that would assist all pupils to fulfil their full potential to the best of their ability and their talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much emphasis in the plan has been placed on the disadvantaged area and the <Col N="825" /> disadvantaged pupil.  Schools can do a good deal for the disadvantaged pupil in the area of poverty and deprivation. When we talk about helping the disadvantaged pupil we are not talking in terms of thousands of pounds and we should not be talking in terms of inner city or city development.  As the INTO pointed out, it is a national problem, and disadvantaged areas and disadvantaged pupils exist in every town and village.  We are not talking in terms of thousands of pounds, we are talking in terms of millions of pounds.  Saying we are doing something about the disadvantaged pupils and not coming up with finance is being unfair.  I find it difficult to understand what the Minister is now saying regarding the disadvantaged pupil when I examine her performance since she became Minister for Education.  For example, the two-honour requirement for the RTC scholarship was taken away overnight.  It was unfair and a scandalous performance, and I do not mind saying so.  It was a direct blow at the disadvantaged pupil.  That was only a few months ago.  Now the Minister is coming up with a plan for the disadvantaged pupils when only a short few months ago she hit them a mighty blow.  The increase in the teacher-pupil ratio is hitting at the disadvantaged pupil as is the drastic curtailment of the number of remedial and guidance teachers.  The Minister has hit many times over the past few months the very people that she claims she is concerned about.  I am not one bit impressed with her new-found interest in the disadvantaged pupil.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  Deputy John Wilson when he was Minister for Education played an important role in this area.  I see as a great challenge for that board in the merging of the traditional education systems and the new technology that will emerge, and I wish them success.  On a local level, in my own town of Athlone we have the examination <Col N="826" /> branch of the Department of Education, and the civil servants therein who number about 130 are concerned at the moment about their future.  They do not know what is happening.  I think the Minister has been evasive, to say the least, about their prospects.  A deputation of those civil servants publicly met Deputy Mary O'Rourke, the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil on education.  They met a Minister, Deputy Cooney, and I think they met the Minister for Education on this matter, but all to no avail.</P>
    <P>They do not know where they are going, and this is not very fair.  I ask the Minister to consider locating the new CEO of the board and his staff in Athlone. That is the least the Minister could do at this stage.</P>
    <P>The higher education grant is very important from the point of view of the county councillor.  It is time that this whole area was re-examined.  The prudent parent who works a few hours overtime in the year and who makes an extra few pounds for his family is being penalised severely.  His income is based on the gross figure, in which overtime and bonuses are included.  On the other hand for the farming community and self-employed there appear to be no strict guidelines.  This area needs a total review and I hope the Minister will examine it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins said that it is no harm to have a general debate on this matter. Debate is cheap.  We are told that this is an action plan.  Unless sufficient funding is given, then we have no more than paper aspirations.  That challenge to education, to pupils, to parents and to teachers generally will fail unless the resources that I have mentioned are forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 April 1984.</P>
