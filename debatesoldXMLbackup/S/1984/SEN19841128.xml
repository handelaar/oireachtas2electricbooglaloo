      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The continuing failure of the Department of Health <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the homeless to issue its report.</P>
      <P>I received notice also from Senator Séamus de Brún of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to proceed with the building of the new vocational school already approved for Castlerea, County Roscommon, to replace the existing school which is totally inadequate and seriously impeding the educational progress of the students in attendance there.</P>
      <P>I received notice also from Senator Alexis FitzGerald of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious public concern arising from primitive lead polluting industries and other emissions from industrial processes and commercial or domestic installations in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard all three matters as suitable for <Col N="250" /> discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ryan's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator de Brún and Senator FitzGerald may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>First, I must apologise to Members that the Order Paper is not in the exact order in which we will be taking business; there was a slight breakdown in communication yesterday between my office and the Seanad Office. If Senators would take their pens in their hands, I will indicate the Order of Business. It is as follows: Nos. 2,4, Nos. 1 and 3 together, Nos. 5 and 6.  I will indicate what this means.</P>
      <P>Item No. 2, which it is proposed to take first, is essentially a formal matter. It is the substantive motion in regard to a Joint Committee on Irish in regard to which the expediency motion was debated here recently.  No. 4 is the receipt back of a Seanad amendment which was sent to the Dáil and further amended and which therefore we will discuss on Report.  Item No. 1 is an order under the Ombudsman Act which we passed recently and the effect of which is to extend the scope of the Ombudsman's activities to local authorities and health boards, but also to An Post agus An Bord Telecom.  It is suggested that No. 3 be taken with this because No. 3 is the extension of the remit of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies to cover An Bord Telecom and An Post so that it means the two debates could, I think, be conveniently taken together. No. 5 is a Private Members' Bill in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan and No. 6 is a Private Members' Motion on the Health Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I might say that the Dáil has this morning passed the Protection of Employees (Employer's Insolvency) Bill, 1984, which guarantees the wages of workers on the occasion of an insolvency in a company.  I propose that <Col N="251" /> we should take that Bill tomorrow morning so that its passage will not be delayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may raise a matter with the minimum of disturbance. Last week when I left Dublin with Senators Rogers and McGonagle we understood &mdash; perhaps not on very good authority &mdash; that our motion, No. 19 on the Order Paper, would be debated this week.  A lot of preparation had gone into it with a view to being constructive and dealing with the whole difficulty with which the country is faced at the moment. However, on reflection Senator McGonagle and I have come to the conclusion &mdash; Senator Rogers has not been here today to confirm this with her &mdash; that there is a phrase in the motion which could be divisive.  We felt that our motion should come before the Seanad with the hope of bringing the Seanad in behind it when it is debated for the purpose for which we intended and with that in mind I would hope that we would re-draft the wording and have the opportunity to put it before the Seanad.  As it is a matter of great importance I would hope that it might be debated next Wednesday. Therefore, I trust that the Leader of the House might consider that very strongly. It is a very important motion in so far as the people whom we live with in Northern Ireland are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support entirely what Senator Robb has said about the motion.  We intend to get rid of any divisive element in the motion and we want the Seanad to be behind the motion in the names of the three Northern Ireland Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding No. 4 on the list, the Criminal Justice Bill, I wish to move that this item be deleted from the Order of Business.  My reason for this is that since this Bill was last discussed in the Seanad the circumstances surrounding it have changed entirely.  We have had all the reports from the cases which have arisen, both in Kerry and in Shercock in Cavan, which would certainly <Col N="252" /> make it necessary for Senators to question yet again many of the powers &mdash; particularly the powers for detention and questioning &mdash; that are being given in the Criminal Justice Bill.  Therefore, I feel that the Seanad should first, have an opportunity for a fuller debate on the Bill and, secondly, that we should wait until the outcome of the various inquiries into these cases, whether they are internal Garda inquiries or ministerial or public inquiries, so that we may see what was the truth behind the various rumours that have gone around before we put the final stamp of approval on the Criminal Justice Bill.  It would be quite wrong of the Seanad to put a final stamp of approval on this Bill while all these question marks are hanging over the situation.  Therefore, I move that this House delete Item No. 4 from today's Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion. I take into account, in addition to the points made by Senator McGuinness, the innuendoes and rumours that are rife at this time concerning the vehicles in the Moyna bugging affair, that these now have been traced back to the Garda depot.  Perhaps the Minister would make a statement on that matter so as to dispel some of the confusion regarding those items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the proposal.  It is very important to consider the circumstances that arose after this measure had been disposed of so far as the Seanad was concerned.  Significant changes took place in the public perception of what was in the Bill.  Let me make it quite clear that support for the amendment is not in any way a vote against the Bill but a vote in favour of putting a stop to further consideration of this measure pending the clearing up of various allegations that have been made concerning the manner in which members of the Garda carried out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea has mentioned one case that concerns him.  Everybody has <Col N="253" /> his own concern but it would be very foolish of this House if we did not take into consideration additional information which came to our knowledge since the Bill was last discussed in this House.  I would like to refer to what has become known as the Kerry babies case, not because of the emotional aspects of the case and not in a condemnatory fashion towards either the members of the Garda Síochána or the other people who were involved in that case.  It brought very clearly before the people what happens in people's minds when they are detained either voluntarily or involuntarily in a Garda station.  To remind the Members of what happened in that case &mdash;&mdash;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Senator O'Leary be not allowed to remind the Members.  It is out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to submit to the Chair and I hope that the House will accept, that all that is proposed on the Order of Business in regard to this matter is item No. 4.  It is concerned with the treatment of a particular amendment and the only matter relevant on the Order of Business is whether or not that matter be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is relevant as to why this should not be taken.  We are here and we are masters of our own destiny.  We decide what we take on the Order of Business.  Surely in considering whether it is appropriate to take the Criminal Justice Bill we are entitled to take account of circumstances which might influence us in that decision and therefore I will ask you to allow me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into a blow by blow description but surely it is in order to say that in the Kerry case not one person but a whole family confessed to something which subsequently they said not only did they not do but they had no connection with at all.  Surely that is relevant as to whether we are going to take this matter back from the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The charges against the young lady have been withdrawn and no charges have been made against any other person in the case.  Therefore it is not <i>sub judice</i>, more is the pity.  Surely there could be nothing more relevant to our consideration of this Bill than to look at what has happened in this case, to realise that a whole family confessed to something which subsequently they said they had no part in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to fight you because I think the vote of this House would be far more eloquent than anything I could say in this regard.  I appeal to the Members of this House.  This is not <Col N="255" /> a matter of confidence in the Government or anything like that.  I appeal to members of all political parties to realise that a change in attitude has taken place and to put this matter right That is all I am asking.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support Senator McGuinness's proposal that the Order of Business be amended, I simply wish to say that Senator O'Leary has made perfectly clear that there is widespread in this country a profound disquiet. This House would not be fulfilling its duties if it allowed the final stage of this legislation to go through unchallenged or indeed not to record in the most effective way at our disposal, which is by declining to discuss this issue, the fact that there is a totally different climate of public opinion on this issue now than there was six weeks or two months ago.  Therefore, I suggest that in the light of what has happened, of the events that are documented and that are unquestioned, there is more to it now than questions of dubious practice.  There is a suggestion at least of very profound public unease.  We would not be meeting our duties as legislators if we did not attempt to reflect in the best possible way that profound unease.  It appears to me the way to do that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But to be orderly how do I explain to the House why I want the Order of Business amended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must say why the amendment should not be discussed today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to the best of my limited ability to explain why to the House.  It is not appropriate for this House in the light of the prevailing climate of public opinion to take this item today or, indeed, until the public have been satisfied about two profoundly disturbing cases and their implications for the operations of the Garda Síochána.  I therefore support Senator McGuinness's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising the question of what might happen in the event of an inquiry, are we not anticipating or prejudging the outcome?  Could we take the other view, that if an investigation went in favour of the Garda we would be bringing in stronger measures?  Is it right to be discussing what might happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the amendment that comes from the other House.  I am just seeking your guidance for the benefit of people who will be deciding whether the matter is to be discussed.  If this amendment is taken and presumed passed by this House, will that in any way affect the various inquiries that may follow?  That is the issue.  It is presumed that by passing the Bill we would be interfering in some way with the carrying out of whatever investigations are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a different concern. This is a very serious amendment. I share the concerns that have been expressed by those who are supporting the amendment but I am not convinced that it is a tactic that the House should consider adopting.  As I understand it, the reasons put forward by Senator McGuinness and others for proposing that we do not deal with this item today are in order to delay our consideration of this item and await further information about the Kerry incident and also the Cavan incident.  The difficulty I have with that is that we may deprive ourselves of the opportunity in this House to address the amendment that is coming back to us.  I <Col N="257" /> am extremely anxious to have an opportunity for full discussion of that amendment in this House.  It was arising out of a Labour amendment that the Minister then brought in on Report Stage in the Seanad the amendment that went to the Dáil and that was there when these incidents arose and that enabled the Dáil to discuss these incidents.  Now that amendment has come back, amended, to this House.  We are in danger, if we accept the tactic proposed by the Senators who wish to adjourn this amendment indefinitely, of depriving ourselves of the opportunity of discussing it, because as I understand the rules it is then open to the Dáil to resolve that the Bill is passed without the Seanad having adopted a position on the amendment because the 90 days for consideration by the Seanad of the Bill have elapsed.  I would accept guidance from the Chair on that but it seems to be the position.  I am not prepared to accept our depriving ourselves of the opportunity to discuss the amendment.</P>
      <P>If there is an opportunity for the movers of this motion to reply I should like them to tell us how open-ended the amendment would be because it is very difficult to know if we did adjourn our consideration of this amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill when the matter could come back before us under the decision taken by the House because it is not at all clear what the outcome would be, for example, if there were to be a publication of the Garda inquiry and if steps were to be taken for a further inquiry.  How much wiser might we be at that stage in relation to the amendment in question?  If I have correctly assessed that the motivation behind the proposal is to delay for a period the Seanad considering this matter I would be gravely concerned that we might be depriving ourselves of the opportunity to debate this amendment.  That would be a great pity because there are Members of this House who have important contributions to make.  We should insist that we make them in this House.  That should be clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to be surprised by the manner in which Members of the Seanad fail to use the procedures of the Seanad with appropriate effectiveness. Senator Robinson has pointed this out clearly in regard to this matter.  Let me remind Senators of what the position is.  The Criminal Justice Bill was read in this House a Second Time.  The Criminal Justice Bill has been debated in Committee and on Report Stage in this House. The only issue that remains in regard to this Bill is the question of the manner in which a Seanad amendment adopted by this House has been further amended by Dáil Éireann.  The question that is put to us today is that we should not consider that amendment today &mdash; not the Bill, not the principle of the Bill, but the particular form of that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not stop the Bill.  It would only make the Seanad look foolish.  That is my clear view in regard to this.  If any Senators wish to stop the implementation of the Criminal Justice Bill they can put down a motion to that effect.  If a majority of Members of this House pass a motion of that type then the view of the Seanad in regard to the implementation of this Bill, whether before or after the receipt of any report, that opinion will then be formally on record.</P>
      <P>The appropriate thing for Seanad Éireann to do is to take item No. 4 today and dispose of it.  This will finish consideration of the Criminal Justice Bill as brought to this House.  That would not necessarily mean, and I do not think anyone would conclude, that that would mean an end to all discussion of this matter either in the country or in the House.  There are more appropriate ways for that discussion to be carried out.  We are dealing with a very small net point. Accordingly I propose that we adhere to the Order of Business as I have suggested, which includes item No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> In regard to motion No. 19, this is a Private Members' motion and normally would come up in due time in Private Members' time. If I receive an approach from all parties in this House that this motion should be accommodated in Government time I will naturally consider the matter, but I cannot consider that a motion in the names of three individual Members should automatically be considered for being taken in Government time.  I will certainly consider the matter most carefully if there is an approach from all groups in the House to make an exception in this regard.  This is the only manner in which this can be considered.  There is Government business for today and tomorrow.  There is Government business, I think, for two days of sitting next week.  Nevertheless, if there is universal wish for the matter to be discussed it must be given serious consideration.  I propose that we adhere to the Order of Business as originally suggested.</P>

      <P>Four people from this House effectively excludes the Independent Members. I have enough work to do but many Independents have a sufficient commitment to the language that goes beyond any party political point-scoring and would wish to have the broadest possible participation on this committee, not because we want the extra work but because we believe it is important. Nobody is under any illusion that this committee will transform the environment for the Irish language or that it will transform any of our political fortunes, so nobody is involved in scoring political points.  I do not oppose the motion.</P>
      <P>I regret that a committee like this, which should have the broadest possible membership of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, is to have a small membership which excludes a significant grouping.  There are among the Independent Senators a number of people who have shown a considerable commitment over the years to the Irish language.  Senators McGuinness and Rogers are active and regular participants in the use of the language in the media &mdash; an area where there is a great need.  I do not claim to be a particularly prominent supporter of the language but I have a commitment that goes back a long time to advancing its usage.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Brendan Ryan I regret there will be no-one from the Independent group on this committee.  Even if the composition of the committee cannot be changed at this stage I ask the Government to consider when they are setting up a committee on an issue which is as broad as this one and which is part of the aims of the Irish people, that they should try to set up a committee which would include as many groups as possible.  All the smaller groups in the Dáil and Seanad contain people who have a commitment to the Irish language and I would prefer to see them represented on the Joint Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Senators will recall that on Report Stage the House agreed to an amendment which I moved and which proposed that a commencement order would not be made in respect of certain sections of the Bill until a statutory Garda complaints procedure would be in operation and until new regulations on the <Col N="269" /> treatment of persons in custody would have been made.  These relate to detention in Garda custody, withholding information about guns or stolen property and inferences from marks, objects and so on.</P>
      <P>The amendment was on the lines of amendments tabled by Senators Robinson and Michael Higgins, Eoin Ryan and Brian Hillery.  I said at the time I did not see a need to have a legislative provision on the matter having regard to the firm undertakings that had been given by the Government and myself to have a new complaints procedure established and the regulations enforced before the provisions in question would come into operation. However, I moved the amendment in deference to the views of Senators and indeed to some views which had been expressed in the other House that it would be preferable to write those commitments into the Bill.  The action taken by the Seanad to incorporate the undertaking in the Bill was widely welcomed in the other House.  Having agreed on the broad principle of the amendment, the Dáil largely concentrated its attention on an effort to make the amendment somewhat more precise as regards the type of complaints procedure which should be introduced before the Criminal Justice Bill would be put into full effect.</P>
      <P>After quite a lengthy debate, the Dáil agreed to an amendment which I moved to the Seanad amendment and which made it clear that the adjudication of complaints would be by a body other than the Garda Síochána.  I considered that the incorporation of a provision in the Bill on the point might provide some reassurance to those who may have felt that the reference to a complaints procedure in the Seanad amendment may have been too widely expressed in so far as it could envisage the adjudication of complaints under the new procedure by the Garda themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was never any question of complaints being adjudicated on by the Garda Síochána alone as the undertaken given by the Government originally, and which I repeated all along, was to bring in a <Col N="270" /> complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent tribunal.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here previously that the drafting of an amendment of this kind poses problems.  For the amendment to be of value, a fair element of precision in the description of the complaints procedure is needed.  On the other hand, there were dangers in specifying the details of a complaints procedure in a short form of words in the Bill as they might prove subsequently to be in conflict with the type of procedure decided upon by both Houses.  This, of course, could have undesirable consequences.  The amendment I have proposed takes the matter as far as it can reasonably be taken at this stage.</P>
    <P>The next stage is the introduction of the Garda Complaints Bill and the draft regulations for treatment of persons in custody, when the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of determining exactly the kind of procedures to be adopted in those respects.  Whatever provisions are ultimately decided on in regard to the membership of the complaints body they will have to comply with the undertaking of the Government that it must be completely independent in the exercise of its function.  Thanks to the Seanad amendment we have had a useful preliminary debate in the Dáil on the form the complaints procedure should take.  I undertook to bring the views expressed in the Dáil before the Government when the complaints Bill is being finalised.  It goes without saying that the views of the Senators will also be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>The amendment made by the Dáil represents a small but important change in the amendment made by this House. It strengthens the commitment which the Seanad succeeded in having written into the Bill on the additional safeguards which have to apply before the detention provisions and certain other provisions can be brought into operation. Accordingly, I commend it to the House on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is to deal with two points which are inadequate in the amendment which came to <Col N="271" /> us from the Dáil.  The first point is that under the present situation an investigation could not take place into any complaint against a chief superintendent or person of higher rank.  The second point is the question of who carries out the investigation.  As regards the first point, which is probably the less important of the two but nevertheless a point of some importance, the question arises why exclude a chief superintendent or higher rank?  Is there some reason for that? First, one can concede that the officers in the Garda of the rank of chief superintendent and upwards are all very reputable and highly regarded officers and it is most unlikely that any complaints will be made against them or that, if they are that they would be justified.  For that very reason it is unnecessary to have them specifically excluded as is proposed in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Merely mentioning their names raises the whole question of why they should be excluded.  It will cause a certain amount of disquiet among the public.  They will want to know why sergeants, inspectors and superintendents may be investigated while a chief superintendent may not be investigated.  There will be a feeling that there is some secret reason which is not apparent as to why a chief superintendent should be excluded.  It immediately raises a suspicion which is probably quite unjustified but nevertheless will lead to this kind of feeling among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They are not excluded.  The Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner are excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not above the rank of chief superintendent?  I am sorry, I misread it, but the same principle applies.  If a particular rank is excluded from the investigation then the same argument will apply.  People will wonder why they are excluded.  They will be concerned that there is some reason for this which is not apparent and is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another undesirable aspect of this will be that the Garda force will be opposed to the idea that certain ranks may be <Col N="272" /> investigated while others may not.  One problem which I am sure the Minister will have is getting through a complaints commission which will be acceptable to the Garda.  I can well understand why they do not wish to have a commission that will be as powerful as it should be. If they accept it at all they would feel that it should apply to every member of the force.  From that point of view and from the point of view of morale within the force, if it is to be accepted at all, they would feel that it should apply to everybody within the force.  From those points of view, it is undesirable and unfortunate that distinctions should be made between officers in the Garda.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of it is from the point of view of conducting an investigation.  If the investigation leads to some action being taken, or failure to take action by an officer above the rank of chief superintendent, then it seems to me that the investigation will have to come to an end. Even though there may be a fairly good case, if it involves in any way the action of an officer above the rank of chief superintendent, even though the main complaint may not be against an officer of that rank, the fact that he is in any way involved would seem to mean that the investigation cannot take place.  This could lead to a situation where every effort would be made in cases where complaints are about to be made or considered, to involve an officer above the rank of chief superintendent so that the investigation could be stymied.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the public's perception of the complaints commission, from the point of view that this seems to be limiting the action that can be taken, from the point of view of the morale of the Garda and from the point of view of the actual investigation which could be limited or possibly completely undermined by the fact that in some way an officer above the rank of chief superintendent is involved, it is most unfortunate that this limitation should be imposed. It is particularly unfortunate because it should not be necessary.  I am quite sure that it will not arise and consequently it is unnecessary.  If anybody argues the <Col N="273" /> other way, that complaints against Assistant Commissioners will arise regularly, that merely proves the point that they should not be excluded from the complaints commission.</P>
    <P>Another point raised in the amendment proposed from this side of the House is the question of investigation and adjudication.</P>

The ACC &mdash; an agency set up to protect Irish farmers &mdash; reneged on a written commitment given on 11 September 1984 to give £1.27 million in working capital to Clover Meats.  As a result of the non-payment of that £1.27 million, 900 people are in grave danger of losing their jobs.  Cheques were returned from the bank last week.  This business has a turnover of over £100 million.  It will have a disastrous effect on agriculture in the south-east.  Unfortunately, the effects will be felt right throughout the country. In employment terms, there are 900 employees with an average wage of £200 a week.  We are talking about a wage bill of £180,000 a week.  As a result of a decision by the ACC the working capital <Col N="274" /> was not forthcoming.  Other banks had made commitments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of investigation and adjudication, as the section stands at present the independent body would be able to adjudicate on complaints but would not be able to investigate them.  This may sound reasonably satisfactory but, in fact, it could prove to be totally worthless because an adjudication body, if it has no evidence before it, if it has no witnesses before it, if it has no facts before it, quite simply cannot act. If it did attempt to act without adequate evidence before it clearly it would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> and would be subject to appeals and so on.  It is absolutely important that the body which is the complaints commission should have the power to investigate as well as to adjudicate. In most cases the Garda would be asked to investigate but in some cases it might be considered desirable by the complaints commission to make investigations of their own.  This could, in certain circumstances, be absolutely necessary.  It must be quite clear that the Garda who are sent out to investigate complaints, without deliberately failing to do their duty, may be inclined to drag their heels a bit.  They may be inclined to accept explanations that in other circumstances they might not be so quick to accept.  There are 101 ways in which an investigation can be carried out with less than the kind of dedication that is necessary. This is the kind of situation that could happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened recently in the Kerry baby case is possibly an example of that. The Minister knows what happened and I do not, so I may be quite wrong, but the Minister said an investigation was <Col N="276" /> taking place and that if it was not satisfactory he might have to set up a judicial inquiry of some kind.  When he was asked about the investigation he said that nothing really had emerged as a result of it. This appears, on the surface, to be exactly the kind of case I have been speaking about.  There was an investigation by members of the Garda, I think two chief superintendents, of a serious situation and they appear to have been unable to bring any facts before, in this case, the Minister who would act if facts were put before him.  It certainly appears, from the statements which he has made, that sufficient facts were not put before him to enable him to act.  I could be quite wrong.  I do not know exactly what went on but it appears to be the kind of example I have in mind, where an investigation just did not produce evidence and facts and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if you are going to have a situation where the commission will only be allowed to adjudicate, no matter how well selected the commission is, no matter how anxious they are to get to the root of the complaint and no matter how good they are in every way, if there is nothing before them there is nothing they can do.  There is a very real possibility that they will be in a situation in which, quite simply, nothing will be put before them, in some cases possibly because there is very deliberate refusal to co-operate by members of the Garda. That might not happen very often but there would be many other cases where there would not be the kind of dedication to investigating and bringing the facts before the commission which there should be and which would leave the commission in a situation where they could not act.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress too strongly how necessary I think it is that this complaints commission should have the full power to investigate and adjudicate.  If they do not have both then in many cases they will be powerless and they will fail to do what this House and the other House feel very strongly should be done.  For that very reason the whole balance of this Bill will be upset.  It has been said again and again <Col N="277" /> by those who accepted and supported this Bill with very grave reservations, that they did so only on the basis that there would be a genuine, powerful and effective complaints commission.  If this complaints commission does not have the power of investigation it will not be effective, it will not fulfil its functions as envisaged by the two Houses of the Oireachtas and it will lead Members of both Houses and members of the public to feel that the Bill should not have been introduced because the protection provided by this commission will not be available to avoid the kind of complaints and the kind of injustice that might arise from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin my contribution on this amendment to the Seanad amendment by saying that I very much welcome the fact that there was an amendment from the Seanad alive at the time when the recent events gave credence to a number of the concerns that had been expressed both in the other House and at considerable length in this House about aspects of the Criminal Justice Bill.  Many of us spoke at considerable length about our concerns and our worries, particularly in relation to extending the powers of the Garda and authorising them, under section 4 of the Bill, to detain people for periods.  We expressed those concerns in precisely the kind of terms which then became a grim and shocking reality when the events, particularly following the death of a baby in Kerry, became known through the media and people were shocked by what they perceived to be the pressures put on people within the garda station.  We are not in a position in this House to comment in an informed way on those incidents because we still do not have the result of any inquiry on which to base a judgment.  I assume that it was principally for that reason that on the Order of Business today a proposal was made that this House delay consideration of the amendment and of the commitment in that amendment not to bring in the provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill relating to <Col N="278" /> detention and other provisions until there is an appropriate complaints machinery.</P>
      <P>If I felt it was possible for this House to delay the matter and still have a real opportunity to debate it then I think there would be considerable merit in the proposal, but as I explained at the time I think the House would effectively have deprived itself of this debate and of the opportunity which it affords us to seek further clarification and to urge on the Minister the strength of our concern to ensure that at this very late stage in the administration of justice in Ireland we do get the balance right.  It is a balance between the role and indeed the requirement that the Garda Síochána are a respected and important part of the machinery of justice.  It is also extremely important that we face up to the bad incidents there have been and the underlying disquiet that flows from those incidents. The disquiet is all the greater because there has not been a sense of fairness, a sense of proper and independent investigation, and there has not been the kind of fair procedures which our Constitution provides are a right of the citizens of this country.  It is a very good thing and it was a good day's work in this House that we did, when this Bill came before us, secure two amendments, in effect, but in particular this amendment which was then debated in the other House and in itself amended.</P>
      <P>I would like to go back briefly to the history of how the amendment arose in this House, because it still seems that the values which are being argued for have to be argued chip by chip.  It is like pulling hen's teeth.  It is difficult to get the full acknowledgment of what are, in fact, fundamental values if we are going to have the system of administration of justice and if we are going to have a sense of what we mean and what we must mean by justice in the most important area of our law, the law that affects the individual and affects the freedom of the individual, one of the most fundamental rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the debate which took place in the Seanad when the amendment was being proposed.  The <Col N="279" /> first debate on an amendment was on Committee Stage in the Seanad on 25 September, just over two months ago, and there was an amendment, which was the first one considered, in the names of Senator Michael Higgins and myself which provided, in effect, that the relevant sections would not be brought into operation &ldquo;until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established and until the regulations referred to in section 7 of this Act are in force.&rdquo; In moving that amendment I pointed out that the wording had been taken very closely from the Explanatory Memorandum that had been published at the time of the Bill and then, added to that, had been the safeguard of referring to the regulations which would be laid in draft under section 7 and requiring that these too would have to be passed and in operation before the sections would come into effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan, who had a similar amendment down, supported this amendment, as did other Members of the House.  The Minister's initial reaction was a very qualified one.  It was effectively that he did not see the necessity to write a provision of this kind into the legislation.  There was further discussion, and then at column 510 of the Official Report, Volume 105, No. 6, I pressed the Minister on the matter, and I would like to refer to the extracts because I think they are relevant to our discussion today.  I said:</P>
    <P>I feel it necessary to come back on this amendment and, indeed to press the Minister further in regard to it.  It is quite clear from the contributions on both sides of the House, from the two parties that form the Government and also from the Fianna Fáil benches and from the Independents, that there is a shared view that it would add to the safeguards in the Bill to have the particular protections referred to in these amendments incorporated in the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I then went on to say that I wanted a <Col N="280" /> clearer assurance from the Minister that he would be prepared to seriously consider bringing in a Government amendment at the Report Stage and that it was the intention of the movers of that amendment to re-table the amendment and to await seeing whether a Government amendment would be forthcoming. In a response to that the Minister said at column 511:</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Garda when consulted said they have no reluctance in accepting a complaints procedure.  As a matter of fact they have stated it on several occasions.  The particular formulation of the complaints procedure that has been discussed with them in various consultations that have taken place has been accepted in principle.  I hope that the consultations will be finalised very shortly.  I expect to have a draft Bill in the next couple of weeks and that the consultations with the Garda will be finalised.  I do not see any great problem there.  I hope they will be able to accept in principle and in detail also the draft regulations which are being drawn up.  We have not discussed that with them in any detail yet.  I do not foresee any problems there either.</P>
    <P>Then he points out that he is glad there are no aspersions being case on the bona fides of the gardaí and that he would genuinely look, and indeed he did subsequently bring in an amendment at Report Stage.</P>
    <P>We then had at Report Stage in this House the two variations, the two different amendments.  We had re-tabled the amendment in the names of Senator Michael Higgins and myself which again referred to the independent person or tribunal, and the Government amendment at that time significantly did not have that added to it.  It was the amendment which went to the Dail and it provided as follows:</P>
    <P>An order shall not be made under subsection (1) in respect of any of the following sections namely, sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until <Col N="281" /> provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.</P>
    <P>That was a significant difference between the amendment which had received widespread support in this House and which formed the basis of the Minister undertaking to look further at the matter, and yet the Government amendment, which was accepted by this House and the other amendment was withdrawn, did not refer to any role of an independent or a non-Garda body however composed.</P>
    <P>The amendment which the Minister then made in the other House to that amendment is a step further &mdash; we are making progress &mdash; because it does import for the first time into the wording of the amendment a role for a non-Garda source.  In other words, although the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is not used it is necessarily imported into the amendment because, as it stands at the moment, it provides that the relevant sections will not come in until provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is important for us to examine very closely the wording and to tease out the meaning of the words and phrases used in this amendment to the amendment.  I regret that the Standing Orders of this House only allow us to have one bite at the cherry because it necessarily compels those of us who are anxious to have as much clarification as possible to speak at some length and then to invite the Minister and to hope that he will in replying give a very full reply to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>This wording refers to the investigation <Col N="282" /> of complaints in the first component of it and then refers to the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints.  This gave rise in the other House, and I am sure it will also be pursued in this House, to considerable questioning as to what the distinction, if any, is being drawn between investigation and adjudication with regard to what the approach of establishing a complaints machinery might be.  In the course of the debate in the other House on this the Minister provided some clarification but he also added to my confusion.  I would like him to come back on this in his reply. In the debate in the other House on 7 November, Vol. 353, No. 7, at column 1346 he responded to questions from Deputy Barnes, among others, about what he meant by adjudication and he said:</P>
    <P>Adjudication involves specifying the particular breach or breaches of discipline alleged, having a hearing of the evidence and of witnesses, making a decision on whether a breach has occurred and, if so, what disciplinary sanctions should be applied.  I will be bringing before the House a Bill which will set up an independent body to investigate complaints.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that was meant to be &ldquo;adjudicate&rdquo; complaints or was it &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; complaints?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of the clarification we are seeking.  The Minister in that quotation continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if there was a seven-man board, would the House insist that all the members should be non-gardaí or would they accept that it might be appropriate to have one representative of the commissioner on that board?  It is obviously an issue which concerns the House.  I see the board as having a full-time staff which would be headed by a chief executive officer.  It does not matter what he is called but he will <Col N="283" /> be answerable to the board and be responsible for the day-to-day running of procedures.  Investigations should be carried out by Garda officers in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some conflict there and I would welcome it if the Minister could resolve it.  Is the investigation going to be by the independent body to investigate complaints or is the investigation going to be carried out by the Garda officers in the normal course of their duties and in a separate way the adjudication to be by the body which will be separate but may have gardaí represented on it?  The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>Investigations should be carried out by Garda officers in the normal course of events but under the supervision of the board and the board would have the power to prescribe general principles to be observed in the appointment of investigating officers.  The board should also be able to give an investigating officer such directions as appear necessary in relation to any individual investigation.</P>
    <P>The questions that I would like to have clarified further, arising out of that passage and the general discussion on this issue in the other House, is whether the Minister accepts the necessity for public confidence in the independence &mdash; in the sense of a separateness in their accountability at least &mdash; of those who would carry out an investigation into a serious complaint and that it would not be a matter of some members of the Garda investigating other members of the Garda in a way which the public now perceive as not giving rise to a satisfactory standard of objective fairness.  I am not suggesting for a moment, and I do not want the Minister to feel that he must defend the reputation of the Garda, that gardaí are incapable of investigating other gardaí or incapable of being impartial in that investigation.</P>
    <P>We are talking now in a very important political sense.  We are talking about <Col N="284" /> public perception.  We are talking about the reputation of our system of administration of justice and we are talking about probably one of the most important attributes of a democracy.  It would be one of the most serious ways in which our democracy could be undermined if there were to be a serious loss of confidence in the Garda Síochána.  We know of another jurisdiction near to us, on the northern side of the Border, where that is a very serious consideration for that part of the country, where a very substantial proportion of the population lack all confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the police force which they have there.  If that were to happen here it would be a tragedy which would be very hard to quantify.</P>
    <P>In the particular circumstances, because of the degree of public disquiet which has been expressed through the elected representatives in the other House and in this House, we must be extremely concerned to ensure that the complaints machinery which evolves has in the investigatory stage a component of separateness which will reassure the public that there is a sufficient impartiality and a difference in the accountability by those who are investigating to ensure that what they do and the nature of the investigation will be accepted and the result of that investigation will lead to the acceptance that it satisfies these standards.</P>
    <P>I now come to another issue which was raised and that is the position in relation to minor complaints.  I would assume that when the Bill to establish this complaints machinery is before us there will be a simpler system for investigating more minor complaints.  If every complaint had to go through a more elaborate form of investigation and inquiry, this for one thing which would slow down the whole procedure and indeed would itself I believe be a problem.  Again, the Minister referred to this in some detail in the other House.  It would be helpful to have further clarification from him.  He emphasised that minor complaints would be dealt with in this way if there was the consent of the complainant.  That is a very important thing.  If the complainant does <Col N="285" /> not regard the matter as a minor one but regards the matter as a very fundamental and important one then there must be a procedure for taking that into account.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another issue which has arisen.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor pointed out in the other House that there would need to be some form of appeal in the complaints machinery.  I understood the Minister in the other House to have agreed that this would be necessary. Again, perhaps in his reply he would give the House some indication of how that would work because once again the introduction of an appeal from the investigation and the adjudication by whatever complaints body is established would help to restore &mdash; because it needs to be restored &mdash; full public confidence in the administration of justice and in particular in this area of complaints against gardaí.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point which Senator Eoin Ryan also referred to, the exclusion of certain higher offices in the Garda from the scope of the complaints machinery. This is a matter which the Minister dealt with in the other House at column 1350 of the same report.  He said:</P>
    <P>We are talking about a commissioner, a couple of deputy commissioners and six or seven assistant commissioners.  The difficulty is that there will be some Garda involvement in the adjudication process because the Commissioner is the chief disciplinary officer.  He is unlikely to be there himself and the people he will appropriately nominate will be from that half dozen.  I do not see, if you have an involvement like that, how that particular body would be appropriate to investigate that senior rank.</P>
    <P>There is no question of exempting people of any rank from being at the receiving end of the complaint.  I suggest to the House that it is a matter for the Government to investigate complaints against very senior officers in the Garda and that there will be opportunities to debate that when the Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> There are a couple of problems about that.  It may well be, and clearly is the situation, that the Commissioner at the moment is the chief disciplinary officer of the gardaí, but what is envisaged, as I understand it, in the next Bill, the sister Bill of the Criminal Justice Bill, is that the whole system of discipline within the force will come under a different regime &mdash; though not entirely.  There will still be presumably a disciplinary code and disciplinary measures, but in so far as we are concerned with complaints by the public these will now be subject to a different type of scrutiny and a different type of examination, investigation and adjudication.  It does not seem to be satisfactory to exclude certain categories from that.  I do not see any cogent reason for doing so.  In fact it places the officers in question in a somewhat difficult position because in saying that it is for the Government of the day to investigate, we would be saying that if a particular incident arose, somebody would be requested to resign perhaps with their full pension rights, perhaps even with the golden handshake, rather than have an examination of the accountability of that person for their actions and an investigation of the complaint.  Because there was no machinery which included that rank of officer within the Garda Síochána the public would feel that there would be an attempt to defuse the possible embarrassment to all concerned &mdash; which is a phrase we often hear &mdash; and that the person would be encouraged to retire.  That is something which would not promote the confidence and the impartiality and the openness of the system which are the kind of values it must have.  I would like the Minister to provide any other reasons he may have or to develop the reasons I have referred to in the passage that I quoted for excluding the senior officers of the Garda Síochána from the possibility of being accountable through complaints machinery.  It would be desirable that all ranks would be included in an even-handed way.  After all, we are a democracy and we should be democratic in that too, if that is possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> I will come to my final comment on the amendment to the amendment.  As I have already said, it is fortunate that there was a Seanad amendment on which to develop and give expression to the concern and apprehension felt by elected representatives in the other House and this House.  There are very worrying aspects about some other recent incidents, a number of incidents which have not been the subject of any independent inquiry.  These have been listed and referred to in recent media reports.  I do not need to remind the Minister of the kind of cases that come to mind in this category including, obviously, the two most recent incidents in Kerry and in Cavan.  There is public disquiet about these.  It is not sufficient simply to try now to have a clean slate for the future and to try now to say we want to establish and to maintain and reinforce a complaints machinery which strikes the right balance and which will restore confidence in the Garda.</P>
    <P>We must also be prepared to face up to the disquieting evidence which there is &mdash; much of it circumstantial but it is there &mdash; that incidents have taken place which have not been the subject of proper investigation, that people who have been detained in Garda stations have made statements in circumstances which cannot be stood over and that there has been no proper investigation.  I would ask the Minister whether it is his intention to re-examine, or to have properly examined for the first time, a number of the past cases, not very far in the past.  There were cases in recent years where there was not any independent complaints machinery and therefore that machinery could not be resorted to by those affected but where there was a sufficient degree of concern and disquiet and where there was a belief firmly held by responsible people that some of those involved in incidents which fell below a standard which would be regarded as satisfactory still hold, in some cases, quite senior office in the Garda Síochána and have never been made accountable for their actions.</P>
    <P>This is one of the factors which do not <Col N="288" /> promote confidence in or respect for or a sense of loyalty to the Garda Síochána. I would hope that when the Minister comes before this House with a Bill setting up the framework of the complaints machinery he will also have been able to take steps to set in motion an investigation of the kind I have outlined.  The kind of investigation, in fact, could be a report to him by somebody whose independence is accepted and who would have and be able to have access both to sources within the Garda Síochána and to those who were immediately involved in various incidents.  If the Minister were to seek a report of that kind and to take the steps &mdash; we are often very slow to lift up the stone and look at what is underneath &mdash; and face up to these very tough areas where just because a year, 18 months or two years have passed we feel that that is something in the past and we do not have to look into it.</P>
    <P>It is exactly the lack of willingness to face up to these problems which has resulted in the kind of malaise about the credibility of the Garda as a body to investigate itself which in part gave rise to the criticisms of increasing the powers of the Garda.  All this is part of the same kind of problem.  It cannot be fully dealt with by having a clean slate and a better system for the future.  We must also be prepared to look at some of the bad situations including current situations, look at them fully and do it all the more publicly because of the extent of the disquiet. In other words, the Minister is on record as having said at the time of the media coverage of the Kerry babies case that he would be prepared to institute a judicial inquiry if he felt that that was necessary.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is not in control of how quickly a preliminary inquiry can be held, but he must also be aware that there is considerable concern about the passage of time and about the absence of any decisive course of that kind.  I would urge on him the importance of taking a step which ensures that there will be either a fullscale judicial inquiry, a sufficiently independent and public inquiry, of what transpired in Kerry so that we can understand better how such <Col N="289" /> a thing could have happened and that we can ensure that circumstances like that do not arise in the future and do not have to be the subject of whatever better complaints machinery may come before us in the proposed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One does have to be quite careful, but, if I can draw an analogy at the beginning with something that we are going to discuss later on today, and that is the Ombudsman, if we were to pass legislation, or had passed legislation setting up the office of the Ombudsman to investigate not merely the serious questions that this complaints tribunal will be investigating, and if we were to say that the Ombudsman could make inquiries in a general way, but the detailed investigation would be carried out by officers of whichever Government Department the Ombudsman was querying, would it be acceptable?  In other words if we did not give the Ombudsman the staff and the resources and the power to carry out investigations himself, independent of the agency or the staff of the agency he was investigating, we would have probably dismissed the whole idea of the Ombudsman as nothing more than a palliative to public concern which really would not deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>We would not be happy that delays in the Department of Social Welfare would be investigated by officers of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is not that we would say that they were all dishonourable or unjust or corrupt or anything like that; we would just recognise quite clearly how ludicrous it would be that allegations or complaints about a group or a body or a Government agency would in whole or in part be investigated by officers of that body, and therefore we gave the Ombudsman his own staff and his own resources to carry out his own independent investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears therefore that when it comes to the Garda, where both the interests of the community and of the Garda and of the individual making the complaint are probably in many cases of a much more serious and much more fundamental nature, that we find it necessary to demur <Col N="290" /> from a such a degree of independence in the investigative role.  Issues are raised about the quality of the Garda and about the need to be careful about what you may say about the Garda and about the need to preserve public support for the Garda.  On the other hand there is no point in living in cloud-cuckooland, somewhat like the majority of the people north of the Border, talking about the need to preserve public acceptability for a force, if at the same time outside of the confines of Leinster House public acceptability and the credibility of the force is in a rapid and apparently inexorable decline.  For us to say something to the contrary will not make that decline any less likely and will not in any way slow down that decline.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary the number of people, some of them Members of the Oireachtas and many of them constituents of mine, relatively educated people who I would have thought had a reasonably balanced view of the world, who have warned me to be very careful of what I say about the Garda because they believe that if I am critical of the Garda the Garda will &ldquo;get me&rdquo;.  I do not believe it is true.  I have said on many occasions that I do not believe it is true, but there is a widely held public perception that if you criticise the Garda you are putting yourself at risk.  A number of people have said to me that Members of this House who often at great cost and pressure on themselves have criticised the Criminal Justice Bill must have a grudge against the Garda.  That is the other side of the argument.  But the issue nevertheless is that there is a widespread public feeling that if you are critical of the Garda, if you suggest that in some areas it is not appropriate for them to carry out certain functions, they will find ways of getting back at you.  That is the most fundamental, threatening conception of the role and operation of the Garda that could be put out.  It is a perception that is held by members of the Oireachtas as well as by the public.  I know it is a perception that inhibited some Members of the Oireachtas from what they would say or would not say on the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> It needs to be said at this stage that there is a question mark over the capabilities of the Garda in certain areas.  There is a question mark over the ability as things stand to conduct an adequate investigation into circumstances and questions that have arisen.  The case of Amanda McShane is a case in point, in which a concocted statement was discovered by her solicitor before she had said a word and the case was dropped and no prosecution resulted and no disciplinary action resulted.  I know that when issues are raised in this House the Minister is not prepared to comment on individual cases.  It appears to me that it is only when the media raise individual cases the Minister gets really concerned, but when Members of this House endeavour to raise individual cases a different level of procedure arises.  That is not to take anything from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I got mildly reprimanded in a newspaper for apparently saying on the one hand that I disliked the Criminal Justice Bill and on the other hand that I admired the Minister's performance.  It is one of the regrettable facts of the Criminal Justice Bill that it has been handled by a particularly capable Minister.  We might have been a lot more successful in opposing it if we did not have such a capable Minister defending it.  That is one of the regrettable facts of life that we have to cope with.  That does not get away from the fact that at the centre of this small final element of the Criminal Justice Bill rests the core of the profound unease that many of us feel about the Bill, and it crystallises in this question of who investigates complaints that are made against the Garda.  There are a number of issues and, apart from the ones about public perception and the ones about whether a question mark legitimately hangs over whether all the gardaí can actually be entirely trusted to carry out an investigation in the way we would like, there is the question of the complainant, the person who makes the complaint against the Garda.</P>
    <P>Is it not a bit much to suggest that somebody who rightly or wrongly believes <Col N="292" /> he or she has been very badly treated by the Garda and is understandably therefore extremely unhappy in the presence of the Garda and is understandably extremely nervous about Garda, will now be told, &ldquo;In order to have your claim processed you must be questioned by the Garda&rdquo;?  It seems to be pushing the thing a long way to say that somebody who is frightened &mdash; and we have seen recent incidents of the claims that people have been extremely frightened &mdash; should now be asked, in order to satisfy some need that is not apparent to me, some need, apparently, in the Garda force or in the legal process, in order to have their claim processed, to go through again that which was initially the source of their complaint, an interrogation by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to believe that we are going to have any substantial volume of complaints adequately presented and processed if the person who presents the claim knows that one of the consequences of making the claim is further questioning by the Garda.  To suggest that distinctions can be made between certain officers and other officers in the eyes of frightened people is to betray a certain unreality in one's understanding of human nature.</P>
    <P>All that is separate from the other issues that have been mentioned here.  It is not fair any longer to say that the public have an unqualified high opinion of the Garda.  They do not.  There is widespread and considerable public concern about the capability of the Garda to carry out investigations.  There is widespread public concern that in the case of what happened in Shercock the bringing of charges to court took an extraordinarily long period of time by comparison with many other cases.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister is contradicting me: if the evidence is there that it was not extraordinarily long, I stand to be corrected. He has the necessary resources. We will wait and see.  A large number of people in society would share the perception that I have about it.  At the core of this is whether or not, on a Bill which the Minister and everyone accepts has given rise to a most intensive public debate, <Col N="293" /> what the Minister identifies at the beginning as being a very necessary part of the satisfying of public concern should now be devalued by virtue of an insistence that the investigation must and will be carried out by the same force against which the complaints are being made.</P>
    <P>In the area of the operations of the Ombudsman we would never have suggested a procedure like that, and it is recognised that for the Ombudsman to function properly he has to have his own staff to carry out the investigation.  Equally, any tribunal of complaint must either have its own staff or a separate agency must be set up to deal with such complaints.  Otherwise both the credibility of the adjudication, the credibility of the process and also the welfare and the fears of complainants will be severely jeopardised.  I do not believe people will be prepared to subject themselves to another Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>I once had to go into a Garda station to make a complaint about misbehaviour by a member of the Garda and I was in a fairly strong position.  I was not a Member of the Oireachtas at the time and I was not making a complaint on my own behalf, and the palpable atmosphere of hostility that descended upon the Garda station among the 20 or so gardaí who were present once I said out loud and in public that I was there to make a complaint because somebody I knew and trusted had alleged to me that he had been assaulted by a member of the Garda, was positively intimidating. To suggest that people with less armoury to defend themselves and less knowledge of how to protect themselves would be prepared to go through a process where the first immediate consequence would be investigation by the Garda seems to be stretching credibility and stretching the conception of how people see their role in society beyond any reasonable degree.  It seems the problem is that there is a very vigorous resistance in the Garda to an independent investigation of complaints against them and it is therefore necessary to preclude that possibility in whatever discussions the Minister will be having with them.  That is giving the <Col N="294" /> Garda a veto on the format and the nature of the investigations that will be carried out against them.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.  The investigation that was carried out into the complaints made by Nicky Kelly demonstrated how inadequately the Garda investigate complaints against themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory in the Dáil detailed the experience of an individual who had the misfortune to make a complaint against the Garda and weeks later was suddenly charged with assaulting and various other offences against the Garda on the night in which he alleged he was assaulted, and eventually had to go to court.  The case was dismissed and eventually he got damages against the Garda for the complaints he made, but in between he had charges brought against him by the Garda.  If that is the climate in which complaints against the Garda are to be investigated then no amount of independence in the final tribunal will convince anybody that complaints are really being dealt with in an objective way which is protecting the Garda and the complainant.</P>
    <P>On the question of investigation of the senior members of the Garda, the rank of Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners, the Minister rightly said that the Government handle the investigations. If the Government promise to have a judicial inquiry into political interference in the Garda had been kept, it would be much easier to believe that Governments were both willing and able to investigate complaints against senior members of the Garda.  The extraordinary determination not to proceed with the promise of a judicial inquiry into political interference in the Garda will not satisfy me that there will ever be the political will to deal with complaints in a way which will satisfy public opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that getting people to retire early and giving them generous golden handshakes in the process is not the way to satisfy public opinion that everybody is equal in the eyes of Government and in the eyes of the law &mdash; I suppose it would be naive to suspect that everybody was equal in the eyes of <Col N="295" /> Government whatever about in the eyes of the law.  It would be much easier to believe that there was a possibility of investigation at that level if the judicial inquiry promised had been set up.  The alienation problem should be raised again in this House.  Whatever the situation in Northern Ireland is &mdash; some people will have to have &ldquo;alienation&rdquo; branded on their nose before they will recognise it &mdash; we are developing a similar problem down here.  I do not think that all the complaints procedures in the world would prevent that, but I believe that a degree of independence involved in the investigation of complaints against the Garda would be a critical factor in alleviating the suspicions, criticisms and hostilities that are the basis of alienation.  It is regrettable that for reasons not explained by the Minister in this House the commitment to independent investigation is not to be incorporated in this most regrettable legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill came to us from the Dáil, section 1 provided that the Bill would commence on such date as the Minister would by order determine. During the course of the debate in this House on Second Stage and on Committee Stage Members expressed concern about various aspects of this Bill, particularly the controversial sections which are referred to specifically in the amendment before us.  The Minister gave certain undertakings that these sections would not be brought into effect until the regulations under section 7 had been specified and ordered and until a Garda complaints procedure had been established by statute. On Report Stage in this House the Minister went further by introducing an amendment in his own name similar to an amendment introduced by other Members of this House, putting that commitment into statutory form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill went back to the Dáil concern was expressed there that the complaints procedure would not be independent. Concern was expressed that the amendment introduced in this House would not necessarily allow the ultimate <Col N="296" /> emergence of a sufficiently independent complaints procedure.  We now have before us in the document which has been circulated the original amendment introduced and passed by this House and the amendment which was introduced in the Dáil more recently by the Minister and the amendment before us today in the names of Senators Lanigan, B. Ryan and W. Ryan.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to see any great difference between the three amendments in so far as the element and aspect of the independence of the complaints procedure is concerned.  Irrespective of the words used, all three amount to the fact that the tribunal when established will be independent.  It is difficult for this House or for any Legislature to legislate and to tie the hands of the Legislature at a future date.  We are attempting to tie the hands of the Legislature at a future date, and that is leaving aside the fact that there is a commitment and a stay on this legislation. If we accept any one of the amendments, there is a stay to ensure that the controversial provisions will not come into effect until the complaints procedure is established.  It seems to me &mdash; I may be wrong in this and, if so, I would like the Minister to correct me &mdash; that irrespective of which of the amendments we accept we can still legislate, as the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas in their wisdom at a future date will so decide, for the complaints procedure.  Members of this House and of the other House have been very vocal in saying that circumstances have been changing rapidly and that events have been coming to light which are giving rise to increasing public concern. If one refers to these events and in particular to the Matthews case, one finds it inconceivable that they can be used as an argument in relation to the Garda complaints procedure and to the inadequacy of existing procedures.  I can certainly see how the argument of the Shercock case can be used as a reason for the Minister very rapidly introducing regulations under section 7 of the Bill.  I should like to see speedy movement on the introduction of regulations under that section and speedy movement on the <Col N="297" /> introduction of a Bill dealing with the complaints procedure.  But the Shercock case cannot be used as a reason for condemning the inadequacy of existing disciplinary procedures.  The fact that the Shercock case ended up before the Central Criminal Court was due to the efficiency of existing disciplinary procedures.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking about existing disciplinary procedures I would say of them, and I am referring in particular to the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations 1977, having defended a considerable number of gardaí under these regulations both in relation to complaints instigated within the force and complaints instigated by the public, that they are mechanically unsatisfactory.  They are regulations which in their operation are cumbersome and unsatisfactory in every way.  The fact that so many people have to make decisions at various levels before an investigation is undertaken, in the absence of information as to how it is to be undertaken, sworn or otherwise, and in the circumstances in which the actual investigative process is really only a process by which a report is prepared and a decision arrived at with the Commissioner being responsible ultimately for adjudicating on the decision, is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The existing procedure would appear to be inadequate when something such as what has been referred to as the Kerry babies case remains unconcluded business in the eyes of the public.  I would see that as one reason for saying that the existing disciplinary procedure is unsatisfactory. I am concerned about certain aspects of the kind of complaints procedure we will have.  It is to be independent, whatever amendment one accepts, one can accept that but by &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, I presume is meant independent of the Garda Síochána.  I should like to know how the tribunal which the Minister has in mind will be composed.  I share the concern expressed by some Members as to the investigative role and the role of adjudication.  Will the tribunal operate, for instance, as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal operate, <Col N="298" /> whereby individual members of the tribunal service complete files and adjudicate on them or will they have the power, as that tribunal have in certain circumstances, to direct further investigations and searches?  Will they have power to investigate and to cause matters to be investigated in depth to the satisfaction of that tribunal?  Would the Minister indicate, if it is possible to do so at this stage, how the tribunal are to operate?</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised a valid point when she referred to minor complaints. How embracing will the tribunal be?  Will anybody be able to make any kind of complaint and expect that it will be investigated? Are members of the Garda to be subject to any frivolous or minor complaint from a member of the public?  We can speak about the rights of members of the public to be assured that the powers the Criminal Justice Bill confers on the Garda will not be abused in any way, to be assured that the other powers, both statutory and common law powers, that the Garda possess, will not be abused but the Garda must be assured also that they are not to be subject to the rigours of a complaints tribunal on the basis of frivolous complaints.  This is the kind of matter the Minister for the Environment addressed himself to when re-establishing An Bord Pleanála.  The Garda should be protected in so far as frivolous complaints against them are concerned.</P>
    <P>On the question of minor complaints, will the power of a superior member of the Garda be removed?  Under article 7 of the existing Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations, any member whose duty includes the discipline of other members can deal with that member informally.  If there is a complaint to a Garda sergeant that a garda in his station is not acting as he should act and if the Garda sergeant is so satisfied, he can caution or deal with the member informally.  Would the establishment of a complaints commission along the lines suggested remove that power from an individual sergeant or from any garda in a supervisory position?</P>
    <P>The question of a cut-off point at chief superintendent level is something I agree with.  There is an essential difference <Col N="299" /> between the ranks above chief superintendent and the ranks from chief superintendent down.  The ranks below that of chief superintendent are essentially those who are in contact with the public.  They are the ranks who are mobilised throughout the country with powers and functions which bring them into contact with the public.  It is proper that they be subject to the complaints procedure. Members of the Garda at Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner ranks are in a different role.  Successive Governments have shown their ability in dealing with Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners as the need arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>On at least two previous occasions I said I had no difficulty in agreeing in principle with the Bill.  That still is the case.  However, I am quite concerned about its effective implementation in due course.  It is vital that adequate preparation be made for its implementation.  Otherwise if it is not so implemented, the Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the Garda force is of the first importance.  It follows logically that confidence in the complaints procedure and in the regulations are also particularly important.  However, the effective implementation of the Bill will cost a lot of money.  The Minister when replying might indicate what attention has been devoted to the cost involved and also what sort of progress has been made in providing the funds to effectively implement the Bill in due course.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day Garda sergeants will have the responsibility for the implementation of the Bill.  Therefore extra Garda sergeants will have to be appointed, and that will cost money.  In addition extra clerical staff will have to be appointed.  That, too, will cost money. If the Bill is to be properly implemented there will have to be appropriate accommodation. It goes without saying that many Garda stations do not have proper interview rooms or proper cell accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> Another aspect I am concerned about is Garda training for the implementation of the complaints procedure and the regulations in particular.  Additional funds will have to be devoted for in-service training of members in the operation of these new procedures.  If detainees are to have the opportunity to phone their solicitors &mdash; if they are fortunate enough to know solicitors &mdash; extra telephones will be required to ensure that contact is made between detainees and solicitors.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to refer to the point raised by Senator Eoin Ryan and other speakers in relation to the exclusion of the top ten officers or so in the Garda from the scope of the complaints procedure. I remain to be convinced that the Minister's reasoning in the Dáil is adequate.  A balance has to be struck between the reason he has put forward and the almost unnecessary invitation to the public and to other members of the Garda to be suspicious about these exclusions. If there are no substantial grounds, and I suggest that such substantial grounds do not at this point exist, for the exclusion of these top Garda officers, then I ask the question, why not include them?</P>
    <P>My primary point, however, is about planning for the effective implementation of the Bill.  Now is the time to provide the resources to arrange for training, for extra personnel for the facilities that will be essential for effectively implementing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In your wisdom you decided that it would not be appropriate to discuss the Clover Meats issue today. If you had decided to discuss it this kind of discussion would be about as relevant as if we decided to use that time to discuss the petty cash book of Clover Meats rather than the issue itself, because what we are talking about is the petty cash of this legislation and not the actual heart of it.  Senator Durcan is right: it is irrelevant which of these three sections are put into the Bill because they all mean the same thing anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we are spending our time talking about matters that are largely <Col N="301" /> irrelevant.  We have three possibilities before us today.  We have the original amendment in the Seanad which the Minister conceded on, and that was a very valuable concession, but what has gone on since then is only party political jockeying for position.  Fianna Fáil, having abdicated their responsibilities with regard to this Bill time and time again, have been reduced to playing with words to try to give the impression that they in fact opposed in some meaningful way the Criminal Justice Bill.  They have abdicated their responsibility as the Opposition in this House and as the Opposition in the other House.  They confined themselves to putting down meaningless amendments to other meaningless amendments which the Minister has put down to a substantial amendment. That is the reality.  We have the grotesque situation where the other House is delayed by a complete week because of the necessity to improve the self importance of certain spokesmen for the Opposition in that House.</P>
    <P>The three possibilities before us have a central core with which I agree. Amendment No. 1 as made by the Seanad expresses the view that was the majority view in the House.  However, the additional amendments make very little change on that concession by the Minister.  It was appropriate that we would consider a much wider aspect of the Criminal Justice Bill when the matter was being considered by the House.  It does not appear to have caused the Chair any difficulty whatsoever that people referred, for example, to what has become known as the Shercock case.  My colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, with whom I very seldom agree, made a statement to which the Minister, by the shaking of his head demurred, that was, that there had been an unreasonable delay in processing that case.  That is true.  There was not an unreasonable delay in so far as bringing people to trial, once charged, was concerned.  More than 13 months passed before anyone was charged with anything in connection with that incident even though each of the people involved knew who was involved and it was a <Col N="302" /> simple matter to get statements from them.  Thirteen months elapsed before statements were got from the people by the chief superintendent who investigated the case ultimately.  The incident happened in April 1982 and these statements were not got until May 1983.  There was an unreasonable delay.  The reason for that delay is the way in which complaints against the Garda are dealt with. There is no necessity for anybody to tell lies.  The matter is simply delayed until it becomes irrelevant.  That is not only my view.  A person who has held a very high post in Government has told me it is his view that the method of overcoming complaints against the Garda is to delay the investigation until the matter becomes irrelevant.</P>
    <P>That happened in the case of Shercock. It also happened that the necessity of having an independent investigative process was shown in that case because somewhere at some time a decision was taken, on the basis of information supplied to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to separate the potential defendants in that case and to try them separately.  That was the decision which brought about a successive series of acquittals.  Shercock is relevant to why we need an independent investigative procedure and independent adjudication, because it shows how it is possible to play ducks and drakes with the system, how it is possible to divide and conquer.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly earlier another case that is relevant in that regard &mdash; the Kerry babies case.  It baffles me why this case has not been explained to the public after this long period of time.  It should not baffle us, because it is again the use of the tactic of delay, and delay will overcome the necessity for the completion of investigations and will overcome conclusions for investigations unless the investigative process is not carried out by the Garda and not adjudicated by them.  The Minister is aware of the Bunratty case. There are other cases which are important. The Bunratty case, in so far as part of it is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not referring to any portion of a case which is <i>sub judice</i>.  The charge against the individual is <i>sub judice.</i> I do not have to say anything else.  The Minister knows all about the Bunratty case.</P>
      <P>There is very little difference between the proposals which are here today before us.  What difference does it make which one of these three options is accepted by the House?  It makes very little difference to what was discussed.  I was interested in what Senator Robinson said.  It was extremely competent advocacy but it added nothing to our store of knowledge, no more than I am adding to your store of knowledge now.  Presumably Senator Robinson is going to come in and vote for what Senator Dooge has proposed.  It appears to me that there has developed a disease in this House today which I can only describe as sticky backsides &mdash; people unwilling to stand, glued to their seats by some unseen force.  I hope those who suffer from sticky backsides will get the rewards they consider they deserve, whether those rewards be membership of the other House or a position of importance under the Constitution.  They will have earned their reward.  It is no wonder the Minister laughs.  He knows what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the significant points made in the debate here today was made by Senator Eoin Ryan who referred to the necessity for an independent complaints commission.  I have a slight difficulty in referring, in an amendment, to something called an independent complaints commission.  I have a slight difficulty in referring, in an independent complaints commission, which is not, in itself, defined.  That is one of the problems with the Fianna Fáil amendment.  The use of the expression &ldquo;independent complaints commission&rdquo; begs the question of what is an independent complaints commission. I wonder whether an independent complaints commission in this Bill can be defined in the text of another Bill.  I doubt it.  To overcome the problem you would have to do something like this: when you <Col N="304" /> bring in the Bill to deal with the complaints procedure you would have to say &ldquo;for the purpose of section so-and-so of the Criminal Justice Bill, the independent complaints commission referred to therein is the commission established by section 54 of this Bill&rdquo;.  I wonder if that is really sustainable.  There might be a problem there.  Fianna Fáil, in the manner in which they have dealt with this matter, have not come to terms with this problem, in either the Dáil or the Seanad. The use of an expression such as &ldquo;an independent complaints commission&rdquo; in itself creates problems.  It creates problems of linking that to the ultimate legislation which is going to go through.  There is some difficulty in that regard.</P>
    <P>The idea behind what Fianna Fáil are saying is excellent.  They are correct in saying that there should be an independent complaints commission, that it is important to have one.  They are also correct in saying that it should not cease at the rank of chief superintendent.  It is almost inconceivable that one could get a complaint in respect of a rank higher than that of chief superintendent.  If the Garda themselves are going to carry out the investigation and the adjudication it is inconceivable that it could go higher than the chief superintendent.  In the event of there being in practice an independent complaints commission I do not see any great problem regarding a complaint which might arise in respect of a Commissioner or somebody of a lower status being brought before that independent complaints commission.  Fianna Fáil are right in a marginal sort of way.  The complaints we hear against the members of the Garda &mdash; thankfully they are against a tiny minority of the Garda &mdash; do not relate very often to anybody above the rank of chief superintendent or even to the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>That is an important point Fianna Fáil have brought out in their examination of this legislation, but all these matters can be dealt with in the next Bill.  The important thing is the point of principle we are seeking.  I congratulate Senator Robinson and Senator Michael D. Higgins and indeed Fianna Fáil in this House for <Col N="305" /> bringing forward the original amendment at the Committee Stage which gave rise to the ministerial amendment in the Seanad.  That was the important achievement in so far as it relates to this section. The other changes by the Minister and by Fianna Fáil are of little relevance.</P>
    <P>I should like to express to the House my reason for voting the way I intend voting.  It will be &mdash; if nothing else &mdash; consistent.  I hope those of my colleagues who adopted the same attitude towards the Bill as myself will also consider my action to be consistent.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should take this opportunity of sending the Bill back to the Dáil. The reason I want to play ping-pong with the Bill is that I do not like it and I do not want it to be enacted.  The way we should play ping-pong with it is to vote against Senator Dooge's motion and vote also against the Fianna Fáil amendment. We must recognise that circumstances have changed.  We must recognise that the reputation of the Garda Síochána &mdash; probably to an unjustified extent &mdash; has taken a severe hammering, not as a result of anything which took place in this House, but as a result of matters which have been taken place outside of it.  They must realise that there has been a change of attitude in the country, that the Minister no longer commands the widespread support in respect of this legislation which he commanded at one time in the past. There has been a change in the people's attitude.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Members of this House to take that change of attitude into account.  There have been strong indications that even a Minister as brilliant as this Minister cannot beat the Garda when it comes to the question of investigating complaints.  They will beat him.  I said it to him before and I will say it to him again, they will beat him.  There is every indication that even with his determination he will not win, because they will delay and delay until such time as everybody concerned gives up in frustration. Everybody, from sitting on the fence, will develop sticky backsides, the same complaint which was so prevalent in the Seanad today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> For all these reasons it is important that the Seanad should send out a message to the Government and to the people that until such time as the various investigations which are now pending are complete, the additional powers contained in the Criminal Justice Bill will not be enacted.  I am not talking about their being brought into operation.  The only way I can play my part in that is by voting against both the motion and the amendment before us today, and I intend to do that.</P>

      <P>I share Senator O'Leary's concern about the enacting of this Bill while we still have hanging over us the various queries which have arisen as a result of the recent cases which have been so noised abroad in the public press, in particular the Kerry babies case and the Shercock, Cavan, case.  Senator Robinson said earlier in the debate that we are unable to comment in an informed way on the issues that arose out of these cases.  It is precisely because we cannot comment on them in an informed way that myself, Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator O'Leary have been spurred on to make an effort on the Order of Business to prevent the Seanad from putting a final imprimatur on this Bill.  What the Seanad does about it is significant.  I realise the practical difficulties as outlined by Senator Robinson.  I realise the Seanad cannot entirely stop the Bill. Nevertheless, it is significant that the Seanad, if possible, should not put a final imprimatur on it.  However, we have now reached the point of debating these amendments.  I welcome the principle of the amendments which originated in the Seanad and which the Minister accepted. There is no doubt about it but it improved the original Bill immensely.  It was accepted that the various sections should not come into effect until the investigation and complaints procedure was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the people who brought in the amendments in the Seanad, Senator Robinson and Senator Michael Higgins, and the Fianna Fáil Party amendments <Col N="307" /> to the same effect.  I also congratulate the Minister on the fact that he accepted a change in the Bill, which was a major change, and that he was willing to take it back to the Dáil.  We must accept that in so doing he showed that he had an open mind and was able to take on board the criticisms that were made in the Seanad debate on the Bill.  Naturally it is a source of pleasure to me as a Senator that this major change in the Criminal Justice Bill should have arisen out of a debate that took place in this House.</P>
    <P>I support, in principle, the Fianna Fáil amendment to the amendment which would bring in all ranks of the Garda Síochána and also an independent complaints commission.  It is a fairer way of setting it up and of being more open and effective.  I see the point that Senator O'Leary is making about the difficulty of drafting the Bill but, nevertheless, it is important enough a principle to say that we would prefer to have an independent complaints commission.</P>
    <P>I join with other Senators in saying that it is not only a question of adjudication by an independent commission but also investigation by an independent body.  I share the fear that to have any complaints investigated by members of the Garda Síochána themselves and merely the adjudication being done by the independent body would not be effective and above all would not be seen by the public to be effective.  Anyone who has any experience of how trials work or how investigations in court work, will see that one of the most important elements in the adjudication that comes out at the end is not the arguments made but the evidence that is before the adjudicating body.  If we have an adjudicating body whose investigations are carried out not by themselves and therefore who have not much control over the evidence brought before them, the kind of adjudication they can make is very limited.  As in the case of the Ombudsman or indeed in a different way in the case of the Director of Consumer Affairs, they would <Col N="308" /> need staff of their own in order to ensure independence in the investigation of any complaints.  Internal investigations can give rise to enormous frustration, difficulty and delay both for members of the public and for others.  Loss of confidence can result.</P>
    <P>I recall attempting to represent a member of the public at an internal inquiry at a Garda station.  I fought for several hours to have the right to appear at all.  When I did appear, the matter was dealt with by the announcement that the papers summoning the defaulting garda to the inquiry were faulty and, therefore, the matter would have to be adjourned indefinitely until they were served again with papers.  I have nothing to judge by to say whether that was an exceptional case or not.  Once a member of the public and a member of a legal profession arrived it was aborted.</P>
    <P>I have not much confidence in the idea of internal inquiries, however well meant they may be.  Arising out of this, it is important that not only the adjudication but the investigation would need to be independent.  This is very important in regard to the public perception of how this complaints commission should work or whatever complaints body is set up. The public will have no confidence in it unless it is seen to be independent through and through and not merely, as it were, independent icing on the cake which is the same cake that we have had before.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of the senior ranks in the Garda Síochána this is not a point of enormous importance but it is relevant if justice is to be seen to be done even within the ranks of the Garda Síochána themselves.  I know that if I was a sergeant or whatever I would feel somewhat aggrieved at the idea that any of my misdemeanours might be investigated by this complaints commission but those who were, as it were, the bosses were able to avoid this.  I would not foresee this arising frequently.  Perhaps it would not arise at all but from the point of view of natural justice all ranks should be included.  I share the feeling of other Senators that hurrying along people's <Col N="309" /> resignations and giving them golden handshakes as they go out of the door is not at all the same kind of dealing with the matter as would apply to lower ranks in the force.  From the point of view of the morale of the gardaí and officers who are not of such a high rank, it would be fairer to include all within the procedure.</P>
    <P>These are matters of detail, and, in principle, I am extremely pleased that this amendment came from the Seanad, that it went to the Dáil and has been in substance passed by the Dáil.  It makes a considerable difference to the operation of the Criminal Justice Bill as a whole.  I emphasise that in the present atmosphere of doubt and public dismay at what has been revealed so far, or what has been rumoured or alleged because we have no proof one way or the other, but while this is hanging about our ears we should not proceed to enact this Bill into law or to give our voice to the enactment of it into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe any useful purpose will be served or anything worthwhile achieved by further delaying the passage of this legislation.  The debate has centred on doubts as to the effectiveness or otherwise of the independent complaints procedure which will operate and which the Minister has told us is his intention to bring in.  No one can say with any measure of certainty how effective or otherwise any complaints procedure will be until it is in operation.  It is only when it is being availed of that any shortcomings will emerge.  The Minister has emphasised &mdash; despite that doubts have continued to be expressed &mdash; that the complaints procedure which he intends to bring into being will be independent, that its investigative powers will be independent of the Garda and its adjudication will be independent.  Having heard that, I am satisfied that the complaints procedure that he envisages will be in line with the assurances he has given both in this House and in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing in connection with this matter, and I can assure you I am not extending the scope of the debate, <Col N="310" /> that concerns me in relation to the discussion on this legislation.  At times some of my colleagues had a tendency to move away from the point of ensuring that there was no imbalance at the end of the day.  It is vital to ensure balance in this legislation just as it is necessary to have balance in the type of complaints procedure that will exist.  Therefore, I would measure that by saying that an independent complaints procedure in establishing the full truth in relation to any complaint is all that is required.</P>
    <P>If we go further than that and say it is necessary to overstretch ourselves we run the risk of going far beyond what is required and would bring about a situation where we would simply encourage witch hunt after witch hunt.  We then acknowledge that we are undermining the effectiveness of the role of the police force. We are damaging the system and we are achieving nothing more than we can achieve with a system of complaints procedure, investigation and so on, that is adequate in establishing the truth of the complaints that are made.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge that there is public disquiet.  My knowledge of a case that has been mentioned here by previous speakers, the case of the Kerry babies, is nothing more than what I have heard or seen in the media or read in the papers. What disturbs me, is that the attempt at finding the truth or arriving at conclusions in the investigation of that case has been frustrated by lack of co-operation.  That is the message that has come across and it is one that I deplore and totally reject. In so far as that attitude prevails public disquiet will grow.  It is necessary that the Minister will, with all resolution, reassure the public again and again that attempts by any members of the force to frustrate an inquiry such as that in the case of the Kerry babies will be handled by him by the most effective means available to him.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that anything unacceptable is widespread within the Garda.  I believe that the vast majority of the members of that force are men and women of honour and distinction who have brought credit to the force.  Having regard to the <Col N="311" /> case in Kerry there is a belief within the force that there are those who should not be there, who are bringing discredit to it and who have to be dealt with and removed from it before it is damaged further.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by reiterating the two points I made.  What we require is an adequate procedure and I believe that in the motion before us this evening that will come about.  I would press upon the Minister the necessity of ensuring that events such as those in the case of the Kerry babies are now at an end and if there are people within the force who by their actions are damaging it they should be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment which protects the public is a very welcome addition to the Bill.  Like Senator Howard, we could speak for ever about what might happen and what could happen under this investigation.  We will not know until it is actually in force.  If it appears that everything is a whitewash job then I presume the Minister can move in and do something about it.  I accept that there are bad eggs in the Garda Síochána.  Can politicians claim a complete clean sheet for themselves?  Can the journalists who often decide what our viewpoint is on these things make this claim?  Can anybody claim that there is no bad egg in his own profession or his own way of life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would have no mercy on gardaí who overstep the limits and while I think the investigating committee should get every support to deal with them, we should not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of the Garda are there to protect innocent people.  Earlier today I was amazed to hear people with legal experience more or less deciding that the Criminal Justice Bill should be judged on the basis of two incidents that would appear at the moment to be going against the Garda.  Take the case of the poor man of 79 who was beaten to death.  Could you react in the opposite way and say that we have not half enough laws tough enough to deal with those people who harass older people?  I am afraid that once <Col N="312" /> more we are going to spend so long looking after the few bad eggs that are in the Garda Síochána that we will forget to protect the innocent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The core of the amendment, that which we have come to term the controversial sections of the Bill, cannot be brought into operation by order by me or any other Minister until the complaints procedure has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and until regulations governing the control and treatment of people in custody have been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently made by me and put into operation.  That is the situation which we are trying to achieve. That is the core of whichever kind of amendment we would like to get.</P>
      <P>I gave a commitment that these sections would not be included.  The Seanad asked me to write my verbal commitment into the Bill.  I agreed to do that and I took it back to Dáil Éireann.  The debate on the Seanad amendment in Dáil Éireann coincided with the two incidents which have been referred to here.  An amendment which would have been accepted on the nod became an occasion for a long, searching debate on the nature of a complaints procedure.  It was clear before the debate commenced that many Deputies on all sides of the House felt that while there was a commitment to independent investigation of complaints that the same commitment to an independent adjudication was not there.  It was there and it was never my intention that it would be otherwise.  So that it would be quite clear to Members of the Dáil I moved an amendment to the Seanad amendment.  What has happened since in both the Dáil and in this House is that the nature of the complaints Bill have become the subject of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the complaints Bill went to Government a long time ago and we have the final draft at this stage.  There are about three or four outstanding matters to be dealt with by the Attorney General.  I gave a clear indication in the Dáil of the nature of that complaints board as I am proposing it.  It still has to <Col N="313" /> go back to the Government for final ratification. Consequently, what is said in this House and what was said in the Dáil is relevant advice to me which I can present to the Government before they make a final decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is an open secret now that I am thinking of a board which will be independent in the exercise of its functions, that would have, say, seven members.  I pose the question: would it be acceptable to both Houses if the Commissioner had one nominee in those seven?  Would both Houses require that it should have seven people who are not gardaí?  I have also said that it would have to be headed by a chief executive officer who would have a full time staff.</P>
    <P>On the question of investigation, the Garda Síochána conduct criminal investigations in this country.  Under normal circumstances, the investigation would be carried out by the Garda Síochána but under the supervision of the board and the board will have the power to prescribe general principles to be observed in the appointment of investigating officers.  It would be able to give the investigating officer such directions as appear necessary in relation to an individual investigation. Also, I am including in the Bill that it would be required that a preliminary report would be sent back from the Garda Síochána within 30 days.  As regards what Senator O'Leary said in relation to keeping it moving down along the line and having delay with nothing happening I specifically included that the first report should be back to the executive and the board within 30 days and the board can see what is happening.</P>
    <P>We should have a dual system where in certain circumstances &mdash; I shall make provision for this in the Bill &mdash; there should be independent investigation and the board's chief executive would have the power to investigate or he could cause something to be investigated by appointing somebody else.  It may be a barrister or a solicitor or in the case of a complaint concerning fraud an accountant might be an appropriate person to appoint.  He could act in this way with the permission of the board, if it considered that the <Col N="314" /> public interest required that people other than the Garda Síochána should actually carry out an investigation or if the board was not satisfied with the nature of the investigation carried out by the Garda Síochána, or was not satisfied that the matter had been properly investigated. There is no fundamental disagreement there with what has been stated on either side of the House.</P>
    <P>Minor complaints can be dealt with informally.  This would have to be by consent.  What one person would consider minor, another person might consider major.  A complainant might consider it to be major.  This has to be taken into account also.</P>
    <P>If it transpires that an investigation discloses a criminal offence, it has then to be referred to the DPP.  It is up to the DPP to decide whether criminal charges are to be taken.  If, on the other hand, a transgression which is less than a criminal offence is disclosed, merely a breach of discipline rather than a criminal offence, there must be some adjudicating process. I am suggesting that a sub-committee or members of the board would act as adjudicators. They would have the right to decide what kind of disciplinary action should be taken: whether somebody should be reprimanded, demoted or dismissed. As this is a judicial procedure, one would have to give the right of appeal to a garda against the decision of the tribunal.  This must be given to an appeal board.  It would be appropriate that an existing Circuit Court judge should be involved as there is no point in duplicating personnel.  An existing Circuit Court judge could be used as the chairman of an appeal board.  This is the kind of formulation of which I speak.</P>
    <P>The core of the amendment relevant to the complaints procedure is that it cannot become law until the other House and this House are happy with the proposals I put before them.  The same applies to the regulations.  Senators Eoin Ryan and Lanigan's amendment and my amendment, which was the Seanad amendment slightly changed by the Dáil, have the same net effect.  We should not try to legislate detail in advance of a <Col N="315" /> major Bill coming before the House. What is needed is a barrier to prevent the implementation of these controversial sections until this House and the other House has adequate time to discuss them. I am opposed to Senator Eoin Ryan's and Senator Lanigan's amendment for this reason and also for technical reasons.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  This could cause problems at a later stage.  It is conceivable that the essential provisions of the Bill could be challenged in the courts on the ground that they were brought into force before a fully independent complaints commission had been established.  Successful detentions and subsequent convictions could be rendered invalid.  There are real problems in this area which I spelt out in detail in the Dáil and which Senator O'Leary spelt out here again.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in reference to the regulations.  What does &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; mean?  Adequate to whom? To the detained person or adequate to the gardaí who need to be protected against false allegations?  &ldquo;Adequate&rdquo; means adequate to the Dáil and Seanad so that the regulations will be approved by both. That is the test of adequacy.  Since the Dáil and Seanad have to approve these safeguards anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, so <Col N="316" /> we do not need it in that sense.  There is no major difference in substance between the two amendments.  The amendment originally accepted by the Seanad and slightly amended by me for the reasons I have outlined which have strengthened it somewhat, is every bit as good as the substitute amendment.  The final test of it will be here and in the other House where we will have to go through all stages of the complaints Bill.</P>
      <P>As to the exclusion of ranks above Chief Superintendent, there is nothing in the amendment which states that it cannot be extended, either before publication of the Bill or during Committee Stage, to include Assistant Commissioner or Commissioner as the case may be.  I shall take that view into account. The fact that we are saying Chief Superintendent here is to keep it in line with what I originally intended, but since we have the opportunity of having a preliminary debate and getting the views of both Houses on the kind of complaints procedure they would like to see, I shall keep this in mind.  I am open also to the advice of the House as we go through Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with every point in a general way.  If I had more time I would deal with the points specifically raised by each Senator.  In the general remarks I have made I have covered the areas of doubt raised by Senators.</P>

      <P>In regard to item No. 2 today, I would ask leave of the House to make a correction to the motion as it stood on the Order Paper.  This is in regard to the motion establishing a committee in regard to the use of Irish.  The position was that we passed an expediency motion some time ago and what we were doing today was passing the substantive motion.  It is necessary to adapt from the original motion to the substantive motion in certain respects.  One of those adaptations was not made in the text that appeared on the Order Paper and I ask the House to agree that the text on the Order Paper which was the subject of debate and decision, would be corrected in the Journal of the House and in the Official Report to include paragraph 3 as follows:</P>
      <P>That in the absence from a particular meeting of the Joint Committee of a member who is a Member of Seanad Éireann, another Member of Seanad Éireann may, with the authority of the absent member, take part in the proceedings and vote in his stead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent debate which <Col N="319" /> took place in this House on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, a Cathaoirligh, there was a very favourable response on all sides to the work of the Ombudsman. That is a view I share fully.  There is no doubt that, in his comparatively short existence, the Ombudsman has made a major impact.  He has completely justified the all-party agreement to set up the office.  He has shown how effective an instrument he can be in acting on behalf of citizens in their dealings with the bureaucracy.  Indeed, as I recall, he was described during the debate as a &ldquo;Tribune of the People&rdquo;.  To my mind, the sentiments underlying that description captured the essential features of his role.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the office of Ombudsman did not, however, imply that the public service was some ogre which needed a stick to be beaten with. It was rather a recognition that, with so large an organisation as the public service, whose actions touch the daily lives of citizens, independent and impartial machinery was needed to ensure fair play.  And fair play can work both ways &mdash; both for the bureaucracy as well as the citizen.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman, therefore, is essentially an impartial and independent referee. He acts on behalf of the citizen but he is not an enemy of the bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>I have thought it important to underline the role of the Ombudsman as a prelude to a consideration of the major expansion of his remit which is envisaged in the draft order before the House.  And I am glad to fulfil my promise, which I made during the earlier debate mentioned, that I would fully involve the House in all decisions affecting this remit.</P>
      <P>I think it would be helpful if, at the outset, I outlined generally the basis of the Government's approach to the extension proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding on the framework for the extended remit, the Government had to take account of a number of relevant issues.  The most important of these were timing, resources, and areas of need for <Col N="320" /> action by the Ombudsman.  It is proposed that the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to each of the bodies indicated in the draft order would become effective from 1 April 1985.  As I indicated in the recent debate on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, the Ombudsman had already received by then about 1,300 complaints.  Since then, I understand that he has received a further 250 complaints approximately.  It is clear, therefore, that the Ombudsman is very actively involved in the discharge of his existing responsibilities. He must be allowed a certain breathing space, and time to recruit and train the additional staff required, before he can take on additional responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second issue &mdash; the question of resources.  To discharge the major expansion envisaged in the remit will require a substantial increase in the existing staff resources of the Ombudsman's office.  To this end, the Government have provided some £300,000 for extra staff in the 1985 provision for the office.  While I have not checked the corresponding provisions for every other Vote, I can confidently say that this is one of the largest, if not the largest, increase in the 1985 Estimates.  It underlines the Government's commitment, in a time of stringent economies, to ensure that the redress of citizens' grievances is treated as a major priority.</P>
    <P>In deciding the optimum use of these additional resources, it was clear to the Government that health boards and local authorities should come within the Ombudsman's remit.  That was the unanimous view of the 1977 informal all-party committee, whose work did so much to provide the impetus for the establishment of the office of Ombudsman.  It is a view to which I fully subscribe and on which I had given an earlier commitment to the House.  The basic question facing the Government was, however, what other areas should be covered with the resources available.</P>
    <P>During the earlier debate on the Bill to which I have referred, a number of Senators on all sides of the House commented on the position of Bord Telecom Éireann.  Reference was made to the <Col N="321" /> large volume of complaints in this area and, indeed, some criticism was made of the reaction of the company to representations made in this regard.  These views were echoed in the debate in the other House.  It was clear to me, therefore, that many public representatives were unhappy with the position here.  In fact, the points made endorsed my own position which I made clear during the debate.</P>
    <P>The views of the Houses, and indeed my own views, were therefore an important input into the Government's decision to extend the Ombudsman's remit to Bord Telecom Éireann.  I want to emphasise that this decision did not imply any wish on their part to single out this body among all State-sponsored bodies.  In fact, they recognise that, since their establishment, Bord Telecom Éireann have made major advances, many as a result of the large scale capital investment over the past number of years, in the development of the telephone service. But it is also a fact that, side by side with these advances, there seems to exist a serious level of public dissatisfaction in the area of complaints.  The Government would be entirely remiss if they did not utilise the Ombudsman, whose primary role it is to seek redress on behalf of citizens, in a situation where such a large volume of public complaints exist.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension of the Ombudsman's remit also embraces An Post.  Here, I think it is only fair to say that the level of complaints in this area does not seem to compare with that in the telecommunications area.  However, since both An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann were established at the same time, and since both have such a wide impact on the public at large in the whole postal and telecommunications area, it is appropriate that the Ombudsman's remit should embrace the two bodies.  Indeed, his investigations of both bodies should also help to compare their respective approaches and responses to complaints.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, have decided that the proposed extended remit for the Ombudsman is the most appropriate one by reference to the resources <Col N="322" /> available, the needs arising, and the time scale involved.  The remit envisaged represents by any reasonable standards a major addition to the responsibilities of the Ombudsman and to his coverage of public service operations.  That is not to say, however, that further additions cannot be made to his remit as appropriate. This is a matter which I intend to keep under review and to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>I would like now to comment briefly on specific aspects relevant to each of the areas embraced by the proposed extended remit.  In the health area, actions involving the exercise of clinical judgment would be excluded from the extended remit.  This is in line with the clear view of the all-party committee to which I referred earlier.  The basis for this view, with which I fully agree, is that the primary purpose of the Ombudsman is to investigate administrative malpractice, not clinical judgments reached by doctors, etc., as a result of their professional medical expertise.</P>
    <P>The reserved functions of elected members would similarly be excluded from the Ombudsman's remit in the local authority area.  These functions are essentially policy matters and would not be appropriate for investigation by the Ombudsman.  The exclusion of reserved functions is in line with the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where the counterparts of the Irish Ombudsman do not examine the discretionary powers of local authorities.  It is also understood that the practice in other administrations follows a similar course.</P>
    <P>With these exceptions, the whole area of health board and local authority administration, which impacts so much on the public at large, will be open to investigation by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken at some length about the postal and telecommunications area.  The extension of the Ombudsman's remit here, coupled with the work of the existing Users' Councils, will provide the public with a major focus for the remedy of complaints arising.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to make some general comments.  As I have said, <Col N="323" /> I intend to keep the framework of the Ombudsman's remit under review.  I also intend to review the underlying legislation under which he operates.  If the Ombudsman's remit is extended as now proposed, he will be undertaking responsibilities in relation to a vast area of the public service.  While I have no reason to anticipate it, experience of operation in these areas might indicate some necessary changes in the relevant legislation. It would probably be best to review together the legislation and any necessary further changes in the remit.</P>
    <P>I consider it would be wrong now to give any specific commitment on the timescale for such a general review.  It can only be based on experience of the Ombudsman's expanded role.  I would think, however, that it could be started in about 18 months' time.  If, however, any specific matter arises which requires urgent attention, I will of course deal with it immediately.  I intend to come back to the House in the new year with proposals for some further changes in the Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980. Basically, these changes will be aimed at bringing the Schedules up to date &mdash; to take account of the establishment of new bodies, etc. since the original 1980 Act. I have thought it better to treat these separately from the change proposed now under the draft Order before the Seanad. This change envisages a major extension of the Ombudsman's remit and is one deserving the full consideration of the House in its own right.</P>
    <P>If the House approves the draft Order, it is vital that the public become fully aware of the Ombudsman's expanded role and, indeed, of his important work under his existing remit.  I have had discussions on these matters with the Ombudsman, and I am glad to inform the House that he intends to launch a major publicity campaign to these ends.</P>
    <P>The efficient discharge of the Ombudsman's role depends, to a large extent, on the co-operation he receives from the bureaucracy.  I have no reason to believe that such co-operation has not been forthcoming to date, nor do I have <Col N="324" /> any doubts that it will not freely be given by the bodies covered by the proposed extended remit.  I would highlight, however, the importance which every relevant public organisation, and indeed their individual staffs, should attach to this matter.  I need hardly say that any absence of co-operation would be tantamount to frustrating the intentions of the Government and will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>To conclude, let me again emphasise the major expansion of the Ombudsman's remit which is envisaged in the draft Order before the House.  Its effect will be to increase still further the protection of citizens against administrative malpractice.  The interests of our citizens is something I have always passionately believed in as a public representative. I know that my fellow public representatives also share this view, and I look forward to the approval of the House for the draft Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, are happy to lend our support to the draft Order.  The Minister when speaking here two weeks ago indicated his intention to expand the remit.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that substantial additional resources will be made available to the office of the Ombudsman but I would ask the Minister to indicate if he is satisfied that this sum will be adequate to meet the demands on the office of the Ombudsman following this extension.  It is one thing to have adequate resources, and I look to the Minister for confirmation that resources will be adequate for the additional staff required to meet the two new categories now covered.  The recruitment procedure through the Civil Service, however, is a very slow process. I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that the recruitment and selection procedure will be activated straight away so that the additional staff with the relevant expertise will be available at the actual time that new categories will come under the purview of the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to the debate two weeks ago covered most of the points raised by Senators, but I want to return to a point I made at that time.  It refers to the exclusion of public servants from <Col N="325" /> the Ombudsman's remit.  I find it difficult to accept the continuation of this exclusion, because most public servants do not have the right to bring their cases to the Labour Court or to the Rights Commissioner. The Minister did not respond to that particular point, and perhaps he would be good enough to do so this evening. Public servants who are excluded from the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner service should be permitted to refer their cases to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with item 1 on the Order of Business, which relates specifically to the Ombudsman, we are also taking No. 3.  In relation to No. 3 I would like to make a few comments, especially since I am a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I want to welcome the addition of An Bord Telecom and An Post to the list of designated bodies which we will examine.  I want to make one specific point here, and I am glad to have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The work of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies is not a witchhunt.  Rather are we concerned with an objective analysis of the operation of these undertakings.  Following a thorough examination and analysis of these bodies we make recommendations which we regard as a considered input into policy making.  One of our primary considerations in drawing up these reports is to try to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for his money.  The members of the committee invest a considerable amount of time and effort in the proceedings of the committee and we expect our reports to be debated by the Seanad and Dáil, and we also expect the Government to take careful note of them.</P>
    <P>Our first report, on CIE, has been debated by the Seanad and I am happy to record that the Minister for Labour, who took that debate, said that he accepted all our recommendations in principle.  I have no such favourable comment to make in regard to Irish Shipping. While admitting that we were not in a position to produce our report before the <Col N="326" /> actual date of liquidation, even though it was virtually ready, we had made a thorough analysis of the problems facing that company and we had invested many man hours in preparing that report.  What we found particularly frustrating was the fact that we were never consulted. Admitedly our report was not published, but before the decision to liquidate was taken, it would have been a very valuable exercise and a valuable contribution to a policy decision for the Minister and the Government to consult us about the contents of the report.  We would have been only too happy to indicate our findings at that point in time.</P>
    <P>Liquidation was obviously one option. I remain to be convinced that there were not other options.  The chartering people in Hong Kong and in Japan are hardheaded businessmen who should have been more than willing to re-negotiate the terms of the charter agreements if the liquidation option was properly spelled out to them.  At this very time representatives from the chartering people both in Hong Kong and in Japan are in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to thank the Minister for coming back so speedily to <Col N="327" /> us with this order which reflects the wishes and views of this House expressed recently in trying to ensure the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to areas in which we as public representatives were involved, where we could see a need for the Ombudsman's role, areas that all of us, individually or as party groups, have had dealings with in the past, that is, the area of local authorities, health boards and of course the area of An Bord Telecom and An Bord Poist.  I am glad the Minister has confirmed that there have been relatively few complaints about An Post.  They seem to give a magnificient service under most extraordinary conditions at times.  The vast majority of people &mdash; I put this on the record of the House during the passage of the legislation &mdash; are most complimentary to An Post particularly, and I should like to reiterate that compliment today.  From the postman upwards they are a magnificent organisation.  I have relatively little complaint about them.</P>
      <P>The same cannot be said of Bord Telecom Éireann.  It is appropriate that this order should be forthcoming so quickly from the Minister in response to the amount of complaints that were documented and listed as having been made. I am glad that by bringing these two boards within the remit of the Ombudsman it might reduce the workload of Gay Byrne, who seems at the moment to be the only ombudsman available to people when they have a complaint to make against An Bord Telecom.  He has been very active in recent weeks in this area. It is an indication of the frustration of people that they have to turn to people who are well known in the media to express their views and consternation about some of their complaints.  It is appropriate that we would set down formally a remit that will give statutory power to somebody to investigate complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Minister for Finance has agreed, in consultation with the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies which has <Col N="328" /> looked for the facility, to investigate the accounts of these two boards.  That is also appropriate in view of the fact that shortly after the boards were set up a desire was expressed by this committee to visit them.  To say the least, discourtesy was shown to the members of the committee on that occasion.  The matter was rectified afterwards in the interests of good public relations.  It is not enough just to be able to put &ldquo;our good public relations&rdquo; on the record; there should be a formula there.  This motion will give effect to the committee's power to call in the people representing these two boards, to make them accountable to the committee which, in turn, will report to us.  That is how democracy should work.</P>
    <P>No person, whether in Irish Shipping or in any other semi-State body, should be allowed to make decisions without his board's knowledge or permission or without the permission of the Minister. It is appropriate that a specific committee of the House would have the power to investigate them.  We realise that Ministers in their various Departments have a continuing consultation process going on with the various semi-State bodies. All of us have to answer to the public, about complaints in the semi-State sector, which I usually defend.  I agree with the system; as a matter of fact, there should be a further extension of it but only if these bodies can prove themselves to be efficient.  That is what all of us are looking for, because money is so scarce now that unless we deploy it correctly and efficiently the service we would hope to give the people from taxpayers' funds would not be readily forthcoming.  It is a welcome move that these two motions which were taken together should receive the widespread approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I accept, as a member of a health board, that the remit would be in the area of administration only, but let us not interpret the area of administration as purely administrative decisions.  Administrative decisions can be made at community care level where somebody can decide whether they will visit an old person or not, and if they do not, somebody should have regard to the fact that <Col N="329" /> because they are in need of the service and deserve it they should have it.  If there is a problem about staffing in the community care service &mdash; and I know there is: I disagree with the blanket embargo in the health services, particularly in the community care section &mdash; it is appropriate that the people who feel they are not being served at that level should have some means by which they can lodge a formal complaint to have their case investigated.</P>
    <P>I think the Ombudsman is the appropriate one to do so, because while as a member of a board you can make a policy decision how it is administered at any level is then a matter for administrators, and the administrator of the community care service could be a professional person such as a nurse or community care director, it may not necessarily involve medical opinion which the Minister referred to and which would arise in a hospital situation.  I should like to differentiate between administration at community care level which could be provided by a medical professional person and the medical ethics of a decision which would be based within a hospital complex.</P>
    <P>We have to have regard for the ordinary common rights of people who already have recourse in law if any decisions of a clinical level in a hospital adversely affect them.  One should not take away the rights of people, and if anything I think the Minister is substantiating their rights.  As a public representative I should like to commend him for the excellent way he has dealt with this matter so speedily at the request of this House.  It is an indication of his concern as a public representative that the public at all times will have means of ensuring that their rights are protected and vindicated. It is a matter for this House to substantiate the belief the Minister has in that form of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, like Senator Hillery wish to compliment the performance of the Ombudsman and particularly to support this order.  At the same time I have a certain reservation about lending <Col N="330" /> what one would call blanket support.  I fear that sometimes we are creating a new bureaucracy and I would fear that the role of the Ombudsman might fall into that line.  For example, in the length of time he has been in operation &mdash; he is obviously a most admirable man &mdash; I think he has come up with only one problem which he has brought to public attention, and that was in the case of social welfare, one specific case where he felt that a new order should be made by the Government where a certain section of the community were not getting fair play from the Department of Social Welfare. I forget the details of that case but I listened to him outlining it on radio one morning and I thought it was fair.  Apart from that he has not come up with any sensational news.</P>
      <P>As regards the health boards, like the leader of the Labour Party in the House, I believe there may be room for him there but basically what is wrong with the health boards today is not that the administration is not working well, it is that they have no money.  I would not like to see the Ombudsman being used as a shelter by the Government or by any members of the Government to protect what is really wrong in the health board districts.  I cannot see anything wrong with the administration of the Western Health Board from the point of view of people who have complaints to make. They have made them through the normal process of direct letter or direct communication, and I suppose there were thousands of them.  The few who did not get satisfaction went to the public representatives and if they did not resolve the matter it was often brought to the attention of a health board member, who highlighted the case.  I do not see anything wrong with that system.  It would be a waste of money at this stage to dip too deeply into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened patiently to the Minister making his arguments regarding the need for the Ombudsman in An Bord Telecom. I was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1979 to 1981.  We are talking about a vast Department which, at that time, <Col N="331" /> was dealing with more than half of the public service.  During that time we set in train, as regards complaints, particularly on the telecommunications side which seems to be an eternal source of complaints, certain methods by which complaints could be dealt with quickly.  It was successful.  The Minister will acknowledge that he was the recipient on many occasions of rapid diagnosis of problems. Whether the results given to him were accepted by the public is another question. Whether they will be accepted by the report given to the Ombudsman is also another question.  An Bord Telecom were faced with a difficult task and it will continue to be a difficult task because most complaints are about bills.  A few weeks ago it was found out for the first time that the biggest offenders were the Government headed by the King Kong boss himself, the Taoiseach, who owed £55,000 to the board.  He was described as the person, who as leader of the Government, should have shown better example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I will.  But the point is that the Taoiseach and his Department showed bad example to the nation.  What is the Ombudsman going to do about it?  The Taoiseach is the Leader of the present Government.  I do not know how long they will last: they seem to be shaky. I would like to know how much the Department of Social Welfare, for example, owe Bord Telecom Éireann.  I would also like to know how much the Department of Health owe.  I would ask the Minister to inform us how much his Department owe An Bord Telecom.  The Department of Foreign Affairs owe in excess of £1,000.  We did not find out what date they paid the bill.  The Minister might tell us on what date his bill was brought up to date.  Has it lapsed for the <Col N="332" /> last 11 or 12 months?  How much was owed by the Government to An Bord Telecom?  What can the Ombudsman do about that?  The bad example is being shown by the Government themselves, by the Taoiseach, who still owes £55,000 to An Bord Telecom.  That is a nice example to an ordinary poor person in the country who finds his telephone bill is more than he thought it should be.  He complains about the bill and he says: The Taoiseach did not pay his bill; why should I pay mine?  That is a simple conclusion that anybody would come to.</P>

Was it true that the two modes of transport used in that bugging escapade were traced back today to the headquarters of the police force in this city?  Senator McMahon did not reply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I just wanted to make the point in answer to Senator <Col N="333" /> McMahon's allegation.  As a public representative I know it is easy for us to take on An Bord Telecom because of the quantity and volume of the inquiries that are made concerning particularly telephone bills.  The problem lay, not in getting the response, but in accepting the reply that An Bord Telecom could give them.  If people do not want to accept that response what can the Ombudsman do about it?  I would almost assume that 80 per cent of all complaints concerned the accounts of An Bord Telecom.  As I have pointed out the Government have not given a good example on this matter. In actual fact, they should be ashamed of themselves, and the Taoiseach in particular, when his own Department is the trend-setter in this particular matter. Obviously, his Department and himself do not accept what An Bord Telecom said the charges were.  He may be right or wrong.  The equipment in the exchanges cannot be relied upon to be giving exact and proper accounts.  Even experienced people within the Department could not stand over them because of the size and complication of that equipment.  I would go so far as to say that it will be very difficult for the Ombudsman to resolve the problem.  I await with anxiety and a keen eye to see if he will be able to come up with a new solution or if he finds any abnormal performance that cannot be responded to by either side.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Minister in his speech said the Ombudsman has a right to defend semi-State bodies on their actions.  I agree with that.  They need defending when wild allegations may be made against them, and in particular with regard to accounts.  I would hope that the Ombudsman will shoulder that responsibility. I am sure he will because he is a very responsible man.  He will see the difference between what is true and factual and what is alleged to be true and factual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to An Post, this is a very well run organisation.  It always was very well run even in the time of the Department. It is going from strength to strength.  There are less confused moments in the Post Office.  Any new <Col N="334" /> ideas emanating from it are good ones.  I welcome the special rate postage stamp for Christmas.  It is a very good idea.  It is expected to sell an extra two million Christmas cards this year.  That generates business for everybody.  It spreads right down along the line in this industry.  The same applied to the St.  Patrick's Day operation.</P>
    <P>When it goes into the banking facilities, there would be a very important role for the Ombudsman.  That is a place where the Ombudsman can really play a very important role, because he will be a strong balancing factor in the privacy of a person's account in any bank if there is something wrong with it.  Some £300,000 has been made available for this expansion. I would like to see the position reviewed in six or eight months' time in this House to see what progress the Ombudsman can make in this alleged area of confusion and complaints in An Bord Telecom.  We can judge what his capability is in that particular field after a certain period.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that if the number of complaints that were listed by the Minister at the last sitting of the House are still in existence after seven or eight or ten months or 12 months then we will know there is some other reason why those complaints continue. I hope in order to give help and assistance to the Ombudsman that the present Minister in our company this evening, a man I hold in high respect and esteem, would tell the next Government meeting that they should show example and pay their bills first so as to let the nation know that they have a responsibility to An Bord Telecom and get this matter cleared up and explain to the people that it is cleared up.  By that example an enormous amount of those problems would evaporate.  He should bring it to the Government's attention that this nonsense of the Taoiseach's office owing £55,000 to An Bord Telecom should be brought to an immediate end.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I will not delay with because I have gone too far already with Senator McMahon interrupting me.  If he believes in trying to <Col N="335" /> annoy me about matters he believes to be relevant it can be understood that it takes me five minutes to answer him in the most appropriate way that I can.  It seems to have dumbfounded him.</P>

      <P>Speaking two weeks ago to the Ombudsman amendment moved by the Minister here I made the point that the picture would be incomplete if the remit of the Ombudsman were not to be extended.  I got the impression &mdash; I said so that day; as a matter of fact we were told &mdash; that it would be extended.  I expected that it would be extended.  What I did not expect was that it would be done so quickly, and I must congratulate the Minister for such speed and efficiency.  This must be one of the fastest times for any piece of legislation to come before the Dáil and Seanad.  I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>The extension into the local authority and public bodies areas is a larger extension than the people here might think. As Parliamentary Commissioner in Northern Ireland and Commissioner for Complaints I dealt in the former body with say X number of complaints per year.  As Commissioner for Complaints I dealt with four times that number.  If we take the 1,300 that Michael Mills has handled up to date in the months that he is there and multiply it by four we get between 5,000 and 5,500.  The staff, therefore, would have to be aimed at dealing with complaints of that volume &mdash; something like that, possibly more.</P>

      <Col N="336" /> The Ombudsman, properly speaking, in his work is not in competition with the courts.  He is not, and should not be seen to be in competition with trade unionism, trade union contracts as such and freely negotiated arrangements.  He is not an Ombudsman to do the work of trade unionists or trade union officials.  That he will have to be warned about, because there is an unhappy tendency for people to pass the buck and in my case it happened that the buck stopped quickly because I happened to be a trade union official as well and I knew how to stop that buck.  It is a dangerous one.  The trade union field is most dangerous for an Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The picture is now complete.  The democratic picture is absolutely complete; there is no doubt about that.  The State will now in all its instruments be seen to be actually serving the citizen. This is not only an extension of the Ombudsman idea; it is an extension of democracy, the idea of fairly quick and efficient justice.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that he expects the fullest co-operation from all the people involved, the representatives of the public bodies, civil servants and the rest.  I got this in the North and I have no doubt that Michael Mills will get the same co-operation in the Republic.  I feel that he will get it; he deserves it.  In my own experience as a trade union official operating in the Republic as well as the North at that time, I got the fullest co-operation from local authorities and any bodies that I had to deal with and I am sure he will get it too.  There was only one occasion in the North when I felt obstructed &mdash; or two rather.  One was a doctor, and I was not interfering with his clinical record. We got over the hurdle.  The other one was an ordinary case of obstruction.  We dealt with that quickly.  There were only two such cases.  I am happy to record that.  Again, let me reiterate that the Minister is to be commended on his circularised statement.  He is to be commended on the speed and efficiency with which he extended the remit of the Ombudsman and therefore the extension <Col N="337" /> of the democratic ideal of justice and fair play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the cutbacks in the Health Services and calls upon the Minister for Health to ensure that there will be no reduction in the level and quality of general health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for this motion are very obvious indeed.  It seems to me that there is a deliberate policy on the part of the Government who have been in office for a period of two years to drastically reduce health services in every way possible.  The unfortunate point in this regard is that the very people whom the Labour Party and the Government say they want to protect, namely the poor, the deprived, the less well-off and those who are on <Col N="338" /> very low incomes, are the people who will suffer most and who are suffering greatly at this point in time.  Indeed we have a group who have become known as the new poor, people who are just above the medical card guidelines.  They are heavily committed to mortgages, to taxes, to new levies of all kinds for planning, for water, for refuse and so on.  I must repeat that in the joint programme for Government those were the very people the two parties concerned indicated they would protect most.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health himself, urged passionately that these very people should not suffer in any way.  It is a sorry situation for Labour people in Government that they should be reneging on all their promises and all their beliefs.  I find that all over the country Labour members of health boards and county councils are hanging their heads in shame at the savagery of the present cutbacks.  From Donegal to Cork it is the same story, and what I intend to say here this evening will be in many ways a factual illustration of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country the story is similar.  Wards in hospitals, in maternity units and other units are being closed. There are cutbacks in expenditure on maintenance and transport.  The statements of many health board members are emotional.  They are saying that people will die because of the cutbacks.  These are very serious words.  I hope that does not prove to be the situation.  The Minister will have to be working extremely hard when he replies next week to prove to me and to my colleagues that it is not. We are told that by 1985 there will be further drastic cutbacks, further staff reductions, further wards and units being closed.  There will be vacancies in hospitals next year.  The public sector rule of filling one in three vacancies will apply to health boards.  There is a ban on overtime. There will even be a ban on sick leave, if that is possible.  The Chairman of the Dublin Skin and Cancer Hospital has said that the amount of money being made available by the State and by voluntary donations makes it difficult to maintain existing health services and <Col N="339" /> developments.  He further stated that both the quality and the quantity of services will be reduced.</P>
    <P>In Galway a maternity unit is not in use because of lack of funds.  Throughout the country there are buildings vacant because of a lack of money to fit and staff them.  At the moment 14 buildings for the mentally handicapped are idle.  In Cork knee joint and hip replacement operations are being discontinued.  Here in Dublin wards are being closed in the Meath, Mater and Adelaide Hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the Midland Health Board area, extreme difficulty is being experienced. The cutback there for 1984 has been £2.025 million.  The board feel that to implement this cutback, if that is the right word, there will be no replacement of staff, no locums, no transfer of staff, that there will be juggling here and there and redeployment all over the place.  That is on the pay side, while on the non-pay side there will be no painting, no maintenance, no renewal of machinery, of ambulances or of other vital equipment.</P>
    <P>We know too, of what I consider to be an all-time low, a cutback on food.  There is evidence of this in hospitals and institutions throughout the country.  In St. James's Hospital tinned fruit and ice cream are no longer on the menu.  In a certain west of Ireland hospital, not far from Athlone, I know of a visiting consultant who has been denied a cup of tea and a biscuit during a break.  He has to go out now to his hotel.  That takes about an hour whereas in the hospital he could have a cup of tea in a period of ten minutes and then continue his work.  That is a very sorry state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The shortfall for 1985 in the Midland Health Board area will create more and more problems.  A shortfall of £2 million would be the equivalent of sacking 200 members of staff at approximately £10,000 per annum each or, if you like, closing for six months Portlaoise or Mullingar hospitals.  It costs £3.8 million per annum to run Portlaoise hospital and £3.9 million per annum to run Mullingar hospital.  I am trying to highlight the magnitude of this cutback, the severity of it <Col N="340" /> and what it means.  One could say that Birr, Edenderry, Athlone or Longford hospitals might be closed by way of equating the cutbacks.  I want to assure the House that that is not the way the problem is being handled, but it is an indication of how serious the whole matter is.</P>
    <P>Recently in the Athlone area there was a very serious accident.  Because of the cutbacks, because of redeployment of ambulance drivers to other duties, what happened in regard to that accident led to massive public concern.  Unfortunately, a young woman and her child were killed and a number of passengers were seriously injured.  A gruesome scene, one might say, just outside Athlone but there was no ambulance available.  The bodies of those who died and those who were injured were brought to a hospital in Ballinasloe by a passing van driver.  He put the injured and the bodies of the dead in the back of his van and took them to hospital.  Surely in this day and age that should not happen.</P>
    <P>Again in Athlone &mdash; I am sorry to be so parochial about this &mdash; the Minister for Health last year came to the town and announced publicly a commitment to an orthopaedic unit and a casualty unit for our hospital.  He has reneged on that promise. We congratulated him at the time. We thought it was the best move possible. We had been fighting for it for years.  The Minister may say that planning is going ahead, which I believe it is, and that the project may well be ready next year for tendering stage, but that will not happen because members of the health board in their wisdom saw fit to travel to, Dublin to make a submission for extra staff for this important orthopaedic unit and also for the casualty unit.  They were told that they must fund the units in some other way, that there must be redeployment, that they must fund them through some saving scheme or whatever.  That is practically saying to our people in Athlone, &ldquo;sorry, the hospital is not on, the orthopaedic unit is not on&rdquo; because there is no way that the health board can transfer funds in this way for this particular important unit.</P>
    <P>I make the point that in the national <Col N="341" /> plan there is provision for, as it were, specialist, separate, important facilities, that they would come automatically without having the juggling of funds within the health boards' scheme.  However, I must confess that I am not happy to read the contribution of Deputy Ormonde in the Dáil in which he said that in dealing with the Athlone situation, he had bad news for the Midland Health Board.  He went on to explain that when the South-Eastern Health Board managed to provide additional funds from their allocations for the provision of two casualty officers and a radiographer, they were told by the Department of Health that because they would have a deficit for 1982 these funds would have to go to correcting this deficit.  Therefore even if a health board manage to find the funds from within their allocations they are losing out.</P>
    <P>I make the point also that I believe we are the only health board area where there are no paediatricians or orthopaedic surgeons.</P>
    <P>The area of medical cards is one that has to be mentioned also.  Entitlement in this regard is being reviewed and they are being taken back at an almost unprecedented rate.  Shortly after coming to office the very first people to be hit by the Minister were the old age pensioners. The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, issued medical cards automatically to old age pensioners. Then we had the students: their medical cards were withdrawn from them as quickly as they got them.  We were promised a review of the famous 900 items that were removed from the list by Deputy Woods as Minister.  There was a storm of protest at the time but we were promised a review of this area.  The review did come about, but an extra 200 items were added to the list.  Simple items like aspirin and Anadin which would have been prescribed in the past are now being replaced by far more expensive and more powerful painkillers costing the taxpayer and the health boards in question much more money than previously.</P>
    <P>One might ask if the whole operation was a waste of time.  The national plan, <Col N="342" /> at paragraph 5.38 refers to coronary by-pass surgery.  It makes the point that there has been an expansion in the capacity of the health services to provide effective diagnostic treatment services for conditions which previously were beyond the scope of active care.  We are told that these include coronary by-pass surgery, renal transplant programmes and total hip replacements.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>The community expects that these life-saving and life-enhancing techniques should be available to all those for whom they are effective.  While health policy will aim to reduce the need for such services by preventing the associated illnesses, it will continue to be policy to make necessary care available to all.</P>
    <P>It has been strongly suggested to me that in this area the people with medical cards perhaps are not receiving the same help as are people who are VHI members. I would like to think that that was not the case, that if a person had a serious coronory ailment he would have coronary by-pass surgery and would get the same treatment as anyone else.  I should like to pay tribute to those people in the Mater Hospital for the great work they are doing in this area of coronary by-pass surgery. It has saved many lives.  The team at the Mater are recognised the world over as being first class.  They should be congratulated heartily.</P>
    <P>I read in the <i>Evening Herald</i> that the Minister indicated that 70,000 Irish people are drunks, that they greatly abuse drink and that many of them die much earlier than they should.  He said also that half of the 5,000 or 6,000 people injured in car accidents were injured as a result of the abuse of drink.  At paragraph 5.34 of the national plan we read that it will be a major concern for future health policy to reduce avoidable expenditure on alleviating the consequences of unhealthy lifestyles.  I would agree with all this.  I would have to refer to the recent report of An Foras Forbartha and agree with the Minister about so many car accidents resulting from the abuse of alcohol. <Col N="343" /> I am of the opinion that the Health Education Bureau by their TV and newspaper advertisements are doing great work in highlighting these problems and telling the people to drink only in moderation. But in the national plan we read of a proposal to extend drinking hours, for which there is absolutely no demand from either publicans, public house staff, trade unions or even the heaviest of boozers. Nobody wants this extension.  I would have to accuse the Government of positive double standards in this area.  They are undermining the work, the morale and the confidence of the Health Education Bureau.  Clearly this is a major retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking an extra £1.5 million from consultants.  This money is to be collected through health boards. The consultants naturally will turn to their patients for this extra money.  They will charge higher fees and in turn the VHI who are presently losing many customers because of the high costs will apply further high costs.  Consequently, more and more patients will be turning to the public sector which is already heavily burdened.  The VHI are to be congratulated. They are playing a major role in providing finance for major operations and for sickness generally but they are losing 60,000 customers a year because of the costs being so great.  This move on the part of the Minister will further take people away from the VHI schemes.  The Minister has been suggesting that we should aim for five-day beds as it were, in other words, that one should arrange to become ill on a Monday only and to be able to leave hospital on a Friday evening.  That is not realistic.  It is absolutely ludicrous, but again it indicates how low we tend to go.  I could go on at length giving, as I said, factual situations.  We know that the dental schemes including the schools dental scheme, are in a chaotic situation.  This is a national disgrace.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic treatment is a thing of the past so far as the dental services are concerned. We cannot say that we are making progress in the area of health. <Col N="344" /> The Minister may ask if we cannot agree with something.  We are not opposed to a reasonable review of the health services and their cost.  But it is an area where we have to be very careful.  It is the most sensitive area of Government in my opinion. Certainly, greater efficiency can be achieved, but it can be done with far more compassion and with a far more human touch than is the case.  This Government, and this might be acceptable in certain areas of Government, are taken up very much with the question of financial rectitude, but the problem is that in this area we are ignoring the unfortunate sick, the geriatrics, people who are physically handicapped and those who suffer from serious illnesses.  These are the very people that the Government promised to-support to a greater extent. The Government are insensitive to the tragic problems they are creating.</P>
    <P>I have a note taken on a question which seems to have hit the headlines recently, that is the question of whether contraceptives should be made available to people at 18 or at 16.  I am sure everyone here would agree with me that this is not a vital issue today.  Compared with the problems I have outlined and to those which other Members on this side of the House have highlighted, it is not a problem at all.  I am not saying that it should not be discussed but I am suggesting that it does not deserve the amount of publicity it has got.  Throwing the question out to the media is purely a diversionary tactic; keep the attention of the people away from the real issues in the area of health.</P>
    <P>Every Government should be judged on how they proceed to help those who cannot help themselves.  If this Government do not provide very soon sufficient capital to the health boards to run the health services we will have a total collapse of these services that are so vital to other people.  The Minister for Health, whom I regret is not here, will have to accept total responsibility for this terrible situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of cost generally, as a member of an advisory <Col N="345" /> committee of the Southern Health Board and also as a member of a voluntary hospital group in Cork city, I would have to ask why there should not be priorities as regards the health services.  I agree that the question of the cutting of health services is an emotional question.  Should we say that health services in themselves are being cut or that health in itself is being given proper priority?  I differ and I see a situation where we are not using our moneys to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>I would have to put the question as to whether we have created a situation where we allowed groups within the health services to make their own demands.  That trend started in 1979.  I do not want to give the impression that I am knocking one Government or another, but when we are spending in the region of about £1,200 million of taxpayers' money, we must ask whether we are getting the best from that expenditure. In respect of health we must ask again what is enough or what is the priority. The impression is given that many people are suffering because of the cutbacks. Certain points can be made in that regard, but I would like to give a few examples to indicate whether we should question expenditure on health.</P>
      <P>A patient in a Southern Health Board bed this week would cost in the region of about £750 a week to keep.  I appreciate that we are talking about the total services and the total commitment of the consultants and other specialists involved in the Southern Health Board area.  I must speak of the area that I represent because I can see the problems there.  I cannot say that the same situation prevails in many other areas but I understand that it prevails in particular in Dublin and in the other cities and big towns.  I cannot understand why some people would say that we should not question why it is costing so much to keep a patient in a Southern Health Board hospital and costing much less to have him in a voluntary hospital which would be funded by way of voluntary contributions as well by contributions from the health board and from central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give an example of the difference <Col N="346" /> in costs as between both types of hospital, a patient in the Southern Health Board area costs £750 per week to maintain while the cost in a smaller hospital, a hospital of between 200 and 600 beds, is in the region of £380 to £390 per week.  I agree that in the latter case the patient would not get the specialist services but all the people within the Southern Health Board region are not looking for specialist services.</P>
    <P>I must then point out that maybe we have brought about a situation where we have created massive specialist areas and not enough caring areas.  That costs a lot more.  Senator Fallon put his finger on the problem when he said that not enough consideration is being given to geriatrics and psychiatrics.  That is just an example.</P>
    <P>We imagined in the early seventies and right up to the early eighties that big was good, and that big was good in our health services.  I do not agree with this.  It has been proven now that we can give the very same service and, in fact, a more personal service &mdash; I emphasise this point as I have seen it personally &mdash; to people who are sick in a smaller hospital.  Why is it that we are not reconsidering this and admitting our mistakes?</P>
    <P>We must admit that the cost of running health boards and the enlargement of them is not working out to the good of all the people.  We now have the situation in which certain people who were under the impression that they were entitled to certain services are not able to get them. I do not deny that there are campaigns by groups within these marvellous enlarged health boards who only look for their own betterment.  For far too long we gave that priority; we should not have done it.  The first priority must be given to patients.  The administration staff of health boards are now recommending and have considered the closing of wards. To think that people in health boards are prepared to say that they will close wards and not allow patients in just so as to intimidate central or local government is a crime and a moral disgrace.  I resent this.  There is no reason why priority should be given to the closing of wards. <Col N="347" /> In my local city we can cater for patients and make them well at much lesser cost. This is appalling.  Are we not allowed to question this?</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are areas within health boards and within the health system generally &mdash; not alone in hospitals or within health care, but also in the social welfare system &mdash; that are being blackguarded.  This should not be allowed.  The responsibility for this lies with the administration staff of the enlarged health boards throughout the country. People get the impression that they cannot and will not be got at.  We as public representatives should be seen to be questioning this.</P>
    <P>The people who pay money every week through various schemes, PAYE and so on should be getting the best value for this money.  As other Senators have said, there are areas in which we have people in hovels, in diabolical conditions.  These are long term patients.  I have seen it in Cork.  The long-term patient is not seen as often as the person who goes into hospital for one week or ten days.  He can get a menu in front of him of four different types of meals.  The priority should be to make him better.  At the same time, the daily newspaper has been cut from long term patients.  Is the priority right?  In my eyes it is not.  I do not think that one person should have a choice between four different meals and that a paper should be taken from a person who cannot go outside the door from one end of the year to the other except for perhaps a bus ride to a local beach once or twice a year.  I question whether that administration has got its priorities right.  I resent that.</P>
    <P>We have questioned locally, in our own committees with the administration staff of the Southern Health Board and voluntary hospital groups boards together, the difference in costs.  We do not get a proper or sincere explanation.  We must give the first priority to the patient.  We all know what it is like to be sick and to be sent to hospital and we expect the best care possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must demand rights. If the spending of £1,200 million per year cannot cater for our people properly as regards health, we must seriously question why this is so.  This is being done, and rightly so.  What are the priorities in this area?  The Opposition spokesman on health says that he also will have to question this.  It must be emphasised that the cuts are being made by the administration staff of the relevant health boards differently in different areas.  There are differences between the Southern Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>People are not worried about the health cuts in particular areas yet there are big worries in other areas because an impression is coming across from the administration staff.  We have a right to question these staff.  We have a moral responsibility to the people whom we represent, particularly to the sick people who need our assistance.  As Senator Fallon has pointed out, we have a responsibility to geriatric and mentally ill people.  We see them living in hovels, in big institutions. We must bring these people to smaller institutions where they can get more personal care at a lesser cost.  This has been proven.  If we work things properly we can make these people more comfortable. I have seen this in my area. People are being kept more comfortable and more happy within themselves, at a lesser cost as compared with health board hospitals.  Why should this not be questioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is understandable public concern about the immediate and long term consequences of the failure of the Minister for Health to understand that you cannot at all times cut in every area of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with care to my colleagues. We all realise that health is costing the taxpayer an enormous sum today. I have always said that we made a mistake in our stance on the regionalisation of <Col N="349" /> health.  I have said that from the beginning, because of the costing.  I worry sincerely about the Minister's approach to general health policy, in particular to staffing.  I nevertheless welcome this debate here this evening because it is typical of the Fianna Fáil Party whether we are in Opposition which we dislike intensely, or in Government, that at all times we try to deal with human problems. Our present Leader's record as Minister for Health was far superior to that of the present man.  The present man, with all due respect, is extraordinary. I cannot track him down.  He even sees fit not to be present here this evening to hear this debate.  I suppose he will read it and comment on it.</P>
    <P>There is widespread upset in the nation today at the cuts in health, because there are savage cutbacks.  My sincerely held worry here in this Chamber this evening is that we might eventually have a total breakdown in the health service.  That would be dreadful because we have at the moment a very, very good health service.  With all the cutbacks, there is no way that we can continue to have the health service to which the people have become accustomed.</P>
    <P>We have financial rectitude <i>a la</i> Minister Dukes.  He may not be remembered for being a Minister for Finance but he will be remembered for generations to come for the hardship and sadness and misery which his actions as Minister for Finance have brought in the field of health through the cutbacks which the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has had to implement.  The cutbacks are ill timed and ill judged, because the morale of the people out there this evening with the generally low standard of living and no jobs available is very low. It is crazy for any Minister, a Labour Minister in particular, to hammer a good health service in the way he has done.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cregan: there were ways of cutting costs.  In fact yesterday evening if he was listening to the debate on the Dentists Bill he was given one very positive way in which he could have made a cut in the health field instead of the awful and inhuman ways in which <Col N="350" /> he is doing it.  His novel idea of people getting sick for five days &mdash; this is it.  You get sick on a Monday and you go home on a Friday and you are better Saturday and Sunday but you can go back into hospital on Monday morning.  My God, for any Minister for Health to get that idea is ridiculous.  How could any hospital be run?  How would the nurses in Ennis run the general hospital on a five day week with staff cuts at weekends, with no doctor that you can call?  If a doctor is there he has to work a 24 hour day.  It is crazy.  What are we to do?  Wrap up all the patients?  Then there are no ambulances &mdash; because he is making cuts in the transport area &mdash; to take them home and back in again on Monday when they can get sick again because Minister Desmond says it is all right and the bed will be there again for them.</P>
    <P>He also in this magnificent document, this grey piece that will go down in history, stated that there are no cuts.  Yet they are not replacing staff.  You have three nurses.  If a nurse leaves or if a nurse is out sick she is not replaced.  You could have one nurse being asked to do three nurses' duty.  That is the reality of what may happen in that case.  Here you have the nurses who are to me probably the greatest profession serving this nation this evening, and I will have more to say on that when we come to the Nurses Bill, and they cannot give the level of service they have been used to giving if they are cut from a three nurse situation to a one nurse situation.  I really do not know how they are going to cope.</P>
    <P>No matter what the cutbacks are I would never accept that the standard of patient care should be reduced.  This is the main worry of the nurses and the doctors.  How are they going to give the same professional nursing and medical attention to the patient with the cut-backs?</P>
    <P>The black bound, grey covered fairy tale would make an ideal Christmas gift. I beg the Minister &mdash; I hope he will read what I have said &mdash; to leave the nation the essential services and leave the hospitals with their nurses and doctors and the ambulances.  He has this lovely way, <Col N="351" /> when there is a major problem in a constituency or in a health board area, of passing it to the board or to the members of the board.  It does not make any difference what party they belong to, he passes the problems and he expects them to come up with the solutions to the major problems in health.  A famous American politician said: &ldquo;The buck stops here&rdquo;. It is not their responsibility.  It is their responsibility to make recommendations and to speak and to suggest options and so on, but it is his responsibility to have the proper health service given to the people of this nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly does not know rural Ireland.  People with bad arthritis now find that they cannot keep appointments with doctors or surgeons. Young and old sick people are being asked to use public transport and when they reach Dublin they are supposed to get to the hospitals.  Dublin may be well known to the people of Dublin and to the people who have spent a long time around Dublin, but it is a great worry to arrive at Heuston Station if you are not well or if you are not accompanied and facing what you might be told to have to find your way to hospital.  Such people are being told by the present Minister to use public transport.  He just does not know rural Ireland.  After the next election he will not know any of it because the few he has down there will be gone after the next election.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell me, when he is replying, how the Mid-Western Health Board, which is my own area, can save nearly £6 million next year and give a service to the people of the mid-western region.  That is the figure, so there will be cuts in staff, cuts in community care, no replacement of locums.  Regardless of what the media say about us, I intensely dislike dishonesty.  In his grey book, which he had as much to do with as the Fine Gael Members had, he makes no reference whatsoever on page 95 of 533 to health cuts.  There is no mention of any cut on page 10 of the smaller version which they got out.  He said there have been improvements in the efficiency with <Col N="352" /> which health services have been provided in the last few years.  Of course he was talking about the days when we were in power.  I do not know what is in the black version with the gold print on the cover that the present cabinet are bringing round the country giving to their supporters. That must be something else.  There are certainly no cuts in that, I am sure.</P>
    <P>We have a problem in Ennis, and indeed it is one that the Mid-Western Health Board have had on their plate for quite some time.  The Minister passed the buck, as he thought, to the members of the health board and they made responsible decisions and then because pressure was put on him from some place he did not fulfil his part of the bargain. In 1983 there were 1,687 Clare babies born.  There were 719 babies born in Clare and 968 of the mothers had to go outside Clare for a service.  We built, at a cost of £800,000 or £900,000, Cahercalla, and what did the Minister do then?  He came along and told the members of the Mid-Western Health Board, and I am sure Senator Smith, who is a member of it, will speak further on this: &ldquo;You can have Cahercalla but you must close down the hospital for the old people&rdquo;.  That was the choice he gave and that was the job he gave to the members of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan for listening to me.  It is rather tragic.  I agree that health is costing an enormous amount of money.  I understand and admit that there should be cuts. I worry at times about too much money being spent on administration, but to cut in the areas that the Minister for Health has done certainly is unforgiveable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the medical profession and as somebody who has worked for five years as a consultant in a central teaching hospital and ten years in one of the smallest viable peripheral hospitals in Ireland, some of the points I would like to make may be relevant to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I would say is that it does not follow that money poured into <Col N="353" /> the health service will result in healthier people.  Almost 20 years ago Lord Platt, who was a distinguished English physician, when delivering the Harvean lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London made the point that at a time in the United States when federal expenditure on biomedical research had increased from one million dollars to 1,000 million dollars, infant mortality had failed to improve and the expectation of life had remained almost stationary.  I will quote from that lecture.  He said:</P>
    <P>The demands of a clinical scientist for ever more expensive and sophisticated apparatus are justifiable if the things to be measured by the apparatus are relevant and important to the study of human health and disease and if they cannot be equally well assessed by simple methods.</P>
    <P>In other words, he asks whether a lot of the research, a lot of the gadgetry, is relevant to the needs of health.  He then puts the question: do we make a distinction between the curing and prevention of disease on the one hand and the promotion of health on the other?  It is my opinion, and I think the opinion of an increasing number of people, both in the profession and outside it, that we have a disease service, disease centres and that we have barely started to consider the implications of a real health service.</P>
    <P>I might say waste not, want not.  There are tons of disposable material thrown out in Irish hospitals every day.  You touch a precious gown that you could use in a garage locally and because it is no longer sterile it is put into the bin.  Take the syringes that are used.  I can use 40 or 50 syringes in a varicose vein clinic and they are never used again because I am caught up in this whole preconditioning that these things can be used and abused. It may make short term economic sense but it spells long term disaster.  The question then is, should we not be looking for safe Morris Minors that 90 per cent of the people using them can understand in smaller hospitals rather than looking for Rolls Royce which only 10 per cent can understand?  Technological imperialism <Col N="354" />&mdash; and that is a term I would like to get into the thinking of people concerned with health &mdash; technological imperialism has become part of the armoury of institutional imperialists, people who are determining what our needs shall be rather than going to the people to find out, as Senator Cregan said earlier, what their priorities are and meeting them.</P>
    <P>The allocation of priorities is the central issue in this whole business.  We have limited resources, we have limited talents, we have limited finances.  A surgeon wanting the latest endoscope at £2,000 for which he is told there is no money is not impressed by the fresh tarmac being spread across the extended car park.  The sick person wanting an extra nurse at night is not impressed by an argument for an extra gardener, and the trade union movement, concerned about the implications for health of employment, is unlikely to be pleased on hearing that the doctor's salary is to go up while the outside labour force in the hospital is being reduced.</P>
    <P>The question then is, how do we get our priorities right?  I suggest that the medical, nursing and para-medical professions, the consumer and all interested in health at local community level, should in order to promote good feeling and heightened awareness for better health, participate in the tripartite concept of management.  We need to get the operatives in our institutions together as one leg, and I emphasised this before in this House.  We need to get the institutional input such as the clergy, the profession, the trade union movement and so on as another leg but, most important, we need to involve the consumer, the person for whom the service has been created, the person who is never consulted or rarely consulted and the person who pays our salaries.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the structure which might help us to decide on priorities at local level and at area and regional level I then go on to the point about how you allocate scarce resources and how you spread our talent.  It is vital to appreciate that only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of ill health or 10 per cent to 15 per cent of <Col N="355" /> hospitalised ill health needs super specialists and super technology care.  Yet the power to decide how undergraduates will be taught, conditioned, the power to determine how postgraduates will be trained to meet needs dictated, by and large, by professional organisations is held to a great degree in the hands of those who are chiefly concerned with the super specialist line in the spectrum of total care.  Therefore, I think we need to challenge the institutional power that is held inside the professions and indeed even inside the centrally controlled movements throughout the country to try to get a better allocation.</P>
    <P>Briefly, then, what I have tried to say is that we need to look at the priorities and to determine how we are going to achieve them.  The best way I can see is to bring together the three legs of the service &mdash; the consumer, the operative and the institution.  We need to look at that at local community level.  We should be considering whether at local level we should not have a community health guild that would bring together those three legs from the day centre to social services, the health centre, the family doctor service and the hospital, to have a debate and to promote at a local community forum a genuine discussion about the allocation of priorities.</P>
    <P>Let me give you one story.  I remember that in Coleraine hospital shortly after I went there there was a problem which has been alluded to here tonight of the elderly, the people who were not labelled geriatric because they were long term stay patients.  The terrible Nissen hut was always pointed at.  Yet the Nissen hut did not leak.  It just looked ghastly.  It did not look part of the 20th century.  In that hut there was one nurse at night who had to call the main hospital for help.  I suggested, as a means of coping with this, that all the relatives should come together and send up one volunteer per night from each of the families separately, that the churches which were always saying they were so concerned might out of all the <Col N="356" /> churches in this town send one representative from the lot, and that the community groups, tenants' associations, should send one, not from each but from the lot. You would quadruple the staff overnight, but you would have only started, because as soon as those people arrive at the front gates of the hospital they would be met by our profession and the nursing profession who would say, &ldquo;No, you do not hold the right certificate&rdquo; and the administration would be saying, &ldquo;No, we cannot insure you because of legislation and liability.&rdquo; The whole of society needs to be shaken by the neck if we are going to be able to make use of the money we have got, the talent that is bottled up and is fossilised because it is so structured.  We must also have the ability to share equipment in accordance with the relevance in the use of that equipment to meet needs determined by the people and not to go on meeting needs dictated by professionals such as myself.</P>
    <P>The consumer will give the clues if you let him, but the institutions are so housebound that they will not allow the consumer to enter the debate freely at local level and local institutional level.  Do that and relate it to an overall scheme of priorities in relation to super specialist need and decentralised need and we will be able to go somewhere.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my last point.  You could evolve a system of finance which would be based on the assumption that the central hospital serves the central city but they should also receive finance in relation to that 10 per cent from other districts which cannot deal locally with the super special, super technology needs.  We must question for instance; are Ballymoney and Coleraine with 100,000 people getting a quarter or slightly less than a quarter of the finance to manage their health services compared with Belfast with its 450,000 people?  Certainly they are not, because in the city, as in Dublin, there are numerous hospitals with all sorts of hierarchies of staff systems, all sorts of expensive equipment which is duplicated, triplicated, quadruplicated and yet we can be told in our neck of the woods that you cannot have <Col N="357" /> a piece of equipment because eight miles down the road another hospital has it and it cannot be duplicated.  I say, fair enough, at a time of financial constraint we should listen to that argument, but let us start rationalising where it would be most effective first in the centre and then rationalise the weak, the peripheral and the small.  When I can see rationalisation taking place in the cities in terms of staff, equipment and finance, then I will be the first to say we will rationalise our two small hospitals in our little district in North Antrim.</P>

      <P>At a time when public disquiet in relation to the health services was never more rampant, Seanad Éireann has been treated in a most shabby and disgraceful way by the Government, almost akin to the way this Government are treating geriatric homes.  It is the Government that order the business of the Seanad, and yet tonight for the first time in a long time in public life we have witnessed a situation where the Minister for Health has not seen fit to come to this House on this motion.  Apparently also he did not inform the Minister of State that this debate was going ahead.  He is now here belatedly without even the normal assistance of personnel from the Civil Service and from the Department of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State would want to interrupt me at this stage, because I am not personally condemning him.  I think he would have to agree with me that on a matter of such importance it is less than fair to Seanad Éireann that it should be treated in that way.  I would expect that there would have been at least some apology to the House long before this.  Perhaps it was an oversight, but I feel it is a most shabby and most disgraceful way to treat a motion of such importance which has <Col N="358" /> been on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  Since we do not have the control on this side of the House as to what business is taken and since it is arranged by agreement the least we could expect is that the Government side would be presented in the way that anybody would expect in a situation like that.</P>
      <P>Over the past couple of years members of health boards have been concerned with developments that have taken place. It is important that we should constantly review our services at all levels and see that they are cost-effective and any inefficiency and any waste in our services should be eradicated.  This would have the support of people of all political shades.  There has been a marked deterioration in the standard of service available to many sectors in the community, but particularly to the old and the poor.  It is because of the biting effect the services are now having on these groups that this matter has to be highlighted until such time as firm Government action is taken. Most of these groups are unable to fend for themselves.  There was a time in this country when there would be mass public meetings and considerable publicity because of this kind of problem.</P>
      <P>In recent times there has been a marked restraint because everybody knows that the economic situation is difficult and nobody wants to be unreasonable. We have to be judged ultimately as politicians, and members of the present Government will be judged by what they do for those in society who are not in a position to fend for themselves.  Whether it is long lists, queues of people unable to gain access to ophthalmic services, dental services, waiting lists for admission to orthopaedic hospitals or wherever the problems are, they should be highlighted here and we should try to get across to the Minister of State the necessity to ensure that whatever the economic strictures are &mdash; I am not saying that the overall budget has to be increased: perhaps it has; but even if it has it is crucial that the money available is diverted and used to cater for the poorest sections in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Many of our services have been discontinued; others are collapsing.  Our hospital wards are packed.  I went in to visit a patient in the county hospital in Nenagh and I virtually had to shift a bed out of my way to get out of the ward as other visitors were coming in.  Nursing services are stretched to the last and there is a limit as to how far we can go down that road.  Perhaps we have travelled down too far already.</P>
    <P>As I am anxious to give the Minister of State some time to reply, I should like to refer briefly to the general medical services scheme.  A few years ago about 900 items were removed from the general medical register.  These are the items provided under our choice-of-doctor scheme.  When this Government came into office they added, as our spokesman on health, Senator Fallon, said earlier, an additional 200 items.  I should like to make a few points in relation to some of the items that have been excluded.  The antacids, Aludrox, Mucaine, have been taken off the list with the result that now doctors are prescribing much more powerful drugs like Tagamet.  If one looks at the report for the general medical services for 1982 one will see that Tagamet which is a preparation for ulcers cost £1,404,635.  Yet, one year later that same drug was costing our health boards £1,880,660.  Panadol, paracetamol and preparations for pain killers were taken off and they, again, are replaced by much more powerful drugs where the doctor, in the knowledge that his patient cannot afford the normal drug, prescribes the only drug that is on the list.  This ultimately leads to the situation where the actual removal of items from the register inevitably costs the State substantially more.  Ponstan which is used instead of Panadol and paracetamol, in 1982 cost the GMS £496,000 and one year later it had doubled to £900,586.  The number of prescriptions for that very powerful drug had increased in the order of 62 per cent. A cheap effective cough bottle like Benylin has been taken off and replaced by Pulmoclase and other expensive preparations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> I have already demonstrated that the actual decision to take off some of these items has led to increased costs.  I am not saying that they should all be replaced; I am suggesting replacing the ones that seem to be needed particularly by old people, by people suffering from chest ailments and people in need of the normal pain-killing drugs.  It is not just a question of the cost factor which I have amply demonstrated, where the overall cost is doubling for particular strong drugs, but also there is the fact that where more powerful drugs are used they may not have the same beneficial medical effects when they are more needed by the patient.  We have also removed all the vitamins, and so old people are unable to get tonics which would cater for their problems and probably ultimately help them to remain out of hospital.</P>
    <P>When a patient leaves hospital the doctor in the hospital will give that patient a prescription.  I understand, as far as our public patients are concerned, that patient has to go back to his or her own doctor before that prescription can be put into effect.  In other words, when the doctor in the hospital prescribes for the patient when he is being discharged, that prescription cannot be taken to a chemist's shop; it has first to be taken to the general practitioner, renewed as it were, and then the person has to queue somewhere else to get what is needed. That is an unnecessary procedure and probably adds additional costs to the service.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister set up a committee to report on the general medical services.  I am told that one of the proposals which emanated from that committee where the medical profession were seeking to have a proper pension scheme was that any saving which they would make in the general medical services, in the discharge of their duties, would be the way by which they could contribute to their pensions.  I should like to give an example to the Minister and I would like him to reply.  Some doctors have abused the general medical services scheme.  I take it for granted that some of them did not but some of them definitely have. <Col N="361" /> So, therefore, somebody who abused the scheme has room for cutting back where he can demonstrate that this is for pension purposes but a doctor who played it fair and did not put in unnecessary visits cannot make the same contribution.  That kind of scheme is unworthy of the Minister and certainly will not contribute to improving the services as a whole.</P>
    <P>We hear the Minister for Health constantly telling us that the area to improve is the community care area, and that we have to take people out of institutions, that it is less expensive and that this is the way to go.  At the same time as that is happening we dismantle the ophthalmic scheme, we discontinue the dental scheme and we are unable to develop these services.  If the Minister wants a development to take place in that area &mdash; and he has the support of everybody in it &mdash; how can it be done when the existing services in the community care area are collapsing?  Time has caught up on me at this stage and I am anxious to give a small proportion of my time to the Minister for his reply.  Overall, we on this side of the House want to emphasise the critical aspects of the administration of the present health services and the need to ensure that whatever funds are made available it will not be the poor and the needy sections of society who suffer as they certainly do today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the valuable things that emerged from this debate this evening was for me to be in a position to listen to the excellent contribution of Senator Robb.  We had the opportunity of listening to a man who has first-hand experience in this field.  With the benefit of that experience behind him, he was able to say to us what he felt were the necessary ingredients for a better health service in general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may not be paraphrasing him correctly, but I gather that one point which he made earlier was that millions of pounds could be poured into a health service but that does not guarantee that people will be more healthy.  Coming from a man of Senator Robb's experience <Col N="362" /> and stature in the medical field, that is a comment that should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the contributions from the other side of the House, I have no doubt that whatever motivation was behind this motion, a substantial part of that motivation &mdash; I am not prepared to say all of it &mdash; was political.  As far as I am concerned, the greatest share of that motivation was political, and therefore I will respond to a certain degree in political terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will and if I do not, I can depend on you to draw me back.  On reading the motion, there is a very clear implication that there will be serious and savage cutbacks in the health service and that the blame and responsibility for that rests entirely on the Minister for Health and the Government. There was an attempt to copperfasten that implication by pointing out that the Minister for some reason, refused to come into the House this evening.  Apart from the fact that the Minister is well represented by the Minister of State, I reject also the contention that the Government in some way connived in that situation because they have responsibility for arranging the business.  Of course that is not correct.  This is a motion being taken in Private Members' Time. It was the turn of the Fianna Fáil Party and it was their privilege to select whatever motion they wanted.  They selected this particular motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to &mdash; among others &mdash; my colleague from County Clare talking about savage cut-backs and talking about &ldquo;a little grey book&rdquo; which I understand is her description of the National Plan.  If you look at what the national plant says about expenditure by the State in relation to health services over the period of that plan &mdash; the next three years &mdash; starting off from a base in 1984 of £986 million, the amount allocated for next year has increased by about £33 million to £1,019 million.  Where is the savage, serious and dangerous cut-back in that allocation?  It <Col N="363" /> simply is not there.  The reverse is true. For 1986 the allocation will be increased by a further £60 million, to £1,078 million. In 1987 it will increase still further. to £1,123 million.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we might look back to what the situation was, for example, ten years ago.  In view of the fact that Senator Smith used some statistics, I will perhaps be permitted to use them also.  Senator Smith, in keeping with his usual contributions, was not political all the time.  He made some worth-while comments.  In 1974 the total allocation by the State for health services was £143 million.  There has been an eight-fold increase in terms of finance in that period.  If you want to express it in terms of GNP, 5.2 per cent of GNP was allocated in 1974.  Ten years later that allocation has increased to 7.5 per cent of GNP.  For that 50 per cent increase in terms of GNP or the eight-fold increase in terms of actual finance, have we that greater measure of sickness in the State today?  To put it another way, has that substantial increase both in terms of money and as a proportion of GNP reflected itself in an improved and much better health service?  Have we a 50 per cent improvement?  In 1975-76 the number of personnel employed in the health services was approximately 40,000.  At present it is substantially over 60,000.  Let us examine, for the benefit of the people who put down this motion, how this substantial increase came about. It was brought into being in the great days that succeeded 1977, when the sky was the limit, where money could be borrowed and when sources could be scattered.  Every health board in the country were told that they could recruit x number of extra staff.  When it appeared that in certain health boards extra staff were not being taken on, reminders were sent to them inquiring as to why it had not happened.  When the reply came back from the health boards that they did not have work for extra people, the response from the Minister of the day was: &ldquo;Take them on whether there is work for them or not&rdquo;.  Resources are scarce.  That has <Col N="364" /> been admitted by a number of speakers from the other side.</P>

      <P>I want to put that on record.  There is evidence in my own county of the ruthless tactics that can be employed by health boards to extract sums that would perhaps be beyond their genuine needs.  Senator Honan referred to hospitals in my county.  It was not the Minister for Health who said if you want to work in Cahercalla you will certainly shut Edendale.  It was the health board that said that.  I am glad that the Minister for Health, having being apprised of the facts of the case, informed the health board that they had better have a re-think on that situation.  That was simply a case of using a new maternity hospital as a measure of blackmail to ensure the closure of an essential geriatric hospital. That was carried out by the health board and not by the Minister.</P>

It will encourage them to have a radical re-think of the best use to which they can put the resources available to them.  Even in the contributions from the other side there is evidence, in addition to these contributions, that resources are not always utilised to the best advantage.

      <P>I think that perhaps for the first time since I came into the Oireachtas the ludicrous side of parliamentary democracy has become apparent to me. By that I mean the polite, meaningless use of polite, meaningless words to give polite, meaningless assurances.  I notice that the Minister who gave me those assurances did not remain here to give me an explanation as to the extraordinary account he gave me in the past.  What we had were polite, meaningless promises about the problems of the homeless.  I want to quote from the Official Report of Seanad Éireann for 2 October 1984, Volume 105, No. 9, column 1073.  The quote is from the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Donnellan:</P>
      <P>I share the concern of Senator Ryan in regard to homeless people and I regret the committee have not reported as quickly as was anticipated. There were staffing problems, but this has been sorted out.  I can assure Senator Ryan that the report will be available in a matter of weeks.  A copy of the report will be with the Senator within four weeks at the most, although I hope it will be somewhat sooner.  I hope that this report, while helping to clarify the respective priorities and responsibilities of local authorities and health boards, will also stimulate these agencies to seek an improved level of co-operation and liaison with each other.  This is a vital requirement if their response to the immediate and long-term difficulties of homeless people is to be relevant and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine stimulating, encouraging, optimistic nonsense made by somebody who either was misled by his officials or was misleading me.  I choose to believe the former, that <Col N="366" /> the Minister was given wrong information. It is not and will never be my inclination to disbelieve the word of a Member of this House or of the other House. What is quite categorically clear is that a promise that was made in this House about something that is not vital to the grand parliamentary and political design of the great institutions of State but that is vital to 3,000 people in this country, that that report was casually promised 12 months ago was equally casually repromised seven weeks ago and I presume now, when the Minister gets up to reply, will be equally casually repromised yet again for some other date in that great, convenient place, the future, where everything can happen and nobody really can be sure and nobody can really contradict you.  As long as it is happening in the future there is no real way of measuring it and therefore it is a very safe place to do anything because really nobody can catch up on you there anyway.</P>
    <P>The realities are different.  I want to read on to the record some information on homelessness in my home city.  I will start with the most graphic because it demonstrates the extraordinary level of indifference in Irish society.  Michael lives in a derelict caravan near the Blackrock Marina in Cork.  There are five windows all of which have been broken, the door, which is off its hinges merely rests against the entrance, leaving the caravan susceptible to severe weather.  It is poorly sheltered and the caravan rests on only two wheels and could be overturned by strong winds.  It is devoid of furniture except for one broken table and a single mattress covered with dirt and lice.  Rats are his company.  Michael shares his accommodation with his dog.  The dirt track outside his caravan is used as an open toilet by many people, and with no immediate sanitation he also uses it for the same purpose. Michael suffered a mental breakdown in 1973.  Michael also needs hospitalisation and no hospital will take him because of his condition.</P>

      <P>It is a publication entitled <i>No Fixed Abode</i>, a publication for external use by the Simon Communities in Ireland.  Michael is one of the 1,000 or so people who live rough in this country, who have been the victims for the last I do not know how many years of the bureaucratic confusion and buck passing to which the homeless have been subjected. As recently as a couple of weeks ago there was a report of a person having been evicted in Dún Laoghaire, an unmarried mother.  The response of the housing authority in that area was: &ldquo;Because the girl is now homeless she is no longer a responsibility of the housing authority.  Because she is homeless she is the responsibility of the health board.  We will be contacting the health board to see what they can do about her case.&rdquo;  That has been the experience of homeless people up and down this country, so much so that in March 1982 the then Minister for Health, Michael Woods, decided to do something about it and he set up a committee.  That was the committee whose report we were promised here seven weeks ago would be completed in four weeks.  In the meantime the weather has got colder and wetter. People will begin to die.  We will not be able to prove that they die from homelessness. It is not as simple as that.  Their life expectancy will be severely reduced. Various complaints will begin to make themselves more manifest, and then when they are beyond recovery we will admit them to the care of the State in a hospital where we will look after them and ensure at least that they die in the comfort that we could never give them when they were fit to live.  In the middle of all that, at the same time as people are being run off the steps of the Custom House, wherein the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment are housed, we will have £1 million being spent on renovating the exterior and the magnificent architecture of that building while a significant proportion of the resources are being devoted to making sure the homeless do not deface the aesthetic appeal of that magnificent building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> All the time people in that building, and it must be those with Government or ministerial office who take the responsibility, promised and promised and promised and promised and failed to deliver. In the same way that they have promised and promised and promised legislation and failed to deliver.  In the same way that they have promised and promised reviews in the area of health care for the homeless and failed to deliver.  In the same way that this Government are now apparently prepared to abandon homeless children in Dublin for the sake of a miserable £10,000 or £20,000.  We do not know why, because apparently we cannot do anything and at the same time they promised and promised legislation on children and failed to deliver.  At the core of all of this and on this specific issue are 3,000 people who have one thing in common, that they are homeless.  They have a lot of other problems which are products of that experience like bad health, nervous complaints, pyschiatric complaints, prison records, drink problems and all sorts of other things.  They are all products of one common experience, the experience that nobody in this House or the other House ever had to go through or ever, please God, will have to go through, the experience of chronic homelessness.  The sense of isolation, of being outside and of being excluded, that that particular experience produces in people is something that nobody understands and I do not claim to understand it any more than anyone else.</P>
    <P>All I would say is that many people have seen the consequences of the experience of homelessness and it is not nice or pleasant to behold in terms of human suffering, of despair, of the destruction of people who had a right to a decent life. In that context, it was an extraordinary decision to postpone a report which was not a question of policy but merely a resolution of a conflict of administrative practice, which was not a matter of enormous expenditure but was simply a matter of solving a problem about which bureaucracy was at least responsible. Even if they did not do anything we would at least know who was responsible, <Col N="369" /> because it would be another and long day's work to get some of those bureaucracies to respond.  It was not a matter of major Government policy.  It was simply a question of ensuring that those who were given a job to do did it properly, promptly, efficiently and on time.  All I can say is that if we cannot get one small committee working on one specific area of a social problem then all the meaningless cant about a comprehensive social policy is so much rhetoric and so much nonsense, because if you cannot deliver on the small things then you will not deliver on the big things, the big things that demand resources and commitment and organisation and policy and decisions. We do not need any of those for the homeless.  We simply want something that has been promised for 15 or 16 months and which seems to be as far away as ever.</P>
    <P>In the light of the fairly categorical assurance that the Minister of State gave me there, I was interested in a reply to a written question in the Dáil today in which this same <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Homelessness was raised.  The reply there was quite specific.  All of a sudden there had been a problem about the committee completing its report.  Several weeks ago the committee was all set to report within four weeks.  Now there is a problem about the committee completing its report and it is going to meet on 3 December.  Then maybe we will have a report.  This is the committee that seven weeks ago we knew when it was going to report.  Let it be said further that a voluntary organisation connected with the homeless was informed before the summer that the report was completed by a senior official in the Department of Health.  Last summer it was completed. Last October it was completed.  Now at the end of November and almost into December mysteriously it is no longer completed.  It has to go back to yet another committee meeting.  Who in God's name is fooling whom?  What I would suggest is something entirely different but in the pressures of business, in the pressures of the grand plans of State and of the great issues of strategy and <Col N="370" /> policy, a tiny marginal group like the homeless go sliding down the list of priorities, and that is where political will is required.  That is where one expects people with stated senses of social concern to ensure that those groups who will never be effective as political lobbyists, who will never have the clout to create a major storm, continue to be important. The sort of fiction we are given, the promise of a report 12 months ago, the promise of a report completed early in the summer, the further promise of a report completed in October, followed by the nonsense of the non-availability of a report, followed by the creation of yet another meeting in December, is not the way to treat any group, however vulnerable, however voiceless, however unheard and however unseen.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, a matter of profound regret that we have got ourselves into what begins to sound more and more like a combination of Myles na Gopaleen and George Orwell and the capacity of people in some of the Soviet bloc countries to rewrite history in their own image and behaviour.  What we have now is language no longer meaning what it is purported to mean; a promise is not a promise; four weeks can become eight weeks; a report that was completed six months ago suddenly becomes incomplete five months later; something that was imminent becomes indefinitely delayed and the problem of the homeless becomes a problem of organisation and administrative detail and apparently of some sort of major and fundamental confusion somewhere within the ranks of that body which is known collectively as the bureaucracy but which individually we are not entitled to criticise.</P>
    <P>We have therefore an extraordinary, illusory world which begins out there at the gate, where words that to ordinary simple men mean four weeks suddenly do not mean that any more, where words like &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; do not mean that any more, where words like &ldquo;a report completed&rdquo; suddenly do not mean that any more.  You come through the gate and words begin to mean different things. Words begin to mean whatever it suits <Col N="371" /> you to say at the moment in time when the issue is raised.  That is where we are now.  The one reality which will not go away is the condition of those about whom these people were supposed to be making recommendations.  The one reality that will not go away is that that condition is deteriorating rapidly; that their numbers are increasing; that the obfuscation of bureaucracy is getting worse as their financial position gets worse; that their experience is now adequately documented.  Until recent years the one excuse was that we did not know about the problem.</P>
    <P>We know now, and instead of endeavouring to do anything or promising to do anything we are simply putting it on a longer and longer finger.  Therefore, without going on at unnecessary length and in the hope that the Minister will for once make a promise that can be kept and will not fob us off &mdash; because I will be back again in another six weeks or another two months until this blessed committee finally discovers the basic skill of literacy, writes its report, completes it and manages to discover photo-copying machines to distribute it to those of us who have waited for far too long and far too patiently for a basic, fundamental piece of administrative detail to be straightened out.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.  I have about five minutes left.  If any of my colleagues wish to comment I would be delighted to hear them.</P>

      <P>I regret that Senator Ryan has found it necessary to raise this matter again.  I sincerely hope that he will never find it necessary again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned to this House by my colleague, Deputy Donnellan, on 2 October an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of representatives of the Departments of Health, Environment and Social Welfare and also of health boards and local authorities was set up to examine and make recommendations on the responsibilities of health boards and local authorities for providing accommodation for homeless persons. <Col N="372" /> There are, as the Senator is aware, a lot of difficulties in interpreting the responsibilities of the health boards and the local authorities for housing in certain cases. Increasingly, for example, health boards have found a housing content in the problems they faced when dealing with homeless people.  Both the statutory and voluntary agencies have experienced difficulties in identifying the special role of health boards and local authorities in providing accommodation for homeless persons. It was therefore apparent that clear guidelines were necessary if services for the homeless were to be improved.  Such guidelines would also allow the local authorities and health boards to take decisions more quickly and meet particular problems in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The guidelines would also help agencies to focus resources in areas where service gaps have arisen.  Senator Ryan has pointed out the extraordinary difficulties in dealing with this problem in the past.  In any problem where there are extraordinary difficulties it takes a certain amount of time to try to get consensus and a report.  I appreciate the Senator's concern that the report of the committee has not yet been published.  When this matter was last raised in the House on 2 October it had been hoped that the committee would report within a month. I want to assure the House that the Minister of State, Mr. Donnellan, gave that information in all good faith because at that time the final draft of the report was being prepared and there was no reason to think that the issue of the report would be delayed any longer than a couple of weeks.  But it had to be circulated to the members of the committee and they were asked to forward their observations on the draft final report so that the final version of the report could be drawn up. A number of members indicated, when they got the draft report, that they required a further meeting of their committee before they could agree to the report.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that the people on this committee were of the highest calibre, expert in their field, experienced people both from town and country.  The <Col N="373" /> appointment of those people to that committee indicated the concern of the Government who selected them because it could be argued that a report could have been available much sooner if less busy people, people who were not involved in so many matters, were put on the committee.  I believe that the right people were put on the committee.  I believe those people are very much involved in that particular area, at health board, Department and local authority level.  My own personal view is that it is far better to wait another few weeks for a better report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I would admire a committee who give a date for the issuing of a report and then find that while they can issue a report by the date promised they could improve the report if they wait another few weeks and have another meeting.  This is exactly the position here. This committee of experts have decided to have another meeting, obviously to try to get a better report.  It is far better in the long run that the promise which my colleague, Deputy Donnellan, gave in this House some weeks ago, a promise which he gave in good faith, was not fulfilled if it meant that by fulfilling it a less-than-perfect report was going to be issued.  Nevertheless I am concerned with the delays and I am concerned that these delays should be kept to a minimum and that the publication of the report should be proceeded with as quickly as possible. <Col N="374" /> But as I have said, due to the expressed view of some committee members it was felt necessary to hold this final meeting in order to clarify the remaining issues. This meeting has been arranged for 3 December, which is only a few days away.  It is hoped that it will be possible to finalise the report at that meeting. Personally, I would not like to give a commitment that it is going to be finalised because I would like to know that these people who sit down on next Monday, if they still feel that some future little querying has to be done in order to perfect their report, that they do that rather than rush out a report in order to save face in this regard.  I can assure the House that every effort is being made to finalise the report of the committee so that the very necessary services for the homeless can be delivered in a planned and effective manner by the health boards and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would just like to reiterate that the delay is not indicative of any indifference on the part of the Department or on the part of the committee. It is quite the opposite.  It is an indication of their very deep concern about this problem.  It is an indication of the thoroughness of their investigation, the thoroughness of their work in order to have as good a report as they can humanly provide.</P>
