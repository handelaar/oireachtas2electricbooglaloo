      <P>I have notice from Senator Mark Killilea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate sanction by the Minister for Health of the appointment of staff and facilities to the Western Health Board, to enable them to open the new maternity wing for the Regional Hospital, Galway, taking into account the serious overcrowding and shortage of staff in the hospital at this time.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3, in that order.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has an important meeting at 3.30 p.m.  Accordingly, the proposition is that we should take No. 1 from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. during which the Minister will make what we hope will be a substantial contribution to the debate.  It is proposed at 3.30 to take No. 2, the Landlord and Tenant Bill, and if that is concluded before 5.30 p.m., to resume No. 1.  Since there is a matter on <Col N="290" /> the Adjournment it is proposed that Private Members' Business should be taken from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.  There will be a suspension of the sitting from 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Landlord and Tenant Bill, this is a somewhat technical Bill.  It is one on which Committee Stage could be important, and indeed it might be one on which the Opposition would like to have a separate Committee Stage debate.  I would like to inform the House that I have already apprised the Minister of this.  The Minister will be out of the country next week. He will be engaged in the Dáil on this day fortnight since the Criminal Justice Bill will then be taken in Committee.  I am not saying that as an indication that I would not be prepared to agree to a separate Committee Stage next week, but it does mean that if it is postponed until next week, the Minister who knows the Bill best would not be available and somebody else would have to be briefed in his place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The past year, I believe, marked the end of a particular era in the history of the European Community.  It should also have seen the beginning of a new growth, a new relevance, a new responsiveness. Unfortunately, events did not happen in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background is well known.  The Community has been staggering from one crisis to another for some four years now.  Its financial resources have been progressively coming closer to their legal limit.  Last year, a number of payments had in fact to be deferred to avoid this <Col N="291" /> limit being breached.  The absence of adequate financial resources meant in addition that, in recent years, there has been little or no policy development within the Community.  We are in effect still trying to respond to the changing problems and challenges of the eighties with instruments and policies drawn up in an earlier era.  The Community &mdash; temporarily I believe &mdash; lost its way over the past four years.  It was no longer seen to have the same cohesiveness, the same sense of solidarity or the same capacity to respond effectively to problems as in the past.  This, in turn, created a serious credibility gap for the EEC in all members countries.</P>
    <P>The essence of the problem is that no Community can develop, can even function effectively, unless it has adequate resources at its disposal.  The Government, in the on-going negotiations within the Community, has focussed with particular emphasis on this point.  But &mdash; and this is something overlooked in Ireland &mdash; the putting in place of new financial resources requires the unanimous consent of all member states and national parliamentary ratification.  A number of member states have set specific preconditions which, they insist, must be met before they will give their consent to a new financing system.  These preconditions concern in particular the need to adapt the Community's Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the CAP has served, and is serving, the Community extremely well.  Its principles are as valid and relevant today as the day they were drafted.  There can be no question of tinkering with them.  That is not to say, however, that the CAP, indeed as is the case with any policy, does not need to be reviewed, and adapted to changing circumstances, from time to time.  The present situation, for instance, when the Community consumption of milk and milk products is estimated at something over 80 million tonnes, while production last year stood at some 103 million tonnes, clearly creates stresses and distortions. We accept, therefore, as any realistic, objective person would, that <Col N="292" /> imbalances of this kind, springing from a structural surpluses situation, have to be put right.</P>
    <P>Within this overall context, the Government's firm emphasis throughout the negotiations has been to ensure that a solution to any Community problem must take into account the legitimate interests of the various member states.  A mechanism designed to respond to a particular problem, does not, in my view, constitute a solution if it imposes a disproportionate burden on any one member state.  The proposed super-levy on milk production, if applied to this country, would constitute such a disproportionate burden.  As such, it is not acceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Government have presented, in an objective and fully documented manner, our case for an exemption from the super-levy. We have indeed been pursuing one of the most intense and continuous diplomatic campaigns on this issue which has ever been carried out by the State.  The Taoiseach late last year, undertook, accompanied on many occasions by myself, a programme of meetings with the leaders of the nine other member states.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and myself have taken every possible opportunity to present our case to our opposite numbers. Last July, I called home our ambassadors in Community countries for a special conference in which I outlined for them the details of our negotiating strategy and the central role I envisaged for them within it.  Their lobbying for, and presentation of, our case, as well as their detailed analyses of the policy positions and movements of other member states, have been an invaluable help in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our position on the super-levy going into the Brussels European Council on 19 March remains as it was at the Athens Council.  Our demand, which we believe is reasonable, fair and historically and statistically justifiable, is for an exemption for the four year duration of the levy. I would emphasise that our case is not a sectoral one.  Milk in Ireland is responsible, uniquely within the Community, for <Col N="293" /> some 9 per cent of GNP.  Our case, therefore, falls clearly into the category of a vital overall national economic interest. It is in this context that it is, and will continue to be, pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should say finally that, while there is still an unprecedently tough and sensitive negotiating period in front of us, our partners have shown considerable understanding of, and appreciation for, the particular circumstances of our case.  This was indeed reflected to some degree in the final offer made to us at Athens, even though this only went a certain way to meet our needs.  The task now is to turn this general understanding and goodwill into a concrete solution for Ireland at the Brussels Summit.  I know that the Government have the full support of this House in pursuing this objective.</P>
    <P>I have dealt briefly above with two of the central elements of the current negotiations, new own resources and the adaptation of the CAP in the milk area. But the negotiations are, of course, much wider than this.  The Stuttgart European Council in June 1983, which launched this stage of the negotiations, spoke of providing &ldquo;a solid basis for the further dynamic development of the Community over the remainder of the present decade&rdquo;, with a view to achieving the relaunch of the Community.  Brave sentiments indeed, and ones we would all agree with; but sentiments which will remain just that unless we can reach agreement in the very near future on not just milk but on the many distortions within the common agricultural policy including, and in particular, the existence of MCAs and the continuing high level of cheap cereal substitute imports into the Community.</P>
    <P>We need in particular, as I indicated earlier, to give the Community the financial security to plan ahead, to develop and, at the lowest end of the scale, to avoid the recurring fear of running out of funds for even its on-going policies.  In this regard, I welcome the Commission's recent proposal to double the present VAT ceiling of 1 per cent.  We need also, and I will come to this in a moment, to develop further our structural funds and <Col N="294" /> to begin to put new and imaginative policies in place.</P>
    <P>We require above all in Europe today, however, to have the courage to take a giant qualitative step forward.  We are all depressed, and understandably so, at endless discussions on issues such as budgetary imbalances and budgetary discipline. The Community needs to think beyond its present crisis, to have again a sense of creativity and innovation, to put it at its simplest, to be relevant and responsive once more to the needs of its peoples, especially the young and unemployed. In the context in which it was established, the Community was &mdash; and remains &mdash; a remarkable achievement. But achievements, however far-reaching, must be built on and not rested upon. This is the challenge we must take up and overcome later this month in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The immense importance to Ireland of the Common Agricultural Policy and the related issue of future Community financing is clear.  For this reason public and media attention has naturally concentrated on these aspects of the post-Stuttgart discussions.  Other aspects, which are equally central to any successful &ldquo;new departure&rdquo; for the Community, have not received the same degree of public attention.  I am thinking, for instance, of the important ongoing work on a range of possible new Community policies designed to improve the Community's industrial competitiveness, particularly in the new high technology sectors.  We must successfully match our competitors in these vital growth areas of modern economies, like research and development biotechnology and telecommunications, if we are to create new job opportunities in the Community for the future.  We are pleased, therefore, that it has been possible to reach agreement on the ESPRIT information technology programme, and we will give our support to the development of other new policies which can help to create jobs and provide a more balanced development of the Community in all areas of economic activity.</P>
    <P>Naturally, together with other smaller member states, we are concerned that the benefits of new policies should also <Col N="295" /> be available to small and medium-sized firms which make up a large part of our own economy and are also important in the economies of the larger states.</P>
    <P>The Community's structural funds, the Regional Fund, Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund, are important instruments for helping the future development of the Community and of its member states.  A review of the Social Fund was successfully completed in June 1983.  One important result of this is that 75 per cent of Social Fund resources are now allocated for programmes for young people under 25, a measure that we, with our large numbers of young people in the work force, were happy to support.  We are also pleased that Ireland has been designated one of a number of superpriority regions on which 40 per cent of Social Fund expenditure will now be concentrated.</P>
    <P>A review of the Regional Fund is being undertaken at present and we are carefully considering the implications of this review for Ireland.  The Commission proposals are quite complex and would, if implemented, result in the abolition of the distinction between the quota and non-quota sections of the fund.  It seems likely that the review will take several more months of detailed consideration before it will be completed.</P>
    <P>In my introductory remarks, I mentioned the intense debate on the Common Agricultural Policy which has taken place, in the special negotiations, since the Stuttgart European Council in June 1983.  In addition to this, Senators are of course aware of the detailed discussions which are presently taking place regarding the agricultural prices for the marketing year 1984-85.  It would, I feel, be appropriate, therefore, to refer briefly to the main features of the agricultural prices agreement for the marketing year which is now drawing to a conclusion, and to other important developments for Ireland in 1984 resulting from the CAP.</P>
    <P>The Commission's price proposals for agricultural products were presented to the Council on 23 December 1982, though most of the substantial discussions took place early in 1983, the year <Col N="296" /> which we are presently reviewing.  While these discussions were difficult, agreement was eventually reached by the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 16-17 May 1983.  This provided for price increases across virtually the whole range of products of particular interest to Ireland, giving an average increase of 9½ per cent, including and, eventually, a total adjustment of the &ldquo;green rate&rdquo; for the Irish pound of 5 per cent.  In addition, and in spite of some opposition during negotiations, both the calf and suckler cow premiums were extended.  The annual value of these premiums comes to some £47 million.</P>
    <P>While below the average level of price increase, that secured for milk nevertheless represented an extra 6.3 p per gallon for the dairying industry.  Increased FEOGA financing was obtained both for school milk and the consumer subsidy on butter which, in a full year, will benefit this country by some £2½ million.  The price increases obtained for the 1983-84 marketing year will result in approximately £190 million extra for the Irish farm sector.  Given the stringency of the circumstances in which they were negotiated, this result was very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The difficult negotiations which followed the Commission's agricultural price proposals last year provided the Government with the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to the agricultural sector and our determination to ensure the continued development of the industry.  This is the same commitment which guided the Government in the course of the critical debate on the adaptation of the Common Agricultural Policy in the period between the Stuttgart and Athens European Councils, and since.  This is the same commitment which makes the Commission's price proposals for the marketing year 1984-85 difficult for the Government to accept, even though we are all aware of the financial crisis within the Community.</P>
    <P>In response to this critical situation the Commission implemented a number of economy measures in the course of 1983. In the agricultural sector, the most important of these involved the suspension <Col N="297" /> of the system of advance payments of export refunds and a delay in payment of the live premium on sheepmeat until the beginning of 1984.</P>
    <P>As Senators are, of course, aware, further economy measures were introduced by the Commission earlier this year. These were designed to achieve savings in the day-to-day operation of the CAP. The measures in question ranged from a 1 per cent cut in the standard interest rate payable for intervention to a four month deferral of payments for intervention purchases in the milk, beef and cereal sectors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, payments to Ireland in 1983 under the guarantee section &mdash; which exists to support market prices &mdash; amounted to £441 million, as compared to £345 million in 1982.  Payments under the guidance section of this Fund &mdash; in respect of various structural projects &mdash; totalled £62 million in 1983, an increase of £3 million over the 1982 figure.</P>
    <P>The year under review, 1983, was a particularly active one in the fisheries area.  Following the intensive efforts which had been made at the end of 1982 to achieve a common fisheries policy, a compromise was eventually found in the first weeks of 1983.  However serious difficulties arose over the settling of the levels of the total allowable catches and member states quotas for 1984.  Eleven months of difficult and intensive negotiations, from January 1983, were necessary to secure, on 14 December 1983, the agreement in Council on the 1983 total allowable catches and individual member states' quotas for 1983.  Agreement was also reached in December 1983 on the difficult issue of North Sea herring, quotas in Greenland waters and on the EEC Norway and EEC-Canada Fishery Agreements.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved at the December 1983 Fisheries Council raised hopes that agreement might be secured early in 1984 on the total allowable catches and quotas for this year.  While I appreciate that we are, today, reviewing 1983 only, I feel that I should touch briefly on the outcome of the Fisheries Council of 31 <Col N="298" /> January 1984.  In particular the early agreement achieved at that Council on catches and quotas puts, I feel, the common fisheries policy on a more assured basis and removes doubts and uncertainties from Community fishermen.  Nationally we were particularly pleased by the outcome of the Council as we secured, <i>inter alia,</i> an increase of 5,300 tonnes of western stock mackerel over our 1983 quota and an undertaking for an investigation of, and proposals to remedy, the market situation in herring.</P>
    <P>I should also like to congratulate, in this regard, my colleague Deputy Paddy O'Toole, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, for his efforts in defending Irish interests in the course of the negotiations on the 1983 and 1984 catches and quotas.</P>
    <P>In the period under review the outlook for the Community in terms of the economic and institutional problems which had to be faced may appear to have been uniformly gloomy.  However, on a number of fronts there were positive developments. The continued interest in European Union was demonstrated by two developments &mdash; the signing of the Solemn Declaration on European Union at Stuttgart on 19 June 1983 and the progress through the European Parliament of the draft Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration which was the result of an initiative taken by Foreign Minister Genscher of the Federal Republic of Germany and Foreign Minister Colombo of Italy reflects the view of successive Irish Governments that closer political integration must be based on greater economic convergence.  The objective of the declaration is to advance European Union.  It outlines the steps which should be taken by the Community towards that end in the field of overall economic strategy and regional and social policy.  The text also sets out ways and means of improving the system of European Political Co-operation.  The adoption of the Solemn Declaration was a reaffirmation of the ideals which inspired the founders of the Communities and by signing at Stuttgart the Taoiseach and myself as Minister for Foreign Affairs joined in that reaffirmation.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament's proposed <Col N="299" /> new Treaty on European Union was adopted in a preliminary form in September 1983.  The final text of the draft treaty was adopted by the Parliament in February of this year.  The text of an accompanying resolution instructs the President of the Parliament to submit the draft treaty to the parliaments and governments of member states.  This important initiative by the Parliament provides us with a suggested model for the development of the European Union.  It will not doubt be the subject of wide-ranging discussion in the coming months leading up to the elections to the European Parliament, as well as in the longer term.  These elections will take place in Ireland, as the House is aware, on Thursday, 14 June and throughout all member states from 14-17 June.</P>
    <P>Ireland has frequently stated its political commitment to the enlargement of the Community.  We believe that the accession of Spain and Portugal will strengthen the Community at a time when Europe has an increasingly important contribution to make to diminishing international tension.  We welcome the prospect of enlargement because we think it will give new impetus to a Community too often seen as being beleaguered by internal difficulties.  While we should not ignore the reality and gravity of these problems, we should not be overwhelmed by them.  Although the prospect of enlargement makes the need for their solution &mdash; and in particular, an increase in the EEC's own resources &mdash; more pressing, it also offers hope for the future.  For enlargement will prove that the Community is capable of progress and development; and it will provide an opportunity for member states to renew their commitment to the fundamental political and economic aims of the EEC.</P>
    <P>We are therefore pleased to note the progress in the accession negotiations with both Spain and Portugal in 1983. Substantial agreement has been reached, in the negotiations with Portugal, on the approximation of laws, environment and consumer protection; while, in the case of Spain, the negotiations on Ceuta and Melilla, tobacco monopolies and Euratom <Col N="300" /> have been substantially concluded, and a number of aspects of the external relations dossier have been settled.  We feel that it is imperative to build on this achievement, so that further progress can be made on the outstanding chapters &mdash; which include such important issues as agriculture, fisheries and social affairs &mdash; with a view to concluding the negotiations by the end of September this year, in accordance with the growing political commitment to that date among the member states.</P>
    <P>On 3 February 1983, the Commission presented its opinion on the future status of Greenland, which formed the basis of subsequent negotiations on the question of the terms that should govern Greenland's withdrawal from the Community. These negotiations were concluded successfully at the Foreign Affairs Council last month when agreement was reached on Greenland's future relations with the Community.  Under this agreement, Greenland will be associated with the Community as an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT) which will entitle it to certain preferential access to Community markets but, unlike other countries with this status, it will not receive aid from the European Development Fund.  Community trawlers will continue to have access to Greenland's waters and Greenland will be granted free access to Community markets for its fisheries products.  Greenland will also receive 26.5 million ECUs in respect of the EEC's fishing rights in its waters, and has given assurances that it will abide by the terms of the North Atlantic Salmon Convention, which provides for the conservation of salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Ireland has frequently expressed its support for the measures proposed by the Commission &mdash; both in its report of March 1983 and in its subsequent amplifications &mdash; in response to the Greek Government's memorandum of 19 March 1982 seeking special terms from the Community.  These proposals cover agricultural development, infrastructure and environment.  Ireland's support for Greece on this issue is inspired by our belief that the eradication of underdevelopment and the promotion of convergence <Col N="301" /> of member states' economies are aims which are fundamental to the Community. We look forward to registering further progress on this issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Community's external relations, the period under review has seen a continuation of the international recession which has placed some strains on the world trading system.  Ireland, as a small open economy benefited from the Community and its major trading partners in general, refraining from a protectionist response to these strains.  During 1983 much work was devoted to following up the decisions reached at the GATT Ministerial in November 1982 including the establishment of a new GATT Committee on Agriculture, the work of which will, of course, be of considerable importance to Ireland because of its implications for the future operation of the CAP.</P>
    <P>This is not to suggest that no difficulties were experienced during the period.  The Seanad will remember that in January 1983 the United States concluded a contract for a subsidised sale of 1 million tonnes of wheat flour to Egypt and at the end of July it also announced the subsidised sale of 24,000 tonnes of dairy products to Egypt.  The Community views these sales as infringing GATT rules and has been using GATT channels to make its dissatisfaction felt and to seek redress.  The Government will continue to seek to ensure that the Community's right to a fair share of the world market in agricultural produce, which was reaffirmed in the Tokyo Round negotiations, is maintained.</P>
    <P>Another problem has arisen in relation to Community exports of special steels to the United States.  Again, the Seanad will recall that in July 1983 the United States decided unilaterally to increase tariffs and impose quantitative restrictions on its imports of special steel products.  The Community argued that the United States measures were not compatible with the commitments made at the Williamsburg Summit on 28-31 May 1983 to resist protectionism and requested prompt consultations in the framework of the GATT, to define the injury suffered by the EEC and to request compensation. <Col N="302" /> The negotiations, however, did not bear fruit, with the result that the Community has notified the GATT of a series of retaliatory measures against certain products imported from the United States.  The measures entered into force on 1 March 1984 and will apply for one year.</P>
    <P>The decline in the Community's balance of trade with Japan was also a matter of serious concern in this period and relations with Japan continue to be dominated by the Community's unacceptable large trade deficit.  It will be appreciated that for those member states which manufacture motor cars, television sets and goods which are in direct competition with Japanese goods, this remains a sensitive matter.  The Community has been pursuing a two-track policy: on the one hand, to limit exports from Japan of certain sensitive products and, on the other, to encourage the Japanese to open their market to Community exports.  I am happy to report that progress has been made on both these fronts during the period under review.  In January 1983, the Japanese announced a series of measures aimed at removing certain non-tariff barriers to imported goods and in February agreed to restrain exports of certain sensitive products, and a further package of market liberalisation measures was announced in October last.  Although much remains to be done to correct the trade imbalance I am nevertheless encouraged by the steps which the Japanese Government have taken in this respect.  Japan has shown growing understanding of the concern with which their trade surplus is viewed by the Community and I am encouraged that this augurs well for future trade relations between the Community and Japan.</P>
    <P>Relations between the EEC and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) continued to expand in 1983 and the fourth Ministerial meeting between the EEC and ASEAN took place in Bangkok on 24-25 March 1983. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, represented Ireland at the meeting.  In discussions on the economic and financial situation of the world, the Community and ASEAN agreed that the <Col N="303" /> present difficulties demonstrated the economic interdependence which existed among all members of the international community.  The two sides reiterated and stressed the need to maintain liberal and open trading conditions and recognised the dangers of recourse to protectionism. The Ministers welcomed the continued development of co-operation between ASEAN and the Community under the Co-operation Agreement as reflected in the rapid expansion and diversification of activities.  A particular importance was attached to co-operation in the fields of science and technology, insurance, trade promotion, training and development co-operation.  I am convinced that these activities have brought about a new momentum in relations between the Community and ASEAN.</P>
    <P>A co-operation agreement between the EEC and the member countries of the Andean Pact &mdash; Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela &mdash; was signed in Cartagena, Colombia, on 17 December 1983.  Ireland was also represented at this ceremony by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  The agreement provides a new framework for co-operation between the Community and the Andean Pact countries.  It will facilitate the development of trade, industrial co-operation and technology transfers and will allow for better coordination of EEC financed actions in the Andean Pact countries under the non-associated developing countries programme. The agreement also provides for the establishment of a joint co-operation committee which will meet annually to review progress and facilitate the implementation of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The period under review also saw the opening of negotiations for a third convention to govern relations between the Community and the developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP countries).  The Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) at its meeting on 19 September 1983 adopted the Community's opening mandate for the negotiations. The mandate aims to give a new impetus to relations between the Community and the ACP states in the convention <Col N="304" /> which is to follow the Lomé I and Lomé II Conventions.  It also states that the new convention should seek to provide for more self-reliant and self-sustained development of the economies of the ACP states with special attention being paid to the least developed countries and the poorest sections of the population. Agricultural and rural development and efforts towards food security are priority areas.  The Community also proposes to initiate a dialogue with the ACP countries on their development policies in order to increase the effectiveness of the various sectoral policies.  The mandate also expresses the desire of the Community to consider the issue of human rights in the negotiations.  The opening meeting in the negotiations for a new EEC-ACP Convention took place in Luxembourg on 6-7 October 1983.  The ACP side set out their basic principles at this meeting.</P>
    <P>These include a desire for mutual respect for the sovereignty of contracting parties, true equality of partnership and respect for overall development strategies and priorities.  They are also seeking joint management, joint control and joint decision-making in all the key areas of co-operation.  The ACP states are also aiming to ensure &ldquo;congruency&rdquo;, or balance, between the objectives the convention seeks to achieve and the volume of resources it actually provides.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are continuing with both sides elaborating their positions and signature of the new convention is expected to take place during the Irish Presidency in the latter half of this year.</P>
    <P>During 1983 a broad range of issues was discussed in the development co-operation framework, and progress was made in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>In regard to hunger in the world, the programme endeavours to combat the problem of food shortages in developing countries.  In addition to the provision of food aid, it also works to increase agricultural production in developing countries. This integrated approach hopes to avoid the pitfalls of dependence which may arise from the provision of food aid alone, which in many cases can be seen to act as a disincentive to domestic productivity. <Col N="305" /> During this period the Council reviewed progress in the Community's food strategy discussions with Kenya, Mali, Rwanda and Zambia where progress was thought to be generally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Council &mdash; in July &mdash; also gave approval to the implementation of the Special Programme to Combat Hunger in the World, for which 50 million ECU had been provided in the 1983 budget. The Management Committee of the Special Programme which met at the end of 1983, approved the projects for funding under the special programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the publication in March of a Commission paper entitled &ldquo;Food Aid for Development&rdquo; which was forwarded to the Council by Commissioner Pisani.  This paper situated food aid in the context of the problem of world hunger and concluded that existing instruments should be adapted to meet the needs of the developing countries more effectively.  A discussion of the Commission paper was held in the Council in November and a resolution was approved on food aid policy, aimed at giving a greater degree of flexibility to the aid, and at improving the food security of the beneficiary countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland regretted that the Common Fund &mdash; which has been open for signature at the UN Headquarters in New York since October 1980 &mdash; did not enter into force during this period.  The conditions for entry into force of the Common Fund still remained to be fulfilled at the end of December 1983, when it had been signed by only 110 states and ratified by 67, accounting for less than 50 per cent of the fund's capital.</P>
    <P>As regards the North-South dialogue, Ireland, together with the other member states, viewed developments in this area during the period under review as representing a modest achievement.  The period was dominated, of course, by the preparation for UNCTAD VI, the conference itself, and its aftermath.</P>
    <P>UNCTAD VI was held in Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983.  In the various fora which discussed the conference, including the Council (Development) in November, the general consensus has <Col N="306" /> been that UNCTAD VI, while not meeting the relatively ambitious goals of the developing countries, represents, nonetheless, modest progress, with concrete, if limited proposals in a number of areas. The general feeling was also that reasonable progress was made later in the year at the 38th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York, on the proposed launching of global negotiations with March 1984 set as the target date for taking a decision.</P>
    <P>Progress achieved in European Political Co-operation was generally satisfactory during the period under review.  The Solemn Declaration on European Union, about which I have already spoken, performed the useful task of bringing together and formalising in a single document, a number of practical measures which have been introduced in recent years in order to improve the effectiveness and coherence of political co-operation.</P>
    <P>Various aspects of the situation in the Middle East continued to preoccupy the Ten in 1983 and figured frequently on the agenda of European Political Co-operation. Foreign forces were still in occupation of much of the territory of Lebanon and on 21-22 March 1983 the European Council stressed the urgent need for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and PLO forces.  The European Council statement expressed concern at the lack of progress towards an Arab-Israeli peace settlement and reiterated the elements which the Ten believed such a settlement should encompass.</P>
    <P>In the statement of 21-22 March 1983 the Ten emphasised that above all the time had come for Israel to show that it stood ready for genuine negotiations on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, in the first place by refraining from enlarging existing settlements in the occupied territories or creating new ones.  The Ten stated again their view that the settlements were contrary to international law and a major and growing obstacle to peace.</P>
    <P>Lebanon was again the subject of a statement by the Ten on 12 September in which they called for a ceasefire in the fighting which had broken out following <Col N="307" /> the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The need for a cessation of sectarian violence and the beginning of a process of national reconciliation was stressed. Serious fighting between rival Palestinian groups in Northern Lebanon was mentioned by the Ten in a statement on 9 November when they expressed their preoccupation at the intolerable sufferings and losses of human lives, notably among the civilian population of the area, both Palestinian and Lebanese.</P>
    <P>In the Presidency's address to the 38th Session of the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Greece said that in the interest of the search of peace, the Ten asked Israel to abandon its policy of gradual annexation and of unilaterally creating new facts in the occupied territories, in particular its settlement policy which was contrary to international law and a major and growing obstacle to peace efforts.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haralambopoulos also said that the Ten strongly deplored the lack of progress towards the solution of the Iran-Iraq conflict, which constituted a serious threat to the stability of the region and to international security and entailed heavy suffering for the two peoples involved.  The Ten appealed urgently to the two belligerents to spare the civilian population and to abide by all international conventions applicable in time of war.  In this respect the Ten welcomed the report of the United Nations mission which visited areas subjected to attacks. The Ten confirmed their readiness, if requested by both parties, to participate in the efforts aimed at restoring peace in the area.</P>
    <P>Meeting in European Political Co-operation on 27 February 1984, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten reacted to the latest outbreak of violence in Lebanon with an appeal for an effective and durable cease fire.  They expressed the desire to see a UN force take up position in Beirut with the agreement of all concerned parties on the basis of a Security Council mandate.  Such a development is now unlikely in the immediate future following the veto of the French draft resolution in the Security Council.  The Ten <Col N="308" /> repeated their view that all foreign forces should leave Lebanon and called for a renewal of the reconciliation process begun at the Geneva conference in autumn 1983.</P>
    <P>Ministers also referred to the intensification of the Iran-Iraq conflict and called for compliance by both sides with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  They appealed to Iran and Iraq to observe the international rules and conventions concerning the protection of the civilian populations and the treatment of prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>East-West relations in 1983 continued to be difficult and tense.  The Ten continue to believe that a genuine and sincere dialogue is now required to promote a climate of stability and predictability in East-West relations.  There is a pressing need for the United States and the Soviet Union to halt the deterioration in their political relationship and to replace the current mood of challenge and confrontation by a process of dialogue leading to agreement.  Following the apparent suspension in December by the Soviet Union of the Geneva talks on intermediate nuclear forces, and of the strategic arms reduction talks, in the wake of the initial deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles, the urgency for dialogue between the superpowers has become more evident.</P>
    <P>The main development in Poland in the period under review was the lifting of martial law on 22 July.  At that time the Polish Government offered an amnesty to most prisoners held in detention, as well as to Solidarity and other political activists in hiding.  Nevertheless, the Polish Government incorporated into Polish law repressive provisions which maintained the spirit of martial law.  In addition, the Polish Government in December significantly increased their powers to control potential opposition.</P>
    <P>The Ten continue to believe that only a national reconciliation which takes account of the aspirations of the Polish people can lead Poland out of its present difficulties.  They would hope that the Polish authorities will respect the provisions contained in the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document, <Col N="309" /> especially as regards trade union liberties and civil rights.  The Ten will respond positively to constructive measures by the Polish authorities aimed at liberalisation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the CSCE, the main development in 1983 was the adoption on 6 September of the Concluding Document of the Madrid Follow-up meeting of the CSCE.  The work of the meeting, which began in March 1980, proved difficult and time-consuming due largely to the deterioration in the climate of East-West relations.  Nevertheless, the Concluding Document in Ireland's view, and that of the other members of the Ten, is a balanced and substantial text.  It contains worthwhile progress on the provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.  For the first time, the principle of trade union freedom is laid down in a CSCE document. It commits participating states to ensure the rights of workers freely to establish and join trade unions and the right of trade unions freely to exercise their activities. In the area of human contacts the procedures for family reunification across frontiers were improved by mentioning for the first time a time limit &mdash; six months &mdash; within which applications should be decided upon.  The Concluding Document reaffirms the guarantee of religious freedom and the role of religious organisations in society.  The provisions relating to the rights of journalists in the participating states are further strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Madrid Concluding Document also contains the mandate for the first stage of the Conference on Confidence &mdash; and Security &mdash; Building Measures and Disarnament in Europe (CDE) which opened in Stockholm on 17 January 1984.</P>
    <P>The objective of the first stage of the CDE is to negotiate confidence &mdash; and security &mdash; building measures designed to reduce the risk of military confrontation in Europe.  It is envisaged that a further stage of the CDE would negotiate actual measures of disarmament.</P>
    <P>On the sub-continent of Latin America, probably the most significant development in recent months has been the restoration of democracy in Argentina following the elections of 30 October 1983. <Col N="310" /> The whole international community has been heartened by the energy and determination with which President Alfonsin has approached the many problems, both political and economic, which confront his country.  One can only hope that the example of Argentina will soon be followed by those of its neighbours whose records in relation to democracy and respect for basic freedoms leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>Prominent among those is Chile, whose Government, despite pressure both from within the country and internationally, appears reluctant to make any significant moves towards democracy and respect for such basic rights as the rights of public assembly, to engage in trade union activity, to freedom from arbitrary detention and freedom from torture.  The international concern at the situation in Chile has been once again manifested by the adoption in December 1983 of a UN resolution on the situation on human rights and fundamental freedoms in that country.  Ireland along with a number of our partners of the Ten was among the co-sponsors of this resolution.</P>
    <P>Central America continues to be the centre of international attention.  The plight of the El Salvadorean people is particularly acute.  They are the victims of a civil war which still drags on, four years after its commencement.  More than half a million people have been forced to leave their homes, and those who remain are afflicted by the ever-permanent terrors of war including, regrettably, murders by squads operating apparently within the framework of the regular army.  An electoral process will take place on 25 March to choose a President; the opposition left-wing guerrilla forces will not be participating.  I hope the new President, whoever he may be, will take a decisive initiative to bring peace and reconciliation to his country.  I am glad to note that Nicaragua appears to be taking steps to uphold its commitment to a pluralist society and to free elections &mdash; these are now scheduled for 4 November next. I hope that the government will permit candidates of all political persuasions to present themselves at those elections.</P>
    <P>In Asia, Ireland and its partners in the <Col N="311" /> Ten continue to express their concern at the lack of progress towards a comprehensive political solution to the Afghanistan problem.  In March 1983 in the joint communique issued at the end of the EEC-ASEAN &mdash; Association of South East Asia Nations &mdash; Ministerial Meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten joined with the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN in deploring the continuing presence of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the refusal of the Soviet Union to heed the appeals of the international community for a withdrawal of its troops.</P>
    <P>Addressing the UN on behalf of the Ten, the Greek Foreign Minister stressed that the key requirement of a solution to the problem was the withdrawal of Soviet troops.  Such a withdrawal and a negotiated settlement would permit Afghanistan's independence and non-aligned status to be restored, would allow the Afghanistan people to exercise fully their right to self-determination and enable the Afghan refugees to return home in safety and honour.</P>
    <P>The Ten supported General Assembly Resolution 38/29 on the situation in Afghanistan.  The resolution was passed with 116 countries voting in favour and 20 against.</P>
    <P>To mark the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan, the Ten issued a joint statement on 27 December condemning &ldquo;the continuing violation of human rights and the attacks against Afghan civilians by Soviet forces in their efforts to suppress the Afghan people's determination of their country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Recently, there have been several happenings in Southern Africa which, hopefully, will contribute to the peace and stability of the region and will facilitate the long delayed independence of Namibia.</P>
    <P>On 29 January South Africa and Mozambique agreed to begin to normalize their diplomatic relations.  For years, South Africa has accused Mozambique of providing bases for attacks against its territory by the banned Africa National Congress.  Accordingly, South Africa has pursued a policy of destabilizing Mozambique by supporting the Mozambique <Col N="312" /> National Resistance guerrilla movement and by itself attacking targets in Mozambique. The recent agreement provides for joint working groups to discuss improved relations in economic and security matters, in tourism and in the utilisation of the hydroelectric output of the Cahora Bassa dam.  It is expected that a non-aggression pact will shortly be signed which will prohibit either country being used as a base for attacking the other.</P>
    <P>On 27 February, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten welcomed these agreements as increasing the security and stability of Southern Africa and as facilitating progress towards Namibia independence in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 435.  The Ten also expressed their willingness to help the development of a free and independent Namibia.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long supported Namibian independence and is hopeful that the recent agreements will create a climate of confidence which will cause South Africa to unblock progress towards the implementation of the UN plan for independence which is embodied in Resolution 35.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the progress which has been made in its external relations is not reflected in South Africa's internal policies.  It adopted a new constitution in November 1983 which gives very circumscribed representation in Parliament to Coloureds and Asians.  Black citizens of South Africa continue to be denied national representation.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to apartheid is based on the principle that people are equal, irrespective of their race, colour or creed. We do not accept that changes in the operation of apartheid are `reforms'; rather, Ireland continues to argue for a complete abolition of an iniquitous system.</P>
    <P>The Ten were unequivocal and immediate in their rejection of the declaration in November by the Turkish Cypriot authorities purporting to create an independent state in northern Cyprus. Ireland has always had a special interest in the problems of Cyprus, and on the day the Turkish Cypriot declaration was made the Government issued a statement rejecting the act and reaffirming Ireland's <Col N="313" /> commitment to the independence, unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus.  On 18 November the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 541 which, among other things, considered that declaration to be legally invalid, called for its withdrawal, called upon all states not to recognise the declaration and called upon those concerned to cooperate with the Secretary General of the United Nations in his mission of good offices.  Full implementation of that resolution by the parties concerned is in Ireland's view the best way forward out of the present <i>impasse.</i>  The immediate priority must be a rescinding of the purported declaration of independence.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed the major developments in the Community during 1983.  I have also tried to put before the House the most important developments with which the Community had dealt since that period.  As Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency in less than four months' time, I think that there is a need to examine closely our position in the Community following the rather traumatic experiences of the recent past.  I feel there is a need to guard against the development among us of a sense of isolation as we pursue our justifiable opposition to some of the proposals we have been confronted with.  Indeed such an attitude would be quite detrimental to our whole perception of our Community membership and to the pursuit of our interests within that Community.</P>
    <P>On the milk super-levy issue, we have gained a tremendous amount of sympathy and understanding for Ireland's special position.  The Government have tried to build on this sympathy and understanding with, I believe, some success. However, we must also be ready to look beyond this issue in the recognition of the benefits that membership of the European Community has brought to Ireland. The quite astonishing diversification of our export market towards the member states is one instance.  The fundamental changes the Common Agriculture Policy has brought to the agriculture scene in this country is perhaps the most dramatic example of the impact of the Community on our lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Apart from the purely economic advantages we have gained from membership of the Community there has been a change in our national outlook. We have become much more aware of our place in the international community and our voice is strengthened by the role we play in the economic and political affairs of Europe.</P>
    <P>I would conclude that enlightened self-interest demands that we should continue to be fully Community-minded and positive in our membership.  The Treaty of Rome, the foundation stone of the Community, represents best the interests of the smaller, less-developed member states.  Any radical departure from the principles laid down in that Treaty would have the gravest implications for the Community &mdash; and ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must thank the Minister for coming in today and giving a very candid and informative description of what did and did not happen in the EEC during 1983.  In fact, I also feel the document he has read out gives us very little hope for the future of the EEC. Whereas the statement was very wide-ranging I was disturbed that one of the main problems we have in the EEC at present and a problem which relates to Ireland more than to any other country, the situation regarding unemployment, particularly the unemployment of young people, was not mentioned in his speech. There are a number of items mentioned which have relevance in the employment situation such as the effects of CAP, the effects of the super-levy and the effects of the deferring of payments.  Nevertheless in a 30 page speech there is not one page relating to employment.  If we are dealing with what happened last year in the EEC, surely employment must be one of the major factors we have to take into account.  From the very beginning there is a sense in his speech that things did not go well and it is just as well to admit that that did happen last year.  He mentioned that the Community staggered from crisis to crisis and basically that there is no future for the EEC until such time as we get the finances of the EEC into a workable situation whereby from <Col N="315" /> year to year rather than from month to month we know where we are going.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that there were little or no policy developments within the EEC last year.  There could be very few policy developments since most of the time was spent in argument as to where the money would come from.  In a sense we are arguably talking about an organisation or a group of countries which, in bankers' terms, would not be permitted to continue in existence and it is sincerely to be hoped that in 1984 more progress will be made in terms of providing the funds which are necessary to continue the EEC as a viable unit.  He mentioned that we are taking over the Presidency in four months' time and I sincerely hope that by the time the Presidency is taken over some of the major problems in regard to finance will be resolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned, towards the end of his speech, that we in Ireland in the last 12 months have felt a sense of isolation and that we should not let this sense of isolation grow, that we have gained many benefits from the EEC over the past number of years.  There is absolutely no doubt that this is true.  However, within the EEC over the past 12 months because of economic and social factors not alone has there been a sense of isolation growing up in Ireland, there has been a sense of isolation growing up in other countries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sense of European Union which we all want to see achieved has been put further and further away from us.  There has been a tendency in the stronger countries in Europe to feel that they should not support the weaker countries and there has been a tendency in the weaker countries to feel that the stronger countries, because of the lack of funds or because of lack of commitment, are now prepared to go back to the old nationalistic and isolationist stances that existed before the EEC came into being.  I feel the Minister could have spoken much more about the unemployment problem. There is absolutely no doubt that in Ireland we feel the full brunt of the EEC policies which are militating against us in <Col N="316" /> creating more employment.  We have a huge number of people unemployed in the under 25 age group.  Unfortunately, from the statistics that are issuing from Eurostat and various Departments which issue statistics, it would appear as if we in Ireland have the lowest rate of unemployment, at 19.4 per cent, in the EEC. This does not take into account that our statistics are not compiled on the same statistical basis as in other countries.  We do not consider people who have just left school, who have not yet signed on for unemployment benefit, to be unemployed, whereas in fact they are.  We do not consider that there are a number of other considerations that have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Minister was right in suggesting that the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy and the fight for the Common Agricultural Policy is a major issue that we must pursue and we must win.  To take the issue on a very broad spectrum sometimes tends to hide the effect on a local economy.  To go back to a local economy such as the one in the south-east I take Avonmore Creamery as an instance and the effect that the super-levy would have on the Avonmore region in regard to milk intake.</P>

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The proposals in this Bill are for the most part of a rather technical nature.  The need for the Bill arises from a judgment of the Supreme Court that was given in November 1980, in the case of <i>Gilsenan. v. Foundary House Investments Limited and Rathmines Properties Limited.</i>  That judgment, which is so far unreported, bears on the determination of the rent that is payable under a renewal <Col N="317" /> of a ground rent lease, or a reversionary lease as it is called.  The judgment amounted to a finding that the existing provisions of the law for determining such a rent are unworkable.  The background is as follows.</P>
      <P>Ground rent tenants have, in general, the right either to buy out the ground landlord and acquire the fee simple, or to renew their leases for 99-year terms.  The rent that is payable under the renewed lease represents what one may call an updated ground rent, that is to say it is related to the current open-market rent of the property in question.  In consequence it is usually very different from the rent payable under the previous lease, granted very many years ago.  The legislation provides a formula which relates the new rent to the rent which, in the opinion of the court, a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the land comprised in the reversionary lease.  The new lease is, as I have said, for a 99-year term.  The Supreme Court, in arriving at the judgment I have mentioned, had had evidence that freely negotiated leases of that kind are no longer entered into, in other words that a lessor would not now willingly grant a lease for a term as long as 99 years at a fixed rent.  Without provision for rent reviews, no such willing lessor is to be found nor can any such rent be determined, and on that basis the court found that the formula is inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two main consequences follow from that judgement.  The first is that the courts are unable to determine the terms of a reversionary lease and such terms cannot be fixed if the parties themselves cannot agree on the terms.  The other is that &mdash; again in the absence of agreement between the parties &mdash; a ground rent tenant who wants to buy out the fee simple rather than get a reversionary lease cannot implement his right of purchase unless his lease has more than 15 years to run.  The reason for this is that, where the lease has less than 15 years to run, or where it has already expired, one of the considerations &mdash; perhaps the most important consideration &mdash; that bears on determination of the purchase price is the <Col N="318" /> rent that would be reserved under a reversionary lease.  Since as matters now stand that rent cannot be determined except by agreement between the parties, the purchase price of the fee simple likewise cannot be determined except by agreement in the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The judgement of the Supreme Court was to the effect that these provisions of the law had come to lack relevance to current market conditions.  The obvious change that is necessary in order to permit the rent under a reversionary lease to be related to current market conditions is, of course, to introduce provision for reviews of the rent payable under such a lease.  Consultation has established that there is fairly general agreement among those professionally concerned with the matter that the review period should be five years, that is to say, that the rent payable under a reversionary lease should be open to review, at the instance of either lessor or lessee, at intervals of not less than five years.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes a change of this kind for future reversionary leases.  The review period of five years is the same as the Bill proposes a change of this kind for future reversionary leases.  The review period of five years is the same as the review period that already applies to the rent payable when a different kind of tenancy &mdash; namely an occupational tenancy &mdash; is being renewed by intervention of the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill proposes that rent reviews at intervals of not less than five years should also apply in the case of any sporting lease that is granted in the future.  The law as it stands &mdash; in section 5 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971 &mdash; already contains limited provision for reviews of the rent payable under sporting leases which, like reversionary leases, run for terms of 99 years.  Where the terms of a sporting lease are fixed by the court the rent is subject to review, at the option of the lessor, after 24 years and thereafter at intervals of not less than 25 years, and the rent itself is a &ldquo;fair rent&rdquo; that is determined in the light of a number of considerations.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the Supreme Court which I have mentioned was not directly concerned with the determination of rents under sporting leases.  However, it <Col N="319" /> is a possible inference from that judgment that no rent could be &ldquo;fair&rdquo; that could not be altered over such a lengthy period.  Accordingly, section 5 provides for rent review periods of not less than five years, at the instance of either lessor or lessee, in any future sporting leases whose rents fall to be fixed by the court. Existing sporting leases do not come within the scope of these proposals.  It is reasonable to take the view that interference with existing leases is not warranted in the absence of a definite indication that the terms of such leases cannot be operated.</P>
    <P>Of course, the changes that must be introduced to enable the courts to fix the rent under a reversionary lease invite the question as to why the right to a reversionary lease should not simply be abolished.  After the changes we have been discussing had been brought about, how many ground rent lessees would actually be interested in obtaining a reversionary lease, since they would be committed to the expense and trouble and uncertainty of rent reviews every few years?  Would it not be simpler to leave ground rent tenants with the single remedy, that is to buy out the fee simple, which of course they would have to do if the right to a renewed lease were abolished? The landlord and tenant code would be simplified; a step would be taken towards simplifying titles to land, and the persons concerned would be saved the expense and so on that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>This question has been considered carefully and full weight has been given to representations that have been made. The conclusion that I have reached &mdash; and that has been accepted by the Government &mdash; is that, on balance, the right to a reversionary lease should be preserved.  This is a right which some tenants will find essential in practice.  A greater number will find it preferable to purchase the fee simple and such a freedom of choice must be given some value.</P>
    <P>Provision for the grant of reversionary leases will continue to be necessary in special cases &mdash; for example, ground rent <Col N="320" /> leases made by harbour authorities &mdash; where the right of purchase does not apply.  However, the most important reason for preserving the right to a reversionary lease is the objection in principle that arises to the abolition of an existing legal right, with the consequence that the alternative right to buy out would become less a right than a matter of practical necessity, and that, perhaps, in circumstances where the necessity to buy out was a most unwelcome one for financial or other reasons.</P>
    <P>We now come to consider the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court in relation to the question of determining the price of the free simple where ground rent lessees are buying out and where their leases are expiring, or have already expired.  Arising out of that judgment it has become necessary to settle completely new provisions in the law in that regard.  As I have said, the rent that would be reserved in a &ldquo;reversionary&rdquo; lease has hitherto been the most important consideration in determining purchase price in such cases.  The introduction of five-year rent reviews under future reversionary leases raises an immediate problem as to how purchase price can be related to the rents in any objective manner. In fact this is quite impossible and a fresh approach had to be adopted.</P>
    <P>An example may bring out the difficulty. Take a case where a tenant exercises his right to get a reversionary lease before termination of his present lease and where that lease would not commence to run for more than five years &mdash; that is, where the ground rent purchaser's existing lease has more than five years to run.  In such a case no one can say what the commencing rent would be under that reversionary lease because, even if a rent is settled now it will fall to be reviewed, under the rent review proposals we have been discussing, before the lease commences to run.  Accordingly, no purchase price can be determined here and now if its determination depends upon that rent.</P>
    <P>Because of these considerations it was necessary to find some new basis for determining purchase price in these cases.  The solution that is proposed in <Col N="321" /> the Bill in subsection (4) of section 7, is that, where the purchaser's lease has expired or where a rent review is already due, the purchase price will normally be one-eighth of the current fee simple market value of the property in question, subject to the making of adjustments and allowances of the same kind as are made in determining the rent to be reserved in a reversionary lease.  The proposals are designed to reflect closely the provisions of the law as it stands in accordance with which reversionary rents fall to be determined by the courts on the basis that they be one-eighth of the open market rent of the property.  In other words, the proposed new formula maintains, in terms of a purchase price, the same stakes in the property of the ground landlord and of the ground rent lessee as the old formula provides in terms of a rent.</P>
    <P>The parallel is one that is reflected in detail in the new proposals.  Under the provisions of the law as it stands the actual rent payable under a reversionary lease excludes any rental element arising from the value of the lessee's goodwill or from any improvements that the lessee has voluntarily undertaken.  Similar exclusions are provided in the new formula in relation to purchase price.  Again, the rent under a reversionary lease is based on the rent of the property in its present use and with its existing buildings. That is to say, that rent excludes any element attributable to development value, and this is again reflected in the formula.  Finally, in so far as the existence of covenants could have a bearing on the amount either of rent or of purchase price, the proposed new formula allows for this so as to ensure that no distortion is introduced.</P>
    <P>While the rent that would be reserved in a reversionary lease is the most important consideration that bears on the determination of purchase price in a case where a ground rent lessee is buying out and where his lease is expiring, or has already expired, it is not the only consideration.  There are other matters to which regard is to be had in determining price.  Because of the importance of the changes that are being proposed, however, and for clarity and simplicity, the <Col N="322" /> existing price provisions as contained in section 17 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, are being repealed and re-enacted and the old and new provisions together are set out in full in section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators who have some familiarity with the landlord and tenant code will note that certain other changes are being proposed in section 17 of the 1978 No. 2 Act.  One such proposal is that the purchase price of the fee simple should be determined by reference to circumstances obtaining at the date the purchase application is made, rather than being left to depend &mdash; at least in some cases &mdash; on the date of a final judicial determination where price is in dispute.  The reason for the change is that the date on which price is determined could in future be a matter of greater importance than in the past, since price may be rather more liable to vary as a matter of time, and it would be fairer that the date should be a definite one.  A further change is that the new price formula is being applied not only to cases where the relevant lease is expiring or has expired but also to cases where a rent review is due within the 15 years.  The reason for this change is that where a rent review is due the price of the fee simple is influenced in the same way as if the lease were expiring.  Finally, it is proposed that, in the determination of purchase price in cases where the new formula will apply, but where there is yet some time to run to the expiration of the relevant lease, or to the rent review, as the case may be, that length of time should be taken specifically into account. This provision is in section 7 (9).</P>
    <P>Senators who look at what I may call the sliding scale provisions for price in section 7 (8) may perhaps be puzzled as to why the subsection (9) provision that I have just mentioned is not simply assimilated to the sliding scale in subsection (8).</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) represents in substance the re-enactment of the provision in section 17(6) of the 1978 No. 2 Act that provide for the determination of price according to a sliding scale.  That price depends on the length of time to run under the lease at the existing rent and <Col N="323" /> the scale goes from the lowest point &mdash; where the lease has more than 15 years to run and where the provisions for the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; maximum price apply &mdash; to the highest point, where the lease has run out or, as may be the case from now on, where a rent review is due.  However, since that &ldquo;formula&rdquo; maximum price does not apply in the case of all ground-rented properties &mdash; typically it applies in the case of the ordinary dwellinghouse that is held under a long lease &mdash; the scope of subsection (8) is likewise restricted to cases where that maximum price applies, or rather where it would apply were not the lease running out.</P>
    <P>I may mention in passing that the provisions for this &ldquo;formula&rdquo; maximum price are being re-enacted in section 7 (5). Subsection (9) on the other hand, while it also concerns cases where there is yet some time to run to expiration of the lease, or to a rent review, yet concerns cases of a different kind.  It concerns cases such as business properties where the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; maximum price does not apply.  In such cases the high point of the scale can be ascertained, the point where a lease has run out or the time for a rent review has arrived, but there is no low point.  In other words, no matter how many years there are to run on the lease of a business property, there is no &ldquo;formula&rdquo; for purchase price at the lower end of the scale.  Accordingly subsection (9) simply provides that, where the lease has run to within 15 years of expiration or of a rent review, the length of time still to run is to be taken into account in determining purchase price.</P>
    <P>What I have said so far covers in outline the main proposals in the Bill, that is, the proposals for rent reviews in reversionary leases and the proposals for a new price formula in certain cases of purchase of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>A number of ancillary proposals are contained in sections 4, 8 and 13, of which the most important &mdash; in sections 4 and 13 &mdash; are designed to cater for cases where leasehold renewal or purchase of the fee simple has been held up in consequence of the Supreme Court judgment on foot of which the main proposals <Col N="324" /> in the Bill arise.  In some such cases at least it is possible that rights of renewal or of purchase could have been carried away by the passage of time alone and without default on the part of the party concerned.  The Bill provides a further period of 12 months within which such rights may still be exercised following the coming into operation of the legislation and the removal of the difficulties that have imposed the delays.</P>
    <P>In particular, section 13 caters for any cases where a ground rent lessee, who would have preferred to buy out the fee simple, may have felt himself constrained to apply instead for a reversionary lease rather than see his lease run out &mdash; and with it, perhaps, his right of purchase. Where such proceedings have not actually been concluded the lessee is being given the option of buying out instead, subject to recoupment of the other parties' costs.  A 12-month limit is again being proposed in respect of this relief.</P>
    <P>A number of miscellaneous improvements in the landlord and tenant code are also being proposed, most of them of a rather minor nature.  There are three of these proposals that may be of sufficient importance to warrant mention now. One &mdash; in section 9 &mdash; amounts to the recognition of a new class of ground rent tenant, although the change that is proposed is rather a marginal one.  What section 9 proposes in effect is that, where a yearly tenant can prove that the buildings on his property were erected by himself or his predecessors, and where otherwise he satisfies the necessary conditions, he will be recognised as a ground rent tenant &mdash; a recognised that carries with it the right to buy out the fee simple &mdash; even though his yearly rent is not less than the rateable valuation of the property. At present the rent under a yearly tenancy must be less than the rateable valuation, on an annual basis, otherwise the tenant cannot have recognition as a ground rent tenant even in a case where he or his predecessors built on a bare site. Of course, this does not affect the position of tenants who are not in a position to establish that they did so build and for <Col N="325" /> whom the rent/valuation criterion may be essential in establishing their rights.</P>
    <P>The second change is in section 14 which proposes an amendment of section 4 of the 1980 Landlord and Tenant Act &mdash; merely to remove a minor anomaly. Section 4 of the 1980 Act, while declaring the State to be exempt from the legislation, nevertheless extends limited rights under the Act to persons to whom rights had already accrued before the State authority concerned became landlord. Such persons retain their right to a renewed tenancy, on one occasion only, and their right to compensation for any improvements already carried out.</P>
    <P>It has come to notice that an anomaly could arise in applying the provisions of section 4 of the 1980 Act in a case where one State authority took over as landlord from another State authority.  In such a case a tenant who had no rights previously could acquire them, contrary to the intentions of section 4 of the 1980 Act. Section 14 of the Bill proposes, accordingly, that the rights I have mentioned will be preserved only in a case where a State authority becomes landlord of a tenanted property in which no State authority had any previous interest as landlord.</P>
    <P>The third change is in section 15.  It is proposed that section 15 will replace section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.  Section 24 of the 1980 Act provides for rent reviews under renewed occupational tenancies and the new proposals mean that, following such a rent review, the reviewed rent will run, not from the date the reviewed rent is fixed, but from the date the rent review proceedings are commenced, provided the previous rent has run for the necessary minimum of five years.  The change is being introduced in the interest of fairness.  It could happen, for example, if protracted negotiations for a rent review were followed by protracted litigation, that a considerable time could elapse between the initiation of a rent review and the final determination of that rent on review.  The new rent review procedure that is proposed in section 15 represents my acceptance, with the approval of the Government, of the validity of <Col N="326" /> representations that have been made to me for a change of this kind.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, in section 24 of the Act of 1980, the reviewed rent could commence to run only from the date of the determination of that reviewed rent, even though that date is outside the control of either party to the tenancy.  Under the proposals in section 15 of the Bill, five years will continue to be the minimum period for which a rent will run before any alteration upon review.  Likewise, if there is dealy in initiating a review, the operation of the reviewed rent may be delayed for that reason as under the present law.  However, that operation will no longer be subject to delay simply because of procedural delays: in principle the reviewed rent will run from the date of the review notice rather than from the date the rent is finally determined, and the time for service of the review notice is being regulated accordingly.  These amended provisions are of a general character and &mdash; apart from their application to occupational tenancies &mdash; they will also apply in relation to the proposed rent reviews under future reversionary leases and sporting leases that I have described.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter that I should like to mention before I conclude. When this Bill was being debated in Dáil Éireann I found it necessary to make it clear that in my view the question of the abolition of ground rents, in the sense in which the ground rents campaigners use that expression, is one that is quite outside the scope of this Bill.  I am sure, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that this will also be readily understood by this House and that Senators will appreciate that I could not appropriately address myself to that problem in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises from a Supreme Court case of <i>Gilsenan V. Foundary House Investments Limited and Rathmines Property Limited</i> in which the difficulty in fixing rent in reversionary leases was discussed.  It was found that because no review was possible in the 99-year term it was in fact impossible to <Col N="327" /> fix the terms.  This Bill enables the court to introduce reviews and accordingly to introduce appropriate terms.  The Bill also provides similar powers in sporting leases and arising from these changes it provides methods for determination of the purchase price of the fee simple.  This can be done by arbitration.  All of these provisions in the Bill were obviously necessary and the methods of making the changes and introducing the reforms are reasonable and acceptable ones.  Certainly they will be accepted by this side of the House.  I am glad that the Minister has also taken the opportunity to deal with a number of relatively small points which were necessary and it is an ideal opportunity to get them out of the way in this Bill which is obviously a non-contentious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill which adds to the already very complex code of landlord and tenant law.  It was, as the Minister said, necessitated by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Gilsenan case.  In that case the Supreme Court found that the existing statutory mechanism for determining rent payable under a reversionary lease was unworkable. The Supreme Court was right in that the existing system is to my mind both socially and commercially irrelevant in the eighties.  It was found unworkable because in the event of renewal of such a lease for a long term it is impossible to determine the rent on the basis of the same being the current open market rent where there is no provision for rent review clauses.  In an age of inflation and of rapidly changing property uses and property values, such is understandable. The parties may agree terms but where agreement is not forthcoming the courts must step in.  Following the decision in the Gilsenan case it is quite clear that the courts are no longer willing to do so until a new mechanism is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, the second difficulty which the Minister referred to and that is the difficulty which arises for tenants who are anxious to purchase the fee simple and their leases have less than 15 years to run.  Then the purchase price <Col N="328" /> relates to the rent which would be payable under the reversionary lease.  The purchase price cannot be determined as the rent which would be payable under such a lease cannot be determined.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises one or two other important points, first that the law of landlord and tenant is extremely complex, secondly, that there is extreme and urgent need for consolidation in this area. It is interesting that this legislation is being introduced in response to a decision of our Supreme Court.  In fact, recent legislation in this area has, by and large, all been in response to decisions of the High Court or the Supreme Court.  It is time that the State should show some initiative in reforming and consolidating this area of the law.  I would like to see the Law Reform Commission getting involved in this area.  They are a very heavily-funded body who, to my mind, have been engaging themselves in examination of very obscure areas of the law and I think they would be better serving the public if they examined more relevant areas such as the law of landlord and tenant.  I fully support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

      <P>Under section 15 of the Bill where the terms of a new tenancy are fixed by the court, under Part II of the Act of 1980, the landlord or the ten-and shall be entitled to have the rent reviewed in accordance with this section. Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1980, refers to the Rent Restrictions Acts on at least seven occasions.  So, I would like briefly to give my views on this aspect, that is the Supreme Court judgment regarding the Rent Restrictions Acts.  I believe profoundly, and I gather there are eminent lawyers who feel likewise, that the Supreme Court has not the power of judicial review over the Rent Restrictions Acts which it declared in the recent past to be unconstitutional.  I had not been long elected to the Seanad when I was approached to make strong representation and protest in this regard because of the importance of the question. All my subsequent consideration of the matter has convinced me that the Supreme Court has not this power.</P>

I am saying that the Supreme Court decision is wrong in law according to some concerned people qualified to express a view on this matter. It is not a decision in accordance with the law of this country for the following reasons.  Article 43 of the Constitution gives power to the State to delimit the use of private property subject to the exigencies of the common good.  The Chief Justice, in reading the judgment of the court, stated that this was subject to qualification, namely, it must not be unjust.  I am convinced that the court is wrong in this interpretation because the Article means precisely what it states and there is no ambiguity about it.  The people ratified this Article as it reads and not as the court would wish it to read.  The court did not refer to Article 45 in its judgment. Why did it not do so?  Here is the preamble:</P>

      <P>Regarding other matters connected with this Bill, I note that its main purpose is to bring about certain changes in the law necessitated by a judgment of the Supreme Court in November 1980, in the case of <i>Gilsenan v. Foundary House Investments Limited</i> and <i>Rathmines Properties Limited.</i>  I welcome the Bill and I believe it will have a speedy passage through this House.  Consequent on the judgment the courts are unable to determine the terms of the renewed or reversionary lease.  Also, a ground rent tenant who wants to buy out the fee simple rather than get a reversionary lease cannot do so unless the lease has more then 15 years to run.</P>
      <P>The big fault in the system rejected by the Supreme Court was its weakness with regard to market conditions because of the 99-year term.  Provision in the Bill for a review period of not less than five years for both lessor and lessee should prove satisfactory.</P>

    <P>The new basis for determining purchase price, where the land is held under a lease that has expired or is held under <Col N="334" /> a rent which is subject to review but has not been made, is that the purchase price will normally be one-eighth of the current fee simple market value of the property. This is on the same lines as the existing law under which reversionary rents fall to be determined by the courts on the basis that they be one-eighth of the open market rent of the property.</P>
    <P>I see under section 15 that on a review of the rent by the court the rent shall be fixed in accordance with the relevant provisions of section 23 of the 1980 Act by reference to the date of service of the notice on which the application to the court is based rather than on the later dates in section 24, now repealed, of the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the question of the abolition of the right to a reversionary lease was considered and rejected for good reasons.  Although it would have simplified the landlord and tenant code it would have meant the abolition of an existing legal right.  Nevertheless, the right to buy out the fee simple must, surely, be the most desirable from many points of view.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that in the near future provision will be made for the total abolition of ground rent.  I am particularly critical of local authorities who in the not too distant past imposed ground rent for long periods and included restrictive covenants with them for what would seem to be no sound or necesary reasons.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill.  It is obviously more than welcome, bearing in mind the legal lacuna which has arisen as a result of the decision in the Gilsenan case.  I will have a number of points to make on Committee Stage. There are just one or two general points I would like to make to express a view on Second Stage with regard to the general structure of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential problem which arose, and which was dealt with by the court in the Gilsenan case, was correctly summarised by the Minister in saying that the judgment amounted to a finding that the existing provisions of the law for determining rent were unworkable and because they were unworkable a new system <Col N="335" /> was necessary.  In considering the Bill before us we should examine how workable the provisions are and whether they will enable the court or the arbitrator, as the case may be, to arrive at a conclusion with the degree of certainty which, apparently, the court feels is necessary before it can make a determination in these matters.  Some of the comments I will make on Committee Stage will be concerned with whether the sections, as drafted, are definite enough for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that there was not an explanatory memorandum made available with the Bill.  If there was ever a necessity for a Bill to have an explanatory memorandum it was in regard to this Bill.  Members of the House receiving this Bill would have no idea of what is in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be so but there should be an explanatory memorandum with the Bill.  The necessity for an explanatory memorandum was never more obvious than in this case where any Member of this House receiving this Bill, without the most painstaking research, could not get to the kernel of what the Bill is about and, therefore, could not begin to see if it achieved those objectives. We were lucky that the Minister, in his excellent speech in the Dáil, had laid out the objectives of the Bill.  This was a considerable help to Members of this House in understanding the thinking behind the drafting of the various sections. Nevertheless, the Minister should take into account the necessity for an explanatory memorandum in the case of technical Bills of this kind.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that a Bill of this kind would not go to one of the special committees where the matter could be handled in a more leisurely and less strained atmosphere than normally exists on the floor of either House of the Oireachtas when it meets in committee as a complete House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 5 of the Bill, I <Col N="336" /> am disappointed that it does not try to address the problem of existing sporting leases and whether they are open to challenge. The Minister's statement says:</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to take the view that interference with existing leases is not warranted in the absence of a definite indication that the terms of such leases cannot be operated.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that with the provisions for renewal of those rents for a period of approximately 24 or 25 years there is little doubt that when the first one of them comes up for rent review the court will adopt the attitude that it is not workable. Somebody in the Department of Justice should begin to think about problems related to that and include solutions in legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 7, which is really the kernel of the Bill, are very welcome.  The Minister is to be congratulated, particularly, in respect of the provisions of section 9.  There are many titles which are bad because they are split between so many different interests and the rent reserved under the various interests are so small that people do not collect them.  We should encourage a situation where this kind of property can have its title improved.  The provisions in section 9 are very welcome in that regard.  I would also like to welcome the provisions in section 12 which overcomes any additional problem with regard to the right of a lessee to continue in possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to thank the Chair and Members of this House for their contributions on Second Stage, and Senator Ryan for welcoming the Bill.  As he said, it is a Bill of a very technical nature which arises from a particular Supreme Court decision.  The Bill is limited to a very large degree to the response required by that particular Supreme Court decision to establish the rights of lessors and lessees which in effect had become unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan talked about the need for consolidation of various landlord and tenant legislation.  Of course, a case can be made for that, but this Bill is confined <Col N="337" /> to a response, by and large, to the decision on the Gilsenan case and does not go beyond that except in a number of very minor ways.  Senator Fitzsimons talked about the Rent Restrictions Acts. They were repealed by the Private Rented Dwellings Acts which were promoted by the Minister for the Environment. Any consequential changes to be made in Part II of the 1980 Landlord and Tenant Act are matters to be dealt with in the Private Rented Dwellings Acts.  It would certainly be outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary talked about whether we should examine if the measures being proposed in this Bill would actually be workable, since the reason we have this Bill before us is that the Supreme Court found that the terms of the 1980 Act were unworkable in certain cases.  That is certainly a matter worth looking at on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of the explanatory memorandum, it is not customary to circulate explanatory memoranda in all cases with legislation.  It is fair to say that the Department of Justice probably circulate more explanatory memoranda than any other Department, but the judgment on this occasion was that the Minister's Second Stage speech would serve as an explanatory memorandum. Whether it should be referred to the legislative committee or to some other appropriate committee of the House is a debatable point.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of urgency with this Bill.  It is a Bill which will not have widespread public interest, but the people who are affected and the people who cannot get a reversionary lease or who cannot exercise the right to purchase the fee simple of their properties, are certainly extremely interested in it and they are extremely interested in a quick passage of this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is technical.  Senator O'Leary said we could discuss it in a more relaxed atmosphere in a committee.  I hope that on Committee Stage here I will have the opportunity to be relaxed and consult with my officials behind me, because I am certainly not a legal expert on landlord and tenant legislation.  I will certainly <Col N="338" /> need the advice of my officials.  The way we discuss Committee Stage here can be very similar to what could happen in the legislative committee.</P>
    <P>On the question of sporting leases, which Senator O'Leary raised, first of all, the changes that are being made here are not retrospective.  They will apply to future sporting leases.  That decision was taken on the basis that the Supreme Court confined itself in the Gilsenan case to leases other than sporting leases and did not make reference to sporting leases. It would be difficult to say that if the particular issue was put before them they would decide that the renewal of sporting leases was also a matter which was unworkable under existing legislation.  It is a debatable point.  The Government decision on this was to make certain changes in the provision of new sporting leases and to allow for rent reviews in new sporting leases but not to make it retrospective.  If an appropriate case goes before the Supreme Court and if there is a decision on it then, of course, there will have to be a legislative response to that. The judgment and the decision of the Government was that it would not be done in this particular Bill.  I would like to thank the House for facilitating me on Second Stage, and I would like to thank the Senators who contributed.</P>

      <P>I would like to commend the Minister and his draftsmen for the way in which section 7 has been approached, in other words, re-enacting section 17 of the original 1978 Bill with amendments.  The section as it stands is <Col N="339" /> quite a complicated one, and certainly would have been very complicated indeed if section 17 of the original Bill had been amended by this one, which would necessitate looking back at the original section and trying to incorporate the amendments into it.  This approach to sections of this kind is the proper one to adopt, and it should be done far more often.  I am very glad indeed that this approach was adopted by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my welcome to that.  It certainly improves the quality of legislation that this is done. I have a number of questions to ask the Minister on this section.  As Senators will appreciate there are a lot of different subsections but I understand that under our Standing Orders we must take all section 7 together.  Section 7 (3) (b) lists the things which should be taken into account by the arbitrator in determining what the purchase price would be in the event of section 7 coming into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (3) (b) should not be confused, in my opinion, with sections 8 and 9 which deal with a situation where a lease is about to expire.  In this case we are talking about a situation where the lease is not about to expire but where there will be a rent review within 15 years.  Section 7 (3) (b) says: &ldquo;where at the relevent date the land is held under a lease which provides for an increased rent payeable within 15 years after that date&rdquo;.  It appears to me that that would limit the arbitrator to a consideration under the section to cases where the rent review specifically provides for an increased rent which is written into the lease.  It does not say &ldquo;where at the relevant date the land is held under a lease which provides for the possibility of a rent increase or a review of the rent payable within 15 years&rdquo;.  It speaks specifically about increased rent.  In my opinion, in those circumstances, it will be confined to cases where the lease specifies that there will be a review of the rent and it will be increased to a particular amount, and that this section will not enable the arbitrator to consider the situation where there is a rent review coming up.  That <Col N="340" /> rent review might, for example, lead to a reduction in rent or it might lead to a confirmation of the rent, unlikely as that might be.  In point of fact, if I was representing someone before an arbitrator, that point could be made.  We seem to be limiting it only to cases where there is an increased rent limiting the ability of the arbitrator to take into account the enhanced value which arises as a result of a predetermined increased rent.  It appears to me that this section needs an amendment to make clear what should be taken into account.  It is quite obvious from the rest of the Bill what the Minister means to take into account is where at the relevant date the land is held under a lease which provides for a rent review within 15 years after that date rather than provides for an increased rent payable within 15 years after that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): First, I would like to thank Senator Ryan for complimenting the draftsman for incorporating the full section from previous legislation.  Senator O'Leary is right in his interpretation of the section.  It is a rewrite of section 5 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1978 which says that subsection (3) shall not apply in the case of the lease which provides for an increased rent payable at any time within 15 years.  It is a rewrite for drafting purposes of the same concept which is already contained in the 1978 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Under that earlier Act the possibility of there being rent reviews was not a live issue.  Here we are building in a situation where there are going to be rent reviews.  Supposing there is a rent review schedule agreed in respect of a particular reversionary lease, and during the course of that reversionary lease an application is made to purchase the property, will the arbitrator be in a position to take into account when the next rent review is due?  I appreciate that it might have been taken somewhere else, but in the context of what we are doing, which is providing for rent reviews, I think it fails to take that into account and it should be amended.</P>

      <P>I have a number of other points to make on this section which is the kernel of the Bill.  I am grateful to the Minister for his statement of the position under subsection (3) (b).  I would like to refer to subsection (4) (b) which sets out the amount of money which would be payable in respect of an expired lease, which is one-eighth of the value of the property which stands on the land.  Then it goes on to say that a deduction from that should be made for an amount equal to the value of goodwill, if any, in the premises of the person acquiring the fee simple.  This is a considerable change in landlord and tenant legislation.  We are asking the arbitrator to value goodwill. Surely the valuation of goodwill which would be necessary in order to make that deduction is precisely the kind of imponderable which the Supreme Court were talking about when they said that they were not satisfied that the last enactment was workable.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the imponderable contained in subsection (4) (b) might be so vague as to render the Bill not capable of being operated in the correct fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The original fraction in the thirties was one-quarter, in the fifties it became one-sixth, and in the 1967 Act it became one-eighth. The Minister has power to vary that fraction, but there is no intention to vary it at the moment.  On the question of goodwill, the existing legislation has regard for that &ldquo;without having regard to any goodwill which might exist in respect of the land&rdquo;.  It is a maintenance of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very big difference. If you tell a person to value the interest in land and discard goodwill, you do not actually have to value the goodwill to arrive at the price.  Here you are doing <Col N="342" /> a different thing.  You are valuing it by a mechanical means, saying the value of the property is divided by eight, and you deduct the goodwill from it.  In order to do that you must arrive at what the goodwill is.  In other words, we were telling people previously to ignore the goodwill, the valuation was done as if there was no goodwill whatsoever on the premises. Now we are doing a different thing, we are valuing it according to a mechanical method, saying the value of the property divided by one-eighth, and then we do a separate calculation to arrive at what the goodwill is so that we can deduct it from that amount.  I know the intention is the same, but the Minister is attacking it from a different point of view.  In the first case, he is valuing the property as if there was no goodwill whatsoever attached to the business, as if it was a new letting, but here he is going at it in a different way. He is valuing the property and then deducting the goodwill.  Therefore it will be necessary in these cases to value the goodwill where it was not necessary under the old formula.  That is precisely the point I am making.  The arbitrator in arriving at a figure will now be under an obligation to value the goodwill where previously he was under the obligation to discard the possibility of the goodwill. This is the fundamental difference which exists in respect of the method included here.  I say this not because I have any fear of arbitrators, but somebody might feel that an arbitrator had not done the job properly and it would ultimately go to court and we might have an unfortunate <i>lacuna</i> in the law on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Senator O'Leary's objection seems to be on the ground that the provision would be unworkable.  The main problem which the Supreme Court addressed in the Gilsenan case was that it would be unworkable because you would not get a willing lessor to grant a lease for 99 years.  On the question of goodwill, I presume goodwill is measurable but whether one would agree with the valuation put on it is another question.  All I can do to help the Senator is to say that we have had representations from professional bodies <Col N="343" /> involved in this area and they have not made any representations on this matter. One would expect that goodwill would have to be valued and one would have to measure goodwill under the 1980 Act but one might not agree with the findings of the arbitrator.  It might end up in court and one might not necessarily agree with the findings of the court, but that does not mean it is not workable.  It is a workable procedure.  In working out the value and then applying the fraction of one-eighth, it would be necessary to allow for goodwill, and this is the mechanism being chosen to allow for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Minister makes that it is not quite the same thing as saying that the possibilities are unworkable for different reasons.  I accept that there is some validity in what he is saying.  I would like to refer to subsection (4) (d) which pursues the matter further.  The valuation of the property, divided by one-eighth, gives the valuation for the purposes of this section which says that in determining the amount referred to in paragraph 8, any addition to the value deriving from the contemplation of substantial rebuilding or a scheme of development shall be disregarded. Has the Minister considered whether it is possible to have an additional value which would not be disregarded, because it is not apparently included in this definition which would derive not from the contemplation of substantial rebuilding or from a scheme of development within the particular Act, but, for example, from a change of use? In the event of there being a change of use applied for and approved by the local authorities, that would be an addition to the value which would arrive as a result of a change of use, but according to the strict interpretation of subparagraph (4) (d) it would not be excluded because it would not be goodwill; it would just be an enhanced value from a property which arises as a result of a change of use.  It would not arise as a result of goodwill; it would not arise as a result of the contemplation of substantial rebuilding because that may not arise.  It may be a simple <Col N="344" /> question of change of use or a scheme of development, but a simple change of use would not be a scheme of development under section 33 (1) (b), and subsections (1) and (2) of the 1980 Act.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the enhanced value which arises as a result of a change of use for example, or some other scheme of development which is not a scheme of development mentioned in section 33, will give rise to an increased value, which in turn will give rise to an increased cost in respect of the purchase of the fee simple.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The ground landlord may not charge rent on foot of the tenant's own improvements to the property under section 35 (2) of the 1980 Act, and section 7 (4) (c) of the Bill proposed has a parallel provision.  The rent under a reversionary lease excludes any element of development value under section 36 (1) of the 1980 Act.  The new formula again reflects this in section 7 (4) (d) of the Bill, which is the one the Senator has in mind.  The rent under a reversionary lease excludes any rental element attributable to the tenant's goodwill.  This exclusion has been provided, as I mentioned already.  On the question of development and the future costs of purchase of fee simple, this is dealing with particular cases of leases with less than 15 years to run.  If there are rent reviews every five years, and if one of the determining factors in decided what the purchase price of the fee simple is to be is the rent, and consequently if the rent reviews change the rent, there will be a change in the purchase of the fee simple once the one-eighth is applied. While prospective development would not change it, retrospectively after the next review I presume it would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that section 7 is so long but I will deal with subsections (8) and (9) together.  I have two different points to make.  I am very grateful to the Minister for explaining why the different system is used.  Of course, some consideration should be given in the future as to whether this <Col N="345" /> differentiation of business purposes and non-business purposes is a valid distinction. I wonder, is it?  For the moment, we will accept that it is.  I would like to refer to subsection (8) (c) which says:</P>
      <P>the purchase price shall not exceed the amount which would be determined under subsection (5) if the land were land to which the subsection applied, together with, in respect of each year by which the unexpired term (reckoned from that date) and of the lease falls short of fifteen years, one fifteenth of the difference between that price and the price that would be determined under subsection (4) if the lease had expired.</P>
      <P>That really means that in the case of a lease which would have seven years to run, the price would be an amalgamation of the seven-fifteenths of the existing purchase price on the basis of the existing rent, and eight-fifteenths of the purchase price as calculated under the revised rent. It appears that in those circumstances we are giving an additional benefit to the landlord in that we do not appear to be discounting the value of the one-fifteenth.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is a sliding scale provision.  The nearer you go to the next revision, the bigger the increase in the rent and the purchase price will be.  Since the main factor in determining purchase price is the actual rent, the bigger the rent will be.  The determining factor will be the size of the rent as against the purchasing price.  It is better to take the date of application rather than the date of determination.  It is fairer to both landlord and tenant if that is the fixed date because there is a greater variation if we take a later date.</P>

With seven years to run to the rent review, the increased purchase price will reflect the fact that in <Col N="346" /> seven years time there will be a rent review.</P>

      <P>the length of time to run from that date to the expiration of the lease or to the earliest date from which the rent as so reviewed may be payable, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>Will that give rise to difficulty on the basis of it being uncertain?  There does not appear to be any instructions to the arbitrator as distinct from subsection (8).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister for Justice listening to the debate.  Before the adjournment I was going to suggest that quoting figures related to a local issue might make it easier to understand the implications of the super-levy on this country.  I was going to relate some figures which I got <Col N="348" /> from Avonmore Creameries which might bring home to people the ferocious problem that would have to be faced if the super-levy, as proposed, was brought in.</P>
      <P>Avonmore Creameries take milk from the south-east area.  They have 6,000 suppliers and 1,396 employees.  If you consider that on each farm there would be approximately two people engaged in the production of milk for the creamery, you are talking about 12,000 people directly working on the land and 1,396 people in the processing plant.  In 1981, the year on which the super-levy was to be based, Avonmore Creameries had an intake of 101 million gallons, and based on accurate projections for 1984 the intake this year will be 138 million gallons.  The increase from 1981 to 1984 would be 37 million gallons.  The levy was to be at 70p per gallon; 70p per gallon by 37 million is £25,900,000.  If you divide 6,000 into £25 million you get an average of £4,200 per farmer.  Naturally, this would mean that some farmers would have a much bigger drop in income and others would get a smaller drop in income and there would be a drop in the numbers employed in that particular industry. Almost £14 million per year is paid out in salaries and wages by Avonmore Coops and of that £14 million, £4 million is paid to the Exchequer by way of PAYE and PRSI contributions.  Avonmore also pay £171 million to the Exchequer by way of tax on profits.  This brings home to people the magnitude of the possible effects of the super-levy.  If one takes it that the drop in income would be £25 million, and that Avonmore take one eighth of the milk production, it is easy to multiply that and one gets a loss of £200 million per annum to the suppliers in this country.  The imposition of this super-levy would have a disastrous effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is fully aware of the fact that there will have to be modifications made in the method of financing the European Parliament and the European Community and that Ireland will have to play her part in the modification.  I do not think there is any doubt that the Irish farmer and the Irish people are prepared to pay in a reasonable amount in order to get a reasonable amount out.  It cannot <Col N="349" /> be suggested by anyone that there should be an equal share paid by each country because the overall principle of the EEC was to raise the standards of the poorer countries to the standards of the richer countries.  Therefore the richer countries must pay a substantially bigger share into the EEC.  Suggestions have been made in the last few days that the VAT rate should be increased from 1 per cent to 1.8 per cent or 2 per cent.  We would agree with this increase as long as readjustments were made in terms of what CAP is involved in at present.  The bigger countries are complaining that all this means is that they would be paying more into the EEC budget.  They did not say they would be prepared to put the extra amount in if there were changes made in CAP.  Since the EEC are running out of resources very quickly a radical change will have to be made in the method of financing.  Possibly the best method would be to increase the VAT rate from 1 per cent to 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in terms of her production of milk, is in no way a major cause of disruption in the EEC in terms of the amounts of money required to subsidise CAP at all levels.  The imposition of the super-levy on milk production would mean a complete blockage in the expansion of our production and of the dairy sector in general.  We have one of the most under-developed dairy sectors in Europe.  It must be recognised that unless Irish farmers are subsidised to a degree they will not be able to bring up their levels of production to those pertaining in the EEC.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that a bigger percentage of Irish farmers are dependent on the dairy sector than in any other country in Europe.  Fifty-three per cent of farmers in Ireland are dependent on milk production.  The EEC average for farm holdings with dairy cows is 35 per cent as against 53 per cent here.  The average cow herd is much smaller here than it is in any other country in Europe. Over 85 per cent of Irish dairy farmers have less than 30 cows compared with 46 per cent in the Netherlands and 35.4 per cent in the United Kingdom.  It must equally be remembered that the beef <Col N="350" /> trade, which is of vital importance to us, is highly dependent on our dairy industry. Eighty per cent of all beef produced in Ireland comes from the dairy herd.  The super-levy, it is estimated, would put 14 to 15 per cent of Irish milk production out of existence, with serious employment consequences, apart from anything else, at a time when unemployment is such a major problem for us.</P>
    <P>In the EEC the biggest proportion of the budget has gone to the agriculture sector.  It is logical that there would be a big move to get the percentage that is given to agriculture brought down.  Of course, we are trying to keep the subsidy to farmers and to milk production up and, at the same time, we are trying to fight to keep food prices down.  There seems to be a total conflict there, but nevertheless, I think that on balance it is to the advantage of this country to have the subsidy rather than the subsidy on production and on increased production rather than to allow the prices of the commodity to creep up, thereby exacerbating the problems we have with inflation and the cost of living.  On balance we must look for the super-levy not to take effect, but there will have to be adjustments made which will give enough cash to the Community to keep going.</P>
    <P>We recognise the fact that remedial measures are necessary to redress the financial situation.  Milk production accounts for 33 per cent of gross agricultural output, and milk output is six and a half times more important to Ireland than overall milk production is to the European Community as a whole.  Milk in Ireland is four times more important to the Irish economy than Danish milk is to the Danish economy and three and a half times more important than Greek milk is to the Greek economy.  The importance of milk production in Greece and Denmark is next to Ireland in the Community.  Milk and beef output in Ireland is five and a half times more important than it is in Denmark and four and a half times more important than in Greece.  These figures thrown out may seem boring and irrelevant, but nevertheless they show that we are not in a <Col N="351" /> favourable position in terms of our production levels and our GDP, <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>One half of all farm families in this country depend on milk as their sole regular source of cash income and the other half almost in its entirely on cattle and beef production.  The dairying sector is of paramount importance and it is of paramount importance that it be protected. The situation which has arisen because of the threat of the super-levy is that we have in this country a dissatisfaction level with the EEC which is far greater than it has been at any time since we went into the EEC in 1973.  There were a number of people who claimed that we should never have gone into the EEC.  I do not subscribe to that idea.  I do, however, agree that unless measures are taken now, the value we have got through the years from the EEC will be dissipated. For every £1 that we put into the EEC we get £5 back, so if we get out of the EEC it is very hard to know where that amount of money will come from.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I was very disappointed that the Minister's statement did not take unemployment into account at all.  There is not one single page in the Minister's speech of 29 pages which deals with the unemployment situation. That is something to which we must address ourselves in this House, but since we are talking about what happens in the EEC I think that is a matter which the EEC will have to spend a lot more time on in the future, because when one looks at the 4½ million people under 25 years of age unemployed in the EEC and of that 4½ million unemployed, 1½ million have been unemployed for more than a year, the magnitude of the problem becomes apparent.</P>
    <P>In the Commission's programme for 1983-84, they set out a list of themes, and I feel that not one single item of their programme has been, to any extent, improved during the 1983-84 period. They set out five inter-dependent categories for priority action: (1) Improving the general economic and social environment; (2) Completing the single market; (3) Restoring industry to a position of <Col N="352" /> strength; (4) Reinforcing the Community's budgetary and financial instruments and (5) Enhancing the Community's influence in the international environment.  I would suggest that not one of those objectives has been advanced in any way.  The Minister in his speech made much about the foreign policy improvements that have been made during the year, but I do not think we have had any progress.  The Minister in his speech &mdash; I think it is important that we should dwell on it for a few minutes &mdash; mentioned the enlargement situation and welcomed the fact that advancement had been made in the bringing in of Spain and Portugal.  In terms of enlargement we have to be very careful because of our very bad economic situation.  It must be said that industrially we would be at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Spain and Portugal if we went out looking for new industry.  Unless adequate protection is given to Irish industry within the enlargement proceedings, when Spain and Portugal come in it would seem to be of more advantage for firms wanting to locate in Europe to go to economies like Spain and Portugal where they will have cheaper labour and where they will not have the same problems in terms of transportation, as they would have here. Unless we have, within the Community, decided upon a proper budgetary basis, the Community does not have any right to bring in anybody else.  All we would be doing is dissipating the benefits that are there and creating more and more problems for our own country.  Indeed, on 17 February, the <i>Evening Herald</i> had a paragraph which stated that the Israeli economy will be damaged irreparably if Spain and Portugal come in because of the fact that they would then be at a trading disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Spain and Portugal because of the amount of fruit and vegetables that are now coming into the EEC at about the same level of support as is being got by Israel at present.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that the <i>Agence Telegraphique Juive</i> of 8 February 1984 contained a report in relation to an important aspect of the EEC &mdash; the EEC-Israeli agreement in the context of a decision regarding a possible free trade <Col N="353" /> agreement between Israel and the United States.  Mr. Elmer Wilson, Chairman of the Committee for Economic Relations for Israel and former Chairman of the American Jewish Committee, was invited to give evidence to the Senate Finance Committee.</P>
    <P>According to the agency report Mr. Wilson explained that the projected free-trade agreement between the two countries would open new export markets for American industrialists and new possibilities for research and development for American industrial laboratories. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Thanks to the Free Trade Agreement which Israel enjoys with the EEC, American industries will be able to be competitive in Europe, after their products have been manufactured and finished in Israel.</P>
    <P>If what has been stated by that agency is correct this would mean major problems for us.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful, if we are going to make agreements with countries which are outside the EEC, that they are not going to be to the detriment of our economy.  Member states have been allowed by the EEC to make trade arrangements with countries outside the EEC which have been to the detriment of the EEC.  We would not be in the same situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the super-levy if arrangements had not been made with countries such as New Zealand, countries which are allowed to export cheap food to Britain.  In the dairying sector there are subsidised foodstuffs coming in which are being used to feed cattle on the extensive farms of France and Holland.  We must be extremely careful that enlargement of the EEC does not further disrupt the progress we have made in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to hunger in the world.  When we talk about hunger in Ireland, it is relative hunger.  Anybody who has been to a Third World country would not suggest that the hunger that exists there is in any way comparable with the hunger that exists in Ireland.  We in the western world, irrespective of whether we feel we are developed or not, <Col N="354" /> will have to look at the Third World and the problems they have in relation to the production of food.  In parts of Africa you have whole communities dying of starvation.  Right through Central Africa, there are large areas of land reverting back to the desert and hundreds of thousands of people are dying of hunger.  We as a country will have to be more aware of the problems that exist in the Third World, and treat it not just as an area from which to get business to help our economy.  We will have to see that the European Economic Community adopts the attitude that if we are going to trade with countries in the Third World it will have to be on a two-way basis of trading; that we will supply them with the expertise and knowledge that they require to get out of their difficulties and that, as a <i>quid pro quo</i> they will supply us with materials we need.</P>
    <P>What is happening in trade in the Third World at present as regards the EEC countries in general and the Western world in particular, is that there is a colonisation process continuing whereby the Third World countries are being milked of everything they have. The only difference between now and one hundred years ago is that the people who are doing the milking do not live in these particular countries.  We must ensure that when we have used up the energy resources they have in the Middle East and in the African countries we have given back to these countries something which will enable them to retain a standard of living comparable with what we would expect here.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference in his speech to our neutrality situation and our attitude towards neutrality.  Apart from unemployment, the younger people in our community see the nuclear problem as the major one of the day.  Whether nuclear weapons are short range, medium range or long range does not matter.  Every extra nuclear weapon placed on the territory of the EEC creates a threat to the future of the world, to our future and to our children's future.  Our young people are very much aware of the dangers.  There is no point in saying those weapons are placed there for deterrent <Col N="355" /> purposes.  You could say that is the argument of the bully who has to hit first just in case somebody might get the idea that he is the weaker person.  We will have to address ourselves continually to the nuclear problem and voice our opinion in Europe that we do not want those weapons, that they are not needed and that they are not a deterrent.</P>
    <P>We must equally condemn the number of missiles that have been placed by the USSR in countries in Eastern Europe and right throughout the periphery of the Middle East.  At every forum that we can, we must ensure that what has happened in the last 12 months when weaponry of this type has been allowed to proliferate all over the world will not happen again. It is very hard to stop this.  We read yesterday that the United States sent a plane with nuclear missiles without the warheads over Canada and the Canadian Government were not in a position to stop them doing so.  It was stated quite categorically that they used Northern Canada and Alaska as being the type of terrain that these missiles would encounter if they were flying over parts of Russia. These people are not preparing, by placing their missiles in a deterrent manner; they are stating quite categorically that they are prepared, if pushed, to attack, and when somebody gets to that stage it is very easy for somebody on the other side to adopt the attitude: if you start we will follow suit.</P>
    <P>We have had a breakdown of support for the United Nations within the EEC in the last 12 months.  Troops from this country have supported the United Nations mandate and the United Nations mission for many years, and in southern Lebanon they have done a magnificent job in maintaining some semblance of normal life and have been accepted by the people of southern Lebanon as being a force who are not there for any reason except in support of peace.  During the past 12 months we have had the situation where the United States went into Lebanon on a separate basis, and Britain, France and Italy, as part of a multinational force rather than going in <Col N="356" /> as a peacekeeping force under the aegis of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We should be playing a more vociferous part in ensuring that countries in Europe do not get involved in conflicts which have nothing to do with them unless they go as part of a UNIFIL force. It is interesting to look at the countries which went in.  These are Italy, France and Britain, three ex-colonial countries which had been in the Lebanon in the past as colonialists.  Anybody who would look at what has happened in the Lebanon or in the Beirut area since these multinational forces went in would see that there has been a total breakdown of what was a semblance of law and order. The Middle East is a cauldron that has been mentioned by the Minister, and I should like to compliment him on his attitude towards that particular area.</P>
    <P>In the past few months there has been an escalation of the war in Iran and Iraq. We in the EEC are not fighting hard enough to get the opposing forces in that war to come to their senses and to get those people to the negotiating table, because that conflict is escalating at a terrifying rate.  The situation between Iran and Iraq is fraught with danger for us.  The major powers are hanging around the border supporting one side at one time and another side at another time in the supply of arms and weapons.  Unless the suppliers of the arms and weapons come to their senses that conflict could engulf us in Europe in a war which would be too horrific to even think about.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding unemployment, as I have mentioned before, is one which should have been highlighted more.  The Minister's speech will probably be reported and a copy will probably be sent to sources within the EEC.  If they do not see that we are interested in progressing our job creation rate, I do not think anybody else will help us.  Ireland now has the highest unemployment rate in the EEC, 17 per cent.  The nearest figure to this is 15.4 per cent in the Netherlands. There is 11.5 per cent of the work force in general out of work in the EEC.  Obviously we at home will have to do something to help ourselves.  I do not think enough consideration has been <Col N="357" /> given to the part that could be played by local groups, whether it is voluntary groups or local authorities, to help in the creation of community derived employment. For too long we have depended solely on outsiders to help us in our aims towards full employment.  We will have to help ourselves more, and we will have to try to get that message across as vociferously as possible.</P>
    <P>The impact of the increase in unemployment has created many problems.  If one looks at the intake of patients into hospitals one will find that a large number of people who are admitted to general hospitals have psychosomatic problems and the intake into mental institutions is far higher than it has ever been.  The number of people attending psychiatrists' out-clinics is growing at an alarming rate, and a lot of those problems are caused by the fact that our unemployment figures are so high.  Again there are links which can be made between our increased crime rate and our increased unemployment rate.  The EEC is not working as hard as it should in trying to alleviate the problems we have as a small country with a very open economy.  To quote some of the headlines in the papers: &ldquo;Jobless Figures Up Again&rdquo;, &ldquo;No Sign of Recovery as Euro Jobless Totals Rise&rdquo; and &ldquo;EEC Jobless Highest&rdquo;.  One can go on and on about unemployment problems but, as I have said before, the EEC with all their resources have not done anything in the past 12 months to help.  The Athens Summit reinforced this when they could not even come up with a joint communique afterwards.  There was a lot of time spent at the previous summit, which came out with a lot of what I would call pious platitudes and did nothing to help.  Then the leaders of the bigger countries headed off to Williamsburg in the States where they sat for four days and talked round about the problems the world faces.  They came away from that beautiful part of America and they might as well have spent it in the Bahamas and enjoyed themselves, because they did not do any better in Williamsburg.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months attempts have been made to bring in a common transport policy.  Before a common transport <Col N="358" /> policy is brought in we will have to look at the problems that transport changes have created for Irish industry in terms of increased costs.  We are living in an industrialised area which is separated from the mainstream of Europe by two seas, and our transport costs, <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners, are much higher. If we introduce a common transport policy which does not take into account the problems we face we will find ourselves in a few years' time looking for help from the EEC to support our transport industry in a manner which nobody wants.</P>
    <P>Under the tachograph regulations a vehicle travelling from Dublin to Cork must have two drivers.  One could do double the amount of mileage on the Continent in the same amount of time. That is just one instance.  If we are to have a common transport policy we will have to ensure that we have a common costing for input into the road vehicles. If we have a common costing method to ensure that insurance rates are reasonably equal, to ensure that the costs of replacement parts are reasonably equal, then we can have a common transport policy, but not until then.</P>
    <P>The EEC in the last 12 months has not given to us as a community what we would have expected from it.  I sincerely hope that in the 1984 period we will see the common agricultural policy defended by this Government, that we will see the finances of the Community being brought into proper accounting, that our situation in Europe at present as being one of the poorest will be taken into account when any changes in policies are to take place. By the time we take up the Presidency of the EEC in four months' time I hope the people who voted to get into Europe, the people who want to stay in Europe and the young people, will get from Europe what is needed to help us to provide a future for young people and to help industry and the community in general and to stop, as the Minister said in his opening remarks, the Community from staggering from crisis to crisis during 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on his very comprehensive <Col N="359" /> and wide ranging report, which gave the House an account of a rather disappointing year as far as the EEC were concerned. At the outset I would like to say to the Minister that I personally am sorely disappointed that despite the fact we have gone through a difficult and impossible year from the European point of view we are discussing a period for which the report is not even published, even though that report should have been published last June.  That is not acceptable. Our debate here this evening is directly because of section 5 of the 1972 European Communities Act, which stipulates that we should have twice yearly reports.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of looking at 1983 and have the opportunity of hearing the Minister give his view, and I certainly look forward to the points that he will make in reply to the queries and perhaps the disappointments that we will, in the course of this debate, underline for him.  The period under review was one of absolutely no progress. There was no development as far as the European Communities were concerned and the Council of Ministers demonstrated themselves to be absolutely incapable of taking any worthwhile decisions towards the development of the Community and towards meeting the challenges that the year has brought up.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): First of all, I would like to apologise for any part I may have had in the delay in resuming business in the House this evening.  I came in with the <Col N="361" /> intention of listening to the contributions from Senators and replying to them, I have many notes so that I can make appropriate responses to points raised.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak in the Seanad.  It is the first opportunity I have had to address either House of the Oireachtas on the question of the penal system and the prisons since the setting up of this inquiry, which is locally colloquially known as the Whitaker inquiry into the prisons.  It is also the first time that I can remember when we have had a debate solely directed to the penal system and the prisons as distinct from the functional area of the Department of Justice as a whole either in the Dáil or in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31 January 1984 the committee of inquiry was set up under the chairmanship of Dr. Ken Whitaker.  I am very glad that a man of his experience and depth of knowledge was willing to take up this onerous task and to chair the committee. It is also worth mentioning the other members of the committee.  The committee is complete and the people on it have accepted and they will be functioning very shortly.  There is no great public awareness about who exactly is on the committee so it is worth mentioning it here in the House.  The committee members are: Dr. John Cooney, a consultant psychiatrist, Associate Medical Director of St. Patrick's Hospital in Dublin; Mr. Declan Doyle who is a marketing director of Irish Cement Limited and has a lot of experience in the building industry &mdash; and there is a major expansion programme in the prisons and relevant experience in building is appropriate; the Honourable Mr. Justice Henchy who is a judge of the Supreme Court &mdash; the need is there for somebody with the legal expertise of a Supreme Court judge and Mr. Justice Henchy is particularly welcome on the committee; Father Peter McVerry, SJ, from the Centre of Faith and Justice, who has experience of conditions within the prisons in his capacity as a supplementary chaplain on one occasion, and he has done a tremendous amount of work for people who are at risk, especially for young people who are at risk in the inner city; Ms. Breege <Col N="362" /> O'Donoghue, who is personnel manager of a large company and will have a wide contribution to make, especially in the area of personal relationships; Ms. Patricia O'Donovan is the Legislation and Equality Officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have already written a report on the penal system and I understand that Ms. O'Donovan played a prominent part in that so, again, apart from her trade union experience she is bringing some additional experience on to the committee; Dr. David B. Rottman is the senior research officer of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I understand he is an American, but he is actually engaged in research work into the penal system in this country already and is working in conjunction with the Department of Justice on material which is relevant, I am very glad that he has been willing to serve on this committee; finally, Father Liam Ryan, who is Professor of Sociology in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth; I do not think it is necessary for me to eulogise the qualities of Father Ryan.</P>
    <P>It is a well-balanced committee, and I hope that it will examine the areas in the terms of reference and that it will be able to make recommendations which can be the basis for policy.  I do not believe in committees that go on interminably; I do not believe in committees who bring out long reports which cannot be used for the basis of policy subsequently.  Given the composition of this committee and the chairmanship of this committee I have great confidence that not only will we have an expeditious report but that we will have a report which will make definite recommendations which will help me as Minister for Justice, and my successors, to form and to execute policy in the penal area for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Even though I was not here when you began to discuss this topic last week &mdash; I was engaged in Private Members' Time in the Dáil &mdash; I have read some of the more substantial contributions to that debate and I will refer to them as I go along.</P>
    <P>There was a general criticism made that the MacBride Committee was looking <Col N="363" /> into the penal system as a whole in a very wide way but there was a feeling that the Whitaker Committee was more restricted in its terms of reference.  I would like to go through the terms of reference to indicate, without in any way attempting to tie the hands of the committee, where I think the thrust of the inquiry lies.</P>
    <P>The first term of reference is to examine the law in regard to imprisonment in related areas with a view to establishing whether (1) a reduction in the number of persons being committed and (2) a shortening of the periods of committal generally and of the period served can be achieved.  First of all, if we think of the numbers in prisons, there are tonight in prisons in this country about 1,620 people.  This is approximately 200 more than there was this time last year.  On average, in 1982 there would have been just over 1,200 in prison and now it has gone up to over 1,600.  This is not necessarily because the number of people being sentenced through our courts has expanded to any large degree, it is principally because there was not sufficient accommodation previously to house people who were being sentenced; in a sense we are providing some of that accommodation now.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are people who have been shed from the system who cannot be accommodated in our prisons, and I will refer to that subsequently.  It is difficult to establish how we fare relative to other countries.  Some statistical information to hand might help.  Rates of imprisonment per 100,000 of population on 1 September 1983 were, in Ireland, 42 per 100,000.  If I read the statistics and comment subsequently you will get the pattern. In the Netherlands, it was 28 per 100,000; in Spain, it was 38; Malta, 30; Iceland, 24; Cyprus 36; Sweden 43; Norway 47; Denmark 60; Switzerland, 62 and the UK 87 per 100,000.  Whether that proves anything is difficult to say, because one always needs the background to the statistics.  The Netherlands figure is extraordinarily low.  One would think that they had succeeded in finding the panacea to the crime problem.  When <Col N="364" /> we examine it further we find that there are about 11,000 people in the Netherlands who have not succeeded in booking their place in prison yet; there is more than a two-year waiting list.  One gets a note through the post saying &ldquo;There is a place now available, come along&rdquo;. Obviously, the low statistic there is not of great help.</P>
    <P>What is important from our present point of view is that the number of people in our prisons who are on remand is quite low relative to international standards. That is very important.  Prisons are a necessary evil in society; if they are to be a necessary evil they are certainly only to be used as far as possible for those who are actually sentenced by the courts and not to be used extensively to hold people on remand.</P>
    <P>In the first term of reference there is a concentration on numbers; there is a concentration on cost; there is a concentration on the shortening of the period.  The general thrust of the first term of reference is to indicate to the committee of inquiry that we would like them to look at alternatives to imprisonment.  If the guards bring someone before the court, the court has to examine the situation.  They have a number of alternatives open to them. They certainly can send somebody to prison.  They can give somebody a suspended sentence.  Probation orders can be made so that they will be in the care of the probation and welfare service. Somebody can be fined.</P>
    <P>I maintain that we have not got sufficient alternatives to imprisonment.  I maintain that there are people in our prisons who would not be there at all but for the fact that sufficient alternatives are not available.  We have the problem that a justice in the District Court or a judge is faced with the situation where there is a limited number of alternatives and it is a matter of deciding whether to give a suspended sentence which would allow culprits out in society or see if anything else can be done.  One of the obvious questions is: what about the Community Service Order Bill which was brought in last year?  When I brought in that Bill last year I said that there was no money in the 1983 Estimates for it.  That was one <Col N="365" /> problem.  You need money for the implementation of the Community Service Order Act.</P>
    <P>I mentioned another problem which did not strike home at the time.  It is this. The experience in England would suggest that it would be impossible to bring this Act in on a pilot basis.  The advice to me is that because of the nature of society it would be improper and probably unconstitutional to have different sanctions operating in different parts of the State. If there was a particular sanction in one part of the State that was not available to citizens in another part of the State, and if it could be perceived as a softer option or an alternative to imprisonment and if somebody in Cork would end up in prison and somebody in Dublin would be put on community service for similar offences, that would not stand up.  It has to be implemented right through the State.  To do that it is necessary to have the probation and welfare officers to organise it. It is necessary to have trades people, people with skills on the ground, to control the work.  That is the reason for the delay.  The money was allocated in the last budget.  There is money in 1984. The details are being finalised with the Department of the Public Service.  It will be possible to implement the Community Service Order Act this year and to do it all over the country.  To do it, staff has to be recruited and that can be put in train very quickly.  The Minister has to make orders under which the scheme will operate. Work is being done on that as well.</P>
    <P>I would hope that some time in the summer this scheme will be operational and that there will be a further alternative to imprisonment, to fines and to suspended sentences available to our courts.  I think this is very important indeed.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the committee would examine other alternatives.  I believe that the range of alternatives is not sufficient. People end up in prison who if there was a better range of alternatives would not be in prison in the first place.  The committee can draw on the experiences from other countries.  There is a possibility of limited imprisonment.  There is a possibility of people attending prison at weekends, for example.  That might not be the <Col N="366" /> best solution.  There needs to be a greater flexibility in sentencing to prison and a wider range of alternatives.  It may be a weak point to make, but if I had all the answers of what the alternatives should be we would not need a committee in the first place.  We need the advice of an expert group examining the situation to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>In this context I would like to mention the juvenile liaison scheme run by the Garda Síochána.  A number of Senators, speaking in this debate, talked about the difficulties which they envisaged in a growing alienation of certain sections of the community especially the young, from the gardaí.  The juvenile liaison scheme run by the gardaí is working successfully. It has the capacity to be expanded.  It must be tied up with the whole idea of community policing and the integration of the police in the community. It is an area which the committee of inquiry can examine and can look at very effectively.</P>
    <P>If we had a number of alternatives to imprisonment available to our judges we would still have problems.  The Community Service Order Act is intended to provide that community services would be in lieu of a prison sentence.  If they are used in lieu of a probation order or in lieu of a fine or in lieu of a suspended sentence then they will not achieve what the Minister and the people who drafted the Bill intend the community service order to achieve.</P>
    <P>Every individual who comes before the courts is different.  They come there in different circumstances.  The actual categorising of crime may be the same but the circumstances and the background of each particular case are different.  Justices and judges need flexibility to deal with the different cases which come before them, the different individuals who come before them.  That is why I would be opposed in principle to mandatory minimum sentences &mdash; because each case is different.  I would also like to say that so many people arrive in so many courts that there must be an overall sentencing policy.  The potential is there for consultation under the 1961 Courts Act. The President of the District Court can <Col N="367" /> call his justices together and they can discuss anything that pertains to their areas of responsibility and certainly to sentencing.  I have been assured through my Department by the Presidents of the other courts, the Circuit Court and the High Court, that there is no difficulty about judges coming together informally to discuss a sentencing policy or any other matters which are relevant.  I would like that this would continue.  I know it is happening now and I would like that it would continue.  I think it is even more important in a situation where there is a range of sanctions which could be implemented by a court that this range of sanctions would be implemented in a reasonable standard way, allowing for all the differences of the cases which appear in courts right through the State.</P>
    <P>This committee of inquiry will certainly, I am sure, be very helpful in this area and will explore these ideas and will come up with recommendations which can form the basis for policy.  I am indicating here how wide I perceive the terms of reference to be especially under term of reference (a).  Term of reference (b) is: to evaluate the adequacy in capacity and range of the existing accommodation for prisoners, particularly for female prisoners and juvenile detainees, and the planned additions and improvements to it.  It is worth looking at the situation as it stands at the moment.  There are a number of prisons in this country. Obviously they date from different periods and the structures are different and the regimes in them are different. Frequently there is a different type of prisoner in each one.</P>
    <P>We have, for example, two very high security prisons where generally the practice is that members of subversive organisations are contained.  These prisons have put a tremendous strain on the prison system in this country.  The two more substantial prisons, Portlaoise and Limerick, have been and are being used for the containment of subversive prisoners. This has caused tremendous pressure on space in other institutions.  It has brought about the problem that two prisons which in the normal situation could <Col N="368" /> be used for the containment of criminals guilty of ordinary crime are now being used in a situation where they are not available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We have prisons like Mountjoy, prisons like St. Patrick's Institution for younger people.  Then we had the open centres like Shanganagh, Shelton and Loughan House.  There is movement between these.  Prisoners can be moved from St. Patrick's to an open institution. I make the point, first of all, simply to enumerate the accommodation available and to draw the House's attention to the fact that there is a range of accommodation available and that somebody sentenced to a particular institution does not necessarily serve the whole sentence there.</P>
    <P>Within the prison system there is a variety of regimes which one can experience; so, it is difficult to say this is the typical Irish one; this is the typical situation in an Irish prison and this is a typical day in the life of an Irish prisoner. It is impossible to categorise in that way because there is not a typical one.  If alternatives to imprisonment are not found, the inadequacy of accommodation in the sense of it not being able to accommodate the number of people who are being sentenced to prison will need to be examined by the committee of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the accommodation available to female prisoners in Mountjoy.  It is inadequate. While I am awaiting the report of the committee of inquiry into the prisons it would be wrong of me to use that as an excuse for inactivity and inaction.  This committee is not to be seen as the Minister handing his problems to a committee and doing nothing until the committee reports.  As many Senators know, there is a building programme in Clondalkin to provide a prison for women and for juvenile offenders.  That is under construction at the moment.  I am not prepared to wait either until adequate accommodation is provided there and simply use that as an excuse for doing nothing in Mountjoy.  It is the policy of my Department in this year to refurbish and reconstruct the women's prison in Mountjoy so that better <Col N="369" /> accommodation is available for the women imprisoned there.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in the prison system which has been getting most publicity in recent times is the number of people who are being shed prematurely from the prison system.  That is a cause for concern. The public expect that if people are sentenced to prison they will serve an adequate proportion of their sentence before they were released.  Some of these people would not be in prison in the first instance if there was an adequate range of alternatives.  I hope that the Community Service Order Act will help in that direction.  Over the last 15 months, approximately 400 extra people have been accommodated in the prisons. There is a public desire that people who are sentenced would be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The next term of reference is: to examine all aspects of the regimes observed in the institutions and the facilities available to prisoners and detainees on their release from custody.  There are different prisons.  There are different regimes in different prisons and consequently it is impossible to give a two sentence account of what the typical regime is.  As the system is evolved it seems that the policy for many years now has been to contain people in as humane a way as possible as a priority and secondly, to rehabilitate them.  I would like the committee of inquiry into the prisons to examine these objectives.  There are a number of other objectives which people could list as being appropriate objectives to a prison system.  There are a number of objectives which Senators have mentioned previously. As in the other terms of reference, what I am indicating is the scope which the committee of inquiry have to investigate, to report and to make recommendations. I hope they will concentrate on the regimes within the prisons.  I do not propose to deal with the regimes within the prisons in any major way tonight.  I am not here to defend the regimes.  I am not here to give an account of the regimes within the prisons but, by and large, people in our prisons are dealt with in a humane way.  I hope the committee of inquiry will examine the regimes and that <Col N="370" /> they will make appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins mentioned a figure of £36,000 used in 1976 for education in prisons.  I came across it in one of the reports.  There are fairly widespread educational services available in the prisons now.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a variety of regimes available in the prisons at present.  There is a variety of educational opportunities available but the term of reference here is specifically wide enough so that the committee of inquiry can inquire into the regimes in the prisons and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last term of reference deals with the number and the deployment of the prison service staff, the management structure relating to the operation of the institutions; the recruitment and training of prisons service staff and staff management relations in the prison system.  That area is important also.  For some years past there has been an industrial relations problem within the prisons.  We had a very clear example of it which culminated in an agreement between the Minister and the Department of Justice and the Prison Officers' Association in late 1983. It is important that the committee of inquiry would examine these matters.  It is particularly important because the peace clause in that agreement will last until there is a report by the committee of inquiry into the prisons on these particular aspects, especially on the staff-management <Col N="371" /> relations in the prison service.</P>
    <P>I have asked that the committee of inquiry would report at an early date on these matters.  I hope they will be enabled to provide me with a full report in two years.  If they are not, I will be looking for a report on staff-management relations within the prison system because that is an important part of it.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of the prison system which is not included in the terms of reference is an examination of the causes of crime.  Everything else is included in the terms of reference.  The committee will be quite free to examine everything I have ranged over and more because there is no attempt to tie the hands of this committee of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Many criminologists have written many learned papers on the causes of crime in any society.  The one thing I have noticed about them is that they are not conclusive.  There is no general agreement on why there is a particular level of crime in any society.  Some people have argued that there is a direct relationship between crime and poverty, but that would be to ignore the fact that the vast majority of poor people are never in trouble with the law and many people who are in such trouble are quite well off.</P>
    <P>People also have drawn what I regard as fairly facile conclusions that because we have a high level of unemployment in the country we must have a high crime rate as well.  It may be the coincidence of two phenomena, not necessarily that one is the cause of the other.  There are various theories about why there are very high levels of crime in society, but from what I have read &mdash; I will have to be convinced otherwise &mdash; there is no general agreement among the experts on what causes crime.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to make one final point.  It is a quotation &mdash; I will give the bones of it &mdash; which might be of relevance.</P>
      <P>The only British Royal Commission in history to fail to complete its task was one set up in 1964 to inquire into the prison system.  A third of its members resigned within two years convinced that no set of general principles for the foundation of penal policy could be found.  The commission was then dissolved.</P>
      <P>This may serve as a warning in regard to the difficulties to be faced in discussing the underlying rationale of prisons as distinct from day to day questions of management and conditions.  The only British Royal Commission in history to fail to complete its task was the one into the prison system in 1964.</P>
      <P>It has been argued here that the terms of reference of this committee of inquiry are too restrictive.  They are not restrictive, as I have pointed out.  I freely admit that they do not deal with an examination of the causes of crime in society.  It was a quite conscious decision by me that they would not because, as I said at the outset of these remarks, I want a committee of inquiry that will come forward with a report and will make recommendations on which I can base policy.  It would be very difficult for them to do so in any reasonable period of time which would be of any benefit to the problems facing this society if the terms of reference were any wider than they have been drafted and as I have explained here to this House tonight.  I am sorry for not getting an opportunity to hear further contributions of the Seanad tonight before I actually replied to the debate.  I can see already from some reactions that I have stimulated a number of Senators, and I will sit here and listen to Senators' contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably my first speech without notes, but on the prison system and the adequacies and inadequacies <Col N="373" /> of the prison system I could probably speak for two hours without any notes.  I am quite sure that the Minister has been criticised, and fairly wrongly, for inadequacies in the committee of inquiry into the prison system.  Let me surprise him by saying I will, to some extent, come to his defence, because at least he set up a committee of inquiry into the prison system. Furthermore, by the appointment of the chairman, he has guaranteed to my satisfaction that that committee will make their own independent report and will not be weighed by opinions from various authorities depending on their status or otherwise in society.  I have, on a purely personal level, the height of regard for the chairman of the committee of inquiry.  I have disagreed with him about many things that we discussed when he was a Member of this House. That never interfered with the fact that I regard him as one of the most impressive people, in terms of intellect, ability and personal integrity.  I am perfectly satisfied that his committee will report to the best of their ability.  I am also quite impressed with some of the members of the committee &mdash; those whom I have some personal contact with.  I am not at all satisfied that his committee will produce only one report, I have fairly strong suspicions that there may well be majority and minority reports dissenting on virtually every issue.  I have enough faith in Fr. Peter McVerry to be sure that the views that I hold will be fairly well articulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an element of close to the ludicrous in the way our prison system operates.  To give an example, I have a number of friends who, through their own omission to pay a series of petty fines for petty offences, were about 18 months ago arrested to be sent to Cork prison for the necessary two weeks, one month or two months.  First of all, they had to be sent to Limerick prison, because Cork prison is an annex of Limerick prison. Limerick prison was full so they were sent back to Cork.  Cork prison was full so they were sent to Dublin to Mountjoy. It turned out that Mountjoy was full so they were given train tickets and sent back to Cork free.  I did a quick calculation <Col N="374" /> that the cost of escorts and the cost of travel cost the State about £1,000.  The point I am making is that there are a large number of crimes which by their nature and by the nature of the people who commit them end up with people being, by default, confined to prison.  For all the offences that are associated with the Vagrancy Act, when people are fined £1, £2 or £5 and quite understandably may neglect to pay the fines they are then either confined to prison, ignored or abandoned.</P>
    <P>There is something in what the Minister said about the prison system and about the causes of crime which is a little bit too trite.  I agree that there is no clear universal agreement about the causes of crime.  There are differences between what causes crime in affluent Sweden and what causes crime in a poverty stricken country in South America.  There is a difference between what causes crime in the United States of America, without a welfare state, and what causes crime in Sweden with the welfare state.  There is yet again a difference between what causes crime in this country, with an inadequate welfare state, a large young population and spiralling unemployment, but the fact that the experts cannot agree is not a reason to ignore the question of what causes crime.</P>
    <P>We have to do what we can to find out what causes crime.  While it may be true, as the Minister says &mdash; I am sure it is &mdash; that the vast majority of poor people never come into contact with the law, it is equally true, and even more demonstrable, that the vast majority of the people in prison are poor and are not just marginally poor but are appallingly poor. The vast majority of prisoners are effectively illiterate.  A large number of them are innumerate.  Most of them lack any skills.  Many of them can only be categorised as unemployable.  Many of them have drink problems.  Many of them come from families with problems of marital breakdown and family violence, and many come from families where there is a long history of criminal activity. Most of them come from areas which are clearly, and without any shadow of argument, identifiable as deprived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> In the canons of logic it does not prove that poverty causes crime, but it quite clearly proves that those who come before the courts and are convicted of crime are by and large poor.  As Senator Robinson quite rightly interjected, that might well be because a large number of white collar crimes are not the sort of thing that people end up being sent to prison for.  That is another side of the values of our society.  That does not avoid the issue that those who are in prison are poor, those who are in prison are those at the bottom of our society, and those who are in prison are those who have least and have got least.  Whether their poverty caused their crime or not is not the critical issue.  The critical issue is that those who are in prison are people who, by definition, in a caring and compassionate society could be regarded as least culpable for the offences they committed because they had least to gain from our society.  They have got less from our society than anybody else.  They had not availed of the services that the rest of us take for granted.  They had lived in housing that none of us would dream of spending a night in.  Many of them are effectively homeless.  That is the truth of the matter about crime.</P>
    <P>I cannot prove that proverty causes crime but we can prove beyond any shadow of doubt that those who end up in prison are poor.  This ought to underline and qualify the whole philosophy and attitude to people who are in prison. Therefore, the Minister's most regrettable remarks during the admittedly outrageous problems in Mountjoy Prison, that the people who were in Mountjoy were the sort of people &mdash; I gather the Minister was quoting Shakespeare &mdash; who would cut your throat in a church and walk away smiling, was an offence to the vast majority of the decent people in Mountjoy prison who were there for petty offences and who would never, by and large, raise a hand to anybody in their lives.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Minister would say this on the spur of the moment but I, as a person who has a certain commitment to those in the margins of our society, <Col N="376" /> do not believe that even prisoners, who are so far outside the canons of normal behaviour justify a Minister making a remark such as this about them. It was not in the Minister's character to say so.  It does nothing to help to develop an enlightened approach to our prisoners. The number of people in our prisons who could be regarded as potentially violent, outside of Portlaoise prison, which we would all accept is a rather exceptional prison, is quite small.  The number of those who could be regarded as a serious threat of the kind the Minister indicated is even smaller.</P>
    <P>The one common characteristic of those who are in our prisons is that they are poor and are outside the structures of our society and they have suffered most and, even in times of affluence, they have got least and in times of recession they suffer most.  They are the least likely to be employed and the most likely to be unemployed.  They are the least likely to avail of education, the most likely to leave school before they are 15 years of age.  They are the least likely to have a skill and the most likely to be unskilled. They are the least likely even to be numerate in a society where numeracy is taken for granted.  They are the most likely to be without even the basic skills of addition, substraction, multiplication and division.  They are the people in our prisons and the people who need to be considered not just as a remedy to the fears of the rest of society about crime but as a group who, by any standards, are marginalised and a specific and needy group in our soceity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Committee of Inquiry into the Prison System will address the problem in those terms and not in terms of prison as some sort of retribution for society.  When a lot of the rhetoric of prisons is taken away we know that prison is not a deterrent.  I would like to hear the Minister's views as to whether prison is a deterrent.  There is a fairly overwhelming amount of evidence, both academically and from my own experience, that whether an offence carries a sentence of three months, six months or two years, it is of minimal deterrent value to those who are liable to <Col N="377" /> commit the offence.  The major deterrent is the possibility of being caught, not the subsequent penalty.  In this context, therefore, the whole idea of prison and increased prison sentences as a remedy for our crime problem is inconsistent and inconclusive and does not stand up to objective analysis.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a minority of people who must be kept in prison to protect society from them because they are a threat to society and because they are dangerous.  The evidence of the sort of things people are sent to prison for suggests that a large number of our prisoners do not come into that category. Therefore, one has to come to the conclusion that people are in prison so that society can be seen to be exacting retribution for crimes that people have committed. That is very close to getting our own back on people for the crimes they have committed.</P>
    <P>We need to look very courageously and imaginatively at the whole idea of whether prisons work.  Would our society be that much more crime-ridden if we did not have large numbers of people suffering custodial sentences?  If the community service order scheme were extended dramatically and in large numbers to almost all of those who are in prison for sentences of less than 12 months would the crime rate be that much different?  I suspect it would not because I do not believe that prisons work.</P>
    <P>It is a rather extraordinary fact that our prison service is costing us about three times as much as the total amount of property stolen in any given 12 month period.  It is an ironic fact that we could deal with the same people at considerably less expense, but there is a problem as to whether society, as it presently stands, would tolerate such a method of dealing with crime.  There appears to be at the back of it all an element of necessary retribution, that we have to be seen to be doing something to those people who do something to us.  If we are to develop an enlightened attitude to prisoners and to those who commit crime, we have to think of much more imaginative remedies that prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> When something close to one-third of all indictable offences are attributed by the gardaí to people aged 17 or less, then the uselessness of prison in dealing with a large part of our crime becomes even more apparent.  When we realise that that section of our society is increasing rapidly and it is quite likely that if crime is attributable to them, it will become more frequent, and even more so, alternatives to prison will have to be examined.  When we look at the allocation of funds within the prison budget the minute sums that are allocated to anything other than the payment of salaries for prison officers are quite frightening.</P>
    <P>We have the most policed prison system in Europe, with more prison officers per prisoner.  One would think we had the most frightening crime rate in Europe.  At the same time the Institute of Public Administration, a State agency, are advising the American students who are now working with many Members of the Oireachtas that Ireland is a relatively crime-free place where they can walk safely on the streets.  At the same time we are spending more <i>per capita</i> on prisoners than virtually any other country in Europe, not on rehabilitation, training or education, but just on keeping them there for no purpose other than that we believe they need to be kept there, for no better reason than we have no other ideas.</P>
    <P>Prisons do not work.  They are there because society cannot think of a better way of dealing with people who break the law.  There are, and there must be, better remedies, and underlying it all must be the fact that, in a particular way, prisoners are important because they are the most extreme manifestation of what it is to be poor.  They are the poor most manifest in our society.  They are the poor who probably cannot cope with their poverty. They are the poor who are most affronted by the inequalities of our society and who have suffered to the extent of no longer being able to cope because of bad housing, bad education, poor skills, lack of literacy and lack of numberacy. When all the thumping is finished about crime and law and order it will still be the poor who will end up in prison <Col N="379" /> unless we really begin to look not just at academic arguments about what causes crime but at the fact that most prisoners come from bad housing and therefore we must deal with this, that most prisoners come from poor educational backgrounds and, therefore, we must deal with poor educational services, and that most prisoners are innumerate and illiterate and we must do something about this if they must be in prison, while they are in prison.  This is the way forward to deal with our prison system.  It is the courage to become compassionate to a group who are most unpopular in society.  That is what political leadership is all about, to be compassionate and caring where there are no votes and where there is no popularity and the popularity lies in the other extreme, because the other extreme provides no solution.</P>

      <P>I wonder, in our discussion on our prisons, when the committee of inquiry report, whether there will be some place laid aside for contributions to be made by the prisoners themselves. When we talk about the unemployed we very often do not have at our table for our deliberations representatives from the unemployed.  We very often have representatives from the employed.  When we talk about the mentally disabled, as we often do, we invite contributions from the people about whom we are talking in order to increase our awareness of the problem.  Not only do we need to get inside the prisons and the prison system but we also need to try to get inside the prisoners.  We could also give the prisoners an opportunity to get inside us, what is inside us that wishes to designate a certain section of society as criminal and to isolate them.  To what extent is that necessary?  What are we doing about the causes?  What are we doing about the condition in which we have placed them, and what are we going to do when we reintegrate them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I should like to ask is &mdash; I am sure not all TDs and Senators have been in a prison &mdash; out of what type of social background and what type of social condition does a prisoner come? <Col N="380" /> We want to know what actually happens in the prisons.  We want to know what happens to the prisoner as a person as a result of the time he is in the prison.  We should also like to know &mdash; perhaps this is more important than all the others &mdash; how does society react when that person comes out of prison?  Do we have enough knowledge and sufficient awareness?  In order to have the knowledge we must have research.  Is there in any of our universities a department of criminology? Has anyone considered setting up such a department so that we can at least obtain knowledge and relate that knowledge to what is happening elsewhere in the world and start studying the causes and effects of crime, the results of incarceration in prison, the effects of imprisonment?</P>
    <P>With regard to awareness, it comes back to what I have said so often in this House.  How are we going to give back to the people of Ireland, both South and North, a much greater sense of community so that they become aware in the community in which they live who are in prison, why they are there and what they are going to do about them when they come out?  I should like to put forward a few proposals which I hope may be taken up by the committee of inquiry.  Some years ago at an international congress on medical ethics, I dared to suggest that the prison doctor was on the horns of a dilemma in any part of the world where there is either social or national conflict. He is paid by the State and when he goes into a prison and has to assess not only whether the prisoner has a disease and how to prevent it but the state of health of that prisoner, his reaction inevitably, in different parts of the world to a greater or lesser degree, will be influenced not only by the fact that his employer sent him in to see the prisoner but also on how he relates to the State which has put the prisoner in the position he is in.  I suggested at that time that this is too great a dilemma for an individual to cope with on his own.  Yet the prison doctor is perhaps one of the greatest sources of information to the public, the families and to the rest of the medical profession that we can have in relation to <Col N="381" /> the health and home of the prisoner, how he is being treated and how it is affecting him inside the prison.</P>
    <P>The point which I made at the time and for which I was greatly criticised was that we need to have a professional institution to which such a person, who may at different times and in different countries, for very different reasons, feel very isolated, can relate, so that he has a source of authority which will give him strength to come out of prison and say: &ldquo;This is wrong, this prisoner is not being rehabilitated, he is suffering psychiatrically because of incarceration, he has been man-handled&rdquo; and so on.  I related this proposal to what is one of the central points of the medical ethic, the one-to-one relationship that should exist between the doctor and the client.  It was interesting that Lord Smith of Marlowe, when President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, in his Bradford oration, made this very point, but he was making it in relation to the fact that Barbara Castle at that time was getting in between what he felt were the rights of the profession and the rights of the patient, particularly in relation to private medicine.  I thought his statement on the medical ethic was excellent, but if it was excellent it must apply in every situation. I suggested that it was almost impossible, as long as prison and police doctors were left on their own, for them in states of stress, and in situations where there is social or ethnic conflict, to be able to carry out their duties fearlessly.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point, what sort of an institution would one consider?  I am thinking in terms of it being related to criminologists &mdash; I have already alluded to the possibility of a department of criminology in one of our universities &mdash; that we should also have some means whereby the prisoner's own family doctor must be obliged by law to have access to him on, say, a two-monthly basis.  We would need to have the families of prisoners represented.  We would need to have ex-prisoners represented and we would need to have social workers represented. Above all, we must ensure that this institution must be completely divorced from the people who run the <Col N="382" /> prisons even though one would also expect, reasonably, to have a representative from those institutions, but they must not be under their control.</P>
    <P>I also suggested in that lecture that as far as our profession was concerned it was necessary, because of the amount of torture that is now going on in prisons throughout the world, to relate this to an international network or an international federation for the promotion of health in prisons and among prisoners for their reintegration into society, and that anyone who broke the code or who was reported for breaking the code would cease to belong to that international brotherhood of medical men; that any country that could not produce the institution which would take responsibility for promoting the health and integration of the prisoner would also, after a period of trial, be suspended from that international brotherhood.  I am inter-mixing two things: one, the need for a far-seeing authority to discuss the whole area of crime, prisons and the prisoner and the re-integration of the prisoner, and the other specific to my own profession and not just in Ireland but perhaps more so in other parts of the world, where he or she is more vulnerable to political pressure than might be the case from time to time here.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make a plea for more research.  Different Senators have referred to this.  We want to look into the effects of the environment, the class issue, the effects of urbanisation, unemployment, social alienation and so forth, the inconsistencies in the way in which we apply our justice, how is it that some people appear to get short sentences and others get longer.  Maybe it is the luck of the draw but we need to look at that and try to understand it better. We need to make a study of prisons by prisoners and to have a prisoner input into our debate.  We certainly need to insist &mdash; and this has been mentioned previously by a Senator &mdash; that the legal profession, and in particular the judges, make a positive effort to get into the prisons and to see what it is like to be a prisoner.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we had no prisons in Ireland <Col N="383" /> today and suddenly thought that we must invent something new to cope with crime and violance, what would we create? I am quite certain with the degree of social enlightenment we now have that we would be interested in trying to compensate for the defects in the person who committed the crime to make him less likely to repeat that crime.  We would also be trying to see how we can equip him to develop his talent so that he can go back into society with more confidence. Perhaps the best example of this was that of Jim Boyle &mdash; many of you will have seen him on television or read about him &mdash; who spent most of his life in prison until he went into a more sophisticated prison with more opportunity for self-development, with a greater feeling that people were concerned about why he was there and how he should develop as a person.  He ultimately married a prison psychiatrist and only in recent weeks has been in Belfast, and perhaps even in Dublin, talking about his experience and making a plea for a much more enlightened attitude towards the prisoner and prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand I have 15 minutes to conclude, so I must use my time with more economy and more expedition than on the occasion when I moved this motion.  Last week I quoted Michael Ignatieff's book <i>A Just Measure of Pain,</i> The Penitentiary in the Industrial Revolution 1750-1850, published by MacMillan in 1978.  I want to open my summary by saying that it concludes with this sentence: &ldquo;As much as anything else, it is this suffocating vision of the past that legitimizes the abuses of the present and seeks to adjust us to the cruelties of the future.&rdquo;  There are no more dangerous people in society than those who want to develop attitudes and responses to present difficulties out of context, out of social context, out of historical context, out of comparative context.  It is with no joy that I hear so much scholarship that has been put into print in so many languages, dismissed so easily at the realistic <Col N="384" /> corpus of work of scholars who cannot reach agreement.</P>
      <P>I want to begin with my more positive, not charitable but fair remarks.  When I moved this motion I made reference to a tradition of lack of co-operation of the Department of Justice with the MacBride Commission in particular.  Fairness requires me to say that there is a report published since, the report on The Prison System for The Council for Social Welfare, a Committee of the Catholic Bishops Conference, published in 1983, which acknowledges the utmost co-operation between the Department of Justice and the researchers involved.  I equally want to acknowledge that in that report &mdash; and I did not mention it in the beginning &mdash; was the suggestion that there is a commitment to research in the number of projects actually under way on alternatives to prisons.  I acknowledge those facts now but it gives me no pleasure to hear trotted out again the only comment made when the MacBride Commission's report was published, that we had got the figure on education in prisons wrong.  I have heard that figure quoted more than once and I put now on the record of the House what I said in an interjection.  It was the only comment of the Minister of the day to the report when it was published. I corrected it on the record of the other House and suggested that other figures, for example, part of the Estimates of the Department of Education, should be taken into account.  It is not very helpful to be trotting out that old lame, daft, little pernickety criticism as a response to a genuine body of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am winding up and in so far as it has not been done so far, I want to thank my colleagues on the MacBride Commission because they have not been thanked by anybody other than those who were involved in the research community on crime.  I want to read out who they are: Seán MacBride, myself, Senator Gemma Hussey, Michael Keating, TD, Dr. Mary McAleese, Patrick McEntee SC, Dr. Mícheál Mac Gréil, SJ, Matt Merrigan, Muireann Ó Briain and Una O'Higgins-O'Malley. I put my thanks at least on the record of the House to that commission for work which was done voluntarily, <Col N="385" /> which drew them the remark that they were a self-appointed commission, work that drew them the only single sentence comment of the Minister of the day, that they had go the figures wrong and that the figure should have been worked differently. I say thank you to that group.</P>
    <P>I want to thank all the Senators who have spoken on this motion.  I want to thank in particular the Minister who comes as the Minister for Justice who announced an investigation into the prison system.  I thank him for that and I want to end this preface to my conclusion by saying that I hope that we are in days of better co-operation between those whose professional task it is to manage custody in our society and those who want simply to be allowed to investigate options, to look at the nature and causes of crime.  The motion before this House speaks about a commission that would report on all aspects of crime.  The Minister has acknowledged that the new Whitaker committee, which incidentally I wish success, will not investigate the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>As a practitioner for nearly two decades in this field I must reject that there is any confusion about the question of the causes of crime.  I will make it explicit. Since 1912 there is an agreed literature in criminology on the connection between the rate of unemployment, for example, and poverty and the rate of crime.  No serious scholar ever said that to be poor will make you a criminal, but every serious study for nearly 100 years has said that there is a connection between the rate of poverty, the rate of unemployment and the rate of crime.  The record of 100 books, of 1,000 articles, tells us that.  It is casuistry to suggest that because every poor person does not become a criminal you can prove no connection between poverty and unemployment and crime.  We deserve better.  We deserve a proper investigation of the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>We will read Senators' comments in the record.  Senator Robinson addressed the question of the legal process &mdash; incidentally, there is no clear indication in the terms of reference that it will be examined.  What of the people who come <Col N="386" /> before the different levels of the legal system?  What of the internal mobility points between the criminal justice system? I am glad there is somebody on the committee who will have looked at that in some detail, Dr. David Rottman.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch spoke about the urbanisation of our society and its effect on the crime rate.  Senator O'Leary made a generous supporting speech about the importance of a broad approach being taken. I was moved by Senator Fitzsimmons' comment about what happens in prisons, describing the case of a child who witnessed its father being removed to prison. Senator Robb developed the importance of a department of criminology supporting my plea for future research.</P>
    <P>I opened my speech by saying we need to ask how did we come to take prison as an option?  Historically there is a connection between the industrial society and the form of the prison in relation to the notion that you would have hard labour, but how did we come to measure time? How much of one's privacy should we take away, and for how long?  There is a historical moment in which views were developed on that issue.  I pose the question again; do we have prisons to punish, to exact retribution, in its worst form to see revenge take place, or do we have prisons for rehabilitation?  Which are the core points of the Irish penal policy?  I hope the new committee will be able to answer these questions.  There has always been an easy excuse available in Ireland in relation to approaching prisons.  Since the foundation of this State we have had political prisoners, but because we have had political prisoners and because there is a political element to crime and to prisons, we do not have an automatic excuse available for not publishing works, for not allowing research on prisons on a general basis.</P>
    <P>There is a need, and I repeat it, for the new committee to report on the adequacy &mdash; obviously it is now outside its terms of reference &mdash; in the case of the Department and the inadequacy of the statistics.  The Minister quoted, for example, comparative statistics.  I looked at those statistics a month ago and they are quite confusing.  He identified the flaws <Col N="387" /> in them himself; some include people on remand and others do not; flaws in international comparative statistics, flaws internally, flaws in whether, for example, the same person had been apprehended for several crimes, more than once and so on.  There is a need for adequate statistics. There is a need to guard ourselves against a false apprehension as to what the true rate of crime is.  I want to draw attention to John Clemens book <i>Polls, Politics and Populism</i> published by Gower Press in 1983.  On page 65 of that book Mr. David Howell, the Conservative Party spokesman on Home Affairs, said at the Young Conservatives' Conference:</P>
    <P>The Conservative Party will win the next election on its policies.  We in the Conservative Party know [sic] very well that our policies are completely in tune with both the national needs and the national mood...</P>
    <P>There are issues that cause the nation profound concern.  Chief amongst these is the boom in crime, violence and delinquency that is so disfiguring our country...</P>
    <P>There follows in that book a description about how the law and order issue got written into the Tory Party's election manifesto and was able to win votes.  One of the reasons I put this motion on the Order Paper of the Seanad was to stop a false concern developing and to stop in its tracks the possibility of people exploiting either fear or ignorance on the basis of reaction.  There is a responsibility for the media in relation to crime.</P>
    <P>I omitted to mention Senator Ryan's contribution in which he drew attention to the poverty atmosphere in which people are apprehended, plead their case, are processed and are treated.  I know the Minister who is so courteous to me in all my dealings with him will excuse me if I differ with him profoundly when he suggests in the course of his remarks that every case coming before the courts is a different case.  It is not.  Above all else, in the best book available on young offenders &mdash;&ldquo;Youth and Justice, Young Offenders in Ireland&rdquo;, edited by Helen <Col N="388" /> Burke, Claire Carney and Geoffrey Cook, 1981 &mdash; the figures come out again and again, they are the semi-skilled and those in lower occupations.  They are people who have members of their families in trouble; they have literacy and educational problems and so on.  The similarities in all those people are overwhelming. The late Ian Hart, of the ERSI, a man whose memory I so respect, showed us in one piece of work after another in the sixties and seventies that people committed crimes in groups and that the peer group was important.  This tells us that you have a choice in motions of this kind, to choose to understand or to try to control.</P>
    <P>We are living in times of high unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, times in which people are under great pressure.  If you choose to control by ignoring the social setting in which you do it, you are laying the basis for revolution, a revolution that is probably justified. If, on the other hand, you seek to understand you must ask the question: why are people in difficulty?  Why, for example, do we not have a genuinely interdisciplinary, interdepartmental report?  I saw one piece of research three years ago which showed that in one district 80 per cent of people who came before the juvenile courts were people with school attendance problems.  Could we not have intervened earlier with assistance to those families, to those communities to stop them having to come into the penal system?  Unfortunately, our thinking is old and inflexible and we are in danger of alienating those who genuinely want to do research on this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope we will begin a new era with the Whitaker commitee because it is important for all of us.  Some might say that I have minimised the victims of crime.  The victims of crime are not confined to a class; they are among the working class.  We know, for example that the sums of money stolen to feed the drug habit are often very small.  But violence is violence, and prison without alternatives is a form of institutionalised violence. To say regularly to poorer sections of the community and to the unemployed: <Col N="389" />&ldquo;We will contain this option, we will proceed with this option and seek to manage it better&rdquo; is, to my mind, to encourage further violence.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking all those who have contributed, but asking for at least the compassion of which Senator Brendan Ryan spoke, not only for the prisoners but might I ask also for respect for our scholarship, for what we know.  Senator Robb suggested that we need an institute of criminology.  What about the printed body of research and reflection from the first moment that a person justifies a prison?  I plead with this House that always respected ideas to consider the concept of prisons.  If we want to be positive, we should be thinking this evening beyond the prisons.  We should be thinking about how in our hearts we can perhaps ask ourselves the question: the society for which we are asking so much control, what is wrong in its structure that we have to do this to so many people who have so few privileges?</P>
    <P>I thank you for your concession in allowing me an extra minute.  I repeat my hope: may this committee work and may it not confine itself to the terms of reference because it is necessary that it go beyond the terms of reference if we are to have any semblance of justice.</P>

      <P>I put down this motion because it needed serious consideration and immediate action.  I had not given much thought to who might be taking the question from the Government side, but I am delighted to see Deputy Donnellan, the newly appointed Minister of State at <Col N="390" /> the Department of Health, here tonight. He realises the seriousness of the problem. However, I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Desmond, is not here to hear my remarks on this most serious question.</P>
      <P>This motion has nothing to do with the general motion by the Fianna Fáil Party. I want to make it quite clear that I am referring to the maternity unit and the general practices in the Regional Hospital Galway.  I am a member of the health board.  It is a most frustrating and difficult job to try to provide the services on the funds made available to the board, particularly this year, but although this is a serious situation there is an even more serious one.</P>
      <P>About four years ago a contract for the extension of the maternity unit in the Regional Hospital Galway was completed. A beautiful new building costing approximately £4 million was erected. Part of that unit has been used to try to create some facilities for a hospital that is already overcrowded.  The maternity wing is overcrowded for two reasons, first, the unit available to the community in Tuam closed and, second, the unit at the private hospital &mdash; Calvary Hospital &mdash; closed also.  Immediately there was pressure on the maternity unit of the Galway Regional Hospital.  The health board have asked for money to be made available so that staff can be appointed. From trainee nursing posts to senior posts, we need 75 staff appointed at an average wage of about £7,500 per annum. We have already bought some of the equipment and about £250,000 worth of extra equipment is needed, not all of it immediately but some of it quite urgently, to provide proper facilities at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks ago last Friday, 70 expectant mothers arrived and were admitted to the already overcrowded hospital. That night there were at least five mothers in labour in the hospital corridors. This situation does not occur every day, but it has occurred more than once and is occurring more often as time goes on.  The reason this is happening is that we have no other unit to serve the population of 125,000, with the exception of <Col N="391" /> a small unit in Portiuncula Hospital which serves Offaly, Roscommon, and Westmeath and only a small portion of our county.</P>
    <P>We have begged and beseeched the Minister to give us the money required to make this facility &mdash; which was built at enormous expense &mdash; available to the public, but we have been consistently refused.  Dr. Donnelly, to whom I listened at health board meetings, said that the Regional Hospital is the second best acute hospital in these islands.  He compared it to St. James's Hospital in Dublin. At the most recent health board meeting he gave the following figures which show the bias that exists against the west of Ireland.  The Regional Hospital cost £19 million to run last year; St. James's Hospital in Dublin &mdash; comparable in size, capacity and throughput &mdash; cost the State £25 million.  The admission rate to the Regional Hospital for an expenditure of £19 million was 21,000 patients; for £6 million more the admissions to St. James's Hospital were 14,000 patients. We were giving almost double the value for money spent.  This year our expenditure was cut by £4.5 million while the Eastern Health Board's expenditure was cut by only £3 million.  We have 70,000 outpatients in the region; the figure for the Eastern Health Board area is almost insignificant.  Last Friday a senior official from the Department of Health came down and asked us if we could cut the services to outpatients.  People may make up their own minds about that suggestion.</P>
    <P>We have a cat-scanner in the Regional Hospital which cost £500,000.  They have a cat-scanner in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.  The Western Health Board asked for a staff of five to operate the cat-scanner.  The request was refused; yet St. Vincent's Hospital have staff approval for seven.  I do not begrudge them.  That may be a decoy I do not understand but I do not see why a bias exists against us.</P>
    <P>I make those comparisons because I want to point out clearly to this House and to the Minister of State present that the situation cannot and will not be tolerated in Galway.  We cannot adjust any <Col N="392" /> more to facilitate the Department of Health.  I am beseeching the Minister of State &mdash; who happens to be a Deputy for that constituency &mdash; to take this matter in hand and to give a favourable and proper response to the needs of our county.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and Labour, are working together in Government at present and any issue arising on the eastern side of this country is not alone well pressed, but efforts are made to ensure that in the event of any abnormality arising the Ministers responsible, or some of them who assume responsibility, will even test the efforts of the national television network to make the case.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I heard the Minister who has responsibility for women in the Government, Deputy Fennell, on a programme talking about womanhood and motherhood.  Would she tell the people of the west of Ireland and the people of County Galway in particular what she understands by womanhood and motherhood? Will she sit in a Government who refuse to give us the money and allow mothers to be in such a state on the corridors of our major hospital or could she twist the arm of the Taoiseach who might have a conversation with the Health Minister, Barry Desmond and ask him to release the money to us to stop this horrible performance?  We are living in 1984 and this cannot be tolerated. There are important issues in this land but there is no issue as important as that. It is a serious situation in our county.  No effort is being made by anybody in the administration in Dublin to come to our aid.  Senator Michael Higgins knows exactly what I am talking about because he is a member of the board as well.  I am sure he will concur with every word I say.</P>

      <P>And hope for it soon, and by &ldquo;soon&rdquo; I mean immediately, within the next two weeks.  The Minister himself, Deputy Desmond, paid a visit recently to our city and went to our hospital to examine it.  He saw it for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> I am sure he did not close an eye when he was passing by the maternity unit.  He could not because the situation prevailing is obvious to anyone.  Then we have the Eastern Health Board.  I do not want to make the comparison.  How many maternity hospitals are in this city?  There must be about 20.  And we have but one hospital in the whole county dealing with a population of about 125,000 people.  We cannot get a single penny to open a new maternity unit despite the fact that it is built.  It is the most ludicrous, shameful, disgraceful performance by any Minister for Health, by any Government, I have ever witnessed in my life.  I do not comprehend it.  I cannot understand it.  I do not understand why the Minister, Deputy Donnellan, is not thumping his fist on the table of the Minister to give expression to this matter because he knows about it too.  I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, has him tucked away in a little corner and says, &ldquo;come in today&rdquo; and &ldquo;go out tomorrow&rdquo;.  I do not know what the situation is with Minister Donnellan and his Minister.  It is about time he made this demand on behalf of all the people, immaterial of what their politics might be.  We will not and cannot tolerate such a situation.</P>
    <P>I am ashamed to say that such a situation prevails in our community.  I am ashamed, as a public representative, to think that we in the west and particularly in Galway are treated in such a manner, that the mothers of our county are left in such a predicament.  It horrifies me to think that we claim, as public representatives, of one kind or another, to be looking after the needs of our people and we allow this intolerable situation to continue. I have only given a few instances but I could go on for hours.  The point I want to make is that whatever about the other cuts and whatever about the medical cuts that may be made to the Western Health Board this is not a cut that can be tolerated any longer.  I trust and hope that the Minister for Health now under pressure not alone from this House but from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Donnellan, will give us what we need immediately and not have us coming to this city in deputation <Col N="394" /> begging and beseeching as if we were not entitled to treatment for our people.  To quote the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, we should appreciate motherhood and womanhood. Deputy Fennell's performance and her party's performance in our county is an absolute disgrace.  Thank you.</P>

      <P>Senator Robb, I think as Senator Killilea has finished a few minutes before his time and you have indicated you would like to speak, you could do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well how Senator Killilea feels.  I moved from a large hospital complex to a smaller area about ten years ago and I found on arrival there that four girls working in the theatre were asked to do 186 operative procedures per month, of which 32 were major procedures. The theatre which I had left and in which there were ten non-medical people working did 86 operative procedures per month of which only 27 were major.  It begged the question, as Senator Killilea has begged, whether centralisation of the services was necessarily more effective, more efficient, more econonomic, as we have been led to believe it was.</P>
      <P>As regards the four unfortunate women who were having their babies in the corridor in 1984, I would venture to suggest that by 2084, if not a lot sooner, many women will be having their babies in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point I would make is that it is high time we looked at the way in which power has been centralised and hoarded within the medical institutions.  I would ask Senator Killilea, through you, a Chathaoirligh, while feeling sympathetic towards his case and indeed without knowing the details of what has happened in the west, particularly the way he has compared the scale of resources available in the east to that available in the west, whether Galway city itself may, at some time in the past, have been to some degree guilty of the very thing of which Dublin is guilty, in relation to Galway in relation to its own smaller communities. That is a point very dear to my heart, the <Col N="395" /> way in which Belfast looked at Ballymena, the way in which Ballymena looked at Ballymoney, and we were at the end of that line with no power and no access to the levers of power and felt, to a much greater degree than has been described by Senator Killilea, defenceless and indeed frustrated and angry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to draw the attention of the House to a point I have made elsewhere and which I think needs to go on the record of this House.  Professor James McCormick of this city has stated that 80 to 90 per cent of all ill-health should be within the compass of the appropriately trained family doctor &mdash; he emphasises &ldquo;appropriately&rdquo;&mdash; provided he relates positively to the other health delivering agencies in his community, relates positively as an equal and not as a prima donna.  Rex Laurie, a distinguished consultant at Guys Hospital in London, at the end of his days, when he had left that hospital, stated that 80 to 90 per cent of all hospitalised ill health should be within the compass of the smaller hospital, and he included accident and emergency treatment also, provided the people serving those hospitals were appropriately trained.  This, in effect, means that only 10 to 15 per cent of hospitalised medicine or 1 to 2 per cent of all ill health requires super technology and super specialisation.  The question I pose and the question to which we should all address ourselves in relation to the problems posed by Senator Killilea is, why is almost all the power to determine undergraduate attitudes, post graduate training profiles and the patronage in relation to the placing of consultants in their final posts in the hands of those whose main concern is with that very important element in medical practice, the 10 to 15 per cent that does require super special, super technology medicine or the one to two per cent of ill health that requires it.</P>
    <P>The important issue he has raised is part of a much greater problem as to how we look at the whole area of health and disease.  We should ask ourselves if we have not become a little bit too obsessed with curing disease when there is so much <Col N="396" /> yet to be done and so many of our resources need yet to be put in the direction of prevention but to remind ourselves that we have barely started to look at the problem of promotion of health. Promotion of health involves communities looking at themselves and feeling confident that in the community in which people live there are indeed the resources to deal with the 80 to 90 per cent of hospitalised ill health that they require in their own community or the much greater percentage of total ill health.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Killilea and Senator Robb for their contributions.  It would be fair to say that some of the points made by Senator Robb would be hard to disagree with.  Some more of his expressions of opinion would be more appropriate to a debate on an Estimate for the Department of Health.  Some type of opportunity such as that should be given to Senators so that they could go into broader areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea was indisposed recently and I am glad to see him back on his feet.  I wish him a long and healthy life.  He referred to staffing ratios <i>vis-à-vis</i> Galway and St. James'.  He could have picked some other hospitals that would show the direct opposite.  There is no question about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to outline for Senators the global position regarding the financing of the health services in 1984.  A few days ago the Minister for Health moved in the Dáil an Estimate for Health in excess of £1 billion.  This figure <Col N="397" /> represents about 7.3 per cent of GNP, a percentage incidentally which is higher than that of our nearest neighbour Britain. I should also mention that expenditure on the health services in Ireland has grown from £400 million in 1978 to an estimated £1,064 million in the current year.  This represents an increase in a six year period of 166 per cent.  In terms of percentage of GNP the growth over the six-year period was 6.2 per cent in 1978 to approximately 7.3 per cent in the current year.</P>
      <P>The serious problem which arises from the increasing cost of providing and delivering our current level of health services is a source of major concern to the Government and to the Minister as well. We have now reached the point where further improvement in the health services can only be brought about by a critical scrutiny by all parties involved of the existing pattern of services.  Changed circumstances may render some services of less relevance than they were before. Emerging priorities must be honestly faced up to and recognition given to the fact that resources may have to be diverted to areas of high priority.  Above all those responsible must resist the temptation of calling for more money and more heads of staff in a situation where the public purse can no longer accommodate such demands.  I should not have to bring these issues to the attention of Senators but unfortunately the seriousness of the present situation where it is no longer possible to plough more and more funds into health, has not yet sunk home in certain quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation at Galway is that the new maternity unit provided at a cost of approximately £4 million is now fully complete.  The unit comprises 23 maternity beds and 8 gynaecological beds together with a delivery suite, a neo-natal unit and an outpatient department.  To date part of the delivery suite and part of the neo-natal unit have been occupied and put into use by the redeployment of existing staff.  The Western Health Board has sought 75 extra heads of staff to commission the whole unit.  However, I am fully convinced &mdash; and this is the line which my Department has taken with the <Col N="398" /> board &mdash; that the entire unit can be brought into use by redeployment.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that the number of births in the area has not at all increased to the extent which the demands for additional staff would imply.  There are indications in Galway as elsewhere of a levelling off of the number of live births.  I should stress that what is available in the new unit in Galway are very much improved facilities to cope with a service which is being provided at present.  While I concede that the design of the unit is such as to demand somewhat more staff than are currently engaged at the existing maternity unit I do not believe it is beyond the ingenuity of the board and their management team to divert staff and resources from areas of lesser priority to enable the unit to be commissioned.</P>

      <P>I know that recently the board have been seeking my Department's approval for the suppression of a number of posts in order to facilitate the creation of posts to cater for other services in the board's area.  The board tell me that the opening of the maternity unit is their top priority.  It logically follows that they should be willing to make the necesary adjustments to enable the unit to be utilised.  I am aware that conditions in the existing unit are far from ideal.  However, the board must tackle the problem.  They have already been notified of a revenue allocation for 1984 of £93.7 million.  There are simply no extra funds available to supplement that figure at present.  In the present situation the Cabinet have had to make extremely tough decisions.  The Minister for Health has made hard decisions and those decisions he has made he intends to stand over.  It is now up to the Western Health Board and their officials to so manage their affairs that the improved facilities <Col N="399" /> at Galway can be made available to the mothers of the area.</P>

It is an absolute fallacy.  What the civil service are telling the Minister on this issue is untrue.  I beseech and beg Minister Donnellan to make a visit to the Western Health Board to examine the situation himself.  He has been told a bag of lies by the civil service.  We were insulted on Monday by a letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Department and it certainly is time the Minister took it in hand himself.</P>
