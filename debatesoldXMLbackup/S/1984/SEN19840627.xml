      <P>I have notice from Senator Patrick Durcan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious delays in considering and finalising applications by small farmers for unemployment assistance and appeals from such decisions where same are filed.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and if time is still available before 5.30 p.m., to resume motion No. 4 and to take with motion No. 4 motion No. 5 which has been put down since the debate was opened on motion No. 4.  Senators will recall that at the time the House was anxious to debate developments in the EEC, the report on developments in the last six months of 1983 was not available.  It has since become available and consequently motion No. 5 has been put down.  My suggestion to the House is that both these motions should be debated together.  It is proposed to take No. 6 from 6.30 until 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>I presume it is intended to deal with the Second Stages of No. 1 and No. 3 and to finish No. 2 today.  I am glad that the Twenty-Third Report is finally before the House.  Since we agreed to discuss the 1983 developments, it is as well to let the debate continue.  I would like the Leader of the House to give an indication of the Order of Business for tomorrow and, if possible, what business we will be taking between now and the end of this session.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on an apology made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the American Government on the flag-burning incident outside Leinster House. It appeared as if Members of the Seanad were not exonerated from blame for this abhorrent incident.</P>

      <P>As regards items Nos. 1 and 3, there is not a substantial amount for Committee Stage debate on these Bills.  My suggestion would be that we complete the Second Stage today.  It might be possible to take Committee Stage tomorrow morning.  I do not think there is any necessity to put it off for a week.  That would be my proposal at the conclusion of Second Stage.  Apart from these short Committee Stages tomorrow, it is proposed tomorrow morning to take items Nos. 7, 8 and 9.  These are concerned with the operation of committees of the Houses.  As of now the proposal would be to debate item No. 5 for the remainder of the morning, that is the EEC report, and to take up the Funds of Suitors Bill after lunch tomorrow and <Col N="503" /> commence the Second Stage but probably not complete it.</P>

      <P>I can give the Senator this afternoon a list of the Bills which I anticipate will have to be taken.  A number of Bills are obviously urgent.  I might mention the Irish Steel Bill, which is a Money Bill and which we will be obliged to pass.  A number of other Bills are going through the Dáil today and it will be necessary for us to dispose of them.  The big question mark is, of course, over the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is not yet clear when Report Stage will be taken in Dáil Éireann, or how long Report Stage will take.  I have already had discussions with the Minister in regard to this and I would hope to have further news tomorrow.  As soon as I have news, even if the House is not sitting, I will communicate the position.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the European Convention on the Protection of Animals kept for Farming.  I am concerned about this because 99 per cent of our farmers are well able to look after their animals.  There may be cases of cruelty but they are fairly scarce.  Farmers are always a bit scared of inspectors calling. Under this Bill an inspector appointed by the Minister, a veterinary officer, a sergeant or a garda can inspect farm premises.  I have seen good farming practices in operation but somebody with different ideas &mdash; what I would consider a do-gooder &mdash; might say conditions were not as suitable as they ought to be.  There was a case in my county where a farmer was brought to court because a garda thought animals were not being kept in <Col N="504" /> proper conditions.  Even though veterinary evidence was brought in to show that he was following normal farming practices, the man was convicted and he had to appeal to the Circuit Court to win his case.</P>
      <P>On the question of records being kept, I would like to know for what kind of units records have to be kept and what would be classified as intensive units. There are a number of units which could be classified as intensive units, such as slatted cattle houses and piggeries.  Most piggeries are intensive because pig farming is so bad that the profit margins are very poor.  The farmer will have to use good husbandry methods.  I am concerned about those records.  Who is to verify those records?  Will they take the farmer's word or the word of the man in charge of the units?  I would like to know what units will be covered.  Will sheep units and cattle units be covered?</P>
      <P>There is a controversy about what constitutes cruelty to animals.  It is said, even by the Agricultural Institute, that it is cruelty to keep sheep in slatted units, which are intensive units, because that is not their natural environment.  It is good farming practice to keep sheep in slatted units and to take them in during the winter although it can be said that they are intensive units and that the animals are not in their natural environment.  I think they are better off in those units than starving on the mountains in winter time. People do not see that as cruelty to animals. Sheep are dying from hunger on the mountains but people are shouting about the cruelty of having them in intensive units.  I would like the Minister to define what he means by intensive units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in the Bill that automatic ventilation must be kept in order but there are times when it is beyond the control of the farmer to have those automatic gadgets working properly.  I know of situations where, through no fault of the farmers, farmers had big losses because automatic units were out of order due to somebody going on strike or pulling a switch.  I have seen 300 pigs dead as a result of an operation like that. Why can not we get some regulations to <Col N="505" /> cover these situations?</P>
    <P>When making regulations under this Bill I would like the Minister to consult the farming organisations because there is a lot which could be said and points I would like to see defined before regulations are made.  If that could be done I would be grateful to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes which was signed by Ireland in June 1978.  Apart from that purpose one would question the need for such a Bill because many of the items contained in it are part and parcel of good farming. We have some reservations with regard to certain sections and subsections of the Bill which I am sure will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill might be considered as casting a slight on the capacity of farmers to do their job.  One might also question the necessity of having the regulations prescribed by statute apart from the necessity to conform with the convention. I agree that in certain cases there is cruelty to animals but this is rare.  In most farming operations and in intensive farming units, safeguards with regard to size, ventilation and the provision of food and water are provided.  In this connection one questions the advisability of having this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of sections could be considered hostile and not in the interests of the farming community and of good farming husbandry.  In addition, there is not adequate protection for farmers, and this must be considered.  There are strong powers under certain sections with regard to entry on to farms by officials of the Department of Agriculture, by members of the veterinary profession and, in certain instances, by the Garda Síochána.  It may be possible to amend this on Committee Stage.  It is something that we will consider and I hope the Minister will consider it also.  The provision in relation to the supply of food and water for animals is far-fetched.  Surely all farmers know about this and will ensure that they <Col N="506" /> will have proper supplies of food and water.  That is in their own interests as well as the interests of the animals.  There are other provisions for the care and welfare of animals, such as those in section 3 (1) (b).</P>
    <P>Entry into farms should be the function of veterinary surgeons and officials who are qualified rather than members of the Garda Síochána &mdash; I am sure the Garda Síochána have enough on their hands at present trying to cope with crime without being asked to visit farms to see that farm animals are kept properly and not subject to abuse &mdash; particularly with regard to the taking of samples.  I hope that there will be an opportunity to amend this on Committee Stage and to restrict entrance of the Garda to any farm without prior notice to the farmer.</P>
    <P>One could also question the omissions from the Bill, one of which relates to the question of transport of animals, where cruelty is being caused to them in transport to and from different farms and to the marts, but perhaps this is covered by some other Act.  If it is not, the Minister might consider introducing such a section.  There should also be provisions made for wintering animals.  This is the greatest area of suffering because animals are left out in snow, wind and frost.  When there are heavy snowfalls the farmer has no access to the animals and this results in grave hardship and suffering to the animals, especially in hilly areas where vast numbers of sheep are lost during severe snowfalls.  The way to remedy this situation would be for the farmers to be able to winter all farm animals.  Under the farm modernisation scheme there was provision for the housing of animals, but the figure of £23 million for that scheme this year as opposed to double that figure three years ago, demonstrates the Government's interest in wintering farm animals.</P>
    <P>Some speakers quite rightly referred to the importance of the farm modernisation scheme with regard to the protection of animals in these units.  There was also the expansion of the farm building programme in recent years, a programme which ground to a halt within the last 12 months primarily because of the suspension <Col N="507" /> of the farm modernisation scheme on 9 February 1983.  This constituted a grievous error on the part of the Government, contending that there was economy involved.  If farmers and the farming community get the aid they are entitled to, and there is money on a £ to a £ basis available from the EEC, they would have adequate buildings and facilities to protect their farm animals.  Many farmers got involved in developing their farms to ensure that their animals could live in comfort and had very sophisticated buildings erected.</P>
    <P>Senator Quealy mentioned the case of many pigs dying.  Because of the depression or because farming did not go too well some farmers found themselves in very serious financial trouble and had to sell some of their stock; some of them had to go out of business altogether.  It was a mistake to suspend the farm modernisation scheme.  However, the scheme is now in operation to a limited extent.  The building regulations that will apply under the farm modernisation scheme will ensure that farmers will have proper buildings to accommodate their animals.  It would be sheer economic madness for any farmer or food producer not to think in terms of looking after their animals properly with such units particularly when one considers present production costs.  The Bill is nearly unnecessary because all farmers who are interested in looking after their farms and in farming efficiently will have proper housing and proper protection for their animals, winter and summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everything that can be said about this Bill has been said, but I want to add my welcome to the Bill. Some people may say there is no need for it, and they may be half right, but the Bill is not going to do any harm.  There is a very small percentage of people &mdash; I do not know the percentage, and maybe I am fortunate that I do not know any of these people either &mdash; who do not look after their livestock well.  This Bill talks about three things: housing, ventilation and feeding and drinking.  In 1984 and in years past most people involved with livestock did an excellent job.  In these times <Col N="508" /> people cannot afford to do anything but a first class job.  There are many people who depend on livestock &mdash; mainly cows and cattle &mdash; for their livelihood.  I do not see a great need for the Bill, but if there is a small percentage of people who feel that this Bill is necessary and that it will be a deterrent to those people who do not look after their livestock properly, then it is welcome.</P>
      <P>There are many different ways of housing livestock.  There has been a welcome change over the last number of years whereby people spent vast sums of money housing their livestock and most people opted for the slatted units.  Maybe there is no figure to substantiate this, but one can say that most cattle slatted units do not look as comfortable as the old bed of straw of bygone days, but people rearing greater numbers of cattle, catering for bigger numbers of cattle, had to move in that direction because in certain counties straw is quite scarce and has become quite expensive.  When we talk about livestock we are talking about profit margins at the end of the day and all farmers and livestock owners tend to think and have to think in terms of profit.</P>
      <P>A few people who realise that this Bill is going through mentioned that they are concerned about a few matters in it.  Two of the things they are most concerned about &mdash; and I can add my own voice to this &mdash; are the type of people we may appoint as inspectors and the time of inspections.  Anybody could walk into most farms throughout the country at different times of the morning and find that cattle did not look as well catered for as they should.  You cannot feed or bed all your stock at the same time.  I am concerned that there might be an invasion of privacy of land owners by people inspecting their stock perhaps at a time when they were not well looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be too concerned if I felt these inspectors were qualified, if they had a knowledge of livestock and the way these jobs were done, but I would not be too happy if I thought that people who might get these jobs did not understand how livestock are looked after, the type of sheds needed or the routine for dealing with this type of job.  As I said, it is not <Col N="509" /> possible to feed all the livestock at one time, and when one gets to the last animal, it can look quite uncomfortable.  If an inspector arrives before all the cattle are fed or bedded, he might think they look neglected.  That type of thing concerns me.  We are not trying to put jobs in the way of veterinary people because they have enough to do in their own field, but I hope the inspectors will have a knowledge of all types of livestock and that they will not report somebody for a petty offence.</P>
    <P>Almost every farmer realises the importance of feeding his stock well.  We have arrived at the stage when we cannot afford to do otherwise because the margin of profit is very low at present, and has been for many years.  The margin of profit on buying and selling can be very small.  Every farmer realises that he must feed his stock the maximum amount of food to get the maximum amount of profit.  For that reason I would not be too concerned about the feeding of animals. When we talk about housing and the move forward that there was in recent years, with many farmers spending tens of thousands of pounds improving their farmyards and houses in general, we must remember that many people still feed their cattle outside.  Ministers in the past encouraged most of these people to spend money and provided decent grants for farmers to erect very modern accommodation for these animals.  Good land will not stay good if the cattle remain on it for a whole winter in atrocious conditions.</P>
    <P>When one is driving through the countryside on a snowy evening, one might see animals outside, up to their knees in muck, eating out of a round feeder.  If an inspector did not know his job, he could regard this as cruelty to animals.  This is happening in many parts of the country still; I have seen it myself.  It is possible that these farmers cannot see their way to getting these cattle off the land, because of financial or other considerations. Under this Bill these people might run the risk of being brought before the courts for not treating their animals properly. There is always a possibility that <Col N="510" /> that could happen.  That would concern me very much.</P>
    <P>Senator Quealy spoke about the intensive units and about pigs, a subject on which he is an expert.  I am talking a little more about the cattle, which I know more about.  In many parts of the country there is nothing but these units.  It has been said to me &mdash; I do not know if it is true &mdash; that the performance of cattle is not as good in these units as in the old type lean-to in which they were bedded in straw and were very comfortable. Nonetheless people have to move in that direction.  If inspectors visited some of these slatted units at a certain time of the day before the animals were fed, perhaps they might look uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>I seem to be emphasising the risk to farmers of being penalised or punished in some way for not looking after their stock properly.  I am sure we are not trying to create more jobs for the veterinary people but it would be true to say that most of them have long experience of the livestock industry.  They see animals in all types of conditions and of course animals have to be in certain types of condition. For example, as Senator Quealy said people could be caught napping, so to speak, during strikes &mdash; ESB or otherwise. If animals are fed by certain machinery which is worked by electricity it might mean they would have to wait much longer than usual for their meals. If an inspector appeared on the scene at that particular time people might find themselves in trouble.  That is perhaps the part of the Bill I am most concerned about.  From my own experience, and that is quite a bit because I have been quite a while in the game, I see no reason for the Minister to be concerned about the feeding and the housing of the cattle. The majority of farmers at the moment have proper sheds, proper slatted units and the type of buildings they need.</P>
    <P>However, there is still a section who are concerned about having their livestock outside and would love if the Minister, in the days and years ahead, could see his way to bring back certain types of grants.  There are some people who would like, if they could get generous <Col N="511" /> grants, to get their cattle off the land. Perhaps they are people who were moving somewhat more slowly but everybody could not move at the same time.  There are some people who did not avail of the reasonably generous grants which were available some years ago and they now find themselves in the position, with the limited amount of cash around and with high interest rates, that they are unable to do this job.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to see that more generous grants are introduced. My main concern about the Bill, welcome as it is in many other aspects, is the type of inspectors we are going to have and the times of inspection.</P>

      <P>Of all the legislation which has come through this House this is the most nonsensical I have seen in my time.  In my view, it is merely a cosmetic exercise.  It will never be put into operation and indeed the Department have no intention of putting it into operation.  It is a Bill which is just meeting the requirements of our EEC partners.  Whoever negotiated on our behalf in Europe, I would lay the blame at the feet of the people from our Department here, and I am not speaking about the political people.  I am speaking about the Civil Service who negotiated this regulation at EEC level.  It is the most nonsensical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the most cosmetic exercise that has ever come into this House because at present, out of all the vacancies in the Department of Agriculture, between redundancy and retirement, only one in every five is filled. There is no way anybody will be appointed to look after these provisions. Indeed, I think the Garda Síochána have plenty to do besides going around inspecting farmers' premises to see whether there is any cruelty to animals or whether they are being fed properly. This will not happen either.  Even widows who have no male help look after their animals so well that one could regard them as pets.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to bring in a Bill of this kind.  Every farmer, with the price of stock as it is at the moment, will ensure that his animals are in an environment in which they will thrive and that is the criterion of whether an animal is happy in his environment.  Senator Quealy put his finger on it when he said that animals on the hills endure more hardship and die from starvation.  Because of the acid nature of the soil they do not get the proper nutrition.  If these animals, sheep in most cases, are taken into slatted houses for the winter and fed properly the mortality rate can be reduced considerably. Every farmer I know is doing that at the moment.  There is no need for anybody to come out to see if a farmer is looking after his animals properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> It would be more useful if farmers got some guidance from the Department of Agriculture on the administration of drugs and on management rather than this type of Bill.  It will never be put into operation.  Maybe it is necessary to bring in the Bill because we are a member state of the EEC but it will probably rest there. I cannot see the provisions of the Bill being implemented because the manpower appointments are not being made in the Department.</P>

      <P>I accept no responsibility for the signing of the convention. It was done by a Minister from the other side of the House and all we are doing is ratifying what he decided.  That was signed on 29 June 1978.  It contains 18 articles.  Articles 1 to 7 deal with the general principles and Nos. 8 to 13 with detailed implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, it is fair to the Minister of the day to say that it was incumbent on us to sign to give effect to the European Convention.  When many of the units we are talking about in the Bill were in their infancy we had a lot of breakdowns and problems.  In section 1 of the Bill we are talking about a husbandry system relying for the purpose of the care of animals on automatic equipment to such an extent that a failure of that equipment would, if it was not rectified, or if some other suitable provision was not made for the care of animals, cause the animals unnecessary suffering.  As was pointed out on both sides of the <Col N="514" /> House, we know that it is in the interest of farmers to look after their stock and do a good job but there are the exceptions and we have to look out for them.  We are legislating on the European scene for the very few neglectful people who are not aware even of their own self-interest with regard to the care of animals.</P>
    <P>A few Senators were concerned about the records.  Senator Hussey in particular was concerned that this would be a burden. All a person has to do is to keep a diary showing the date of inspection and a note to say that everything is in order. It is left to the farmer.  No elaborate records are envisaged.  There is no question of harassment.  The point was made that we do not have a whole lot of manpower to be harassing people.  It will be a spot check system conducted by our agricultural officers.  They have veterinary training.  They have an idea where to go if there are problems.  The Garda will not conduct inspections and will only be called on as a last resort.  They have that power already in the event of persistent obstruction encountered by officials in the carrying out of their duties.</P>
    <P>The Bill relates to animals on the farm. Some Senators are confused about this. The welfare of animals in transit is already catered for under the Transit of Animals General Order 1973 under the Diseases of Animals Act.</P>

      <P>We are not concerned here about out-wintering.  We are concerned purely with housing of animals. In Strasbourg there will be a standing committee.  If there are anomalies in the Bill it can be amended to suit a particular situation.  The fine of £500 was mentioned. That is a maximum fine judges can impose and they will have a discretion to impose lesser fines as warranted in particular cases.  We do not expect that it will involve any extra staff or additional expenditure from the Exchequer.  We are talking about an occasional spot check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hussey raised a point in relation to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  The situation is that there have <Col N="515" /> been little or no prosecutions under the legislation to date.  The delay in bringing forward the Bill is due to administrative reorganisation in the Department of Agriculture.  Possible developments in relation to the harmonisation of poultry and animal welfare legislation in the EEC was also a factor.  Progress at Community level has been slower than expected.  For instance, Italy and Greece have yet to ratify this convention.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that our inspectors will adopt a common sense approach when dealing with this legislation.  The worry of Senators that inspectors might come along in the morning when cattle were not looking their best is not a problem. The problem is where there is gross neglect and where animals are suffering. Where that happens we hope this Bill will serve as a warning to people to be more careful.  I do not expect that this Bill will cause any problems for the farmer or for the Department.  It is just complying with EEC legislation and it is basically to cope with something that is comparatively new to agriculture, that is very intensive and very sophisticated type of equipment being used in the housing and care of animals.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 14 may be taken together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 6 and 7, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;practice of dentistry&rsquo; means the performance of any operation and the giving of any treatment, advice, opinion or attendance which is usually performed or given by a dentist and includes the performance of any operation or the giving of any treatment, advice or attendance on or to any person preparatory to, for the purpose of, or in connection with, the fitting, insertion, or fixing of artificial teeth;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge on Committee Stage raised the point that the only definition in this Bill not included in section 2 was the definition of &ldquo;practice of dentistry&rdquo; which, of course, is in section 49.  Senator Dooge asked that it be placed in section 2 and that section 49 be deleted.  I agreed to make this amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>In debating the definitions Senator Dooge pointed out that the phrase &ldquo;profession of dentistry&rdquo; was used in section 24 (2) but was not defined in the Bill.  He inquired whether it was likely to give rise to difficulties.  The position is that it was decided in consultation with our legal adviser that it was neither necessary nor desirable to define the phrase for the purposes of the section.  In the absence of a definition it can be given its ordinary meaning, namely, it can be interpreted in as wide a way as possible covering anything which might reasonably be regarded as connected with the profession of dentistry.  This would embrace such matters as dental education and training and, of course, the actual practice of dentistry.  A wide interpretation is suitable for the purposes of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am grateful to the Minister for bringing forward this amendment on Report <Col N="517" /> Stage.  While there is no substantial change in the meaning or the legal effect of the Bill, the Bill becomes an easier Bill to read.  It improves the format of the Bill if the definition is brought forward from section 49 to section 2.  In regard to the question of the definition of &ldquo;profession of dentistry&rdquo; which comes up in section 24 in a restricted Part of the Bill in regard to the disposal of surplus funds, the argument of the Minister is a reasonable one. One can take the ordinary meaning of &ldquo;profession&rdquo; and the ordinary meaning of &ldquo;dentistry&rdquo; and if we were to seek to insert a definition of &ldquo;profession of dentistry&rdquo; we might draw it on too narrow a basis and tie the hands of the Dental Council in regard to the disposal of funds.</P>
      <P>In this connection, the problem of definitions is always a very difficult one. We like to approach a Bill like this and see if we can really tie down the definitions. However, one might say that definitions are things which almost by definition cannot be tied down.  One can play a very interesting game by taking a first-class dictionary and looking up a definition in this dictionary and then looking up the definition of the words that are in that definition.  If the dictionary is a cheap one it will only take two or three moves before your definition becomes circular.  In a more expensive dictionary you may go to five or six words before eventually something is defined in terms of itself.  In legislation of this type there are certain things that must be defined.  There are others that need not be defined and now we have defined what is proper and with this amendment we have put it in the appropriate place.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 37 to 38, to delete &ldquo;to fulfil the functions assigned to it by this Act&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;the general concern of which shall be to promote high standards of professional education and professional conduct among dentists, and which shall, in particular, fulfil the functions assigned to it by this Act&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge and Senator Robinson sought the inclusion in this section of a statement in general terms of the objectives of the Dental Council.  I indicated that I had no objection and that I would have another look at this section for Report Stage.  The amendment meets the point by making it the general concern of the council to promote high standards of professional education and professional conduct among dentists.  This is very much in line with the wording of the equivalent section of the UK Dentists Act, 1957, which was quoted by Senator Dooge at the time in support of his argument. I considered that this wording meets the case quite well and it would be difficult to improve on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, again I am grateful to the Minister for having brought forward this amendment which gives a general objective to the Dental Council.  This is appropriate and may well be useful for reasons which I gave on Committee Stage where we debated this at columns 110 to 112 of the Official Report.  I have one remaining point in regard to the wording we now have.  It is really a question of drafting but, after all, that is what we are here to do.</P>
      <P>It appears that to the parliamentary draftsman, the Dental Council or any committee is a neutral thing.  In other words, the draftsman uses the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; here.  Parliamentary draftsmen in other jurisdictions tend to treat a body like the Dental Council as a personal thing and tend to use the words &ldquo;who&rdquo; and &ldquo;whose&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;which&rdquo; and &ldquo;of which&rdquo;.  I just make the inquiry as to whether there is any particular reason for this.  When one compares legislation one notices the difference here.  One would think that the Dental Council, a committee of distinguished dentists, would have a sufficient touch of humanity about them to merit the use of a personal pronoun here and not treat them as neutral beings.</P>

      <P>The convention here is &ldquo;which&rdquo;.  I suppose we are somewhat <Col N="519" /> more stilted in our concepts.  I gather that Senator Dooge has made the point that it is the UK practice generally.  It is probably something to be commended but the Irish parliamentary draftsman procedure is to stick to the old classic &ldquo;which&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 9 (2), Senator Durcan, supported by Senator Dooge made the point that the subsection as drafted gave the Dental Council a virtual veto on future changes by the Minister of the day, by regulation, in the membership of the Dental Council and that this was inherently undesirable. It was suggested that the phrase in the subsection &ldquo;with the consent of the council&rdquo; might be replaced by the use of the words &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and I undertook to introduce an amendment along those lines on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Senator Durcan and myself I am very glad that the Minister has introduced such an amendment.  I think it would have been inappropriate that the Dental Council should have a veto over the extension of their own functions.  This has been well met by the insertion of this time honoured phrase which first appeared, I understand, in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  It is now a better section.</P>

      <P>I fully support the amendment. I hope that the Minister when in consultation will be wearing, among many hats, the hats of the three groups which we had hoped to include in the <Col N="520" /> representation on the council, namely, auxiliary dental workers, dental students and the consumer in the various regions of the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 6, after &ldquo;held&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on a system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is to ensure that in the election of members to the council by using the system of proportional representation there would be an opportunity for dental surgeons working in the health boards to have an opportunity to be elected to the council by the numbers engaged in health boards <i>vis-á-vis</i> the numbers of dental surgeons engaged in private practice.  If it was a straight voting system it might not give a proper representation.  After consultation with the Minister we feel that this would meet our desire to ensure there would be proper representation by all the people engaged in the practice of dentistry, whether in the private sector or in the health boards.  We feel that proportional representation, which the Minister and I have defended on more than one occasion, is the appropriate way to do it, so that minority voices will have an opportunity to be represented.  It did not work so well in the past.  I would hope that in this case it might be more successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris's party should have dominated that interest and used his extraordinary influence over this Bill.  The situation here would be rather unique.  I have been checking through other enactments.  It would be quite unique to write in the particular amendment and to that extent I find myself in a rather unique situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that it could be put into the regulation made under the section which will govern the election of dentists to the council.  I would be quite prepared to do that.  I am not sure if I will be long enough <Col N="521" /> in office to do so, but assuming regulations will be made in the near future, say next year or so, I would certainly be constrained to put a provision into the regulations that the PR system by means of a single transferable vote should operate for those elections which would be subject to annulment by the House if it so wished.  I have that difficulty, and to that extent the amendment would appear to be unnecessary.  However, I would be interested to know how other Members of the House would view the situation in regard to this section and perhaps we could then reach agreement on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be rigid on this.  I just wonder if it is the type of election that would warrant proportional representation.  Would this be the very first Bill of this type to provide for proportional representation?  Personally I would favour the ordinary straight voting system in this kind of election.  It would be my personal choice in that PR might not be the most advantageous system in this situation; it is not very strong one way or the other but I would come down on the side of the straight vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senators Dooge and Ferris on their farsightedness in bringing in what could be called a little piece of institutional democracy into the Bill.  We have heard a lot about community democracy and the day will come in the not too far distant future when people will be insisting on a much greater distribution of democratic power inside our institutions.  If it is a precedent, I think it is an excellent one.  If it is not a precedent I am glad we are following somebody else's example.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Dooge and Ferris in asking for this. Wherever possible we should try to make elections as democratic as possible and give the opportunity for minorities to be represented.  There is nothing I can add to what Senator Ferris has said.  I would like, as the Minister has asked for the <Col N="522" /> views of Members of the House, to express my support for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment looks for a statutory requirement that proportional representation should be the means of election.  It does so for two reasons.  One reason is the general principle which Senator McGuinness has just put forward.  All elections held under the authority of the Oireachtas should be as democratic as possible.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Fallon about the use of the straight vote.  If you have a straight vote here, it does not matter whether there are four, five, six or seven people to be elected, if you allow that vote to take place, you allow a majority to shut out a minority&mdash;you allow them to exclude a minority from any representation. This, to my mind, is highly undesirable.  Senators will recall that we discussed on Committee Stage at quite some length the question of representation. The view was put forward that it would be highly undesirable if, for example, dentists in private practice were to clear the board absolutely in the election of registered dentists to the Dental Council.  It would be equally objectionable if sometime in the future dentists in the public service could clear the board and exclude dentists in private practice.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, no matter what direction the profession might take in the future, the minority should be protected. It will make for a better board.  It will mean that all opinions will be represented. Seven members are elected in this way.  As long as there is an opinion which is strongly held by more than one-eighth of the electorate, that opinion can be represented on the board.  When the Minister spoke and made the offer to put in the regulations the requirement for PR, I thought while he was speaking that this is a reasonable way of meeting the question.  I would have urged the Minister that, even if he thought he would not be around when the regulations were promulgated, at least he should make the draft regulations immediately and allow the inertia of the Department to take care of the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard Senator Fallon speak in <Col N="523" /> favour of the straight vote, I begin to get a little afraid that even if the present Minister were to write the regulations, Senator Fallon or some of his colleagues might come in and revert to the straight vote, which I would not like to see.  Senator Fallon's contribution, rather than persuading me to withdraw the amendment, not to press it on this occasion, has tended to make me think that the amendment is all the more necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the views of Members on this issue because it is quite a precedent to enact a provision of this nature into legislation governing professional bodies.  I assure Senator Dooge that my Department do not suffer from any inertia.  They have been kept on their &ldquo;tippy toes&rdquo; in relation to this Bill by the profession and, indeed, by Senator Dooge during the course of its passage here.  I have no wish to argue against the principle of PR because, as Senator Dooge is well aware, I would not be here today were it not for PR, coming from the kind of constituency which I represent.  Senator Dooge is a constituent, distinguished as he is, in that constituency.  Therefore, who am I to argue against my constituents, be they Senator McGuinness or Senator Dooge? Having the respect I have for PR I will accept the amendment because it will strengthen the broadly representative character of the council.  It will also give a considerable balance and maturity to the profession within its own deliberations. I think it would be useful.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 31, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than section 29&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our longest discussion on Committee Stage was on section 29 of the Bill.  It was the part of the Bill that deals with the <Col N="524" /> register of dental specialists on which there was the greatest gap between the Minister and the Senators who were taking an interest.  At the conclusion even of that very long discussion, Senator Ferris and I withdrew our amendments.  Senator Fallon did not press his amendments on that section.  In other words, we accepted in regard to section 29 that, while we disagreed with the Minister, we would not seek to obstruct him in the enactment of section 29 for the establishment of a register of dental specialists in the form originally proposed.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of that debate that this amendment to section 15 has been put down.  We are back to a key question which ran through our debate on Second Stage, Committee Stage and now it is coming up on Report Stage, with regard to the exact limits of the autonomy of the Dental Council to be established under this Bill.  It seems to me that since Senators have given way on section 29, it is appropriate to ask the Minister not to insist on having the power under section 15 to override the decision, the discretion, the informed opinion of the Dental Council in regard to the question of a dental register.  It seems to me that the Minister would lose very little by the acceptance of this amendment.  If the Minister cannot persuade the Dental Council at any time to move in this direction, then it is not going to be solved by the operation of section 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dooge in this amendment.  I do not think there is any need to go over again the long arguments that were made on Committee Stage on section 29 which, unfortunately, I was not present to take part in.  Many other Senators, particularly Senator Robinson, expressed the feelings I have about this section.  I think that acceptance of the amendment would leave a certain amount of openness to the Dental Council to decide whether the establishment of this sort of register of specialists is necessary or desirable, and not put them in the position where they can be forced to bring it in even if they themselves think it is undesirable.  There are the dangers that were drawn attention <Col N="525" /> to of people being constantly referred to specialists rather than to ordinary general practitioner dentists.  There needs to be some measure of freedom left to the Dental Council with regard to whether they will establish these sorts of registers or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that despite the protracted discussion we had on this issue, even now on Report Stage the amendment, for very good reasons, is still not acceptable to me.  I have gone a very long way from the original draft of the Bill, my original approach in the Bill, in relation to section 15.  Objections were raised and a number of them are still being repeated today.  I went a long way by indicating that any particular order which the Minister of the day would make under that section would be subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.  That approach on Committee Stage providing for such prospective annulment was a major change and provided a very reasonable safeguard over all in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate the sentiments of Senators Dooge and Ferris in this regard I think the amendment would be imposing an unnecessary prohibition on prospective ministerial action in this area.  I think that would be quite excessive.  Its effect would be formally to exclude the setting up of a register of dental specialists from the functions which the Minister could by order direct the council to discharge. Therefore, there would be a total removal of the ultimate&mdash;it would have to be ultimate&mdash;power on the part of the Minister of the day.  It is essential that he should retain some residual powers to issue a final directive in the event of total <i>impasse</i> arising.  Even then that would be subject to annulment.  For example, if there was a clear majority of the dental profession who considered that the establishment of a specialist register would be a very necessary and appropriate development, and the majority of the profession felt that way, the council of the day could still refuse to do so and the Minister of the day would have no prospective <Col N="526" /> ability under that provision so to direct the council.</P>
    <P>That would clearly occur only if there was total confrontation between the Minister of the day and the council of the day.  He would have to have very good public reason before he would exercise that residual opportunity open to him under the Act because he would be subject to annulment in a debate in the House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the principal arguments advanced by me for the retention of the power is that should the establishment of a register become necessary in particular circumstances it would be obviously unacceptable if the council should refuse and continue to refuse, for whatever reason.  The Minister would be excluded from having any opportunity in the public interest to direct the council to go ahead and set up a register even though it had become clearly obvious and necessary that such a register would be appropriate in the public interest.  Therefore I would be reluctant to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I think I have gone a long way.  There are varying views even now within the profession.  Indeed, going back over old Departmental records I recall that in the past few years there was a well attended meeting of the Dublin Metropolitan Branch of the Irish Dental Association which passed by a very clear majority a resolution in favour of the introduction of a specialist register.  I find it somewhat difficult to understand what I would call some of the more recent opposition which emerged to this concept.  It is nothing new at all.</P>
    <P>Even that decision would not necessarily influence my approach to this section.  The approach is that the Minister for Health of the day would be very wise to retain a degree of ultimate residual power which admittedly it might be argued he could exercise under other sections of the Bill.  I would hold that it is relative in a very pertinent way to section 15.  Having succeeded in a very major realignment of the whole approach of this Bill and having agreed very many amendments even on Report Stage today, I would suggest to the House and to the movers of the amendment that my <Col N="527" /> accommodation has been reasonable and fair and should not be strained any further in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's <i>rationale.</i> He knows our views and our feelings on it and the reason why we felt that this type of amendment might meet objections.  Basically, what we were trying to do was to ensure that the profession itself would expand its role in the area of general practice in health care.  The members of the profession in their working relationship tend to refer people to members with special expertise that certain dental surgeons can acquire. They do it from experience.</P>
      <P>I did not want legislation to create an elitist group of dentists in the country and hence my reservations about this section. I realise that there may not be a necessity in the interim period to have a special register of dental specialists but I understand that there is possible EEC legislation that might make this imperative.  For that reason I do not think we will press the amendment.  The Minister has obviously confirmed to the House that it would be in the most extraordinary circumstances that he would implement the powers to remove the council from office in the event of their not performing certain functions and duties.  I am sure that they will perform this function if and when the need arises.  At the moment I cannot see the need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in viewing the actual need to remove the council if they do not perform this function, will have regard to the actual need at any given time for a register of dental specialists having regard to commitments within the EEC.  The Minister has been very fair to us.  He has gone a long way towards trying to ensure that this legislation will be good legislation, that it should be fair and protect everybody through the provision of the services in the health boards.  He has gone 90 per cent of the way and it is the way we want to proceed.  The Minister understands the feelings of Members on all sides of the House.  For that reason I will not press the amendment to a vote. I accept the Minister's explanation, I am <Col N="528" /> sure he will understand the reasons why we did not want to create an elitist group of people at this stage; it may be necessary in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the sentiments of Senator Ferris and say that one of the refreshing things about the way in which this debate has developed is that there seems to be a balance in thinking between the needs of the specialists and the needs of the generalists. Whereas in the fifties and in the sixties, in the way in which the public perceived the health care deliveries systems they were seeking, there was a consumer need for seeking more and more specialised attention, there is now increasingly an awareness that the specialist sees the fragment and not the whole.  I think young professional people and the new generation of people are now more concerned to see the whole; for example, they do not want to think that the organ is being separated from the person, the person from the family and so on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the approach that has been taken to this debate.  People seem to be quite conscious of the need for specialisation and super-specialisation but we must always keep that in proper perspective. There has been a great danger in recent years, through the media and through consumer consciousness that in the hierarchy of values, a specialist is put on a higher rung than a generalist.  The generalist sees the whole, the specialist the part; at least that is the trend by way of training.  We must always keep that to the forefront of our thinking when we are dealing with a subject such as this.</P>

      <P>This matter has been thoroughly debated.  I still hold the conviction I have held to but I think it would only be fair if this House, acknowledging the fact that the Minister has accepted our position and our arguments on so many points, that, even if we still disagree with him, we should not seek to impose on him in regard to this amendment.  I would seek the leave of the House to withdraw amendment No. 5.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted an amendment moved by Senators Dooge and Ferris which inserted the present subsection, namely subsection (4) in section 15, the purpose of that subsection being to make orders of the Minister of the day subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.  I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that it is now necessary to insert a new subsection (4) giving the Minister of the day power to amend or to revoke an order made under the section.  Amendment No. 6 does this.  It has also been pointed out by the draftsman that the section as amended on Committee Stage is flawed in regard to an order under subsection (2) removing the members of the council from office.  If an order removing the members from office were annulled by either House of the Oireachtas this annulment would be, and I quote: &ldquo;without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;, Whether the members of the council would be in or out of office, it would then be quite unclear.  Accordingly, it could be held that the annulment of the order would not mean that the members of the council would be restored to office since the validity of anything done under the order prior to its annulment would not be prejudiced.  It is a complicated roundabout way of explaining this to the House. Amendment No. 7 effectively replaces subsection (4) as inserted on Committee Stage and provides a solution to this problem, namely the restoration of membership which had been destroyed by way of an order in the event of the order being negatived.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 39 to 50 and in page 12, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1)  Where a person who is either an officer or servant of the Council is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or as a candidate for election to Dáil Éireann or to the Assembly of the European Communities,</P>
      <P>(b)  elected as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
      <P>(c)  regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the European Assembly Elections Act, 1984) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as having been elected to the Assembly of the European Communities to fill a vacancy,</P>
      <P>he shall stand seconded from employment by the Council and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Council any remuneration or allowances&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case he is nominated as a member of, or elected to Seanad Éireann or is so elected to the Assembly of the European Communities, in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election to Seanad Éireann or such election to the Assembly of the European Communities, as the case may be, and ending when he ceases to be a member of Seanad Éireann or that Assembly,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in case he is nominated as a candidate for election to Dáil Éireann or to the Assembly of the European Communities, in respect of the period commencing on his nomination and ending when he ceases to be a member of Dáil Éireann or that Assembly, as the <Col N="532" /> case may be, or fails to be elected or withdraws his candidature, as may be appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is part of a long story.  I am beginning to have hope that the story might not run for too much longer.  Senators and many Ministers are now aware of the statutes that provide that mere nomination for the Seanad has the effect of removing a member from many a State-sponsored board or suspending without pay an officer or servant of many semi-State bodies. As was pointed out on Committee Stage, such a nomination can be made without the consent of the person concerned and there is no provision for withdrawal from the Seanad election.</P>
    <P>This particular drawback was placed beyond any doubt in the Seanad general election of 1982.  It is perhaps ironic that it was placed beyond any doubt in regard to a case that arose from the nomination of a candidate by the Irish Dental Association. That candidate was also nominated or was capable of being nominated by her Oireachtas party.  She was unable to withdraw from the contest for which she had been nominated by the Irish Dental Association.  This matter was not only determined by the Seanad Returning Officer but was dealt with by the judicial referee.  The judicial referee upheld the ruling of the Seanad Returning Officer that there was no provision under the Seanad Electoral Act which provided that prior consent to nomination was required.</P>
    <P>It is the view both of Ministers who have spoken here in the House and of Senators that this is a general matter and should be tackled by the amendment of the Seanad Electoral Acts.  It appears to me that a simple amendment of section 27, subsection (2) (c) of the Seanad Electoral Panel Members Act, 1947, would remove this matter from the debate of this House forever, rather than having it as something that recurs every two or three months.</P>
    <P>We have put forward this amendment because it is now the view of all groups in this House that the Seanad cannot continue merely to raise this matter and then receive assurances of Ministers and then <Col N="533" /> have the matter sink back into neglect again.  This amendment is being put forward, and similar amendments will be put forward on every Bill that contains provisions of this sort, until the Government reach the conclusion that it is easier to amend the Seanad Electoral Acts than to have to deal with this matter on every enactment that contains the particular matter.  It is for that reason that we have put down this amendment on Report Stage, not an attempt to embarrass the present Minister, not in an attempt to create possible conflict between the Dáil and the Seanad in relation to this Bill but because all groups in the Seanad now see this as the best way of resolving a longstanding problem.</P>

As the previous speaker has rightly said, it is indeed an old chestnut and it has come before us from different Ministers of different Governments from time to time.  Certainly we here would like to have it resolved once and for all. I recall the incident that the previous speaker referred to.  In fact there was a similar incident I think with the IDA in the same election.  It caused confusion and concern and it was felt to be unfair at the time but in so far as this amendment is concerned it would seem to me that it could happen in the future that a member of the Dental Council might be given a nomination to contest and that being so, he would have to vacate his place on the Dental Council and this would be unfair.  I support totally the points made by the previous speaker.  As I said, we have discussed this in the past and hopefully the Minister will see fit on this occasion to remedy the situation which seems unfair.</P>

It is indeed a matter which has been raised on numerous Bills.  Even in my experience in this House it has formed part of the debates on quite a number of Bills already and it is not good enough to allow it to <Col N="534" /> be mentioned every time and for various assurances to be given and then for the matter to die until it is raised on the next piece of legislation that contains this provision. So, I would very strongly support this amendment as being a way of dealing with it on this Bill but I would also hope very strongly that the matter would be dealt with in principle by amendment of the Electoral Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is also an old chestnut of mine.  I would like to confirm to Senator Fallon that this amendment refers to an officer or servant of the council, not necessarily a member.  Senator Dooge dealt specifically with the nomination procedure for nominating bodies for the Seanad and we have always felt that that is an anomaly in itself from which you cannot withdraw.  But even in the case of an Oireachtas nomination, either for the Seanad or a nomination from a political party for the Dáil, the process of nomination seemed to have excluded people from various boards, semi-State boards or various councils, and that principle is wrong.  I accept that if the person is elected it would be incompatible for him to serve on the two and do it appropriately, but the actual nomination procedure is what concerns me. This has discriminated against quite a lot of people in their livelihood.  People have lost their jobs by just being nominated although they were not afterwards successful in being elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in a previous Bill accepted everything we are saying now and accepted everything that is in the amendment.  Unfortunately, this Bill also slipped through the net and contains the same exclusion of people who we feel should be included in the democratic process of representation either for the Dáil or Seanad.  The public have little enough respect for politicians as it is and politicians have similarly little respect for people who might like to get into the same field and for that reason this amendment of its own right should stand the perusal of draftsmen and the Government in considering any amendments that they may need in other areas.  I know that the Minister feels as we do in this <Col N="535" /> regard and so I hope that he can agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>I can confirm that the matter has been raised and discussed in some detail at Government.  It was agreed on an informal basis at Government that the Minister for the Environment and the other appropriate Ministers should review the question of members of boards and officers and &mdash; if I may use the out-dated term&mdash;servants of boards, being debarred on nomination for election to the Seanad even though the nomination is without their consent.  Admittedly, the amendment now offered is relatively restrictive.  However, it is acceptable to me.  It is time that we created a precedent.  Admittedly it could be argued that not all Government Departments have had the opportunity to consider the Bill in detail and the general implications affecting other major statutes already enacted.  I can assure the House that my colleagues in Government have given this complaint quite a sympathetic hearing in the case of other legislation but of course that will be another day's work and a long day's work in that regard.  Of course, the amendment as drafted has the general support of all Members of the House, as I understand it, and it refers to Seanad Éireann, to Dáil Éireann and to elections to the European Assembly.  It does not refer to a person being nominated without his consent to the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson argued that this section required amendment to make it perfectly clear that entitlement to registration in the register of dental specialists is a conditional entitlement, namely, conditional on such a register being established by the council.  She suggested that a dentist who satisfied the conditions specified in subsection (1) could say to the council that he was entitled to be registered on the register of dental specialists and that he could request the council to set up the register and, if they did not do so, he could go to court and look for a <i>mandamus</i> on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge joined Senator Robinson in asking the Minister to look at the section before Report Stage to remove all danger that the power of the council to establish a register of dental specialists, which was clearly intended to be discretionary, could not be interpreted by the courts as being without discretion.</P>
      <P>I pointed out at that stage of the Committee debate that the essential point was that section 30 was applicable following the establishment of the register by the council under section 29.  Section 30 was qualified by the opening phrase &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; and I said that I would consult the parliamentary draftsman to see whether the section could be amended to make the position explicit.  The draftsman now considers that the fears of the Senators are not only valid but he has suggested that this amendment would meet those fears and accordingly I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendment 11 relates to section 34.  It is the responsibility of the Dental Council to ensure the adequacy and suitability of post-graduate education and training.  On Committee Stage I spoke about the extreme importance of continuing dental education.  I have put down this amendment for consideration by the Minister from the point of view that it might be desirable to stress that post-graduate education does include and should include continuing dental education.  If it would not do any harm to this Bill or any other Bill, it might be as well to stress this very important area.</P>
      <P>I might say that I also raised on the discussion of section 34 the position of the new Dental Council in regard to the board on post-graduate medical and dental education, as to whether, in fact, because that had been established under the Medical Practitioners Act, it would still have a dominance of medical over dental post-graduate education.  Since then I have had the opportunity to study that section of the Medical Practitioners Act at leisure and in quiet rather than in the House here.  I am perfectly satisfied that while it is established under that Act, that this post-graduate board is not in any way tied to the apron strings of the Medical Council.  I no longer have that doubt, but I invite the Minister's opinion on the desirability of stressing continual dental education by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator James Dooge and Senator Michael Ferris <Col N="538" /> on proposing this amendment.  Anyone who has been through the processing of medical or dental education &mdash; perhaps particularly medical education &mdash; is all too aware of the tremendous emphasis that there has been on examinations. Twenty years ago when I resurrected the junior hospital staff group of Northern Ireland and became its chairman it was following the writing of an article in which I said that barely fertile and almost 40 we eventually collapsed in a heap, so-called fully trained to do our life's work but it was doubtful if we had retained the enthusiasm of the early youth when we had started out on this enterprise.</P>
      <P>The importance about including the need to emphasise &ldquo;including continuing dental education&rdquo; is that to some extent it takes away from the emphasis placed on examinations and certification and puts an obligation on the council to ensure that there are facilities available for updating dental practice and giving those who do practice on the periphery &mdash;if one may use that term&mdash;the opportunity to see what is going on in the centre and to take back with them what is relevant to their practice.  That is not to say that I subscribe to the view of &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo;.  I think there is just as much excellent work done on the periphery as in the centre.  I have found that term particularly offensive in recent years and perhaps more so since I moved from the centre to the periphery.  It is in that context and the need to sustain an interest throughout professional life in what is happening in advances and in also trying to give the people who have the power to control the direction that those advances are taking, an insight into the relevance of their endeavours as they relate to practice on the ground that I certainly support and welcome the proposal which is brought before us in the names of Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris for including the term &ldquo;continuing dental education&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>One of the issues which has exercised my mind right through the past 18 months has been the duplication of effort in very many areas of the health services whether in terms of nurse training or doctor training or post-graduate training or psychiatric nursing training.  In whole areas there is massive duplication of effort and work at enormous expense.  There is a real problem in accepting the amendment which I am very reluctant to accept and it is that if I were to assign statutory responsibility to the Dental Council for continuing education it would in a very real way cut across the responsibilities and the activities of the post-graduate board and the structure which it is developing as of now in this area.  Whether it is developing it to the extent required by the dental profession is another matter; it is involved in the area.  If I were to accept the amendment, effectively I would have two bodies with responsibility in the area. It would be another blurring of the lines of responsibility which would be detrimental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Senator Dooge referred to the two aspects of post-graduate education, namely post-graduate in the formal sense and what is known as continuing education.  He raised the question of the position of the post-graduate medical and dental board in relation to dental post-graduate education.  He pointed out correctly that the Bill would give autonomy to the dental profession but responsibility for promoting and coordinating post-graduate dental education would still rest with the post-graduate board which he said was set up under the umbrella of the Medical Council and is subsidiary to it.  He inquired whether provision could not be made to alter the status of the board to make it a board jointly appointed by the Medical Council and the Dental Council or whether there <Col N="540" /> could be a separate post-graduate dental board set up under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will clarify the precise status of the post-graduate medical and dental board. Its statutory basis lies in the Medical Practitioners Act of 1978, but this is only because that legislation at the time provided a convenient vehicle when the decision was taken to establish the board. The post-graduate medical dental board is entirely and completely an independent body; it is not subject to the Medical Council in any way; the board's membership is appointed by the Minister of the day after consultation with the Medical Council and after consultation with the Dental Board which will now be replaced by the Dental Council under the Bill. Other appropriate bodies and organisations are also consulted.  Its functions are to promote and co-ordinate development of post-graduate medical and dental education and training.  These have been interpreted as covering the continuing responsibility for both formal post-graduate education and continuing education itself.  Therefore the board is excercising its responsibility in regard to the medical and the dental fields.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in carrying out its remit in relation to the continuing education in the dental field, the post-graduate board has set up a dental committee to advise it on continuing education, and there are representatives of the Irish Dental Association on this committee. They have developed a set of proposals relating to the provision of continuing education for dentists.  These are based on the establishment of a structure of regional committees to promote and co-ordinate the provision of continuing education at local level.  Two such committees have been set up on a pilot basis, one covering the north-west and the other covering the south and mid-west. Among other activities have been the development by the board with the chief executive officers of the health boards of some policy guidelines in relation to the provision of continuing education and the making available to post-graduate centres and health boards of grants for the purchase of audio-visual equipment <Col N="541" /> for continuing education purposes and so on.</P>
    <P>To that extent the post-graduate board is involved.  At this stage, I could not accept the amendment because it would open up a duplication of area, going back to the old Medical Research Council, the Medico-Social Research Board and the Economic and Social Research Institute and duplication among academics, teachers and universities, costing a great deal of money.  People with great expertise are spread so thinly that I am afraid they would spend a lot of their time administering rather than being fundamentally involved in post-graduate work.</P>

However, I think it is clear from what the Minister has said that he will continue to keep under review this particular area and, if necessary, to come forward with proposals for some alternative method of organisation of this very important field of education and training.</P>

I made the suggestion because I feel it is not an unreasonable level of fine to allow a court of summary jurisdiction to impose.

I thank the Senator for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>This section provides that the council will print, publish and place on sale copies of any register maintained by them at intervals of not more than five years and will print, publish and place on sale a supplement to each register in every other year.  This point was made by Senator Dooge on Committee Stage that while the clear intention seemed to be that in each year in the intervals between publication of the register <Col N="545" /> a supplement would be published, the phrase &ldquo;in every other year&rdquo; also had the meaning of &ldquo;every alternative year.&rdquo; Therefore, I have consulted with the parliamentary draftsman and the latter has drafted this amendment which makes the intention of the section absolutely clear.

      <P>Senator Dooge argued that the assignment of additional functions to the council under this section would be tantamount to legislative action.  He pointed out that the Bill laid out the functions of the council and the nature and scope of these had been debated at length.  Under this section the Minister of the day, however, could assign functions other than those in the Bill and this would in effect amount to legislating without bringing the matter before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge suggested that the most appropriate way to bring the Oireachtas into the picture would be to have assignments of additional functions done by ministerial order which would be subject to annulment by the Houses of the <Col N="547" /> Oireachtas.

      <P>On amendment No. 34, I am glad the Minister has followed my suggestion in this regard.  My suggestion on Committee Stage was that the Minister amend section 68 by the addition of a subsection similar to that which is attached to section 52 which would allow the institution of summary proceedings after the normal six month period.  The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, allows the period of six months within which a summons may be issued from the date of the commission of an offence.  The point I made on Committee Stage was that offence, under section 68, offences which relate to registers kept by the council, would be difficult to detect, the point being that the six month period could elapse before such an offence could be detected.  If that were the case, as the offence is not a continuing offence, then it would not be possible to prosecute somebody in a court of summary jurisdiction. I think that is a wise way in which offences of this nature should be prosecuted, and I am glad the Minister has accepted my suggestion and introduced an amendment similar to mine.</P>

      <P>I was not here on Committee Stage and I did not hear the no doubt persuasive arguments of Senator Durcan with regard to this matter.  This is by no means a unique provision to be putting into a Bill.  A lot of legislation dealing with things like safety at work and so on has been drafted with sections like this included.  Leaving aside for the moment the particular problem identified by Senator Durcan with regard to the question of entries on registers and the problems of proving that within the six month period, I do not think that the extension of six months in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act to two years is something that should be done generally. One of the benefits of courts of summary jurisdiction is that they are courts of summary jurisdiction and the matter is dealt with quickly.  You must be brought before the court fairly quickly or else you cannot be prosecuted.  That is a good principle to follow.  I do not think it is a good principle to follow in our ordinary District Courts that offences can be held up and there can be delays in the prosecution of offences for a period of two years, because my experience is that if you allow people the opportunity of having two years in which to institute proceedings, they will go to the very last moment of those two years before actually instituting the proceedings.  The longer I am dealing with bureaucracies the better I understand that the way in which to get anything done well is to put a very short time limit on it.  In that way you ensure that people will meet their responsibilities in a quick manner when the alleged offence is fresh in everybody's mind.  While not objecting to this particular insertion, the Minister and the House would do well to consider carefully before agreeing to the extension of the six month period to two years in any other case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points which were raised on Committee Stage and on which amendments were not put down on Report Stage.  They were matters which the Minister indicated that he would look at between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I am rising now to enumerate what I think are the more important of these points, and on these particular points I would be glad if the Minister could give us any information now available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these points relates to the question on section 8 of the reference to stamp duty exemption.  Here I am looking for as perfect a format in regard to this Bill as possible.  I would be glad to know from the Minister if it is possible to improve the consistency, the power of the Bill, for the Bill to stand alone without reference.  The second point I would be glad to have the Minister's comments on is in regard to the question of mobility <Col N="551" /> which I raised on section 19, at columns 166 to 168 of the Committee Stage report. I would be glad if the Minister could indicate what is the degree of mobility under this Bill and whether tying in the officers of the new Dental Council to the local government system in fact is a limitation rather than bringing them under the Superannuation Act, 1963, which applies on scheduling to the whole of the public sector.  The third point is the question which arose under a number of sections but especially under section 38, whether in fact it would be possible for the Dental Council or for the Fitness to Practise Committee to employ an assesssor to assist their deliberations, who would not be not just a legal adviser to the board itself, who are, as it were, the prosecution in the case, but a legal assessor whose opinions would be made known to both sides in order to assist in arriving at a just decision.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to raise relates to the relationship between sections 54 and 55.  There was a very long debate in this House on Committee Stage on sections 54, 55 and 56.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage at column 319, Volume 104 of the Official Report of 7 June last:</P>
    <P>My strong view is that in determining the nature of the dental work that a member of a class would undertake, it would be within the power of the council to specify particular types of patients and particular forms of control. I was slightly taken aback when I was assured there are some 300 known classes of illness which one might suffer from in that regard.  The Council will have a major role in this determination, but equally it will be obliged to have the consent of the Minister for Health of the day so there is mutual interaction in the setting up of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister in the light of his review of sections 54 and 55 and, possibly section 56 since Committee Stage whether he is absolutely satisfied that there is no limitation under section 54 (2) in regard to the reasonable restrictions that the council may make in <Col N="552" /> drawing up a scheme in regard to the question of classes of patients and in regard possibly even to such matters of oral conditions.  I think the Minister would agree that there can be a very great difference between the situation when we are concerned with the fitting of a complete set of dentures in conjunction with natural the other hand the fitting of a partial set of dentures in conjunction with natural teeth.  I would be glad if the Minister could give as firm an assurance as he can that, in fact, the operation of section 55 (2) will not be hindered in any way by any of the provisions of section 55.  These are the four points I would like to raise at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the question of stamp duty and the issue relating to the Finance Act, 1895 is quite a complex matter.  Section 7 (8) of the Bill specifies that section 12 of the Finance Act, 1895, shall not apply to the transfer of property or rights from the Dental Board to the Dental Council.  If it were to apply, stamp duty would be payable on the transaction itself, Senator Dooge inquired whether the Bill could be drafted in any way that would avoid the reference, namely, by re-enactment of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1895.  Our legal adviser and the parliamentary draftsmen have been consulted in some detail about this matter and they say that to try to meet the Senator's wishes would pose very great difficulty. Section 12 of the 1895 Act would have to be repeated in the Bill and a provision inserted that it would not apply.  There would then be the problem of subsequent legislation which has been amended or modified or has relevance to section 12 of the 1895 Act.  To give a complete picture this would also have to be repeated in the Bill and we felt the outcome would have been very cumbersome and difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the point that this legislation relating to stamp duty on property transactions is only one part of a legal structure dealing with the application of stamp duty and to re-enact it in this Bill would be to take it out of its proper context.  Accordingly, the legal adviser is also of the view that it would be very <Col N="553" /> confusing to the people who would be concerned with the provisions in the Bill, namely, solicitors, conveyancers, accountants, the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  Therefore the formula used in section 7 (8) is a very tried one with which most people are now reasonably familiar.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would make the point that the provision in section 7 (8) will have application only in a &ldquo;once-off situation, that is, when the property of the board is transferred to the council.  It will have no relevance thereafter.  These are the general observations I make on the particular stamp duty point raised by Senator Dooge.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (9) covers the transfer of staff from the Dental Board to the Dental Council by providing that the council will take over any contracts of service which the board have entered into.  Senator Dooge, understandably, queried the need for this provision in view of subsection (6) under which all contracts entered into by the board will be taken over by the council.  Again, I am advised that subsection (6) can be interpreted as covering contracts of service and that it can be argued that subsection (9) is unnecessary.  However, our legal adviser is of the opinion that it is important in this Bill to make it absolutely clear that the position of employees, as distinct from contracts generally, of the Dental Board is protected, and it is considered that subsection (9) should be retained to highlight this.</P>
    <P>Equally in terms of mobility the question of the application of the local government superannuation scheme to employees of the Dental Council arises. Understandably, Senator Dooge inquired whether full mobility was possible under the scheme, mentioning in particular the universities.  The scheme provides for automatic mobility between the local authorities, the health boards, health corporate bodies, joint bodies, civil service, the teaching services, our Defence Forces and our harbour authorities. In addition, the Minister for the Environment can approve transfer of pensionable service to other bodies which <Col N="554" /> have comparable schemes.  A large number of semi-State bodies have been approved in this way, as have the constituent colleges of the NUI and Trinity. There are some bodies, for example, CIE, that do not participate in the mobility scheme &mdash; a very big issue in itself &mdash; but in such cases mobility could be obtained if the bodies concerned were to pursue the matter and to modify their own pension schemes, where necessary, so that they are compatible with the local government scheme.  In recent months I have approved a number of transferrals and they are working well.</P>
    <P>Regarding the services of a legal assessor, Senator Dooge referred to the provision in the United Kingdom in the Dentists Act, 1957, whereby the disciplinary committee set up under the Act have available in all proceedings before them an assessor to advise on any questions of law arising.  He inquired whether the introduction of a similar arrangement had been considered in relation to the proceedings of the Fitness to Practise Committee to be set up under the Bill. The question of whether provision should be made in the Bill for the appointment of a legal assessor when the Fitness to Practise Committee holds an inquiry was considered by our legal adviser.  It was decided and generally agreed that a blanket provision of this type was not required and it would be preferable to give the Dental Council power to obtain the services of a barrister or a solicitor to assist the council itself, or any of its committees, in any case where it was considered necessary.  This power has been given to the council in section 57. This provides that the council may make and carry out arrangements with any person to assist it, or any of its committees, in the discharge of its functions.  Apart from the general principle involved, this arrangement will mean that funds will not have to be expended on an on-going basis for legal assistance in cases where the Restrictive Practices Committee considers that this will not be required.  We are all aware of the costs of seeking legal advice on a permanent established basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will deal with one outstanding <Col N="555" /> matter raised by Senator Dooge.  This is the question relating to the council's powers under section 54 (2) and the provisions of section 55 (2) and (3).  Appropriately enough, at the very kernel of the Bill Senator Dooge has raised the question of a limitation, as he used the phrase &ldquo;no limitation on reasonable restrictions&rdquo;. I accept the point he made relating to classes of patients and relating to forms of treatment.  These provisions would not inhibit the Council from determining in a particular scheme under section 54 (2) that, for instance, the work done by denturists would not extend to certain types of patients, such as haemophiliacs or mentally handicapped persons, or to persons who might suffer from specified diseases or indeed particular conditions of the mouth that they, would be excluded from dealing with those. Certainly, there is provision there and the council will have its role adequately safeguarded and secured under this provision.</P>

      <P>On the question that the Bill do now pass, there are a few remarks I should like to make on the contents of the Bill.  Apart from anything else that is all you will allow me to talk about on this particular Stage.  The contents of this Bill are a reflection of a thorough debate: there was a long Second Stage, a Committee Stage that spread over three sitting days, involving eight hours of debate, and a Report Stage which has lasted for two hours.  There will be agreement that the Bill as it leaves this House is a better Bill than the Bill that entered this House.  This improved Bill is the result of co-operation.  On my count there were 27 amendments made on Committee Stage and 23 amendments made today on Report Stage.  This is a remarkable feature, and I want to pay a very sincere tribute to the Minister for the attitude he has taken to this Bill. There is always a temptation for a Minister <Col N="556" /> who is as busy as the present Minister, to come into this House in the hope that he can get the Bill through as quickly as possible, but the present Minister sat here patiently, listening, discussing, putting forward his point of view.  In this regard we have had from him an object lesson in approaching the question of legislation as such.</P>
      <P>In the Bill as it leaves this House we now have a new departure and we hope that all those responsible, not just the members of the new Dental Council, but the whole of the dental profession will react to this new dispensation and that we will see in the years to come an attack on the very serious problem of dental health in Ireland and the question of the preventive aspects of dental care.  That really will reflect a minor revolution in our attack on this particular problem.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members of the House for their outstanding co-operation in the enactment of this legislation by Seanad Éireann.  The approach of the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition in the House and their colleagues was an object lesson to me of how it should be done, and as one who has been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas since 1969 I had not thought it possible that I would have been able to sit here and in a spirit of outstanding co-operation pilot through a complex Bill of this nature.  However, my faith has been somewhat restored in parliamentary reform and the operation of our democratic system in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the dental profession and the very many other bodies who made innumerable, understandable representations to all sides of the House in relation to this Bill.  These representations were received in a spirit of openness and frankness and not without some contention at times.  This is the way of the democratic process.  I thank, unusually perhaps, our Departmental staffs in the Department of Health who have worked for many years in the long process of development of this Bill: Mr. Joe O'Rourke, Jerry Deevy, Paddy Byrne, our administrative senior staff in the Department of Health, <Col N="557" /> and, of course, I should like to thank our professional dental staff who have been most involved and helpful in advice and guidance on the professional aspects of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to present this Bill to Seanad Éireann.  I thank the Members for their co-operation at all times.</P>

    <Title>Wool Marketing Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give legal effect to a decision taken last year to dissolve An Chomhairle Olla.  The Bill also provides for the continued implementation by my Department of the statutory functions of the Wool Marketing Act, 1968, involving the registration and licensing of wool buyers' and wool exporters' premises, respectively.</P>
      <P>The 1968 Act which provided for the establishment of An Chomhairle Olla came about as a direct result of the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvements who reported their findings in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle's main functions were to advise the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the fixing of grades of wool, apply standards in relation to the registration for the register of buyers of wool and, in consultation with the Minister, to fix a code of practice to be observed by wool exporters.  An Chomhairle were funded by an annual grant-in-aid, provided by the Oireachtas, which in the last three years averaged £100,000 per annum.  Membership comprised a chairman and 11 other members, representative of the trade and producers.  An Chomhairle had a staff of five, four of whom were seconded from, and paid by, my Department.  The remaining member, a specialist in wool grading, was <Col N="558" /> employed directly by An Chomhairle on a daily fee paid basis.</P>
    <P>Before An Chomhairle were established, no standard system, whereby wool was purchased on a graded basis, existed.  Indeed, there were no set standards in respect of buyers' or exporters' premises where wool was stored prior to export.  The image of Irish wool, especially on export markets, needed to be improved.  The main provisions of the 1968 Act, together with the principal related functions of An Chomhairle, provided for the proper grading and presentation of wool for sale, the registration of wool buyers and the licensing of wool exporters.  On the recommendations of An Chomhairle, regulations were made by the Minister for Agriculture setting out minimum standards in respect of these matters.  These regulations are still in being and will continue to be enforced by my Department.  The inspection of buyers' and exporters' premises heretofore carried out by officers of my Department on behalf of An Chomhairle to ensure that standards are maintained, will be continued on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    <P>As part of the measures taken to reduce Exchequer expenditure, the Government decided, in February 1983, to dissolve An Chomhairle.  As I emphasised in the Dáil, and I repeat here today, this decision should not be interpreted as a reflection on An Chomhairle, the marketing of wool is now in a much healthier state.  Irish wool enjoys a very high reputation on world markets and commands a higher price per lb. on these markets than comparable types of New Zealand and British wools.</P>
    <P>This year, especially, is turning out to be a good one for producers.  Because of the exceptionally fine weather, the quality of wool coming on the market is very high.  In the lowland areas, producers have sold their wool earlier than in previous years and it is estimated that approximately 65 per cent of the lowland clip has been disposed of at prices which are 10p-12p per lb. higher than last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> Export of wool has also continued at an accelerated rate.</P>
    <P>Wool from the hill areas, particularly along the western seaboard, has just commenced to come on the market and again, because of the high prices prevailing, producers are disposing of their wool quickly.  This, of course, should be the practice whenever possible.  Wool not properly stored will deteriorate and since many producers do not have the facilities to store wool for any considerable time the aim should be to dispose of their wool as early as possible into merchant stores where suitable facilities are available.</P>
    <P>Total wool production in this country amounts to 13 million lb. per annum made up to 5.2 million lb. Galway, 3.7 million lb. Blackface Mountain, 2.9 million lb. Cheviot and halfbred and 1.2 million lb. of other types.  The value of the national clip to producers is estimated to be worth in excess of £11 million a year &mdash; a significant contribution to farm incomes.  Over 70 per cent of the Irish clip is exported, 65 per cent of which goes to Great Britain.  The percentage of wool exported to Great Britain has been declining over the years as new markets were opened up, particularly in Europe and Eastern bloc countries.  Exports to France and Belgium have shown significant increases.  Czechoslavakia and Poland have been the main outlets in Eastern Europe but exports to that area have declined in recent years.</P>
    <P>The EEC is not self-sufficient in the production of sheep meat and with the application of the CAP to that commodity I anticipate a substantial increase in our national flock, with a consequential increase in wool production.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into account, I am satisfied that the wool industry has been placed on a sound footing and I am confident that the 80 licensed exporters will continue to seek out new markets and that the 306 registered buyers can effectively handle any increase in production. I am also confident that producers will continue to provide the high quality product which the market place demands. However, continuation of the successes already achieved will, of course, depend on the willingness of both traders and <Col N="560" /> producers to observe the statutory requirements.  In this connection I am fully satisfied that in co-operation with my Department, traders and producers can maintain progress.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, whilst the budget for An Chomhairle was a relatively modest one, I feel that the Members of the House will appreciate that, in the current financial situation, any scope for cutting back on Exchequer expenditure cannot be overlooked. In recent years, a high proportion of An Chomhairle's grant was spent in highlighting the need for clean wool presentation by means of fleece displays; in conducting training courses in wool grading and sheep shearing and in subsidising sheep shearing competitions at shows throughout the country.  Expenditure was also incurred on press advertisements and display posters and promoting wool end-products through fashion shows, etc.  All of these activities, whilst useful, are minor in the context of the Wool Marketing Act.  The main intentions of the Act and the corresponding principal functions of An Chomhairle, have long since been implemented, and expenditure on An Chomhairle's recent activities cannot be justified in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of world trends is, no doubt, an essential service to the wool industry.  It provides up-to-date information on trends and prices and guarantees a fair return to producers in line with world trends.  The market intelligence service will, therefore, be continued on a regular basis by my Department &mdash; as, indeed, it has been since An Chomhairle ceased to function.</P>
    <P>The four officers seconded from my Department have returned and three of them have been assigned to other duties. The fourth is engaged in sheep breeding duties and is also assisting in implementing the statutory functions of the Act.  No additional expenditure has arisen for my Department.  Indeed, staff savings have been achieved through the more effective use of the returned staff.  The wool grader employed by An Chomhairle has been paid his statutory redundancy entitlements and I understand that further claims he has made are under negotiament <Col N="561" /> tions.  Also, I am informed that he has secured outside employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains safeguard clauses in regard to creditors and other claimants of An Chomhairle.  These are included in Article 3 which provides, in general, that any outstanding debts will be discharged by the Minister for Agriculture, and that every contract entered into or in force between An Chomhairle and any person, shall continue in the name of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Article 4 provides that a final account of all moneys received and expended by An Chomhairle from 1 January 1983 to the day on which the last liabilities are discharged, shall be prepared for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General prior to its presentation to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, is a relatively straightforward one.  I commend it to the House and am confident it will secure approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of any board that has been doing a good job in the promotion of Irish wool on the world market is a very retrograde step.  Indeed, everybody admits that the Wool Council justified their existence and succeeded in educating wool producers on the importance of producing high quality wool and presenting it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember the days when farmers used tar to raddle their sheep and when they allowed all kinds of foreign matter to be included in the fleece in order to bring up the weight.  It took a long time to convince farmers that this was wrong, that they were really damaging their own long-term prospects of improving the market for Irish wool.  It was here that An Chomhairle Olla came in.  Through a series of educational programmes, demonstrations and so on, they succeeded in doing trojan work in the preparation and presentation of Irish wool.  Today the total wool production is worth £13 million per annum.  Over 70 per cent of the clip is exported, giving a very valuable boost to our balance of payments situation.  It is true to say that <Col N="562" /> we would not have secured some of those markets if it had not been for the efforts of the Wool Council who sent delegations to visit wool markets in Britain, France and the Eastern Bloc countries to find out what was required and make that information available to Irish producers. They also kept farmers informed as to the price obtaining on foreign markets. This was very useful information because producers knew the best time to sell their wool.</P>
    <P>Now the Government have decided that the Department of Agriculture will take over the responsibilities of the Wool Council.  I cannot see the Department giving the same service to producers as the Wool Council have given, simply because the Department have so many other irons in the fire.  No matter what gloss is put on this take-over let nobody tell me that it will improve the situation for Irish wool producers.  Taken in the context of overall expenditure by the Department of Agriculture the £100,000 saved by disbanding the council is very small indeed.  Instead of abolishing the Wool Council I would be happier if the Minister was here today seeking the approval of this House for the establishment of a wool marketing board as had been recommended originally by the committee set up in 1963 to deal with improvements in our wool.</P>
    <P>Sheep numbers in 1983 amounted to 3,600,000.  Sheep and wool together contribute £78 million or 3.65 per cent of total agricultural output.  Our entry to the French market for Irish lamb has given a new dimension to sheep production in this country and has opened new horizons for our lamb and wool trade.  Indeed, I would like to pay tribute to the man who succeeded in making that breakthrough, a former Fianna Fáil Minister, Mr. Jim Gibbons.  He, more than any other Minister for Agriculture, deserves the thanks and respect of Irish sheep producers for the trojan work he did in getting Irish lamb into the French market in 1978. That move by Mr. Gibbons succeeded in getting the sheep industry established on a solid basis.  Farmers who had abandoned sheep farming for the more lucrative beef and dairying industry began to <Col N="563" /> have a new look at profit margins, and slowly sheep began to reappear on farms where they had been phased out some years earlier.  Should this industry not then be nurtured, nourished and encouraged in every way by the Government instead of dismantling the very organisation that was set up to do that?</P>
    <P>As a Galwayman, where the best sheep in the country are produced, I resent this penny pinching exercise by the Government. I am particularly incensed that a fellow Galwayman, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, should be piloting this legislation through the House.  He knows as well as I do that the Wool Council had done a good job. Indeed he is on record as having said so. He knows too that the educational programme they initiated is an on-going process and should be continued rather than retarded if we are to get the best result and the best price for our wool clip.</P>
    <P>It was my job some years ago to reappoint the members of the Wool Council. I did so not on the basis of their political affiliation but on their knowledge of the industry as producers, traders and manufacturers. Those 11 people understood every aspect of the industry and were committed to its advancement in every way.  The improvements that have taken place over the past 15 years in the presentation and marketing of Irish wool are a fitting testimony to their work.  Indeed while I have the highest regard for the officials in the Department of Agriculture, I cannot honestly accept that they will have the same commitment because of their other responsibilities, as the Wool Council has.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Department more involved, perhaps with An Foras Taluntáis, in the area of breeding.  Much has been done to improve the lambing rate.  An Foras Taluntáis have been particularly active at their centre in Belclare. They have made remarkable progress there, progress that will benefit the whole agricultural industry and particularly those involved in sheep rearing. Farmers now realise that in order to achieve the highest prices for lambs on the French market they must produce good quality lambs that will grade properly <Col N="564" /> when killed.  Perhaps the Department could do more in helping producers to achieve those high results.  We have keen competition from other European countries and indeed from New Zealand for the French market.  It is up to the Department of Agriculture and our producers to ensure that we maintain a solid foothold on that market.  I understand that the duties of the Wool Council will now be undertaken by one man.  This will be an impossible task for him.  In no way can he be expected to provide the same service as the Wool Council.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to promote the sale of woollen materials at home and abroad.  Irish blankets, tweeds and carpets are known all over the world. A little effort perhaps could improve the situation and prove to the world that Irish wool is far superior to the cheap synthetic material now being dumped here from foreign shores.  It could, in its own way, contribute to the employment situation in this country.  I am sure there are many mills that could perhaps take on additional employees if a proper promotional job was done and the value of our Irish woollen materials promoted throughout the world.  I would imagine that it would have been better to give greater strength to the Wool Council to get them involved in this kind of activity, rather than dissolving them, and enable them to promote the sale of Irish woollen materials. I do not see any reason why they could not be engaged in this kind of work.  It is unfortunate that the Government have to take this kind of action in order to save £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I will apply myself to one section particularly, the children and adult disabled and mentally handicapped.  Sport activities as a means of increasing physical fitness and self-confidence are of particular importance for people with a disability. In the area of mental handicap, with which I am most familiar, an increasing emphasis in recent years on physical education and sports of all kinds has been of enormous benefit to both children and adults.</P>
      <P>Competitive sports have brought about improvements in co-ordination and selfawareness and provide many opportunities for disabled people of all kinds to integrate with every other person taking part on the sports field or in any sport or in the swimming pool.  I have seen the results of this at first hand and the great children who have taken part in competitions. I refer to some of the schools with which I have had association for 20 years in Clare.  I am asking here for special consideration and the provision of grants to those special schools when grants are being allocated by the Minister.  Athletics, gymnastics and swimming are major factors in the development of the special child, and because of the sense of achievement alone they seem to derive much benefit out of such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask here this evening if, against the background of a particular school for the moderately mentally handicapped, two hours of the service of one physical education teacher to 40 children is sufficient. Maybe the Minister will reply to me later and tell me that £X have been allocated to those special children to help them to do better at sport, and to keep in line with the motion which I am delighted to see on the Clár of this House.  Maybe this money is allocated by the Department, but if it is and if it is going to the larger units I would like to know what kind of money we are talking about.  I know first-hand the way the smaller units dealing <Col N="566" /> with these children and adults are being starved.  We must invest money in sport for them because it gives them complementary confidence in other areas of education.  They seem to get new confidence in themselves if they have achievements in the world of sport.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about children participating in Olympics at world level it is not right to ask that all the money to send them to world Olympics should come from voluntary organisations.  I chair a federation and I have collected over £200,000, if not nearly £300,000.  That is a lot of money.  I am asking that the Department give some allocation to the smaller schools for the handicapped.  I wonder if we are aware in this House of the Special Olympics and the results for our competitors last year against international opposition.  They brought home 25 medals.  I am proud to say that these medals came back to the four provinces of this nation, not three.  The training to send these children or adults was done by school staff, teachers, granted teachers sanctioned by the Department of Education, for which we are grateful, but we had to employ experts on a part-time basis.  That money had to be found out of voluntary collections or from the parents of the people we were sending abroad. This is not right in 1984.  I ask the Minister for equal grants for disabled people.  I am sure, given the necessary support, including Government financial support, they will go on to do better.  I have seen the results and the marvellous consideration that is given to these disabled and mentally handicapped people and the way in which they react and the very high level of achievement which they bring back to their families.  It is money very well spent. I have seen the results first-hand.  I want to put it on the record of the House. Nobody in this House has given the voluntary service to the mentally handicapped that I have given for a long number of years, and I will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the money which the Department and the Minister have allocated. I thank the Minister, Deputy Creed, especially for his help since he took office.  He has a special awareness about the needs of those less advantaged. <Col N="567" /> When allocating money to all sports &mdash; it is all right to be talking about all-Ireland footballers and hurlers and jumpers &mdash; he must not forget the less well off people in sport.  They should be given equal grants <i>vis-à-vis</i> the others competing both at home and abroad.  I am sure the two Senators opposite, both of whom are teachers, are also aware of the achievements in recent years because of commitments by past and present Governments to special children and adults.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address this House on the motion before us.  I thank Senators Deenihan and O'Brien for having the interest of sport at heart in putting down this important motion.  I am grateful to all the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  It was very satisfying and interesting to listen to the contributions which were made, and I must say that it is apparent that each of the Senators who contributed did much preparation in obtaining the various facts and figures which were given in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the debate which pleased me was the fact that there was no party flagwaving but rather were the contributions useful, informative and constructive. In the course of the debate there were some statements made which I believe were based on inadequate information, and I propose to deal with some of these misconceptions later in my address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government policy in relation to sport is based on the principles of the European Sport for All Charter.  The programme for the development of sport has as its objective the establishment of positive attitudes towards sport and physical recreation and the development of habits of regular and active participation in these areas through the provision of opportunities and facilities.  The policy for sport, while placing its main emphasis on providing the best possible opportunities for the greatest number of people, sets out to stimulate participation at all levels of performance.  In this context, elite sportsmen and the community at <Col N="568" /> large are interdependent, and no attempt should be made to separate high level performance from competitive sport.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, as elsewhere, there is a growing problem of alienation resulting in unrest, alcoholism, drug abuse, vandalism, violence, truancy and crime. Some of these problems can be related to increased leisure time and the lack of recreational opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>Sport and physical activity, as aspects of leisure time activity are not by themselves the only way to help to relieve the stress and tension of modern living, but certainly they are an essential part of any co-ordinated and integrated plan to help bring about an improved and healthier way of life.  It is extremely important that the value of sport and physical activity is fully appreciated and that the beneficial outcomes of regular participation in sport for all sectors of our society are widely understood.</P>
    <P>Within a community the level of participation in leisure and recreation provides an indicator to the strength of community spirit and therefore the confidence prevailing within a community. In areas of special need or disadvantaged areas this role of sport and recreation takes on a wider significance as it becomes a valuable mechanism in trying to meet the objective of reducing social disadvantage.  While the varied nature of the problems in these areas calls for a comprehensive programme of action, properly co-ordinated, it is my firm belief that sport and recreation could make a very positive contribution within a wider framework to improve the quality of life in these areas.</P>
    <P>The development of sport is implemented mainly through Cospóir, the National Sports Council, the national governing bodies of sport and the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, Cospóir is a body of 28 sports people who have been or are still deeply involved with sport, either as participants or as administrators.  Each member of the sports council has been appointed in a personal capacity.  However, there is a very wide representation of sporting <Col N="569" /> interests on the council and the majority of the major sports are represented. Since its establishment Cospóir, through its many activities, has been endeavouring to increase participation in sport, and I am pleased that previous speakers have made reference to the massive upsurge in participation in sport and physical recreation which has taken place in the last number of years.  I am certain that Cospóir's promotional campaigns and programmes have contributed in a very large way to the greater involvement of all our people in sports activities.</P>
    <P>As examples of Cospóir's work in the area of heightening public awareness of the benefits of sport and of the opportunities for participation, I would mention such promotions as Community Sport for All Day, National Walk Day and National Bike Week.</P>
    <P>Senators Deenihan and O'Leary spoke of the need to involve children in sport at an early age.  This is a view which I also hold.  Indeed, Cospóir also saw the need for a special initiative to involve primary school-children in sporting activities when, in 1983, the first Primary Schools Sport for All day was introduced.  Such was the success of the Day that the Sport for All Day in the primary schools will now be an annual event.  For the 1984 Sport for All Day in the primary school which was on 8 May, a wide range of promotional literature and a special booklet were sent to every primary school-teacher in the country.  The special booklet contains hints and guidelines on the organisation of Sport for All activities and places these activities in perspective in relation to the total school physical education programme.</P>
    <P>On 8 May I was delighted to have had the opportunity to witness at first hand the activities which were organised for the children.  It was a very pleasant experience to see teachers and children enjoying themselves in sporting activities. I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the boards of management for the enthusiasm, commitment and interest which they have shown by their involvement with this promotion. <Col N="570" /> Without their assistance such a project could not succeed.  Other Sport for All projects which have taken place or are planned in 1984 include:</P>
    <P>A national conference in Westport in May last on &ldquo;Outdoor recreation and leisure &mdash; future planning and development&rdquo;; special promotions of badminton, bowling, orienteering, walking and mini-sports; a club development award scheme (in association with a sponsor); participation in the GAA Centenary Exhibition in the RDS; a GAA/Cospóir Club Day on 29 July; publication of a newsletter; courses for voluntary sports leaders; sailing courses for the less advantaged.</P>
    <P>At local level, Cospóir's programmes are implemented through the 38 vocational education committees.  These committees have established sports advisory bodies, under the aegis of Cospóir to co-ordinate and to implement Sport for All programmes within their own areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to involvement in national campaigns, the sports advisory bodies maintain an ongoing programme of Sport for All activities at local level.</P>
    <P>The relationship which has been established between Cospóir and the vocational education committees has been a very wise development and has been further consolidated by the setting up of the sports advisory bodies which are widely representative of local sports and other organisations on a very democratic basis.</P>
    <P>Support for the programmes and activities of the sports advisory bodies is provided by way of annual grant-aid from my Department to the vocational education committees.  I am very pleased that in 1984 I was in a position to allocate a sum of £770,000 to vocational education committees.  I know from my own experience and from reports which I have received that the moneys which are allocated to vocational education committees for youth and sports programmes are having a very positive influence on sport at local level.  In my own county I have attended a number of family activities days which are aimed at participation by <Col N="571" /> the young and the old.  These have proved to be a most successful undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Sport for All policy, promoted by Cospóir is recognised as having created a favourable climate of public opinion in favour of sport and has contributed to an increased level of participation in sport. This, however, in turn has created problems for many sports organisations in that their structures have not been geared to cater for the demand for participation. The fact that most of the organisations are run on a voluntary basis, without any full-time administrative support, has limited the service which the national governing bodies of sport can provide.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased indeed that in 1984 the Government have recognised the needs which are being created by increased participation in sport and that for the first time since the introduction of the grant-in-aid scheme to sporting organisations the allocation for sport has exceeded £1 million.  Of this amount a sum in excess of £800,000 has been allocated in direct grant-aid to the national sports organisations.</P>
    <P>This allocation represents an increase of 62 per cent over the 1983 grants and is evidence that the Government is committed to the development of sport.  The grants to the national governing bodies of sport will assist towards the cost of coaching, administration, equipment, special projects to increase participation and improve standards and the hosting or travelling to international competitions.</P>
    <P>One of the major beneficiaries from the grant-in-aid scheme has been the Olympic Council of Ireland, which received grants amounting to £240,000 from the sports allocation.  The Olympic Council of Ireland is the &ldquo;agent&rdquo; of the International Olympic Committee in this country and is charged with the responsibility for the development of the Olympic movement here.  It is also the task of the Olympic Council of Ireland to ensure the representation of Ireland's athletes at the Olympic Games, to organise and to supervise participation of their delegations, to provide equipment, transport, housing, insurance and medical attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> Since 1924 the Olympic Council of Ireland has discharged its duty in relation to the development of the Olympic movement with dedication and efficiency, coupled with wisdom and integrity, in their approach to the many complex problems and undesirable developments which have occurred in sport over the years and which have tended to tarnish the high-minded ideals of the Olympic philosophy.</P>
    <P>In the course of last week's debate I was disappointed and upset that a Member of this House should speak in such a hostile fashion in relation to the Olympic Council of Ireland.  When one considers that the Olympic Council of Ireland has neither permanent headquarters nor permanent staff one must admit that their contribution to the development of sport in this country has been enormous.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, the Olympic Council of Ireland is an all-Ireland body which represents 22 affiliated sports recognised by international federations.  The council executive is reelected every four years by the affiliated sports organisations.  All officers of the council work in a voluntary capacity.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to the provision of funds to the Olympic Council of Ireland, and on behalf of the Government I would like to say that we are fully behind them in their efforts to promote the Olympic ideal.</P>
    <P>The Government are particularly appreciative of the contribution made by the Gaelic Athletic Association to the fabric of Irish life, both in sporting and cultural events.  To mark the celebration of the centenary year of the GAA a special grant of £100,000 was awarded in the budget in recognition of this contribution.</P>
    <P>While on the subject, I would like, in response to Senator Lanigan's remarks about the level of funding of the GAA by the State, to point out that the special grant given in the budget was over and above the normal grant-aid given annually to the GAA by my Department. For example, in 1984 a grant of £44,500 was allocated under my Department's <Col N="573" /> scheme of grants to national governing bodies of sport.  My Department also pay £21,000 per annum in respect of the three development officers attached to the GAA, and many clubs benefit under the youth and sport grants allocated by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out also that over the past five years GAA clubs throughout the country have received grants totalling £4 million under the Youth Employment Scheme, formerly the responsibility of my Department but now that of the Department of Labour.  These grants have enabled rural clubs, in particular, to improve the amenities for their members and for the local community.  I am giving the information not for the purpose of expounding the good deeds of the Government, but to provide information for anyone who may have been under a misapprehension in relation to the Government's commitment to Cumann Lúthchleas Gael.</P>
    <P>A significant fact of sport in this country is the vast number of voluntary workers in clubs, sports associations and community groups who give of their time and talents in the cause of sport.  No efforts by the Government to promote the concept and ideals of sport for all could achieve fruition without the interest and dedication of the voluntary workers, and to them I extend my congratulations and gratitude for their sustained efforts to maintain and improve the quality of life within our society.</P>
    <P>Further evidence, if it be needed, of the importance which the Government attaches to the role of sport in society is reflected in other schemes run by my Department:</P>
    <P>(a)  To assist with the hosting of/attendance at international competition;</P>
    <P>(b)  The provision of financial assistance to enable sports organisations to develop sports exchanges with their counterpart organisations in France;</P>
    <P>(c)  The sports scholarship scheme under which young sports persons can pursue their career in sport while <Col N="574" /> studying for the academic qualification of their choice.  Seventeen young sports persons are at present in receipt of sports scholarships, and an advertisement was recently placed in the national press for the holding of competitions for five further scholarships this year.</P>
    <P>(d)  A Long Distance Walking Routes Committee was established to identify and lay out on a countrywide basis paths and tracks which will be suitable for both the short and long distance walkers.  A major undertaking by this committee was the completion of the Wicklow Way which has now been extended as far as Aughavannagh, a total of 166 km.  Plans are ongoing for the provision of other walking routes and it is hoped, through this initiative, to encourage greater numbers of people to participate in walking as a leisure pursuit.</P>
    <P>(e)  The payment of grants towards the employment of development officers by nine sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>In this context I should mention in response to Senator Fallon's contribution that in addition to the £7,000 which the Government pays towards the development officer assigned to the National Community Games, the Government also pays a grant in respect of the salary of the general secretary of this organisation. Indeed the total grant-in-aid to the National Community Games in 1984 will amount to £58,300.  Some of the major sporting organisations have had considerable success in obtaining sponsorship from the private sector, and here I wish to pay tribute to the Irish Basketball Association which has recently been successful in the franchising of some of its senior clubs, which will mean an investment of over £1 million in the next five years.  The enthusiasm and commitment of the Irish Basketball Association should serve as an example to many other organisations.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid scheme to national governing bodies of sport extends to 65 such bodies.  Many of those represent minor sports, and if Senator Lanigan <Col N="575" /> could let me have the names of other minor national governing bodies of sport which he feels should be funded by my Department I will certainly be very happy to have the matter considered.</P>
    <P>Some of the speakers outlined their views on the desirability of having a coaching policy.  Coaching plays an important and influential role in the development of athletes.  The responsibility for coaching in individual sports rests solely with the national governing bodies of sport and their autonomy in this regard must be respected.  However, it is a fact that many sports organisations have poor coaching structures and do not have the capacity to develop proper structures.  There is, therefore, a need to analyse existing coaching structures, to examine means of raising the general standard of coaching and to establish a panel of top-class coaches.  A national coaching programme which will offer to coaches of all sports and at all levels of participation opportunities to improve their coaching skills is required.  The area of coaching is one to which I will be devoting special attention as funds become available for new developments.</P>
    <P>Experience as a Minister with responsibility for sport has brought me to the conclusion that a more comprehensive form of funding for sport is required.  In this context I have for some time now been pursuing the question of the establishment of a national sports lottery. Many previous Ministers with responsibility for sport spoke about the need and the desirability of having such a lottery. However, I am pleased to be able to advise the House that I have now succeeded in having the lottery proposal brought to Government and I am optimistic that a favourable outcome will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As I refer to the desirability of having a sports lottery I want to state that in the event of the lottery becoming a reality a priority will be the building of a national sports centre which would provide top-class facilities for our sports.  It would be my intention to have included in the centre, and I am sure that Senator Fallon will be pleased about this, a 50-metre <Col N="576" /> swimming pool.</P>
    <P>I also want to say in relation to the sports lottery that I am quite confident, with my experience of 18 months as Minister for Sport that I have no doubts about the success of such a lottery.  As far as the governing bodies of sport are concerned it is necessary to have a more regular funding mechanism available to them. When I came into office in November, 1982 because of the economic situation at that time in the Book of Estimates which was prepared there was a reduction of 11½ per cent.  It was not a very pleasant start for a Minister in dealing with the national sports organisations and dealing with Cospóir, the National Sports Council.  I made a commitment at that stage that I would do everything in my power to make sure that sporting organisations who do so much on a voluntary basis, that people who give of their time and people who subscribe to the provision of facilities for our young people, would not be let down.</P>
    <P>Before the year was out I was pleased that I was in a position to introduce a supplementary grant for those sporting organisations which brought the grant to the level of 1982, I am not saying this in any boastful fashion.  The introduction and success of a national sports lottery would provide a regular funding mechanism which would enable those organisations to plan well into the future.  That, I hope, will happen.  I sincerely hope that the lottery if and when introduced will be a success.</P>
    <P>The Government is constantly aware of its responsibility to the youth of Ireland and recognises that there is an urgent need to cater in the widest sense for recreational outlets to that leisure activities for all would be channelled into wholesome and positive outlets.  The Government will continue to pursue vigorously this objective with a wide range of innovative measures to heighten public awareness of the value of sport and promote opportunities for the involvement of all people in worthwhile recreational pursuits.</P>
    <P>In this address I have concentrated in the main on the funding which is made available by those areas of my own <Col N="577" /> Department for which I have direct responsibility.  Other funding which is important in the overall context of my Department's support for sport include the payment of salaries of physical education teachers, grants to Thomond College of Education through the Higher Education Authority, grants in respect of physical education equipment in schools, in-service courses for teachers, etc.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention at this stage that, in the context of funding from the Department the Department, the Minister of the day and Cospóir should be seen to be there in a helpful and advisory supportive capacity.  If tomorrow morning sufficient funds were available and if you could grant-aid and meet all the financial demands of the sporting organisations, sport would die a natural death. It is necessary to have grant aid that would match the voluntary effort by the community and sporting organisations and match equally the very generous sponsorship which is available for sport in this country.</P>
    <P>A major input to the development of sport and recreation amenities is also made by other Government Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>Examples are the provision of amenity grants and swimming pool grants by the Department of the Environment, capital and youth employment scheme, grants for recreational facilities from the Department of Labour, amenity development of forests by the Department of Forestry and Wildlife, public parks maintenance, etc. by the Office of Public Works, support for the Army School of Equitation and the sail-training scheme by the Department of Defence; the development of water sports, equestrian sports, etc. by Bórd Fáilte; health education promotions which emphasise the importance of sport and regular exercise by the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    <P>While the investment which has been made in sport by the Government in 1984 is to be welcomed, much remains to be done.  However, I feel that the allocation of £1.196 million directly to sport was a major step forward by the Government, <Col N="578" /> having regard to the fact that in 1983 the provision for sport was £719,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that State-aid to sport is not intended to supplant but rather to be supportive and to supplement the finance already being generated in sport.  However, it is recognised that there is a need for more development in sport in terms of facilities, coaching and financing, and it is the Government's intention to continue to provide as high a level of State funding for sport as is possible in the current economic situation.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention the position in relation to facilities in which we are falling far behind.  I am not blaming anyone in particular: we have not the facilities which are necessary to provide the incentive and necessary outlets for our young people.  We must realise the importance of sport.  We must also recognise and appreciate that it is necessary from the point of view of the State to finance sport. It is necessary to encourage it to lead towards a healthier community and to provide the unemployed with outlets for their energies.  It costs so much at present to provide them with care in an institution. I believe a lot of violence, the level of drug abuse, the vandalism which we have, is created and caused by young people with nothing to do and nowhere to go.  It is essential for all of us to recognise these facts, and that is why I am so pleased to attend this debate.  It is in no sense a cause of flagwaving; we must realise and appreciate the strong economic argument that can be put up in favour of greater resources being made available to those people.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned what I intend to do if resources are sufficient and if the lottery is a success, which I have no doubt it will.  I would like to see greater co-operation between the governing bodies in sport so that we could make the best use of scarce resources.  A situation has developed in this country where you have organisations who are doing their own thing in the provision of facilities.  If we had the co-operation and co-ordination of all the people concerned we could make a better use of our scarce resources <Col N="579" /> and we could provide facilities for our young people.</P>
    <P>Only as recently as this morning I had discussions with people in Cospóir about ways and means by which we could bring that about.  I hope that I will improve the position in my term of office.  I accept what the Cathaoirleach says in relation to the handicapped and disabled.  We have provided grants for these people.  In the budget this year we provided a sum of money which would help those people, the area which I mentioned in relation to coaching and to the people who do the background work.  We recognise achievement in the field of sport and we make awards: it is only right that we should. We would not have any awards or achievement in the field of sport were it not for coaches and people who do the background work.  I am also considering ways and means by which we could provide some kind of recognition or awards for those people.</P>
    <P>I am convinced from my term in office that from economic, social and political viewpoints &mdash; this is something that we never bear in mind &mdash; most of our national sporting organisations are 32-county based.  I was very pleased to receive the people involved in the Special Olympics recently and to find out that between Derry and Belfast and Galway and Kerry, their organisations and their officers have a spread throughout the entire 32 counties.  The amount of goodwill which can be generated by those organisations is very difficult to assess.  I can assure you it is an important aspect of sport which should be encouraged.  To all those who contributed I again want to express my gratitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak on the motion and to thank Senator Deenihan for putting down this motion.  I would not entirely praise the Government for what they are doing because I do not think it is entirely adequate, but I call on the Government to continue to support this policy and to improve on it, and would also point out to the Minister some matters of policy of the Government which are definitely harming some of our games.  Sport is important.  Encouraging <Col N="580" /> sport in our schools is nearly as important as educating our youth.  In the times in which we are living, with increased crime and so on, it is most important that our youth be introduced to sport at an early age, so that they would develop an interest in a sport of their choice and continue to play it so that they would not get involved in vandalism or crime.</P>
      <P>I am really interested in and have been involved all my life &mdash; more as an administrator than as a player &mdash; in the GAA. The mover of this motion, Senator Deenihan, had great success on the playing field and I am sure he is also interested in the administration of the games.  My first love is hurling.</P>
      <P>The Minister says:</P>
      <P>The Government particularly appreciated the contribution made by the Gaelic Athletic Association to the fabric of Irish life both in sporting and cultural events.</P>
      <P>He says:</P>
      <P>To mark the celebration of the centenary year of the GAA a special grant of £100,000 was awarded in the budget in recognition of this contribution.</P>
      <P>The GAA appreciates such recognition and it also appreciates the other grants it is getting through the auspices of Cospóir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to raise &mdash; and I am delighted that Senator Deenihan mentioned it when he was moving the motion &mdash; the matter of the VAT on hurleys and rates on GAA fields.  The VAT on hurleys is crippling the promotion of hurling and I am disappointed that the Minister did not make some reference to it in his speech.  Hurleys are subject to VAT at the rate of 35 per cent.  It costs an average hurling club about £1,200 for hurleys and there are about 50 hurling clubs on average, in each county.  There might be 100 in Cork but when you compare that with counties in the North where there might be fewer I would say it would be an average of 50 hurling clubs in each county.  It would cost each of these clubs £1,200 for hurleys and possibly £300 for sliothars or balls.  This would amount to £1,500 to promote hurling, which would be very <Col N="581" /> costly.  This expenditure is subject to 35 per cent VAT.  If you had 50 clubs in a county paying out £1,500 towards hurleys and balls, that would amount to £75,000 for each county, which would be a total of £l,950,000 for the 26 counties.  This is a very vast sum indeed, and that it what it would cost the clubs, not taking into account the individuals or the county boards' other costs.  Thirty five per cent of £l,950,000 is £662,500, so the GAA while they are promoting hurling are subsidising the Government to the tune of £662,500.  This is staggering and it is something that must be recognised.  I do not want to complete removal of VAT from hurleys but I think it could be reduced very much.  The rate of VAT for arts and theatres has been reduced to 5 per cent, and there is no greater art than the game of hurling.  Hurling is our national game.  It has been played in Ireland for a long time and it is a game we cannot allow to die.  It is for that reason that I am pointing out the enormous amount of money it takes to keep hurling going.  This is all done voluntarily, and I hope the Minister might have some discussions with the Minister for Finance. I tried to raise the matter in last years' Finance Bill at Second Stage but the Minister seemed to ignore it.  I tried to raise it later on the Adjournment but I was ruled out of order.  I am delighted &mdash; and I thank Senator Deenihan for tabling the motion &mdash; to have this opportunity to pinpoint it here.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the rates on GAA fields.  A lot of these fields were developed and purchased by GAA clubs for the benefit of the community as a whole and not only for members of the GAA.  I appreciate &mdash; as the Minister has pointed out &mdash; that they get help through the youth employment schemes, which is very much appreciated.  But it is very unfair to put a demand for rates on these pitches.  I am not referring to the community centres or the complexes which can earn money and which should be subject to rates, as would be the case with the big stadia.  There are several of the local stadia in every country &mdash; I am sure Senator Deenihan's own pitch is subject <Col N="582" /> to a rate demand &mdash; and it is very hard for voluntary clubs which have no means of income, except a tournament or something like that, to meet these demands for rates.  This is another area that the Government should examine and try to alleviate the hardships involved.  It would be much better if you could derate these pitches and reduce the VAT &mdash; if it cannot be abolished completely &mdash; to at least 5 per cent.  Then you would be doing as much of a service as if you were financially aiding these boards.</P>
    <P>These fields are also subject to public liability insurance.  They have to pay a premium for public pitches, also increasing the cost along with the rates.  So they have an extraordinarily difficult task to keep solvent and to promote and to develop their pitches to ensure that they will be there for the benefit of all, both young and old.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary in his contribution as contained in the Official Report last week, Volume 104, column 488 said:</P>
    <P>The employment by the schools, with the encouragement of the Government, of outside helpers to make up for this potential deficiency is very important if the team games of which we are so proud are to survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>This is absolutely vital.  In this regard I know that the Minister will speak &mdash; when he speaks in this debate &mdash; of developments that have taken place in this regard.  My son at present, as part of his school curriculum, is being tutored in hurling and in Gaelic football. This is being done by young people who previous to being employed in this area were unemployed. It is done under the supervision of their teachers and it is tremendously successful.</P>
    <P>That is something I very much welcome, and I know that the Cork City juvenile board got a substantial grant through the Youth Employment Agency in order to get unemployed people for coaching in hurling and football.</P>
    <P>On the school curriculum there is an hour or half-an-hour per week &mdash; I am subject to correction &mdash; allocated to physical <Col N="583" /> education.  I do not think it includes Gaelic football or hurling.  This is something that applies to the Minister's Department.  It is important to get young people interested in sport and educate them so as to improve the quality of their lives and the quality of Irish life.  An hour or a half-hour devoted to physical education in cities where they have the facilities is all very well but in country places where they have a love for Gaelic games they have no facilities only to go out to a field and play these games.  A half an hour a week at least should be devoted in the school curriculum to this purpose whether it be Gaelic games or some other game.  The pupils would benefit.  The various GAA bodies such as the Munster Council are considering the employment of a full-time coach.  He should have access to the schools during school hours. Half-an-hour should be allocated for this purpose and it would benefit the children.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Community Games Council.  The Minister said he gave a grant of £58,300 to the council.  This I suppose is good in view of financial constraints but if at all possible I would like to see this sum increased. The National Community Games Council are doing great work in encouraging all types of games among the youth, getting them involved and ensuring that they will continue to play when they grow older.  Hurling is becoming almost impossible for youth to play because of the price of hurleys and the cost to the people who are promoting the game.  The 35 per cent VAT is a major factor in this.  The Central Council subsidise juvenile hurleys but the cost of subsidising juvenile hurleys was much more in 1982 than in 1983 which proves that fewer hurleys were bought by youth because of the high price.  I would appeal to the Minister to see if he could do something about the price of hurleys, which is a very serious matter in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on the tremendous work she is doing for the mentally handicapped.  Long before I came to the Seanad I was well aware of what the Leas-Chathaoirleach was doing, <Col N="584" /> and I am glad to have the opportunity to wish her every success in the future in what she is doing.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach complimented the Minister on his attitude, and I know from a delegation I accompanied to him here concerning a school for mentally handicapped in Carlow that his heart is in the right place, and I hope that later on his work will be a help to those who need special help. We should do everything we can for disadvantaged people.  Swimming pools are a tremendous advantage to such people and we have not got enough pools.  It is difficult to provide them all over the countryside but we should do everything we can to have that facility and help those who really need it.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few things in general about the role of sport, as I see it, having spent every evening for 25 years out with juveniles engaged in GAA or athletics.  I see a tremendous value in sport for young people where they learn to take part.  They learn to grow up and be manly and to take their beating.  It is very important that those in charge of games set a standard for them, give them every motivation going on to the field and right through the game.  Even when losing your &ldquo;cool&rdquo; you encourage them to still play to the rules and when the game is over you get them to understand that it is finished and that there are no excuses or cribbing or objections.  From that point of view sport is tremendous for young people, and we should put a lot more emphasis on the Olympic ideal of taking part in sport.  We should never lose sight of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tremendous admiration for what the Community Games are doing.  In Carlow, the community games is a tremendous event because it is the nearest thing to mini-Olympic games one could find with flags waving and the presentation of medals.  It is superb.  When I mention about taking part in sport, for the sake of taking part, I cannot help having one slight worry, and that is that the competitive element at a very young age at community games level is something that I would question.  There is a certain age when children are able to compete and there is a certain age when they are not <Col N="585" /> able to compete and you cannot explain this to them.  It is pathetic to see young lads with crying mothers and fathers perhaps who should have more sense, being rather silly afterwards.  Parents have to play a very important role in laying down standards for children and making sure that if they run at a very young age that it is a very important affair from a fun point of view and not from the point of view of winning.</P>
    <P>Sport for young people has a tremendous advantage in that very often in class children are being taught who may not be stars from an academic point of view.  If they have to sit all day listening to a teacher who is boring them they can get some consolation from the fact that during break-time, when they are out taking part with the rest of the children, they are the heroes and perhaps later on in the evening everybody is cheering for them at a match.  That does a world of good.  Sport can fill up a very important void in their lives and make them realise that their life is very important.  They may not be the honours group in the class: nowadays, that may not be important but it is important that everybody takes a place in society.  I have found very often that the stars in the football field were not the stars in the classroom &mdash; sometimes they were.  It is marvellous to see them in a role where you can boost their ego for them because they need that boost also.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the many volunteers down the years who have worked so ably and so freely.  My own experience is with the GAA all my life.  I have very limited experience with anything else. People have given their time, their money, their cars and family life in order to promote the games that have done so much to give us a national outlook. Because of that work we are now celebrating the centenary of the GAA.  We could not pay a high enough tribute to people who work in a voluntary capacity. Grants are very important, and I applaud the Government for giving as much as they can, but I would hate to see the situation where everybody would be paid for doing everything where sport is concerned, <Col N="586" /> because they would finish up with a nine-to-five job and sport would not be played in the evening because everybody had to go home.  We could not pay high enough tribute to the volunteers who have done so much.  For that reason I endorse what Senator Kiely and others have said about the VAT on hurleys and rates.  If we cannot compensate the people who work so hard for these organisations by giving them money then we can help them by at least not taking it from them.  We will get it off them when they put petrol in their cars or have to replace cars because they have carried half a team in the back seat going around from place to place.</P>
    <P>I have no qualms about saying that hurling deserves special treatment. People have asked why hurling should get special treatment.  It is our national game; it is the oldest game we have and I do not think we should make an apology to anybody for treating it in a special way. I am fascinated by the idea that Cork gets a special grant to promote hurling.  God knows, we have had enough of Cork; we have seen Clare get the &ldquo;colly-wobbles&rdquo; facing them in Thurles on several occasions. The idea to promote hurling in some of the weaker counties is probably good and the weaker counties would benefit.</P>
    <P>Schools have been mentioned.  I am glad we are building more than schools. We were great for building schools before this but the parish priests only managed to get a site a little bit bigger than a matchbox all around the school and there was no playing area.  We must get away from that stage immediately.  New schools should be guaranteed a playing pitch.  The day is long past when you can have anything except tarmacadam in the school-yard.  I am glad to see that the Department are taking a very broad view on this because this means pupils can play basketball tennis and so on.  This is marvellous, even if it were only for cleanliness around the school.  There should be a playing area close to all national schools.  It is good for children to get out but there is no point talking about providing special time on the curriculum for games and so on if children have to go <Col N="587" /> into a small concrete yard to kick a ball against a toilet wall or some such place. It serves no purpose.  I ask the Minister to ensure that all schools in future will have adequate playing space.</P>
    <P>The idea of sports for all days in schools is a very good one.  It gets across the whole concept of sport.  If someone does not want to participate in a particular event, it is marvellous to say that there is no prize at the end of the day and that it does not matter a tuppenny curse whether you are first or last.  Taking part is what really counts.  The sports for all days in schools have served that purpose. I was at our GAA pitch and it was marvellous to see all kinds of activity going on.  Everybody seemed to be doing something. It took away the competitive element and made people feel they were perfectly entitled to have their freedom and to get enjoyment out of it.</P>
    <P>There are other things that one could say about different sports which I am not involved in.  We will all be very proud of the green singlets being worn in Los Angeles; we will be twice as proud if our representatives are standing on the podium to receive gold medals.  One way or the other, the fact that they are there will be a source of pride.  Whether we win, lose or draw, we will be delighted to see them there.  The standards they set will inspire young people.  I am glad the Government have done something to help them by providing money.  I will conclude by wishing all our athletes who go to Los Angeles the very best of luck. We will be proud of them, wherever they finish.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this motion.  There is a duty on all of us to do everything possible to help people, especially young people, to recognise the importance of healthy recreation in their lives.  There is no more healthy recreation, in every other sense as well as in the physical fitness sense, than sport.  For this reason I believe the Government have a clear duty to promote and support all sporting activities and the various bodies involved in the organisation of such activities. I do not believe that any Government <Col N="588" /> yet have given a sufficiently high priority to the promotion of sport and sporting activities.  The encouragement and promotion of sport and the development of sporting skills should be an important part &mdash; probably the most important part &mdash; of the physical education programme at both primary and second level schools.  The creation of an increased awareness of the value of sport should also be one of the main aims of any worth while health education programme.</P>
      <P>There is a growing recognition of the fact that physical exercise is absolutely essential to the present generation if they are to stay healthy because present-day living is the enemy of the human body. The majority of people today spend much of every working day either sitting behind a desk or behind the wheel of a car and a large part of every night crouched in front of a television set.  At best, if we are lucky, such a lifestyle will only cause our bodies to become fat, flabby and stiff, but for the not so lucky the result can be heart disease, high blood pressure or, indeed, any one of a variety of other problems.  On the other hand, not alone do people who take physical exercise have a better chance of avoiding such problems but it is a recognised fact that such people tend to have a happier and more confident outlook on life as a whole.</P>
      <P>Tributes have been paid to Cospóir, the National Sports Council, for the work they have done in propagating the concept of sport for all but a lot more needs to be done.  Activities such as walking, swimming, cycling, jogging and running should be continually promoted through the media.  Cospóir should be provided with sufficient funds to sustain an all-the-year-round advertising campaign to convince people of the benefits of physical exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the cost would be more than offset by the saving that would result in the provision of health care services. People also need to be convinced that exercise does not have to mean that one has to suffer pain, exhaustion or even embarrassment.  Healthy exercise should be fun.  It should not exhaust the body. <Col N="589" /> The emphasis should be on moderation in relation to exercise, as in most other things.</P>
    <P>I would also like to join with the Minister and other Senators in complimenting Cospóir on having inaugurated the sport for all day in primary schools.  The aim of sports-for-all day in primary schools is to encourage every primary school child to become involved in some form of sport or physical recreation, and to increase the children's awareness of the value of sport.  I am fully in agreement that the place to start promoting the sport for all concept is in the primary schools. I am convinced that if children's interests in physical recreation can be aroused when they are in school, especially in primary school, this will continue as they grow older.</P>
    <P>As far as the younger age group are concerned, I believe that the community games movement has done, and is doing, a wonderful job.  Community games introduce young boys and girls to the sport of their choice at a very early age. The movement encourages the pursuit of healthy interests and enables young people to discover their talents and abilities and to test them in a variety of ways. Since the community games competitions are organised annually by parish or area committees, all sections of the community have an opportunity to become involved.  Everybody involved in the community games movement at local, county and national level deserves to be congratulated.  I believe the community games movement should get more Government aid.  The only <i>caveat</i> I would enter as far as community games are concerned is that it should be continually stressed to the young people involved that to compete is more important than to win, and that the enjoyment of taking part should be the motivation for competing rather than the desire to win.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by previous speakers to the GAA and to the great work they have done in the 100 years since their foundation for the preservation and promotion of our national games.  I want to endorse everything that has been said in this regard and to be <Col N="590" /> associated with the tributes that have been paid to the GAA.</P>
    <P>It is universally acknowledged that present day youth have to contend with problems which were totally unknown to previous generations.  We are living in a society which has more leisure time at its disposal than any earlier generation. Every year the GAA face stiffer competition from a variety of counter attractions, some of which could be described as insidious.  Therefore it is more important than ever that we should assist our youth to organise and to provide their own recreation and to make proper facilities available to them to ensure that their recreation takes place in a healthy and wholesome atmosphere.  Those engaged in the promotion of our games should not rest satisfied with the mere organisation of games and competitions.  Today, more than ever before, character formation and the mental and moral aspects of youth training require a greater emphasis than at any time in the past.  I should like to support the call made to the Minister for the removal, or at least the reduction, of value added tax on hurleys and sliothars, and also the appeal that has been made to him in relation to rates on GAA pitches.  Senator Deenihan expressed the fear that because of the fact that nowadays the majority of teachers in primary schools are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;females, there might not be the same emphasis on coaching and the encouragement of our national games in the primary schools.  In my part of the country lady teachers are doing a tremendous job as far as encouraging and coaching the children in their schools are concerned.  The inter-school competitions and tournaments that take place every year are stronger and better than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with other speakers who referred to the forthcoming Olympic Games, to the work being done by the National Olympic Council and to extend every good wish to the people who will <Col N="591" /> be representing this country at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.  I should also like to express regret that because politics has become mixed up with sport, certain countries will not be competing in Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>When we talk of sport we mean physical games of every description, both team and individual games for all &mdash; the young, the old and the handicapped.  The concept of sport at every level should have popular Government support and encouragement.  The philosophy of sport for all must be given a greater emphasis, and every encouragement possible should be given to those who promote this ideal.</P>

      <P>I want to express my gratitude to Senator Deenihan.  I agree with this motion in so far as there is financial commitment or help towards sport but it is not enough.  Even if there was twice as much financial help it would still not be enough.  I hope Senator Deenihan will agree with me on this, and I feel sure he will.</P>
      <P>Coming as I do from an area which housed the Tailteann Games &mdash; which were famous in their time and held in the small townland of Tailteann between Kells and Navan &mdash; I am interested in this motion.  Coming from Kells, the home of great handballers over the years, I must say that the handball club is doing a very fine job and marvellous work for the young people, but it could do far more if extra money was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien has referred to the old proverb <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>&mdash; a sound mind in a sound body.  This is something with which I am sure we would all have to agree.  Like Senator Browne, I would be worried about the competitive element in sport because there can only be one winner.  While I have the greatest admiration for winners and for great sportsmen like Senator Deenihan, I have greater admiration for the people who never make it &mdash; the people who try when there is no great trophy or acclaim for them.  These are the people who make sport, and without them we would have no Senator Deenihans.  In competitive sports there is not enough time given to <Col N="592" /> those who do not get into the top grade. Teachers and those in charge want to be involved with those who are going to get medals and to bring honour to the clubs. My heart is with those who know they will never make it.  This is one of the things we learn in life.  As we grow up we may feel we are the best, but then we find we are not the best, and sometimes we find we are at the very end of the queue.</P>
    <P>I welcome Minister of State, Deputy Creed's, enthusiasm and commitment to sport.  I should like, with all the other Senators, to pay tribute to all those people who played their part in sport over the years for no financial reward, particularly the voluntary workers.  I should also like to pay tribute to the GAA with which I was involved all my life as a player and at club level.  In my view, it was a mistake that the GAA ever acquired licences to sell intoxicating drink.  While my views on drink are very well known &mdash; by and large I have liberal views &mdash; nevertheless drink seems to have an importance in every walk of life.  I know of one secondary school &mdash; not in my home town &mdash; where more than 25 per cent of the girls became pregnant due to the fact that they were attending a disco where intoxicating drink was sold. It is a sad reflection on us in every sphere, particularly in sport, if we must have drink to enjoy ourselves.  I should like to pay tribute to the Health Education Bureau and I hope that their courses on drugs and drink will be followed by all the secondary schools.  I should like to see extra money being made available for physical education because sport and games might help to solve the problems of unemployment, drugs and crime.  For that reason, I would hope that more money would be made available.</P>
    <P>Finally, like other Senators, I would have to say that special help should be given to the disabled and the handicapped. I welcome the Minister's commitment and his enthusiasm and I hope he will look into all those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>I take this opportunity to thank Senators who contributed to this debate.  I am very pleased with the overall <Col N="593" /> response from both sides of the House and their very worthwhile contributions. I am sure we all share a common goal and their very worth while contributions. ideal of &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo;.  I think this was very well demonstrated in this House during the debate.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Lanigan's expression of dismay at my audacity to put this motion before the House, I feel I would be failing as a sportsman and as somebody involved in the promotion of sports if I did not highlight the extraordinarily high percentage increase which this Government in their wisdom have made towards the funding of sport for 1984.  On this point, I would like to exhort the Government to continue along these lines.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to what various speakers have said on this subject. I would like to begin with the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Creed.  Deputy Creed has made a very valuable contribution towards the promotion of sport since his election to the office of Minister of State as, indeed, had previous Ministers of State.  It is a very important position to hold in Government and we are very fortunate to have a person of the calibre of Deputy Creed, holding the office at the moment.  I welcome his novel idea of promoting a sports lottery.  This would be very important for the funding of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also mentioned the proposal to set up a national sports stadium which would include a 50 metre swimming pool which Senator Fallon pointed out was a great necessity.  As I mentioned last Wednesday, I feel that a national sports assembly should be set up in this country. Although he made no reference to this in his reply, I hope the Minister will bear it in mind in the future.  This whole idea of a sports stadium could be considered together with the suggestion of setting up a sports assembly and a sports house and the eventual setting up of a national sports library and information resource centre.  If this concept was developed it could result in the promotion and the further development of sport in Ireland. <Col N="594" /> I will be taking up the matter again with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Apart from the idea of a sports stadium, sports assembly and a national sports house, I would also like to welcome the Minister's recommendations in coaching and administration.  I referred to this already last Wednesday.  I pointed out that we are deficient in this respect especially when we compare our administrative standards to EEC countries and those of the United Kingdom and the USA.  There is now an awareness developing not alone in Deputy Creed's Department but within the various organisations as well.  Coaching is now considered a priority rather than the unstructured and unco-ordinated playing of games.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference as well to the development of our outdoor facilities which should be a priority.  I welcome the recommendations made by the Cospóir conference in Westport recently, that we should exploit our great reservoir of natural outdoor advantages in the future.  This would have a tourist aspect and be an employment creator as well. The Minister, Deputy Creed, as well as other Senators, mentioned the importance of sport for young people.  We are all very much aware of this.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to what each of the speakers said.  Senator Fallon mentioned the contribution that sport can make in preventing crime.  I agree with Senator Fallon to some extent.  However, unless teams are properly disciplined and administered it need not necessarily have this effect and much depends on the ability of the coaches to inculcate proper values in these young people.  From my own experience I have seen young sports people who were not automatically gentlemen and who do not necessarily resist the temptation to commit crime. Senator Fallon also made reference to VAT on sports equipment.  This should be considered, especially VAT on hurleys, and no doubt a case could be made for a lower rate of VAT on sports equipment. It would make a further contribution towards the promotion of sport in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I would like to congratulate Senator Honan on the great work she has done on behalf of the handicapped.  This is an area where I worked for a period of time and I fully appreciate her demand for more funding for the handicapped.  For a long time they were the forgotten people of Ireland.  I welcome the awareness that has developed in the country mainly through the efforts of people like Senator Honan.  I request the Minister to consider increasing the funding of sport for the handicapped, especially the provision of teachers of physical education for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely mentioned rates on GAA grounds.  I agree with him in that a serious look should be taken at the level of rating of GAA pitches.  I will be pursuing this matter still further with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly expressed his desire to see a further development of PE in the primary and secondary schools with emphasis on teaching skills.  I agree with these sentiments.  I have advocated a similar policy on previous occasions.  I am glad that he mentioned that the female teachers in County Roscommon are doing a very good job and I am glad that they were not around in 1980 when Kerry beat Roscommon in the All-Ireland Final.  We will be expecting a lot from Roscommon now that the females have assumed their responsibility.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzsimons said sport should be for all.  It should cross the social class divides, the sexes and various somato types.  I agree with him wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome Senator O'Leary's contribution, especially the point he made on the employment of unemployed PE teachers or experts to teach part-time in schools.  I made the point last Wednesday that these people could be employed in both the secondary and primary sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made a point about the contribution of sport towards the constructive <Col N="596" /> use of leisure time and pointed to the unemployment levels, the shorter working week trend and early retirement age.  He pointed out that as a result there will be more people seeking better recreation facilities and they must be provided for.  I agree with Senator Browne that the competitive aspect has been emphasised too much in community games.  I had the experience last week of seeing children crying on the side of the track during the Kerry finals in Tralee. This must be avoided because it is not what was intended when the community games were set up.  The emphasis must be on competing for enjoyment rather than on winning.  There is too much emphasis on providing trophies for winners rather than some other form of recognition.  In conclusion I enjoyed very much bringing forward this motion.  I am glad that Senators from all sides of the House took an active interest in it and contributed very objectively to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter tonight because of a tremendous sense of frustration which I feel and which I think is shared by public representatives throughout the counties of Connacht.  That frustration has been developed because of what we see as a type of administrative constipation in dealing with applications for unemployment assistance by small farmers and appeals lodged by people who have suffered a reduction or a complete removal of the assistance which heretofore they were receiving.</P>
      <P>In raising this matter I am not raising the issue of notional assessment versus factual assessment of small farmers in determining their entitlement to employment assistance.  That question has been settled by the High Court, confirmed by the Supreme Court, following an action instituted by Wexford farmers, supported by the Irish Farmers' Association, to challenge the constitutionality of the PLV system for rating purposes.  What I am raising is the administration of the factual system by the Department of Social Welfare.  Some months ago I had the pleasure, with certain Deputies and Senators from the affected areas, of attending a meeting with the Minister of State, his colleague, Deputy John Donnellan, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, and senior officials of their Department when we discussed this problem.  We had a lengthy and stormy meeting but I would also say, for the record, a fruitful meeting, because following that meeting the Minister made certain promises to us with regard to changes in the administration of that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were promised, firstly, advance notice in all cases of visits by social welfare officers to give applicants the opportunity of getting their affairs in order, to give them the opportunity of detailing items of income and items of expenditure. Secondly, we were promised that applicants would be informed of the total gross income on which assessment was based and the total amount of expenses incurred in earning that income and allowable for assessment purposes. Thirdly, we were told that applicants who appealed against assessment would be <Col N="598" /> made aware of specific items on which the assessment of means was made.</P>
    <P>Applicants are now receiving the advance notice and that is an advance for which the two Ministers of State, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Donnellan, must be thanked and congratulated.  It is a very substantial advance; an advance from the sudden call, the hard knock on the door when somebody would be caught unawares and would be forced to give details which he could not be expected to get at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>Applicants who appeal find that different social welfare officers use different yardsticks in determining the costings of specific items of expenditure.  The best two examples I can cite are of motoring expenses and the cost of replacement stock.  On the question of motoring expenses used for agricultural purposes, what is the yardstick in determining the cost of an average car to an average farmer in rural Ireland for a particular year?  Are social welfare officers taking into account items such as petrol, tax, insurance, servicing and matters of that nature?  The information I have would suggest that they do not.  That is one item of expenditure which is not being included at the moment.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty which is causing tremendous frustration, which is now reaching boiling point in rural Ireland, is the question of the delay in processing appeals.  One can only think that officialdom in many cases is defeating justice and many people have lost hope and faith in a system which is limitless.  Furthermore, the manner in which appeals are determined is that files go from office to office, travel from the west coast to the east coast and while an appeal is in progress people can get very little information. I would urge the Minister to implement a uniform code of procedure for dealing with all applications, to publicise that code of procedure and to ensure that no reduction or disallowance of payments is made until the reassessment and appeal are determined to ensure that the entire system is speeded up.</P>
    <P>When I say a uniform procedure, I think the staff who carry out initial investigations should be retrained.  Factual <Col N="599" /> assessment is totally different from notional assessment.  I do not think the people who are carrying out factual assessments under the new system are properly trained in the job they have to do.  Certainly I am not satisfied in my area when I see people coming to me from every area of Mayo west &mdash; I mention one place in particular, Louisburgh &mdash; where there are little girls coming out with the local taxi driver going to specific houses to do checks.  I agree that people have to travel but certainly that does nothing to sell the system or to make the system acceptable to the people it is meant to serve.  This is a system that is meant to serve people.  The operation of the system should be properly publicised. It is time that Department jumped into the eighties and took a leaf out of the book of bodies like An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann and saw how they publicise the services which they are operating. It is important that by publicity, and in a way that can be got across nicely, the Department should explain the current procedures to the people whom this system is meant to serve.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to ensure that as a right every applicant is given an answer to his application within a specified period, indicating how his factual assessment is being carried out, indicating the income accepted and the expenditure accepted.  Failure to do this will lead to many unnecessary appeals.  Promises were given in this regard but I have not seen any evidence that this has been brought into action as yet.  It is difficult to expect people not to appeal when they do not know how their application was determined in the first instance.  Until this is done there can be no faith in the system.</P>
    <P>The entire appeals system should be opened up.  The question must be asked whether it is right that appeals in this area should be determined by officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  Appeals are being determined by people who belong to the same body of the Civil Service as those who initially carried out investigations, and for many people having to face the social welfare appeal is a bit like going to law with the devil and <Col N="600" /> the court being in hell.  That is the way many people in rural Ireland look on it. I do not say that by way of criticism of the officials of the Department, but that is the system that exists and the one that people have to suffer under.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong and indeed I do not think it is constitutional to deprive somebody of payment before an appeal has been determined.  It is wrong that somebody overnight can lose his entitlement. A family can be deprived of a substantial portion of their income overnight without an appeal even having been filed let alone determined.  A small farm may lose a very important supplement overnight without an appeal being determined, and whereas ultimately if the recipient is proved right he will receive back-payment he nevertheless has to wait a considerable period without any payment whatsoever.  The operation of this system should be reviewed to ensure that no reductions are made until an appeal has been finally determined.  A stay of execution should be placed on the operation of the system until final determination.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties being experienced may be due to staffing within the Minister's Department.  It is no answer for any Minister to come into this House and say that there are delays because there are not sufficient staff.  I call upon the Minister of State and his colleague the Minister to ensure that staff are made available to deal expeditiously with these appeals.  If staff are not made available then the people of this country will rapidly lose faith in the operation of this system, and they will also lose faith politically in those of us who support the Government who at the moment are politically directing the system.  Staff should be redeployed immediately to ensure that this system is seen by the people it serves to operate properly.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter because of my awareness of the many cases where appeals have been filed and nothing has happened. Today I have given to the Minister's colleague, Deputy Donnellan, a list of eight appeals filed in recent months and I have given a copy of that list to officials of his Department, and I would <Col N="601" /> like to see something happening on those specific cases.  Those applicants have already lost hope and faith in the system. I want to maintain some hope in it, and I hope the Minister can give us an assurance that the officials of his Department will be taking steps to allow this system to move more rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Durcan in his contention that there are undue delays in the processing of social welfare applications for unemployment assistance, that is small farmers' dole.  I had hoped that it would not be necessary and that the new streamlining and new regulations and criteria introduced would have had the desired effect and would in fact have relieved the log jam that is now clogging, stifling and strangulating the system.  If the gentlemen in the Department of Social Welfare who make the decisions at deciding officer level, at appeals officer level or indeed on the ground, were asked to take a cut in salary of £30, £40 or £50 per week I can imagine the natural recoil in anger with which such a proposal would be greeted.  This is what has happened throughout the length and breadth of the western counties.  Time and time again small farmers, dole recipients, have been slashed and cut and in some cases wrongly cut in their social welfare assessments. I would again make the point that we have made repeatedly, and we made it on the occasion of the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill to this House, that we hold absolutely no brief whatever for anybody who is not entitled to get such benefit.  We certainly hold briefs for the hundreds of people who have been unjustly disallowed this form of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can point to corners of County Mayo where people were allegedly factually assessed, where the social welfare entitlement was withdrawn, where we assisted them with their appeals and where benefit was restored.  Surely the fact that somebody has gone from £35 to zero and back to £35 again underlines the fact that these people were wrongly assessed in the first place and that the final line in the criteria of instructions laid down for <Col N="602" /> social welfare officers, and that is that their function and purpose is to assist and to advise social welfare applicants, is not being and has not been applied in either the letter or the spirit.  I am not pointing the finger at every social welfare officer but I am pointing the finger at some, and I can back up my contentions with statistics. Naturally there are going to be delays in the system.</P>
    <P>When a new system and a more cumbersome one is introduced it stands to reason that it is going to take more time and it stands to reason that the additional staff which are asked for by Senator Durcan must be provided if we are not going to have such undue delays.  It stands to reason that you will have delays in the system of appeals when a deadline is set for the assessment of 13,000 small farmers. Again naturally enough when we have inaccurate assessments or assessments which are carried out without the evidence for same being produced to the recipient or the applicant it stands to reason that people are going to appeal and the more people who appeal the more the system is clogged and stifled.  I know the Department will say that if an appeal is justified and if it is allowed this, in effect, constitutes what happens in the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>I support the contention of Senator Durcan that these people should be permitted to retain the benefit until such time as the final court of appeal, and that is the decision of the appeals officer, arrives in the front door.  The key to this is the word &ldquo;factual&rdquo;.  If somebody has been factually assessed there should be no fear whatever on the part of the social welfare authorities of the production of the evidence to sustain the contention that they are not entitled to benefit.  If something has been done factually, all the items in relation to gross income on the one hand and expenses on the other hand, if these have been carried out in accordance with specific regulations laid down by the Minister, then there should be no fear on anybody's part of the production of such evidence, and indeed I would say that it would greatly facilitate in reducing possibly the number of appeals which are disallowed on good <Col N="603" /> grounds because the people would be deterred from appealing in the first place.</P>
    <P>I also back up the contention of Senator Durcan in relation to the fact that many of the social welfare officers carrying out these assessments do not know the mechanics of farming and are not <i>au fait</i> with farming situations.  They come from non-farming backgrounds and have not the training to deal adequately or competently with the gymnastics of a farm accounts system, and indeed they do not understand the components that go to make up the everyday running of a farm. It is vital that all the expenses necessarily incurred in the running of a farm are taken into consideration.  It is vital that these must be sought by the social welfare officer if through ignorance on the part of the farmer he is incapable of articulating them.  It is vital that the hardship that is being caused to the people in the west of Ireland at present by the withdrawing of £l.4 million in terms of this form of benefit must be relieved.  We made great play on the Social Welfare Bill of the introduction of the family income supplement. This is a family income supplement. It is a farm income supplement. The statistics are there from independent bodies and agencies to prove conclusively that with the level of subsistence farming in the west there is need for this form of benefit.</P>
    <P>Again I make the point that any social welfare officer, and civil servant, any politician, who was asked to take a freeze in salary let alone a cut would naturally recoil in anger and in anguish.  This is what has happened across the board.  I commend the Minister of State and his colleague, Deputy Donnellan, for introducing the new streamlined system, the new regulations, the new criteria.  Unfortunately they are not being adhered to and things have not, in fact, reached the stage of perfection that we would like. The late Ernest Blythe went down in history as the person who removed the shilling from the old age pensioner.  Minister, I ask you not to write your name into the annals of the history of this House and the history of Ministers and <Col N="604" /> Ministers of State for Social Welfare by compounding another wrong.</P>

      <P>The problem of delays in dealing with applications and appeals under the various social welfare schemes has been and continues to be a matter of serious concern.  I would like to assure the House that I am very conscious and very concerned that there are delays and, in many cases, long delays in having claims dealt with.  This is apart altogether from these delays which can occur in dealing with correspondence and queries of various kinds.  There would be no point in my denying that difficulties exist, and it is only by recognising these difficulties that action can then be taken to deal with them.</P>
      <P>As far as the unemployment assistance scheme is concerned the problems are particularly acute.  Senators will appreciate that the very rapid increase in the live register in recent years has resulted in a massive increase in the workload on the employment exchanges, outdoor inspection staff and the headquarters sections involved in administering the scheme. The embargo on the filling of vacancies in the public service has been felt acutely here.  In a period of recession the workload in the Department of Social Welfare increases.  It has not been possible to allocate the necessary additional staff, even though some additional staff have been allocated to that area, but certainly not the number required to deal with applications for unemployment assistance and to deal with them as quickly as I would like them to be dealt with.  This situation inevitably gives rise to delays. The way in which the unemployment assistance scheme is administered is also under review and procedures are being simplified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The devolving of decision-making from headquarters to local offices to the greatest extent possible will help to get cases dealt with more quickly.  This process, however, means additional work for the local offices and it is not something which can be implemented overnight. The present system involves a considerable amount of movement of papers <Col N="605" /> between the various offices, particularly where local branch offices are involved, and the priority is to reduce this movement to the minimum consistent with the employment exchange being able to exercise control on claims being dealt with and to control them efficiently and to be in a position to know the up-to-date position with regard to a claim at any particular time.  In the long-term the computerisation of the unemployment payment scheme will offer significant possibilities in this area, but this prospect is some time in the future.</P>
    <P>In so far as small holders are concerned, the requirement, arising from the High Court decision, in relation to the PLV system to review the circumstances of all smallholders who had been on the notional system of means assessment and to transfer them to a factual system has greatly increased the workload on the unemployment branch.  The process of re-investigations started in May 1983 and to date over 9,000 small holders have had their cases reviewed.  The review involves in each case an investigation by a social welfare officer who must take account of all items of farm income and expenses and on the basis of whose report the decision on entitlement in any particular case is based.</P>
    <P>The system of assessing means of small holders for unemployment assistance purposes has been the subject of a great deal of comment and criticism over the past 12 months.  A number of changes have been introduced in the administration of the scheme.  Arrangements have been made for claimants to be notified in advance of the visit by the social welfare officer.  In the advance notification details are given of the items of income and expenses which can be taken into account in the assessment as well as the documentation which the social welfare officer will require.  The more detail which the applicant can supply to the social welfare officer the better.  Under the legislation it is the deciding officer who makes the decision on entitlement to assistance.</P>
    <P>I would hope that many of the queries which applicants may have about particular items of income or expenditure can <Col N="606" /> be sorted out at the initial investigation stage in discussion with the social welfare officer.  I cannot stress this point too strongly, because if all the queries were cleared up at that stage it would relieve the burden on subsequent inquiries and appeals where the biggest time lapse happens. The time lapse between the initial decision given in the case of a small holder applicant is not, however, the main concern in so far as they continue to receive payment of unemployment assistance at the rates appropriate to their means, notionally assessed, until the decision on the basis of factual means assessment is given.</P>
    <P>It is at the appeals stage that the main problem arises.  It is here that I hope the new arrangements, recently introduced, will help the situation significantly by enabling queries to be dealt with at an earlier stage and thereby reducing the number of cases actually going to appeal. It is open to any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the deciding officer to appeal against that decision and have his case referred to an appeals officer.  The Senators made a plea for assistance to continue, pending the outcome of an appeal.  Under the legislation it is the deciding officer who has the legal authority. It is not possible to continue payment. I agree that it can cause hardship in certain cases.  There would be the problem, if we were to do what Senator Durcan and Senator Higgins have asked for, that some people would inevitably be in a position of having to refund money when their appeal was disallowed.  Of course, it might also have the other effect of encouraging everyone to appeal because by appealing they would know they could continue on a higher rate. That might not be a good thing either because it would clog up further the appeals system.  It is the deciding officer, under the legislation, who has that power.</P>
    <P>The appeals branch of the Department has also been seriously affected by the increase in the number of claims in recent years, particularly on the unemployment payments side.  There has been an unavoidable lengthening of the time involved in dealing with cases.  Within the <Col N="607" /> constraints which exist every effort is made and will continue to be made to ensure that the delays are kept to a minimum. The arrangement for advance notification of means investigation and the fact that smallholders will in future be informed of the actual gross income and expenses with which they have been assessed should reduce the pressure at the appeal stage.  In many cases hitherto when an appeal has been made it is necessary, arising from the contentions made by the appellant, to have a second re-investigation of the means carried out. This causes additional delay.  In fact the papers may have to be referred a number of times to the social welfare officer for further information on particular items. No two cases are the same, and generally speaking the only way in which the situation can be fully examined is by an investigation on the spot.  Appeals officers are independent deciding authorities and will only decide a case when they are satisfied that they are aware of the full facts.  Reference has been made to delays occurring before the papers are actually referred to the appeals officer.  Where there is an apparent discrepancy in the information supplied by the appellant and the report of the social welfare officer the case <Col N="608" /> would be referred back to the social welfare officer for further clarification.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I can only say that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to deal with cases as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a reasonable standard of service within the confines of existing resources.  The Department is seeking the provision of additional staff and is introducing administrative measures designed to speed up the process as far as possible.  The additional workload arising from the reinvestigations of the means of smallholders has posed particular difficulties over the past year.  When this process of reinvestigation and review has been completed the situation should be an improvement in the level of service overall.  I would hope that the measures recently taken will be recognised as a genuine attempt to meet the criticisms levelled at the scheme and to improve its administration in particularly difficult circumstances with limited resources and trying to work within the confines of the embargo in the public service.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 June 1984.</P>
