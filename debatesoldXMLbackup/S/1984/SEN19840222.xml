      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 in that order.  I propose that we complete No. 2, the motion on neutrality, between 7 and 8.30 p.m. or earlier if we reach it.  It would also be my intention to have an adjournment for tea from 6 to 7 o'clock.</P>
      <P>Regarding No.4 on which questions have been asked on a number of occasions as to why it has not been taken, I just want to assure the House that the Leader of the House has been making many efforts to get the up-to date report so that we would not be discussing an old report.  I want to confirm that it is with the printers but because we have no control over how long it will take the printers to complete the work on it, it is proposed by way of the resolution in No. 4 to have a debate in Government time on the developments in the EEC during 1983 to facilitate the Members, even if the report is not printed.  We would intend to take that on Wednesday, 7 March.  The House will be sitting in the meantime but that is the date that it is proposed to take that. I can assure Members that the Leader wanted to facilitate the House and has made every effort to have the report available.  If not, we will proceed on No. 4 as stated there.</P>

      <P>May I propose that <Col N="98" /> Standing Orders be changed today in order that we might discuss in this Chamber the deplorable acts which were carried on against a former Member of this House, Séamus Mallon.  Séamus Mallon contributed very constructively to the Seanad debates during the time he was here and contributed to the work of the Forum.  It has to be said that he has acquitted himself very honourably as an Irishman and I feel we should suspend Standing Orders so that this House could discuss the deplorable incidents that have taken place in relation to the bugging of the house in which he was staying in Dublin.  It is deplorable that a former Member of this House, and possibly because he was a former Member of the House, had this type of action carried out against him.  It is equally deplorable that at a time when he is a very important member of the Forum which is acting on behalf of the Irish nation that this should have happened.  I propose that Standing Orders be suspended so that a discussion can take place on these actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to facilitate the Cathaoirleach, and to be fair, I was not consulted by the Leader of the Opposition and I did not know that he was going to raise this matter.  There would be a lot of sympathy, I am sure, among Members for the idea that facilities should be available for such discussion but in fairness to all of us, if we are to work this out in an orderly fashion, I suggest that the Whips and the Leaders of the groups should meet and discuss this matter.  They should then communicate with the Chair, who is now in an invidious situation in regard to ruling on this matter.  I propose that the <Col N="99" /> Whips and Leaders meet as soon as possible to discuss how to approach this problem.  It is a problem and the Senator will find I have a willing ear.  If I had been approached on this matter we would have had an opportunity to have consultations before the House met.  To propose the suspension of Standing Orders without a discussion with the Members responsible for the orderly running of the House is rather unfair of the Leader of the Opposition. I formally propose that if necessary we meet and discuss the matter, or go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or to any forum the Leader of the Opposition wishes.  Last week it was agreed that we would have a certain Order of Business today.  A Minister is waiting for a very important Bill to be taken in this House.  I propose the Order of Business in the order in which I originally announced it and I recommend that we have discussions on the other matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader on the Government side is he telling us that we may get a chance to discuss the matter?  With all due respect to important Bills before the House later this evening, we owe it, as colleagues, to the former Senator Mallon &mdash; who was on television last night &mdash; to make it clear that we are backing him.  It is not at all clear out there that we are backing Mr. Mallon and that he has been wronged.  I am asking the Acting Leader of the House is somebody going to come in here and defend Mr. Mallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion of the Acting Leader of the House that we have a meeting which should take place as soon as possible after the Order of Business is discussed.  I take issue with him as to the necessity for discussions prior to raising the matter here in the sense that there is no mechanism in the Seanad to raise matters of an urgent nature here as they arise.  In the other <Col N="100" /> House matters of urgent importance can be taken on a particular day.  We are confined on the Adjournment Debate to issues which are of minor importance. We cannot raise matters of major importance on the Adjournment Debate.  In this context I raise the matter here.  I accede to the request of the Acting Leader of the Opposition that we meet and discuss the matter today.  On the Order of Business as it has been suggested, on item No. 1, I would ask that we take the Second Stage only today because there will be amendments tabled to the Bill.  Is it the intention that we take only the Second Stage today?</P>

    <Title>National Social Service Board Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the Bill arises out of the Government's commitment to re-establish the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis, to repeal the National Community Development Agency Act, 1982 and to establish a Combat Poverty Organisation under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the National Social Service Board, in one form or another, has been in existence since 1971.  The National Social Service Council, as it was until 1981, was set up by the Minister for Health as an informal body to be responsible for the support and development of community information <Col N="102" /> centres and to be a national resource centre to help health boards and voluntary organisations in the development of voluntary social services.  The council was reconstituted as the National Social Service Board in 1981 and had its rather unwieldy membership of 29 reduced to 11.  It retained the same functions and also became responsible for servicing the National Council for the Aged which was also established in 1981.</P>
    <P>The board was still a non-statutory body at that time but with the establishment of the National Community Development Agency in 1982, the staff functions and responsibilities of the board were subsumed into the agency and at last the board and its staff achieved the status and security of a statutory body.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the Dáil, I have had grave doubts about the viability and potential for effectiveness of the National Community Development Agency from its very inception.  The agency was a hastily conceived hybrid organisation within no clear and workable mandate.  The very concept of community development is a nebulous one and this was reflected in the functions of the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency was intended to promote the concepts of self-help and community development; to foster and assist projects of community involvement and activity; and to facilitate the mobilisation of self-help in deprived communities.  The agency's function in relation to poverty was not explicit, it was intertwined with the vague concept of community development and never had much chance in the fight against poverty.</P>
    <P>Its possibilities of anti-poverty activities were further curtailed by its statutory obligation to take on all the existing functions and responsibilities of the National Social Service Board, then an unincorporated, informally established body. Poverty is an important and complex issue that cannot be lumped together with a set of functions and responsibilities which are quite distinct from it.  Poverty and inequality must be singled out for special attention.  The Government's commitment to combat poverty is being and will be pursued in the context of a <Col N="103" /> single-minded approach to the issue by an organisation unencumbered by other responsibilities or functions.</P>
    <P>I believe that poverty derives from the class basis of our society.  It derives from the structures of our economic and social system which create and consolidate inequality.  The idea of community development was, I believe, founded on the outdated and discredited notion that the poor are poor primarily through their own fault and if we engage in community development somehow their poverty will be alleviated.</P>
    <P>Community development is only valid as a means to combat poverty in so far as the causes of that poverty are located within the community itself.  The injustices and inequalities which create poverty can be found in society as a whole and even if individual communities successfully undergo a process of community development it is unlikely that this will in any way affect the inequality and poverty within those communities.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty is primarily a structural problem relating to the powerlessness of particular groups in an individualistic and market oriented society. The problem of poverty is also interlinked with the causes of inequality and therefore I believe it is important that we develop the anti-poverty philosophy which existed in this country some years ago.</P>
    <P>Because the realities of poverty and inequality are so inextricably linked into the structures and effects of the social welfare system and its interaction with policies in areas such as taxation, health, education and housing I considered it appropriate to seek the advice of the Commission on Social Welfare before formally establishing a Combat Poverty Organisation.  The commission was established in September last to review and report on the social welfare system and related social services and to make recommendations for their development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  When I addressed the inaugural meeting of the commission, I made it clear to the members that I considered their most important and most urgent <Col N="104" /> task was to advise me on the implementation of an anti-poverty plan, the establishment of an organisation to combat poverty and the introduction of a new and comprehensive EEC poverty programme. The commission have now given me their advice on this matter and I have prepared my proposals for the Government accordingly.  I expect that the Government will make a decision on these proposals shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to drawing up and implementing an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning, to re-establishing the structure of the Combat Poverty Organisation with local involvement and to developing constructive community action against poverty as recommended in the 1980 Combat Poverty Report.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that redistribution of resources will be necessary.  We can no longer depend on growth in national income and on more foreign borrowing to deal with the problem.  We must now face poverty head-on by redistributing existing resources.  I look forward to the re-activation of an anti-poverty programme by this Government.</P>
    <P>I have already stated quite clearly in the Dáil that I felt it was undesirable to combine the functions of the former board with those of the agency.  I firmly believe that the State's obligation to work towards the elimination of poverty and its obligation to develop the voluntary social service sector&mdash;while not mutually exclusive&mdash;do require the commitment of two separate organisations.</P>
    <P>If this board is to make a major impact on the development and expansion of our voluntary social service sector, it must be re-established on a statutory basis.  The board has undergone a number of changes since June 1981 and I am confident that its re-establishment under legislation will greatly enhance its role in the development of the voluntary social service and also its promotion and development of statutory/voluntary cooperation.</P>
    <P>The staff of the board have provided steady and reliable service over the years and it is vitally important to preserve for <Col N="105" /> the staff of the board the security of employment and superannuation benefits that they possess at present as employees of the National Community Development Agency.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this Bill, I have taken the opportunity to broaden and extend the board's functions to give it as wide a scope as possible.  In addition to its original responsibility for the support and development of community information centres and its mandate to act as a national resource centre for the development of voluntary social services, it will also be responsible for (i) positive interventions at local community level in the area of development of voluntary social services and schemes and (ii) for a promotional and developmental role in relation to statutory agencies and voluntary organisations in their social service activities.</P>
    <P>Both the former National Social Service Board and its predecessor the National Social Service Council had a somewhat limited role, they both engaged in supporting, stimulating and encouraging the development of social service councils, providing a training service for volunteer information officers and generally acting in a back-up capacity and repository of information on the health and social services.  Vital though these functions were I would suggest that the board had neither the status nor the financial resources to act vigorously and to exploit to the fullest extent its potential. Nevertheless, the board has managed to make a valuable contribution to the development of voluntary social services over the years and it may be concluded that with adequate resources and authority a great deal more can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In drafting this Bill I made specific provision to enable the board &ldquo;to promote, develop, encourage and assist&rdquo; co-operation between statutory bodies and voluntary organisations.  There are hundreds of voluntary welfare organisations operating within our society.  While each of these organisations has a task to perform there is some scope for co-operation and integration between them and with the statutory authorities.  There is a <Col N="106" /> danger of duplication where a host of concerned groups are working away on an individual basis in a given area.  I will look to the National Social service Board to continue the efforts it has already made to bring about an effective voluntary/statutory partnership.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the voluntary sector will, for the foreseeable future, be a vital component of our health and social services.  It has important merits such as local responsiveness, flexibility and dedication and in a situation where many voluntary organisations are largely funded with public moneys, it is vital that every possible effort must be made to link the statutory and voluntary sectors in supplementary and complementary relationship to one another.  I believe that the enactment of this Bill will lead to the further strengthening and integration of the two sectors through the expertise and assistance of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that I commend the Bill to Senators for a Second Reading.  I will listen to their comments and suggestions with great interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>My first comment on this Bill is that much of it is already contained in the National Community Development Agency Act which was passed in 1982.  This Bill was set up by a former Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Woods.  If one examines the record of Fianna Fáil in Government in this area I think he can say it has been a proud record because it was in 1971 that the then Minister for Health, Mr. Childers, set up the original National Social Service Council and again it was Deputy Woods who reconstituted that council in some way in 1981.  At that time, as indeed now, the aim was to co-ordinate the various voluntary groups involved in this area of our way of life &mdash; all very important work and work that we should commend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has rightly mentioned the hundreds of voluntary groups around the country who are engaged in this work.  It is right and proper that we should congratulate them on the great work they are doing.  To come back for a moment to the actual Bill itself, I wonder if, even at this <Col N="107" /> late stage, the Minister might consider, rather than going ahead with a Bill of this type, amending the existing Act.  If he was not satisfied with the way it works he might amend it in some way.  It might be as important as an actual Bill itself because the National Community Agency Act, 1982, was to develop a national policy on community development in a structured, organised manner. I feel they should have been allowed to continue with their work to help in the voluntary agencies that are doing so much, as the Minister has said.  The personnel in these organisations should be congratulated for giving much of their time on a purely voluntary basis, doing great work in their communities, devoting many hours of their free time and their energy to promoting community development in the various towns, cities and villages of Ireland.</P>
    <P>These people consist of many types of people.  We have, for example, the residents' associations helping.  We have community councils, priests, parsons and people of all religions working in this area.  Indeed, we have the social workers. There are many of them doing excellent work and in theory having good ideas but some of them are not as practical as I would think they should be.  Someone who might be termed in some way a social worker is the politician, whether he be a local politician or a professional politician because I find, as I am sure the Minister finds, that in his work as a politician more and more work of this nature is being given to him.  He is even asked to investigate family matters and private matters and he does so with success on many occasions.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with membership of the board is very important.  I hope that the Minister, assuming this Bill is passed, will give a good spread throughout the country and that the members of the board will be selected not just on a city basis but will be picked from right across the country, on as wide a basis as possible.  Far more important, and this is something I would stress, those who become members of this board should have done actual work of this nature. <Col N="108" /> They should have a real, basic and practical knowledge of the work they are doing.  It is important, and I stress it, that they should have a track record in this area.  We want people who know what they are doing rather than people who are &ldquo;paper worms&rdquo;, preparing report after report.  We have had far too many reports in the past, not just in the area of Government, but in many other areas as well.  We have not had sufficient action. Report after survey, after survey should cease for the future and hopefully the Minister will pick people who are prepared to work and work hard in the field. Paper work is necessary, I am not denying that, but mostly people with a good track record with a practical commonsense approach to the problem should be selected.</P>
    <P>What has often amazed me over the years &mdash; and I pay tribute to former Ministers for the work they did &mdash; is that despite all the people involved in this type of work, let them be social workers, community workers, those in child guidance clinics, employment experts, the Youth Employment Agency, all doing their best in this area, the fact is that dole queues continue to get longer, crime and vandalism continue to increase and there are more and more social problems.  Our jails are still bursting at the seams.  With all of these experts one would have thought the opposite would have been the case.  The reality is that this country is getting worse in terms of crime, vandalism, unemployment, poverty and poverty of ideas to solve the various problems that exist in our land.</P>
    <P>The financing of the Bill will obviously be important.  There is a defect in this Bill, as has been the case in other Bills which have come before us, for example, the Litter Bill which is in the environment area, and the Community Service Bill which was under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  They were beautiful, well worded, important, but with no mention of how they would be financed. The Minister should give us some idea about the financing of this Bill.  I am sure the health boards will be asked to play a role in this area.  I would be quick to <Col N="109" /> remind the Minister, as he knows himself, that all over the country the health boards' estimates have been cut drastically. They will probably be cutting back on this area of their work also.  The Minister should spell out to us the actual financing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another defect is that poverty has not been included.  There was a combat poverty element in the National Community Development Agency.  The question of combating poverty was never as important as it is today.  I do not have to spell out the reasons for that.  There are many reasons why this is so.  We have to tackle this problem of poverty as it was never tackled before.  I do not accept that we have one million people on the poverty line although the number is high.  I wonder whether that figure of one million is correct.  In the previous Act there was a combat poverty element.  My opinion of the combat poverty scheme is that it failed miserably.  We must learn from the mistakes of that scheme.  We have learned from them.</P>
    <P>We spent millions of pounds on surveys and research but, at the end of the day, we had no results.  In my own area on what was to be a combat poverty programme thousands of pounds were spent on preparing a monthly magazine which lasted for a period of five or six months. At one stage it was thought that a &ldquo;swop shop&rdquo; might be a good idea for combating poverty.  There were problems in Leitrim, Donegal and Cork.  Some people resigned from that board because they felt they were not doing the work they should be doing.  We had surveys everywhere. Those projects were doing absolutely nothing to combat poverty.  They were a waste of money and I hope we have learned from that.  The poverty figure is not as high as some people think but nonetheless it is a vital and important problem.  It is a problem that will be debated in the media in the future and rightly so.  They are taking up less important issues and making sensational headlines out of what are not very important problems.</P>
    <P>The problems of unemployment and poverty should be debated at every opportunity.  The media should tackle <Col N="110" /> those problems as they have tackled other problems in the past.  There is no doubt that the effects of the recession on the less well off sections of our society have been severe.  There has been a rise in unemployment.  We now have one in six people out of work.  This has caused severe hardship in many cases.</P>
    <P>When we talk about combating poverty, we have to look at it in a different way.  I am certain the Minister does not mean to hand out cheques indiscriminately. That is not the purpose of a combat poverty scheme.  There are whole areas where we can help.  We have unmarried mothers; we have deserted wives; we have old age pensioners.  All of these people exist and many of them are in poverty stricken areas.  Combined with a combat poverty programme we must give greater attention to educating people on how they should spend their money.  Many people have a gross income of about £120 a week.  By the time they meet their mortgage payments and car payments, and so on, their net income could probably be regarded as being on the poverty line.  They could manage their affairs better.  This is one reason why we should educate these people and endeavour to get them to budget properly.</P>
    <P>There is some triplication in education. AnCO, the VECs and the health boards are all doing courses in this area.  This is something that might be examined.  That triplication may not be necessary, but the work itself is very necessary.  Courses in home economics could be provided in areas where poverty is known to exist. People could be trained to purchase proper, nourishing food rather than food which has less nourishment and so on. Recently in my own town there was a bargain in sausages in a supermarket and one particular family filled their fridge with sausages which were there for a fortnight or three weeks.  We can go into the areas which are known to be problem areas where poverty exists and educate people there.  In specific areas in our towns and cities 90 per cent of the social services are most needed.  That is certain.</P>
    <P>That is where the poverty is, and also where 80 per cent of the crime and vandalism <Col N="111" /> occurs.  We need practical people who understand the problem to go into areas and identify the problems and help to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>Not having a combat poverty element in this Bill is a defect in the Bill.  As our Leader said, we will be tabling at least one amendment in this area.  The Bill is defective from that point of view.  We definitely require action on poverty and we should have it now rather than wait a year, or 18 months, or whatever the Minister has in mind.  I see no need for the Bill in its present form.  As I said earlier, much of the Bill was in the National Community Agency Development Act and that legislation should have been given a chance to work and not allowed to become defunct over the past 12 months or so.  At a later stage I will be submitting an amendment on section 4. I sincerely hope that even at this late stage the Minister will consider including a combat poverty element in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it will win widespread support.  The Minister's objectives are quite clear-cut. There are two principal objectives: one to re-establish the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis; and, secondly, to establish a combat poverty organisation.  Regarding the re-establishment of the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis, the Minister has paid tribute to the work done down through the years by the director and his colleagues.  In the other House he and the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, paid tribute to the director and his colleagues on the board for the great work they did in very difficult circumstances. Nobody will have any objection to that board being established on a statutory basis and freeing these people of any doubts about their role in the future.  The Minister is to be commended on his action in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to establish a combat poverty organisation. That will have the support of Members of the House and of the general public. We are all aware of the fact that poverty exists for different reasons in different <Col N="112" /> circumstances.  It is not an easy matter to get rid of this problem which has been with us for a long time.  Indeed, looking back on our history the Irish race has had more than its fair share of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to tackle the problem in what I might call an organised way.  Poverty is not always due to lack of income.  Poverty is sometimes due to alcoholism or gambling and in some cases it is due to downright bad management, to the inability of people to spend their income prudently and make wise purchases. This results in their being unable to cope.</P>
    <P>On an examination of poverty it is right to say that the pace of change in the world we live in means that a certain percentage of people are not able to keep up with and adapt to changing circumstances. That results in poverty.  They decide they are not able to cope and that generates a certain amount of despondency and lack of effort, and they fall by the wayside. With the passing of time, with inflation, and so on, their position becomes progressively worse and they are in difficulty. Even at this time when a high percentage of people expect help of all kinds from the central authority we have some people of independent spirit who are in severe difficulties but resist any advice to look to the State for help.  These people are very often in very poor circumstances, and they are too proud to avail of the help or assistance available to them.  An examination of the causes of poverty, the structures that lead to poverty, and the types of people who are in a state of poverty without their neighbour knowing it, is a very complex matter.</P>
    <P>I was happy to read that soon after taking up office the Minister set up a commission to examine this question of poverty.  They should be congratulated on making a report at such an early date. I understand the report came to the Minister's office last September.  When he was setting up this commission the Minister emphasised that he wanted them to review the whole social welfare structure and to report to him on the system and related social services, and make recommendations for their development having regard to the needs of our society.  That <Col N="113" /> is the point I was emphasising.  The needs of our society now are not identical to the needs some years ago, because of the pace of change and the different approach to life in many circumstances, and because of the difficulties small enterprises have with people from bigger combines.  People who in previous generations were far removed from poverty now find themselves at the poverty level because they were not adaptable.</P>
    <P>There are cases where better management would take a family from the poverty line at least up to a state of frugal comfort.  Domicilary care could be provided by people with expertise in these matters and with the personality and the professionalism which would enable them to communicate freely with people without causing embarrassment.  They could help out in changing the domestic set-up from the financial point of view. This would result in better home management and more prudent expenditure. People who are definitely on the poverty line could at least be taken with assistance and guidance into the area of what is called, perhaps, frugal comfort.  Much good work can be done in that way provided it is tackled professionally by people who have the gift of being able to get things done without causing embarrassment or provoking resentment.</P>
    <P>We all know there are people who resist interference from outside no matter how well intentioned that interference or guidance may be.  If it is not done on a highly professional basis it can be difficult. For that reason I was glad to see that the Minister stated clearly in the other House that it was the intention that the health boards will continue to fulfil the same role in this regard as they have up to now.  As the years go by, officers of the health boards are building up a vast pool of information and knowledge on different regions and on different individuals. The expertise of health board officers and pool of knowledge accumulated down through the years can be used to advantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Fallon spoke about the work of voluntary organisations. I do not intend to deal at any great length with that matter except to put on <Col N="114" /> record my appreciation of the work voluntary organisations have done and are doing through the length and breadth of the country.  Senator Fallon made the point that sometimes there is duplication. I know that to be a fact.  People with the best intentions in the world in some cases are duplicating the work being done by other organisations and even the health boards.  A little bit of streamlining would do a great deal of good in that regard.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the new board and the voluntary organisations which do great work and make full use of the knowledge and expertise of the health boards will improve the situation without necessarily having to spend a huge amount of extra money.  With close liaison between the board and the voluntary organisations the health boards can have a more streamlined approach to the problems and get the best possible return for money spent.  We will then be on the way to combating poverty.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my appreciation of the fact that the Minister had this commission set up so soon after taking up office, and my appreciation of the speed with which the commission issued a report.  I know it is a Government commitment to combat poverty and I believe that the Minister has sufficient dedication and enthusiasm for the project to make a valuable contribution towards getting it done in the immediate future. What he has set out to do is appreciated in the House and Senators on all sides of this House will wish him well.  This is a matter on which people of all shades of political opinion agree.  In so far as is humanly possible within the resources of the State, we should set about getting a worthwhile effort made to combat poverty and hopefully, in the not too distant future, eliminating poverty entirely from our society.  That is the Minister's objective and I am sufficiently convinced of his dedication to believe that he will go full steam ahead in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by welcoming this Bill which has come before the Seanad at last.  The statutory establishment of a National Social Service Board, or National Social Service <Col N="115" /> Council as it was before, is something that many of us who were involved in it have been frustrated about for at least ten years.  I am very pleased that at last it has come to fruition.</P>
      <P>I should probably start by doing what is normally called declaring an interest. From about 1973 until the establishment of the Community Development Agency in 1982 I was chairman of the National Social Service Council and then the National Social Service Board.  What I say can be taken as being perhaps enlightened, perhaps prejudiced by the fact that I held that position and that I knew what was going on in the background all the time.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Minister has a great deal in his speech &mdash; and some other Senator referred to it &mdash; about the need to combat poverty and to set up a separate institution to deal with the poverty problem.  I would quite agree this is very necessary, but it is not what I propose to deal with in my contribution.  When that agency is set up I will no doubt have something to say about it.  Today I particularly want to deal with this Bill and the history and the prospects of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said at the beginning of his speech that the National Social Service Council were set up in 1971 and re-constituted into the board in 1981. What this leaves out of account is the fact that from at least 1977 onwards various Governments had been playing around with the idea of re-constituting the National Social Service Council possibly as a statutory body and possibly not as a statutory body.  Members of the National Social Service Council spent a period of some four years in total uncertainty as to what was to happen to the council.  I think it is fair to say they were very poorly treated by successive Governments in that they were the kind of people Senator Fallon was talking about, people who knew about this problem on the ground, people who worked very hard, people like the president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, people who were involved in social service councils on the ground, people who had a great deal to do, and <Col N="116" /> had a great deal more to do than to sit around waiting for Government decisions that never seemed to come.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Fallon meant very well in saying that he did not want any more reports, or surveys, or whatever, but I really must point out that was not the kind of thing the National Social Service Council or board did on the whole.  There was a certain amount of preparation of documents incidental to their work.  But basically their work was practical work.  Their work was on the ground.  Their work was setting up a whole network of community information centres throughout the country to which people could go and find out their entitlements under all sorts of headings, bringing consumer information into these centres as well as social welfare information, and so on.</P>
    <P>Their work was in the setting up, establishment and organisation of social service councils throughout the country and the development of these social service councils in so far as they were allowed to do so.  Their work was in giving information to people all over the country about their various entitlements. They regularly published a document called &ldquo;Entitlements of the Elderly&rdquo; and, just as regularly as it was published, it joined the top ten selling publications in this country, because so many people felt the need of it and so many people wanted it and bought it, or were given it free if they had not got the money to buy it.</P>
    <P>Regularly over the years they produced <i>Relate</i> magazine which dealt with all sorts of matters that came under the heading of social and personal services. The January issue, for instance, dealt with medical cards for young people, the enterprise allowance scheme, medical card income guidelines, discrimination in social welfare, road accident injuries and health services, this Bill and changes in hospital charges.  It was a publication which gave information to social workers throughout the country, to people involved in social service councils, people involved in community information centres and so on.  I would very much resent any suggestion that this body made reports and surveys and did nothing <Col N="117" /> about them.  In addition to this, very many courses of training for voluntary workers were organised by the National Social Service Council through their development section.  Many voluntary bodies have benefited greatly from these training courses.</P>
    <P>This is, perhaps, why, through the years, I have felt such very considerable resentment that people, both the staff carrying out this work faithfully and the members of the council and later the board who gave their time voluntarily to try to run this enterprise, were never told what was being done about their reorganisation, were never sure whether the organisation was going to continue from year to year.  At one stage I recall that it got to the stage where the council was not reappointed, fell into abeyance, nobody was able to sign a cheque for money to be paid out to staff or anybody else.  I recall the then president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society sending a telex to the then Minister for Health complaining bitterly about what had happened. When a person of that stature reaches that point of frustration and rage, something very bad is going on.</P>
    <P>Obviously I am not blaming the present Minister for this because he was not in office at the time, but I hope that this Bill will mark an end to this kind of thing and once the board is fully established under the Act that people will be allowed to get on with the work they are doing, that the staff will have security of tenure, security of pension, will know where they stand and not be reduced to going on one-day strikes to try to find out what their position is.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with matters relating to the functions of the board.  Here again there have been a number of problems. The Minister referred to the matter of the security of the staff.  They have had tremendous problems relating to private pension schemes, inability to receive death benefits and many other difficulties have arisen.  The board was finally, after four years of negotiation, reconstituted in June 1981 and appeared to be working perfectly until suddenly, in April 1982, it was announced it was to be disbanded and that the community development <Col N="118" /> organisation was to be brought in.  There was only one meeting of the board between the announcement and the bringing in of the Act which created the community development association. There was absolutely no discussion with the then board as to what were the merits of setting up the community development association or what its functions were. That board was set up.  Immediately, in the aftermath of the election in December 1982, the Government announced that they intended to repeal the Community Development Agency Act and bring in the present Bill.  This has been awaited from that time.  The staff and the people dealing with the National Social Service Council have been in what O'Casey described as a state of &ldquo;chassis&rdquo; since 1977.  It is unfair to either a devoted staff or to people who were giving of their time to try to deal with the social services area.  I hope sincerely this will mark the end of such occurrences and that from now on the National Social Service Board will be able to go from strength to strength in a statutory and established way and that there will be no more necessity to reconstitute the whole thing, throw it back into the melting pot again.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one or two comments on the functions of the new board, as set out in section 4 of the Bill.  As far as the first one is concerned, advising the Minister and keeping him informed of developments in social services generally, I hope very much this will be interpreted as a fairly free remit to advise the Minister even where they think the Minister is wrong; to be allowed criticise the Minister, be free to say things about Government policy on health and social services that may not be altogether pleasing to the Government.</P>
    <P>While in the past the council and the board have had these functions of advising the Minister from time to time, one had the feeling that advising the Minister was fine as long as one agreed with what the Minister thought; but if one advised the Minister and did not agree with what he thought it was rather a dangerous function.  At times we got into terrible trouble because we actually advised the Minister that we thought he was wrong. <Col N="119" /> I hope in the future a Minister will be able to accept that advice may sometimes be very good, telling him that he is taking the wrong course rather than saying &ldquo;Yes, yes Minister, of course you are taking the right course&rdquo;.  If the board cannot be critical of Government policy, then it may as well not have such a function because there is no point in just having a flattery shop.</P>
    <P>It is also true that this type of advice can take the form of submissions in advance of the budget and so on.  To be fair, it must be said that on numerous occasions in the past when submissions were made in advance of the budget various Governments involved have made changes and done things that were advised.  That was a very useful situation. Perhaps the statutory setting up of the board will make this easier.  But it is a difficult situation where a group of people are being paid by the Government to advise the Government: if they break into criticism of the Government it is all too easy to say: &ldquo;Why are you biting the hand that feeds you?  You are being paid by us; how dare you criticise us?&rdquo;  I hope that will not be the attitude in the future.</P>
    <P>Another point which is important in relation to the functions of the board is contained in section 4 (1) (e), in which it refers to promoting, developing, encouraging and assisting co-operation between statutory and voluntary organisations. This had been a function of the National Social Service Board since they were set up.  It is a particularly important function in this economic climate because with the various cut-backs in statutory health services and difficulties in finding money to provide new statutory services, it is extremely important that voluntary services should be treated not just as a kind of offshoot or a sidekick or a cheap way of providing services that we cannot pay professionals to provide, but as an equal partner in the co-operation between the statutory and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that in the Programme for Government produced by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1981, what was known <Col N="120" /> colloquially as the &ldquo;Gaiety Theatre Document&rdquo;, there was a specific reference to this in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>The Parties in Government acknowledge the enormous contribution of voluntary, community-based organisations to tackling social problems and meeting local needs.  The examples of Social Service Councils, specialist bodies and non-governmental organisations dealing with a wide range of current issues are well known. We will ensure that this role is given proper recognition.  A Charter for Voluntary Services will be introduced which will provide a framework for the relations between the statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>When I saw that in the Programme for Government I was extremely pleased.  I thought it was a very worthy aim to produce this charter because very often voluntary organisations find it difficult to know where they are in relation to the different health boards, particularly as relationships tend to vary from health board to health board.</P>
    <P>At the time that this was proposed the Government wished to have submissions about it and the National Social Service Board, as it then was, went to a great deal of trouble to produce the discussion document on the development of voluntary social services in Ireland.  It was published by the National Social Service Board and presented to the Government. It dealt with a great many of the very difficult questions that arise in the relationship between statutory social services and voluntary social services.  I do not recall any reference to this proposed charter in the programme of the present Government but I hope it is not an idea that has been flung out.  We need more than just the National Social Service Board; we need the kind of context in which the whole relationship of voluntary and statutory bodies can be seen.</P>
    <P>One has to remember that the money expended on personal social services of the type covered by the National Social Service Board is a very small proportion of what is spent by the health boards, community welfare programmes and so <Col N="121" /> on.  If it difficult to find out exactly what the level of spending on personal social services is.  In 1980 the total non-capital expenditure on health services was £701 million.  Of that, the community welfare sub-programme was only £46.84 million, which is quite a small amount of it.  Of that £46.84 million some £32.19 million went on income maintenance schemes so that in point of fact only about £14½ million, about 2 per cent of the total health spending, may have been spent on personal social services.  It may also have been spent on other things.  When we talk about what we spend through statutory funds on personal social services of the type dealt with by the National Social Service Board, it is a very small proportion of total health board spending of which, as we know, the vast majority goes on hospital services and so on.  We very badly need the co-operation of the local social service councils and the other voluntary bodies in dealing with this area of voluntary social services.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the things which have bedevilled this situation is that in the early seventies when the social service council was first set up there was great encouragement and movement towards social service councils in every area and they were encouraged to employ social workers, to employ professional personnel and on many occasions were given grants to do so by the health boards. About the mid-seventies the health boards came to the conclusion that they were going to provide these community welfare services and that they were no longer going to grant-aid voluntary organisations to employ social workers or only to do so in a very limited way. All social workers basically would be employed by the health boards under their senior social workers.  This sounds a very fine idea but in effect I do not know that it has worked so very successfully. I hope that, when this Bill is enacted, another look will be taken at this matter and that more encouragement will be given to granting voluntary bodies, who have shown themselves capable, help to allow them to use professional social workers as well so that they will be more equal partners with the statutory <Col N="122" /> services.  Indeed, some of the community development social workers who have been employed by the health boards found themselves faced with an uncomfortable dichotomy between what their bosses wanted and what they felt the community wanted.  It is not a complete solution to everything to say that the health boards will employ community workers and that will look after the whole thing.</P>
    <P>One other item in regard to the functions of the National Social Service Board is referred to in the Minister's speech.  He states that it also became responsible for servicing the National Council for the Aged which was also established in 1981. Certainly, it became responsible for servicing it but if it did, it became responsible for servicing it without one single extra person of staff, without any other resources than it already had and the end result was that, in particular, the director of the National Social Service Board and a couple of other members of the staff were run into the ground trying to service the National Council for the Aged as well as all the other work that they were already supposed to do.  I understand that there is now a certain amount of extra personnel being provided, in particular because the present director is being seconded to the Commission on Social Welfare, but I still feel that if we are going to take the National Council for the Aged seriously&mdash;its publications and work to date would certainly suggest that it should be taken seriously&mdash;then we must be prepared also to staff it seriously and not expect the people in the National Council Service Board who are dealing with information, training and so on to just fit it into their free time, of which there is none.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that the National Council for the Aged is properly staffed if it is to be effective.</P>
    <P>There are two other things which I would like to say.  One is a small matter which might also be raised on Committee Stage.  This may sound as though it is a personal plea but I can assure you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that it is not meant to be.  It is something that has been raised in this House in particular with great <Col N="123" /> vehemence by Senator Mark Killilea on a previous occasion while discussing the Posts and Telegraphs Boards.  It is that membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or even being a candidate for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas, means that a person is statute-barred from being a member of this board.  This, as I understand it, is now being included in all these Bills as a matter of form.  I have a feeling that people are not thinking about it.  Obviously, if these are paid functions, if a salary is going to go with them, there may well be an extremely good argument that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of the board.  But where, as in this case, it is something that is free, a service given to the community, it seems to me somewhat harsh to decide that Members of the Oireachtas who have a particular knowledge of the area are just automatically barred.  I do not see why this should be so.  I say this particularly as, to my knowledge, the National Economic and Social Council, another voluntary body which advises the Government on economic and social matters, has not got this barring of Members of the Oireachtas.  There are Members of the Oireachtas who are also members of it and I cannot see what the difference in principle is.  I would suggest that the Minister look at this again.  He should not just accept, because the Department of Finance or whoever organises these things says that this is an automatic section in all these Bills, that it should be so.  He should look again and say, &ldquo;Why should it be so?&rdquo;  Are we just accepting it automatically?</P>
    <P>My last point is something which was also mentioned by other Members, that is with regard to the finances of the board. The Minister in his speech referred to the fact that the board in the past had neither the status nor the financial resources to act vigorously and to the fullest extent of its potential.  That is a true statement and I agree with the Minister.  It had not the status, partly because it was not statutory and partly because there were all the difficulties that I referred to at the beginning of my speech with regard to its establishment or non-establishment.  But it <Col N="124" /> never had anything more than peanuts as far as financial resources were concerned in comparison with, say, the Combat Poverty Committee.  It had very little money.  At the time of the setting up of the Community Development Agency it was suggested that some £2 million would be allocated to this area but between one difficulty and another and one election and another, the £2 million never materialised. I would again suggest to the Minister that of course the board cannot carry out its functions successfully if it has not got the financial resources.  Financial resources means financial resources to staff it properly and to promote its various activities and publications.  This Bill will set up, we hope, the status by making it a statutory body and by making it permanent. We must expect and hope that in the very near future it will also have the financial resources necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of enormous interest to anyone who has been concerned about the need for social change, increasing awareness of people living in the community and throughout the nation as a whole.  In that context may I just say what a great pleasure it is to be responding to the Bill and the Minister? Only two weeks ago I had the great pleasure of listening to him twice during the bicentenary celebrations of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and I felt that not only did he say what needed to be said in relation to the whole philosophy of health in the technological age and the fair distribution of resources to meet social demand but he said it in such a way that he gained a response from those who would naturally be somewhat reticent in sharing some of the institutional power which they have to control the way in which the moneys are spent, particularly when they are very closely allied to specific technological development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement by the Minister this afternoon provokes a number of questions and thoughts.  It has stimulated a few suggestions.  He first of all teases out the need to establish some sort of balance between what the citizen in a community should have by way of resources, power, <Col N="125" /> opportunity and finance and how at the same time this must be related to a reasonable national strategy.  It is a very fine thing to balance the need for power centrally, which inevitably has overtones of control, and the need to devolve power to the community to liberate the talents and resourcefulness of the people.  As he has implied in his statement, it is all very well trying to liberate the talents and the resourcefulness of the people; but if the people concerned have had extremely little opportunity and they are denied the resources and the input and the involvement to develop their innate talent, then the country is denying itself something that is very precious to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Andy O'Brien mentioned something which has been close to my heart for a number of years, the difficulty of dealing with rate of change.  We are today living in an era perhaps of the greatest rate of perceived change that mankind has ever had to deal with.  It is an interesting psychological phenomenon that when change is imposed remotely from outside of oneself or entirely from outside of oneself there is a natural resistance to it and a great difficulty in adapting to it positively.  On the other hand, if change emanates from within oneself, one does not feel at all threatened by it and can react very positively to it.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have this total dependence on remote control.  On the other we have the isolation which goes with total independence.  What the Minister's speech has been endeavouring to do is to promote this balance, the need for interdependence, the need for shifting of resources not only from privileged people to underprivileged people but from those communities that have a considerable amount going for them towards those communities which do not have much.  He identified class as a major obstacle to the self-development of the Irish people.  We must all recognise that, although the original concept of republicanism was of a classless society, just by the nature of things and the way in which Ireland has developed since Partition, class was very much an issue.  I venture to say it is much less of an issue today in <Col N="126" /> the North of Ireland than it is in the South, but it is still an issue throughout the country.  Tied with the class is the interest of capital and it has been of some concern to me since I became interested in the community movement that people who would maintain that they are community minded people and very concerned to be involved at community level may in fact find it a fundamental conflict whenever the class and capital issues come into opposition with those of the community.  We can think all too easily of whether we educate our children in our own community or do they go elsewhere. Do we remove our capital resources from our community to look for a better chance in another community when times are rough?  There are many areas that one can see where community comes off second best in relation to class and capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the difficulties with the economy of the times and that we could not expect increasing growth in the GNP or GDP and I would say that not only can we not expect it but anyone who reads the ecology journals of the world today will actually see that there has been a plea for western countries to stop increasing their GNP/GDP because it is argued that if we continue, particularly in North America, to have fears of exponental rise in GNP or to have an expectation of it, we will in fact render this planet barren in not such a very long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister then poses the question: what are the alternatives?  We all know about the black economy, but he did focus our attention briefly on the hidden economy.  The whole crux for us is to try, on the one hand to ensure that the State looks after those who are having difficulty in looking after themselves and on the other to promote in everyone the possibility of development and of liberation of the resourcefulness that is innate in each one of us in the proper type of environment.  This brings in the whole area of the hidden economy which has been overlooked for far too long, the sort of economy that E. F. Schumacher talks about in his various writings and particularly in the book, <i>Small is Beautiful</i>, the <Col N="127" /> economy of the hidden, the intangible asset, things to do with morale, enthusiasm, commitment, application; things that you cannot quantify but which are essential in any society, and the more controlled the society is the less likely that those things will ever have opportunity to surface.</P>
    <P>There is always this need for balance between central control on the one hand and community liberation on the other. When we talk about the intangible asset when we talk about the hidden economy, I think the women's movement has perhaps done more than anything else to make us aware of the hidden economy because women in the western world have shown to us that all work is valid, not just the work that one does in someone else's employment for someone else's profit.  There is community work; there is co-operative work; there is work in the garden; there is work in the home. All of these things add up to the total economy of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the interlinkage of poverty and inequality and in that area we have to recognise that when one talks about the millions on the poverty line in today's world, particularly in today's western world, it is the frustration gap which has increased, the gap between expectations that have been kindled by the new communications technology on the one hand and the reality of life as it exists.  While we may not have a million people in the country without shoes on their feet, as we might well have had a hundred years ago, we have a million people who feel totally frustrated, and as the Minister so rightly identifies, powerless to do anything about their condition. It is this powerlessness to effect any change to meet the terrible tensions of the frustration gap that is perhaps, the best way of identifying the present type of poverty which surrounds us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's proposals, there seems to be, going through his speech, a suggestion of the statutory and voluntary bodies coming together.  The Seanad should give him full support for his efforts in this direction.  There is a <Col N="128" /> great lack of awareness at local, regional and national levels of the agencies which exist, particularly the voluntary agencies. It is only when people are brought together at local level, and I would emphasise local level, that they begin to see the number of agencies that are available, what they can do and how they can inter-react positively with one another. Certainly working in a small hospital in a community context, one becomes very conscious of the need to be aware of what is available to support the health care needs of the people in community.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>To pursue the problem at local community level, the Minister did allude in his speech to the need for bringing together the voluntary and statutory agencies.  I would endorse that very fully indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to that need, let me give one example.  I can recollect shortly after moving from Belfast to north Antrim that there was a great problem with regard to the chronically ill, not those designated as geriatrics who can be rehabilitated by definition, but people who could not after medical assessment expect to be rehabilitated to return to their own homes. These people were being nursed in a Nissen hut and this hut caused a great deal of trouble.  Everyone seemed to focus on the Nissen hut rather than on the problems of the two nurses trying to look after 20 chronically ill patients who were unable to move themselves and who were catheterised and have very little control <Col N="130" /> over their own systems.  I remember a minister of religion coming to see me and he was most outraged that this was occurring in a hospital to which I was attached. I said there was far too much focus on the building and not anything like enough focus on the need to mobilise the community to deal with the problem.  I said &ldquo;If you were to go back to all the churches in your town and get them all to come together and to provide one volunteer from the lot to attend that Nissen hut nightly, then if you were to go around all the tenants' associations and community groups and ask for a volunteer from the lot to come to that Nissen hut nightly, then if you were to go to the families of those people in the Nissen hut and to ask them to come together to provide one volunteer each night, each person would be on a rota working perhaps for one night in 60 or perhaps one night in every two or three years, if all the resources available to the community were mobilised, and you would have increased the staff four-fold.&rdquo;  The problem is only beginning at that point, because as soon as volunteers arrive at the gate of that hospital the first thing you will find is members of my profession and the nursing profession and perhaps even the legal profession standing aghast that people who are not certified are going to do a job which has traditionally been done by those who are certificated.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of novel ways in which we could start to deal with the problem and to increase the potential of our hidden economy.  The Minister was coming close to that.  It is interesting that the title of this Bill is the National Social Services Board Bill.  For a number of years I have felt that there is a great need in Ireland for national social service, not as a means of trying to get cheap labour, not as a means of denying other people employment, but as a means of raising awareness among the school-leavers of the great social problems which confront us and which have been alluded to in the Minister's speech this afternoon.  A period of national social service, where the period was obligatory but where the options were entirely voluntary, could <Col N="131" /> provide an enormous increase of awareness of the problems.</P>
    <P>We have children from Northern Ireland going to Holland and America. Would it not be much better if we were to organise children to move in the North-South direction, children to move across the sectarian divide, rural youngsters to work in urban settings or urban youngsters in rural settings?  You could have service in the area of rehabilitation, the rehabilitation of those who have had problems with drugs, alcohol, problems of mental health.  There are all sorts of imaginative ways in which we could mobilise our youth and make them more aware.  In time they would come in the adaptable way to respond to need and would be much more aware than their predecessors have been and they would, because of their awareness, break down the class barriers which are alluded in this document and would promote a much more healthy new Ireland for the future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; on a number of occasions, and in his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Because the realities of poverty and inequality are so inextricably linked into the structures and effects of the social welfare system and its interaction with policies in areas such as taxation, health, education and housing I considered it appropriate to seek the advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Let us just look at these things.  In the context of the problems we now face, is our education system about development? Is it about integration of the person in the community?  Is it about leading out, education &mdash; I lead out, <i>educo</i>&mdash; or is it indication which is something which leads us in, refines talents, differentiates talent?  It is about health and wholeness or is it about the super-refinement of a small area or our talents?  We need to look at education.</P>
    <P>Let us look at health.  The so-called health professions are at present terribly obsessed with curing disease.  They pay lip service to its prevention but they have barely started to consider the very radical political implications of promoting <Col N="132" /> health.  When you talk about promoting health, particularly at community level, you are talking about the system of education that exists, the opportunity that exists locally.  It is much harder to face these problems locally and to bring people together to have a debate of this sort locally because you are facing yourself in your own community.  In terms of health we must ask what are the resources and how we should develop them.</P>
    <P>There is mention of taxation.  At the last meeting of the Seanad I put forward an idea that we should look at the whole system of taxation to see if it could be greatly simplified and to see if a fairly high proportion of our taxes could be clearly seen to be collected at local level so that people would take responsibility at local level for what was happening, decide their own priorities and have the power &mdash; that would overcome the powerlessness &mdash; to have decision making which is effective where they live.  That has to be balanced with the need for a regional and national strategy and that is where this fine point of balance comes in.</P>
    <P>I am glad that housing was mentioned. It seems that one side of society is only too glad to have a house that does not leak and the other side of society looks upon a house as a form of currency rather than a home.  In Ireland we talk in all sorts of grandiose ways about violence in the macro sense.  Violence starts from within ourselves and within the home we create around the hearth.  Unless we get back to this concept of a home rather than a house as a form of currency, which it has become certainly across the class divide, then we are missing out on something that is very central to health and wholeness in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals for community information centres.  I presume that is a euphemism for citizens advice bureaux.  I was not quite clear if there was a distinction to be made.  Well staffed, properly equipped community information centres which are readily available to all the people could become one means of getting over the appalling problem of clientelism which faces Irish politicians today.  A tremendous amount of energy and time is taken up in dealing <Col N="133" /> with people who are entitled by law to what they want; if they are not entitled to it, if the law does not allow it, then they should not have it.  If they still feel that they need it then it is up to the legislators to change the law.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about this before on many occasions, not only here but elsewhere, and I support the community information centres as a means to starting to cope with that great problem.  It is true to say that anyone who is in the rather privileged position in which I find myself in this House cannot fail to be impressed by the vast amount of work done by politicians and the enormous demands that are made on them.  The only question I would sometimes ask is whether it is the right work and whether their energies could not be more effectively used in the area of creative thought to meet the challenge of the social problems which we now confront in this high technology age that we are entering.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that at some stage someone should look into what has been done in Northern Ireland in the area of social development. There is the Northern Ireland Council for Social Services who have the monthly magazine <i>Scope</i> which deals with many of the areas that he has dealt with this afternoon and provides a means of communication between the networks that already exist at local community level. There is the North West Foundation for Human Development which is located in Derry and which was linked with the Irish Foundation for Human Development that was inaugurated in Dublin some years ago.  There is the Ulster People's College.  All of these are run by and involve people who are very concerned with the issues of poverty and the need to provide a social service which balances community involvement on the one hand and the reallocation of resources to meet special needs on the other.</P>
    <P>As we face the challenges of Irish society we must look upon ourselves as trustees for the future generations.  We must look at our rivers, our land, our afforestation and our coastline and we should ask ourselves whether we are good trustees of them.  I suggest that the answer is at <Col N="134" /> present open to debate.  What are we going to do about the pollution of our resources?  What are we going to do about the litter which, in spite of the Litter Bill which was passed here last year, pollutes the countryside?  How are we going to use our resources sensibly?  We have more than enough of them.  We must look at the land and the possibility of using it for vegetable protein as much as for animal protein.  There are opportunities for developing afforestation, which has already been done to a considerable degree.  There should be better protection of the maritime potential of our coastline from the effects of pollution and exploitation.  We have a lot going for us.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it will be possible to mobilise our resources if we see it all as a matter of central control and do not open up the debate locally.  This National Social Services Board will help in that process.  When we look at our talent we have to ask ourselves whether we are finding, developing and liberating the talent that is unique to each member of our younger generation.  Are we giving them a free enough society to live in and yet not so free that they are not aware of their obligations to others.</P>
    <P>I would say that the slogan in relation to national social service of all forms might be share today, conserve for tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this brief contribution I want to make a few general comments relating to the Bill and to make a couple of practical suggestions for the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>The Bill constitutes a very limited concept of what we should be doing to tackle social need in Irish society.  The National Community Development Agency Act which is now being repealed was both broader in scope and more radical in its approach than the Bill before us.  Having said that, we need quick decisive action to deal with the problems of social need. This type of action is all the more urgent against the background of the present cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has correctly stressed the vital contribution made by the voluntary sector to social services.  I share this view. <Col N="135" /> Local voluntary activities are highly desirable and should be actively encouraged. I would not like to think, however, that the Minister would actually abuse these voluntary efforts by inadequate provision of funds to voluntary agencies. They should not be used simply to save money for the Exchequer or to provide cheap or free labour.  Resources are critical, especially for community information centres.</P>
    <P>On the question of dissemination of information, leaflets are rather antiquated when we consider the possibilities of new information technology.  As we know we can get comprehensive information about our bank accounts in a matter of a few seconds from a computer terminal. Why not apply the same technology to getting, for example, social insurance information?  Successful computer companies, of which there are many in this country, are providing computers to Irish schools at greatly reduced prices. This brings me to my first practical suggestion for the Minister's attention.  I think the Minister should induce these successful computer companies to make their contribution to voluntary social service agencies by providing computer equipment at minimal or no cost.  In any case, there is an urgent need to plan for the dissemination of increasing volumes of information through new information technology.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I stressed that the board as proposed in this Bill is very limited in concept.  The community development approach contained in the Act now being repealed is concerned not alone with the provision of information on rights and entitlements but also, with the conditions and circumstances that give rise to deficiencies in our society.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that local groups will have a large measure of independence to meet local needs.  I recognise that when local groups receive public funds there must be accountability.  My concern, however, is that there may be excessive control over these local voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by previous speakers to modern technology.  We live <Col N="136" /> in an era of rapid technological change. The Department of Social Welfare must keep abreast of developments in information technology since this Department deals with such a massive number of payments to relatively disadvantaged people.  Prompt payment of these benefits is essential and clearly new technology can facilitate such prompt payment.</P>
    <P>Developments in micro-electronics have dominated the past decade but bio-technology, which will have huge implications for health and social services, will dominate the next decade. The changes in Irish society in the immediate years ahead will be profound, not least in the area of employment.  We need to anticipate and to plan for these social and technological changes rather than wait for the changes to occur and then try to patch up the consequential problems.</P>
    <P>My final point is a practical suggestion for the Minister's attention.  It relates to the tax benefits, approved by the Revenue Commissioners, which apply to covenants. Both the donor and the recipient of funds for health and social research enjoy substantial tax benefits which clearly benefit research work.  I would urge the Minister to speak to his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to extending the same tax benefits to individuals or organisations who wish to contribute financially to local initiatives in the social service field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robb referred to people wishing to have a home without a leak; indeed, in my part of the country there are many persons who would like to have a home in which to have the said leak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to bring up a number of items that are not specifically related to the Minister's Department but about which he in his capacity as Minister setting up this board would have an ear.  I refer first of all to the free books scheme in national primary schools.  I, as principal of a small primary school, found it difficult, if not impossible, to administer the free books scheme without inferring poverty where it might not lie or discriminating in some other way.  The teacher or principal teacher in a small school was <Col N="137" /> asked to apply the scheme.  If he applied it where he thought poverty lay, he could infer poverty where it did not lie and could also insult.</P>
    <P>The itinerant problem was raised recently in Dublin and I do not wish to comment on the decision of Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation, whichever body it was.  The itinerant problem is with us and it is not going away.  Despite the best efforts in my own county, the setting up of voluntary committees and the setting up within the county council of a statutory committee to co-ordinate with the voluntary committees, that problem is not going away but is on the increase.  The Minister should seek advice as to how the itinerant problem might be solved.  I want to pose one problem to this Minister or whichever Minister might be concerned. Should an itinerant family apply for tenancy of a local authority house and that family's need be greater than that of a settled family, I believe that the itinerant settlement association or some individual itinerant family would take a case under the Constitution and find unconstitutional whatever reasons the manager of the said local authority gave for not housing that itinerant family.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the house building programme.  While I welcome this Government's commitment and the extension of £1 million extra this year to Donegal for local authority housing, the villages of caravans are growing in our county.  The Minister could seek advice as to how he could utilise the training that has been given to some of our young people in apprentice trades.  Some funds could be made available for groups of young people under supervision to use the training they have got in building, plastering, electricity, plumbing and carpentry to build houses for some people within our community.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to one scheme that is being built at present.  There are numerous people coming to me to apply for housing in it.  There are 14 applicants for four old persons' homes in the town of Milford.  I know most of them.  One person comes in daily to my office with a bar of chocolate, a bag of crisps and at <Col N="138" /> one stage with a £5 note as a good will present on the opening of my new office. I knew precisely what that person was doing; she was not bribing but she was trying to get on the right side of me because she felt so desperately in need of housing.  That person has already left a rural community from ten miles away from that village to come to reside in what she describes as a very damp flat. She now is applying to get into better conditions.  That lady should never have had to move from her rural community. No matter what the family's circumstances might have been, she should not have had to move to this town in the first instance and she now may not get a house in this new housing scheme.</P>
    <P>The same training I mentioned earlier might be applied to the building of old persons' communal homes.  That might sound to be somewhat against what I have already mentioned about people staying in their own environment.  There could be something between the community welfare home and the old persons' homes as we now know them.  A number of old people could reside together, having their own individual bedrooms, sharing bathrooms and having communal sittingroom, diningroom and kitchen facilities.  The Minister should seek advice on this and should utilise the training that some of our young people got in the trades in the building of the community homes.</P>
    <P>I want to go on to something that has been on my mind for the last number of months, and that is the smallholders' assistance that has now been removed because of the court case that was brought by some farmers with regard to the poor law valuation scheme.  There are a number of things that I want to say to the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare.  The first is I believe that the application now, as a result of the court case, is rendering some of our small farmers less productive than they might be.  They are afraid to admit that they have had certain crops, that they own certain animals.  The thing is anti-production. Secondly, and I apologise for saying this, I believe the application of the reassessment is, in fact, selective.  I <Col N="139" /> would even go as far as to say it is politically selective.  In my own area when I see the people who are being assessed first and those who have been left till last I firmly believe this to be the case.  I have written to the Minister, I have no proof of it and it is very hard to establish where proof lies.  I have written to the managers of the employment exchanges but unfortunately in my area there is more unemployment than employment.  I have asked them for lists of persons who have been assessed to date.  I am told that this information is confidential because of the nature of the social welfare and that that list cannot be given.  I have written to the Minister.  The Minister says that unless I can provide concrete evidence of my allegation he cannot act on it.  I am tied between the two.  The Minister should consider that since the production of this new method of assessment certain farmers on very low income initially are being deprived of an income that they were heretofore budgeting with and budgeting for, and now without that money coming into the house they simply do not know where to turn.  If production is to continue on the small farms these people will have to get a fair deal.  This form of social welfare should be removed and there should be some other scheme or subsidy to replace it.  Those are a few random thoughts that I would like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  Even though it is a short Bill I feel it is somewhat confusing for people who are not familiar with all the background. As the Minister aptly said, the service in one form or another has been in existence since 1971.  The National Social Service Council was established in that year and in 1981 the National Social Service Board was established.  In 1982 we had the National Community Development Agency.  This National Social Service Board Bill, 1983, provides for re-establishment of the National Social Service Board and repeal of the National Community Development Act, 1982.  The National Community Development Agency was established in December, <Col N="140" /> 1982 but it never actually functioned as such.  Through this Bill we are reverting back to the National Social Service Board on a statutory basis, which everybody agrees is most important.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are 75 community information centres throughout the country with total grant aiding amounting to £30,000 or less than £450 per centre per year, which seems to me to be totally inadequate to give a proper service.  I also believe that in 1979 the number of queries dealt with was 39,000, in 1980 this increased to 49,500, in 1981 to 59,500, in 1982 to 85,000 and last year to 90,000.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the ultimate number of community information centres that he envisages will be necessary to cater for the country as a whole.  I see from the leaflet handed out at various centres that the community information centre provides free and confidential information on such subjects as taxation, health, housing, consumer affairs, social welfare and redundancy as well as information on local organisations and services.  The centres are financed by local funds and by Government grants, administered by the National Social Service Council, which also provides the up to date reference files used in the centres.  Each centre is run by voluntary community groups and operated by trained volunteers.  As I said, there are 75 information centres throughout the country and they deal with inquiries by callers through letters and phone calls.</P>
      <P>The information bulletin of the National Social Service Board, <i>Relate</i>, which has been referred to before, in a number of its issues, gives a fairly detailed history of the service from 1971. Very briefly, it seems that the National Social Service Council was established in October 1971.  The terms of reference of the original council were:</P>
      <P>(i)  To stimulate and encourage the formation of new voluntary social service councils and the expansion of existing councils without participation in the actual administration of such councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  To provide an advisory and information service to voluntary bodies <Col N="141" /> engaged in community social service.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To co-ordinate and to give advice on the work of governmental, local governmental and voluntary bodies engaged in the provision of community social services.</P>
    <P>(iv)  To promote liaison between central and local authorities and voluntary social service organisations.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that the council would become the focal point of voluntary social work activity in the country and would be a source of encouragement, assistance and advice to existing social work agencies. The National Social Service Council was re-constituted in March 1975.  The aims of the new council were broadly similar to the terms of reference of the original council but there were some changes in emphasis.  There were drawn up in the light of the council's experience since its formation.  The aims of the 1975 National Social Service Council were:</P>
    <P>1.  To promote co-operation between voluntary social service organisations at local and regional levels by encouraging the formation and development of Social Service Councils or similar bodies and by other means.</P>
    <P>2.  To promote co-operation between statutory and voluntary social services.</P>
    <P>3.  To provide information and advice on the social services and related fields.</P>
    <P>4.  To offer advice on policy and services to Government and to statutory and voluntary bodies engaged in the provision of social services.</P>
    <P>5.  To encourage the development of social services as an integral part of community development.</P>
    <P>The National Community Development Agency seems to have had many functions which the Minister has not included in this Bill, and I will refer to some of them.  I quote from <i>Relate,</i> June 1982:</P>
    <P>(a)  To advise the Minister for Health <Col N="142" /> and make recommendations to him regarding community development policies and community development programmes, in relation to self-help, poverty and social services;</P>
    <P>(b)  to promote and co-ordinate programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation,...</P>
    <P>(c)  to ascertain and specify communities in which there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation;</P>
    <P>(d)  to foster and assist, including by financial or material aid, projects of community involvement and activity, and to facilitate the mobilisation of community self-help;</P>
    <P>(e)  to advise the Minister on the social aspects of economic and social planning;</P>
    <P>(g)  to draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation by third level educational and other bodies, and to promote such research from time to time on specific projects;</P>
    <P>(i)  to collect and disseminate information on community development, self-help, poverty and social deprivation;</P>
    <P>(j)  to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.</P>
    <P>All of these have been eliminated from this Bill.  So it seems to me that it does not have the bite of the National Community Development Agency.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before us functions of the board as I see them, will be to advise and inform the Minister for Health regarding the social services, to provide information and the spreading of information about the social services; to do whatever is possible to promote voluntary social services for local communities; to organise co-operation between all social service groups, and to be concerned with the work in relation to social services of such bodies as the Minister may specify. Also, the Minister may add or withdraw <Col N="143" /> any function as he thinks proper from time to time.</P>
    <P>I believe there are particular problems regarding local funds, Government grants and personnel in many areas.  I would like the Minister to give some information with regard to these local funds, how they are obtained; whether there is any intention of improving or increasing the grants and whether there is a problem in getting suitable personnel. If possible, it would be desirable to increase the number of hours these centres are open.  Will that be possible?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will be no overlapping of services.  I would like to ask him what is the difference between a community information centre, the work they do and their responsibilities, and the information centres which are about to be set up by the North Western Health Board.  Will there not be an overlapping of activities here?  I understand the functions of the health board to include providing information on health matters but I see that in the address by the Minister at the opening of the information and advisory centre at Cleveragh Road, Sligo, on Monday, 13 February this year, he said that:</P>
    <P>Basic, straightforward information about services and entitlements is an absolute necessity.  Indeed, there is little point in providing a sophisticated range of services and benefits if people in need are not aware of them or do not know how to apply for them.</P>
    <P>Later on, he said:</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the health board and all those who have worked to bring this public information and advisory service to fruition.  I hope that other health boards will take their cue from the North Western Health Board and begin to develop similar services.</P>
    <P>All of us would be in favour of providing information in various ways and extending this service but it seems to me that clearly here there is an overlapping because, in my view, this is the work <Col N="144" /> which will be carried out by the board as envisaged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer, as Senator McGuinness did, to the publications of the National Social Service Board, particularly Entitlements for the Elderly and Entitlements for the Disabled, which have been very helpful.  Also, the monthly information bulletin <i>Relate.</i>  I would like to pay tribute to the present chairman, Mr. Joe McGough, to Mr. Noel O'Sullivan, head of information since 1979, who has been so helpful to all of us, and indeed all the staff.  They have been impressive on radio and television. I would like to pay tribute to Mr. John Curry, Director, who was also chairman of the Commission for Social Welfare which is trying to tease out the existing labyrinth in the social welfare code and recommend a new one.  I want to extend my thanks to all the volunteers with the board and in other capacities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the combating of poverty, perhaps the Minister feels rightly that between two stools we might come to the ground.  He states that the Government commitment to combat poverty is being and will be pursued in the context of a single-minded approach to the issue by an organisation unencumbered by other responsibilities or functions.  Of course, we would all support and be completely in favour of this.  With regard to combating poverty, I would agree with the Minister that it is important to identify the causes.  There would be a big input required in many ways, and I would agree with other Senators when they say not least will be information and education. Could I ask the Minister to take into consideration the important role which is being played by the adult education programme throughout the country, in Meath, in particular, with which I am most familiar.  The adult education services have helped the travelling community by providing courses without charge.  They also help the unemployed. They have special terms for them.  To do this properly they would need more funds, and we can only provide these services at the expense of something else. I would ask the Minister to look sympathetically <Col N="145" /> at the vocational education committees and adult education.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final point to the Minister.  It is an important one.  The two big problems at present are unemployment and housing.  I believe that to solve them a radical approach will be necessary. I have stated this before and I want to restate it here, I believe that to marry them both will go a long way towards solving both problems.  I have said before that it should be possible to channel labour from the huge unemployed pool into productive areas.  Housing with a very high percentage of labour content is one area where this is possible.  To give an example of what I mean, if the Government are committed, with regard to the payment of social benefits, to a certain amount of money and the existing grant system as we understand it for housing is abolished, but if people building houses were empowered statutorily to go to the labour exchange and engage workers who are receiving unemployment assistance and suppose the Government continued to pay the amount of unemployment assistance, the person building the house could pay a small additional amount, say £10 per week per person.  If we take a situation where the total cost of providing a house would be £30,000 and we assume that the labour/materials ratio of cost would be 60 to 40 per cent, that would mean that the labour cost would be £18,000 and materials £12,000.</P>
    <P>In many instances it would be people drawing unemployment benefits who would be building the house.  If that person had to contribute an additional £2,000 total for the additional incentive of £10 per week per person, then it would cost the person building the house £14,000.  That house would be provided at a total cost to the individual of £14,000. Taking other factors into consideration, the house which now would cost £30,000 could be built for less than £14,000.  This could be covered by a 100 per cent long-term loan.  The Government would be paying no more money than if the payments had been made continuously of the unemployment benefit.  This would need the co-operation of the trade unions and the employers' representatives.  But there <Col N="146" /> is scope for progress here and I would ask the Minister to consider this as a means of dealing positively with both problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank my fellow Members of the Oireachtas for their general support and understanding in relation to the Bill? Senator Mallon, or Senator Fallon &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mallon is on the mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse my Freudian slip.  Senator Fallon made the point that it would be preferable to amend the existing Act.  I have considered that approach but I strongly thought that the original agency, the National Community Development Agency, lacked a very clear and sustainable workable mandate and that, therefore, simply to amend the Act would only, to an extent, compound the original error, however will intentioned it was on the part of those who brought in that Bill.  Apart from that, the changes which would be required would be of a major nature in terms of reference and to that extent the amending legislation would be inappropriate.  It is better to start afresh and finish the job for all time and to put the National Social Service Board on a firm, definite and permanent footing so that this saga can be brought to an end.  I agree with Senator Fallon that poverty is the most important issue in our community.  It has to be singled out for very particular and positive attention. For that reason the Government's view is that we should establish a separate agency with a separate budget.  That is part of the Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon was critical of the former Combat Poverty Agency.  While it achieved a good deal and its final report was extremely interesting it had its drawbacks. As the Senator pointed out, setting up projects and various schemes on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, without due consideration for local community needs, is likely to lead to a lack of any lasting benefit and indeed could lead to a lot of local confusion. There was an element of that in relation to the work of the Combat Poverty <Col N="147" /> Agency.  However, I am confident that if we get the new organisation established on a definite and straightforward basis and learn from the mistakes of the past, then we will have an opportunity to establish a worth while agency.  I may set up the board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis initially, on an interim basis and then it can come forward with a final structure.  However, I am anxious to get it off the ground as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also indicated, regarding the membership of the Social Services Board, that the representation on the board should be as wide as possible.  I share that view.  We, in this country, have a habit of putting too many people on such boards.  I would think that in the region of eight, ten or eleven people at most would be most appropriate.  I agree with the Senator that it would be inadvisable to select members purely on the basis of their being from the major urban areas.  Admittedly, the areas of great deprivation are in the urban areas but nevertheless I think we need a geographical spread.  I am conscious of the need to select members who have established particularly good records in the field of voluntary social services.  I hope to get the board off the ground in the next few months on the assumption that the Bill will be given general approval.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Andy O'Brien for his support of the work of the voluntary bodies. That is much appreciated. As a member of a health board he knows the particular need to develop a close working relationship between the voluntary bodies and the health boards.  Co-operation throughout the country is a patchwork quilt.  In some boards it is outstanding, in others it is non-existent.  I share Senator O'Brien's view that there is a need to develop a closer working relationship. I fully support his view that we need to express our appreciation of the work being done by many people in the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness brought a nostalgic note, one might say, to my particular role in relation to the Bill.  I would share her view that from 1973 to 1984 the <Col N="148" /> board has languished without a statutory base.  Now it is going to have a formal statutory base.  As chairman from 1973 onwards, Senator McGuinness bore her scars of endeavour with a rare degree of tolerance.  Her trenchant criticisms of the past are merited and are put on record. The staff of the old National Social Service Board have been treated rather shoddily by politicians, and not by the Department of Health.  The Department had a good working relationship with the board but politicians could not make up their minds what they wanted to do, and they dilly dallied unduly.</P>
    <P>I share her view that the staff of this board and the chief executive officer, Mr. John Curry, deserved better treatment. They will, at long last, have formal statutory security in relation to their terms of reference and their future work. I want to thank Joe McGough, the current chairman of the National Community Development Agency and the members of that agency who stood by patiently during 1983 knowing that this change was coming.  I want to thank them for their forebearance.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two or three other aspects mentioned by Senator McGuinness.  She made a point about the need for statutory and voluntary co-operation. I appreciate that the former board were active in this area but I believe that, by giving the new board statutory authority, it will greatly facilitate their work.  That is a valid point.  We will ensure that special care is given to that role.  Regarding a possible charter for voluntary bodies, I agree with the Senator's views and I will be asking the re-established board to advise me on the matter.  I would see this as a priority for the new board.  As a Member of the Oireachtas for the past 14 or 15 years I have met many voluntary bodies, what strikes me most frequently is the wide disparity of skills, of commitment and of resources.  Very often these bodies start with a great flourish and establish a great track record.  Suddenly the chief motivator behind them dies, or an internal row develops, or suddenly they run out of resources and pile up debts inadvertently, and the whole thing falls apart.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> There is a need for greater coherent guidance and assistance to voluntary bodies than we have been giving in the past. One of the big problems is the capacity in this country.  People of enormous goodwill, dedication, sincerity and energy want to run their own voluntary body, and do not want to share it with a health board, or another organisation or, indeed, with persons at church level or with anybody else.  It becomes part of their lives.  While that is perfectly understandable, very frequently life and problems and new dimensions of poverty pass them by.  They find themselves treating a symptom which in fact has long gone in terms of a need being perceived.  Therefore, there is a great need for a charter for the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I again want to assure Senator McGuinness that I will do my utmost to assist the National Council for the Aged. Their publications and the great work done by Michael Killeen as chairman of the council are a rare aspect of dedicated public service on a voluntary basis.  The kind of work done by John Curry, the Chief Officer of the National Social Service Board in servicing the National Council for the Aged merits particular mention.</P>
    <P>I have a problem in concurring with Senator McGuinness on the question of membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have considered it over the years, I often felt that our exclusion was due to some mandarin in the parliamentary draftsman's office busily trying to prevent Members of the Oireachtas from participating on various national bodies.</P>
    <P>On reflection I have come to the conclusion over the years &mdash; perhaps it is because I am getting old; and I am not yet 50 &mdash; that the problem is that Members of the Oireachtas have so much to do in terms of enacting legislation, that we must resist the temptation to get deeply personally involved in the bodies themselves, whether they are on a paid basis or on a voluntary basis.  The dual mandate in that context is reasonable. There are arguments for and against but, on balance, I would not entirely share the Senator's view that Members of the Oireachtas should be permitted to be <Col N="150" /> included in the membership of the National Social Service Board.  On balance it is best that, having established a statutory base, we disengage ourselves and go on to other work as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon and Senator McGuinness raised the question of the financing of the agency.  The budget this year is about £475,000.  It is sufficient as of 1984 to enable them to discharge their functions. When the board are re-established the provisions for financing can be reexamined in relation to the revised functions and the revised powers.  I share the view of Senator Hillery &mdash; I regret that I was not able to be here when he contributed to the debate due to the Dáil being recalled &mdash; that the prompt payment of social welfare benefits would alleviate much of the criticism and many of the problems which faced the National Social Service Board because of the perennial number of inquiries which this board get.</P>
    <P>The publications of the board are very good, particularly <i>Relate</i> and the comprehensive document on services for the aged, for example.  Very often when an elderly person has a sudden recall of a pension book, or a prolonged delay in obtaining a benefit, that can cause enormous deprivation and distress to such a person.  We all experience this in our daily work at constituency level.  I share his view that there is a need for prompt payment.  When we have a public service staff embargo and 220,000 on the live register, and a growing number of dependants, there are enormous pressures on our public servants, particularly on the staff of the Department of Social Welfare. I can assure the Deputy that I marvel at the fact that at exchange level they manage to deliver what they deliver in the present setting.  I very much bear in mind the points he made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons needs a reply in relation to the community information centres.  He asked in particular about the difference between the National Social Service Board's community information centres and the North-Western Health Board's information centres.  The community information centres, by and large, <Col N="151" /> cover all the public information services, taxes, social services, housing, and they are open on a part-time basis only.  Some of them in the North-Western Health Board area &mdash; and there is outstanding work being done in that health board area &mdash; are full-time because they are based at health centres, but many are part-time.  They tend to be confined to the health and welfare services.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the National Social Service Board services tend to be of a broader, more comprehensive nature.  I was in Sligo last Monday week and I was enormously impressed, as were the officers of my Department who attended, by the outstanding work being done in Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.  Every health board could take an object lesson from the massive spread of community information centres which they have virtually in every health centre, in every hospital, in every local community office.  There is, for example, a range of leaflets, a range of information available to the local community which very frequently does not exist in other major areas.  In the Eastern Health Board &mdash; to draw a direct comparison where one is dealing with the best part of one-third of the population &mdash; there is an example to be followed in that regard.</P>
    <P>These are my comments on the general aspects of the Bill.  I am sure many Members of this House share the view that Senator Robb's contributions on such matters show rare, continued and radical imagination.  When he talks about the need to ask serious questions on education, on health and taxation matters and on the need to liberate resources and to liberate power so that the people who need those services can get them, I think we all share his views.  I am conscious that, in the Department of Social Welfare we are spending £1,000 million a year, and in the Department of Health we are spending another £1,000 million a year. A total of 40 per cent of all the State's Exchequer moneys goes through my two Departments.  I would hazard a guess, having looked at that expenditure over the past 15 months, that about 20 per cent of it, or about £400 million of it, <Col N="152" /> does not really get to the people it was intended for.</P>
    <P>The real poor in our community, the really deprived people, and the really disabled people, the really handicapped people, and those on really low incomes do not get the transfer payments within those resources.  The question asked by Senator John Robb must be answered. So conservative are we as politicians, so conservative are the power groups within our community, and so inately conservative are we in terms of radical transfer of resources, that the strictures of Senator Robb are merited and should be carefully considered.  His contribution lays down a major marker for all of us to work more effectively in that direction.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Senators for their detailed observations on this Bill over the past three hours.  I look forward to continuing, if possible, with the remaining stages of the Bill this afternoon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I mentioned the need for a combat poverty input in the Bill.  It <Col N="153" /> is very desirable and is more necessary than ever before.  Many people are out of work and on the poverty line.  Rather than having separate legislation in the future &mdash; in a year, or two years, or whatever the Minister has in mind &mdash; the Minister should accept this amendment. It would meet the need the Minister knows to exist.  If this Government are totally committed to the socially deprived and to those who suffer from poverty, now is the time to implement this scheme and there is no better way of doing it than by an amendment of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Second Stage that the Government were strongly of the view that there is a need for a separate statutory role for the National Social Service Board.  I hold the view that we need a separation of powers in this area. Nobody in the Houses of the Oireachtas would be more reluctant than myself to establish what one might call political quangos, or new political organisations, or new community structures.  Nevertheless the National Social Service Board should have a formal statutory base in our community to deliver basic information and the co-ordination of services in the social service area.  That is being done in relation to the voluntary social services.</P>
      <P>The broader issue of alleviating poverty and undertaking community involvement and activity in the poverty area, and in the area of social deprivation, requires separate, sustained action.  There was confusion in the setting up of the National Community Development Agency because those functions were subsumed into the work of the National Community Development Agency.  For these reasons, and not in any way detracting from the laudable arguments advanced by Senator Fallon, but holding that they are different and should be kept apart from the ordinary day-to-day work of the National Social Service Board, and separate in budget terms, I regret that I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have set aside in 1984 £475,000 for the National Social Service Board.  In the years ahead I would like to <Col N="154" /> see more resources going into the work of that board.  On an entirely separate basis the Government set aside £1 million for the Combat Poverty Organisation to work in that area.  I am rather anxious that the two of them should not be confused or intertwined at this stage.  There may be people who would like to see them so intertwined and the moneys put under the one broad subhead.  For that reason and in terms of budget reallocation of moneys on an ongoing basis, I regret that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Before we develop the point raised by Senator Fallon, there is a point I should like to raise, a Chathaoirligh. Having disagreed with your ruling, I hope I will not have any further disagreements with you this afternoon.  This seems to me the only place I can raise this matter.  I do not see in this section any co-ordination of the educational aspects of the social services.  There are many aspects which come within the ambit of social services but we have not got the proper means of training the people involved.  In our universities we have a social science degree.  Once people get their degree they are foisted on the public as being experts in a particular area.  I have come across cases of marital breakdown where young people were giving advice to married couples on what they should do, whether they should break up, or whether they should stay together, and giving advice which in some cases resulted in the actual breaking up of the marriage.</P>
      <P>In Kilkenny we have a very good and well-established voluntary social service centre.  We get people to follow up their training in social science but, unfortunately, there is no co-ordination in the educational process.  The best social service workers are people who have been working on a voluntary basis in the deprived areas of our cities, towns and in the countryside.  After many years of looking at the problems and seeing how they were resolved they know what is needed.  Will the board co-ordinate whatever training is available for social service workers, and how does the Minister foresee the social service board improving the type of advice given at present by social service workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections have been quite deliberately framed in the broadest possible context to enable that kind of training to be given. We have inserted the words &ldquo;to promote, develop, encourage and assist, whether by means of the provision of financial or material aid, personnel or services or otherwise, the development of services and schemes in local communities for the dissemination of information and advice <Col N="157" /> in relation to social services...the establishment and development of voluntary social services for those communities... co-operation in relation to social services between boards...work in relation to social services...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By and large the prospect of direct training schemes being organised and serviced by the National Social Service Board would be encompassed in that particular function.  I certainly take careful note of what Senator Lanigan has said, and I hope the National Social Service Board, together with the academic authorities, who provide the formal professional qualifications in the area, will co-ordinate their activities and deliver the kind of services envisaged by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has said that.  When you qualify theoretically as an engineer, it does not make any difference if a bridge falls down unless somebody is killed, but if you are dealing with people, as social workers are, it is totally important that not only is their theoretical training up to standard <Col N="158" /> but that they are not foisted on the public as trained social workers whereas, in actual fact, they have just been trained in the theory of social work.</P>

Unfortunately when they pontificate to people who are in trouble, the impression given by them is that they are there for their own good, that they get personal satisfaction out of helping the underprivileged. It should be the other way around. They should be giving to the people what is necessary for them to solve their problems.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a small point on section 23.  Senator McGuinness made the point regarding this section and the Minister replied to it.  Senator McGuinness is an example of where an Oireachtas member could usefully be and has proved to be valuable in the past.  I am not certain that we should stick rigidly with this provision in this Bill or for future Bills.  If there is a good person in the Oireachtas, a Member with an interest at heart and if he or she is suitable for a board, I feel that that person should be entitled to go on it.  The Government should waive that particular section in the various Bills.  As Senator McGuinness said, it is becoming part and parcel of every Bill that comes before the two Houses.  I hold the view that if there is a Member well and truly qualified and with the interest of the particular project at heart, recognition should be given to that person and this particular section might be waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Fallon has said.  We cannot complain too strongly against the Minister himself on this.  This is a general policy decision which successive Governments have pursued and is one which I think should be re-examined.  You have to strike a balance between the necessity and the wisdom of not permitting the quangos which arise out of legislation to become the plaything of party politicians on the one hand &mdash; and there is a great danger that this might happen &mdash; and on the other hand, the very desirable encouragement which will be given to people to become Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas without changing too much their contacts and lifestyle and their contribution to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of Seanad Éireann should be developed in as non-political or apolitical <Col N="161" /> a fashion as is possible under the system.  I ask the Minister to consider for the future in the case of any similar Bills which may go through his Department whether Members of Seanad Éireann, recognising that they are, or should be, less politically motivated than Members of the Dáil might not as a first step be excluded from disqualification of this type.  Increasingly in public life we have the situation where even expressing a desire to be a Member of Seanad Éireann is disqualifying people from a large range of activities.  This situation is not good and it is not healthy: it would be a factor influencing whether a particularly worth while person would decide to be a candidate or not.  Similarly, in private institutions, directors of private institutions are being increasingly subjected to the same restrictions.  For example, as I understand it, a director of any one of the major banks in Ireland will be expected to cease to be a director in the event of standing for political office &mdash; standing for political office, not actually succeeding.  This is only an extension of what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>Is it a good thing that the direction of these bodies which we set up should be totally removed from the political process? You have on the one hand the problem of the domination of these bodies by political activists, but on the other hand you have the equally serious danger of these bodies being controlled by rather directionless people who are not in touch with the realities of the administration of Government or not in touch with the realities of representative politics.  There appears to be a general view on both sides of the Seanad that this matter should be re-examined.  I ask the Minister to give the matter very serious consideration for any future legislation which may go through his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In echoing those sentiments may I say that this House has at all stages of legislation on the formation of boards, expressed reservations about this section.  I know that it would not be the Minister's wish to have this kind of bar on people running for public office <Col N="162" /> because we know from our own experience, particularly in my party, where a member who was working in a post office and allowed himself to be nominated for an election, lost his job forthwith.  He was not elected to the Dáil at that time; it was a by-election, but by going forward as a public representative for his party he lost his job.  I think it is discrimination that people are not allowed even to be nominated for the European Parliament or for either House of the Oireachtas.  We have consistently said that in this House.  I am saying to the Minister that we feel that this is almost automatic parliamentary draftsman's language that appears in all Bills.  We are asking again on this occasion that the views of this House be taken into consideration by parliamentary draftsmen.  It can be communicated to them by the Minister that we have the gravest reservations about this provision particularly in the area of nominating people: if they want to be nominated it should not debar them from membership of a board or they should not lose membership of a board.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think there is a special degree of sense in Senator O'Leary's contribution about Members of the Seanad.  Quite a lot of people who have spoken on this section, including Senator McGuinness, are elected here vocationally and they have an expertise and could contribute much to running a board of this nature without any political influences that people like me might be subjected to, or somebody on the other side of the House.  There are people here who have an expertise that we admire. They are elected here through a different kind of process, and it is not the political process.  We should certainly look at that particular area.  Legislators here are unhappy that in all these pieces of legislation we are, it seems, automatically treated as second class citizens, that we have not a useful contribution to make since by allowing your name to go forward for nomination you automatically lose a seat on a board like this.  I am asking the Minister to communicate those views to the people who prepare the legislation for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate in a way to add to this again, having said my say on the Second Stage, but first I would like to thank the people who have said such kind things about me personally and reiterate that this is not a personal plea on my own behalf.  I do feel in relation to what Senators O'Leary and Ferris have said about Seanad Éireann that it is a particular case in which the Members of this House generally are elected on a vocational basis or elected because they have particular expertise in a certain field.  It does seem to be a waste of their abilities then to turn around and say well, if we are setting up a Government board that deals with that particular field we must exclude the Members of Seanad Éireann because they are Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is just a way of dealing with politicians as a whole.  We have enough people in this country and indeed in other countries describing politicians pejoratively as a general brood of people that are not particularly admirable.  If we go in this way saying that politicians or anybody who aspires to be a politician should not be allowed to be a member of any kind of State board or whatever, I think we fuel this fire.  We tend to make it easier for people to say &ldquo;Ah well, they want to keep those horrible politicians out of it at any rate&rdquo;.  I do not think that is necessarily a very good idea.  Therefore, I would like the Minister to have another think about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider in relation to future legislation and in relation to my work in the health area, the particular point made by Senators in relation to Seanad Éireann itself.  I might indicate that in relation to the setting up of the National Health Council, a body which was languished since 1978-79 &mdash; earlier in fact &mdash; the body has not been re-established at all although I am required to consult with the body under the Health Act before enacting any legislation including this legislation; the body has not been in existence.  In that regard, I did go to the Government and I did suggest that three Members of the <Col N="164" /> Oireachtas should serve on that body, and the Government accepted that argument and the three Members of the Oireachtas concerned have now been asked and all three have accepted membership of the National Health Council for the next three years.  The composition will be announced in the near future.  To that extent, there is a development in that direction.  I would have difficulty in accepting it as a matter of general provision. Admittedly, there are those rather rare, unique unaffiliated souls in Seanad Éireann who possess personal, unique objectivity but that, I fear, would not apply to the generality of Senators.  Some Senators have a propensity to collect offices of various bodies like fellows I knew when I was going to school who were collecting minor hurling championship medals, &ldquo;lashings&rdquo; of trophies for membership of this, that and the other, so many memberships and so many bodies that one wonders when one looks at some of the <i>curriculae vitae</i> how they managed to get through a day at all without going around with agendas stuffed into their pockets for different meetings at every hour of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that Members of the Oireachtas, including Seanad Éireann, in particular Seanad Éireann, if I may digress for a minute, should be so deeply immersed in the legislative process and in a great deal of work within the context of their membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas that they should not have any other time available to spend in servicing, administering and being involved in other bodies.  They could perhaps be involved in the National Social Service Board which would be a very busy board, perhaps meeting at a minimum every three or four weeks and doing a lot of subcommittee work and so on.  To that extent I would have some reservations, but I will certainly bear in mind what Senators have said in relation to this House of the Oireachtas.  I might add that that standard provision, if it is any consolation to the Seanad, was put in a standard form; it was not discussed at Government because it has become an established part of so much legislation now that perhaps it is time that we had more flexibility.  At <Col N="165" /> least there is the consolation that in respect of the National Health Council I have not excluded Members of the Oireachtas.  I think in relation to other boards, like the National Planning Board and so on, Members of the Oireachtas have not <i>per se</i> been excluded although in fact they were, but not in terms of the terms of reference.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Robb on Wednesday, 1 February 1984:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, appalled at the continuous proliferation of nuclear weapons, concerned at the impact in particular of arms expenditure on the poor of the world, determined to do everything possible to contribute to the resolution of the war in Ireland and recognising the growing acknowledgement of non-violent action as a form of resistance, calls on the Government to pursue a policy of positive neutrality committed to anti-nuclearism, nonaggression and support for the oppressed of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is among the smallest states of Europe and nearly unarmed, with all due respects to our army, and we are not a member of any military alliance.  Yet it would be foolish <Col N="167" /> of us to cod ourselves that the big powers do not know or are not watching our moves.  Indeed, if we only recall events of recent days it may be that history is repeating itself in this State.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the increasing anxiety among the Irish people of the dangers of nuclear war and the escalation of the arms race.  Senator Rogers when speaking on this motion last week said: &ldquo;The lucky ones are the ones who will die&rdquo;.  That was a severe statement, but how true.  The unthinkable horror of a nuclear war has added a new and terrifying dimension to the situation.  It is the first time that we have certain death hanging over all of us, that is, if somebody presses the button.</P>
      <P>We must not become entangled in any military alliance or pact.  Every Irish Government must be vigilant and alert at all times to preserve our freedom and avoiding the siting of nuclear weaponry on any Irish soil &mdash; I presume the House will know the territory I am talking about.  We must always stay alert, because while there is commerce being done by some of the great powers in part of our country it should in no way tie us to any military pact.</P>
      <P>Our commitment to the democratic way of life is unswerving.  In the EEC or in the United Nations or indeed in any other arena we must face the issue as it has had to be faced in recent times.  I do not have to make reference to the place or to name it.  Fianna Fáil will always seek by diplomatic and political means to prevent armed conflict; that is our tradition, even in difficult and dangerous times.  Some of today's politicians do not think our neutrality is as important as I think it is.  It is quite clear that the plain people of Ireland do not want any involvement in any military alliance that might jeopardise the neutrality of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a debate in this House on our air space, which still worries me, and a Bill which went through on 14 December 1983.  In that debate we talked about the implications of Eurocontrol for our air space.  I am still confused about whether we made proper decisions in the mid-sixties <Col N="168" /> as a neutral country and with a positive stand on neutrality and as a non-member of NATO.  I am still confused about some of the things that happened with air space and Eurocontrol.  I am not talking about the movement of army personnel and their families; I am talking about military flights in our air space.  We finished that legislation at that time and of course it was only the follow up of other legislation.  I do not know if we saw the implications for our neutrality of the Eurocontrol Bill that went through.  We want to be neutral and at the same time acknowledge the difficulties in preserving our neutrality.  We should always be determined that we will not be the tool of any great power.  That was our strength in the past; let us hope we will hold on to it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the papers do not always print the correct quotation, but Senator McGonagle was reported as saying that our neutrality is negotiable.  I hope he was incorrectly quoted in the paper.  Furthermore, Irish neutrality is very much linked with the need for Irish unity.  If we exercise influence and command respect in international politics out of all proportion to the size of our country, maybe it is because we have such values as peace and our neutrality stand.  We should try at all times to see that people are treated fairly in life, whether it be in regard to world peace or a nation at peace or even peace in the home, which is where peace starts.</P>
    <P>I understand that negotiations were suspended between the Soviet Union and the USA in January 1983 on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Geneva, and in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  I wonder have dates been fixed for new negotiations on these two matters.  At all times there have been serious violations of human rights. Indeed in many parts of the world today they are continuing.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; has been used many times, and I should like to put on the record of this House my positive stand on our neutrality, not an inch no matter what the gain might be.  I have no doubt that in the long run we will not allow anyone to whittle away our ability <Col N="169" /> to work for peace for all mankind.  I am equally aware of the difficulties as a very small nation in hoping that the great powers might even begin to listen to us.  I hope that at some time some Minister of the present Government will clear my mind about the confusion regarding our air space and the Eurocontrol legislation of past years, not just of last year.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment to the motion and in so doing I would say to the proposers of the motion, Senators John Robb and Brendan Ryan, that in many ways it was due to a question of semantics that it was found necessary to put down an amendment.  The motion itself is so complex and is comprised of so many diverse elements that it would be possible for somebody to agree with certain parts of it and disagree with other parts.  To support it as a whole was not found possible, hence the putting down of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would preface my remarks by saying to Senator Honan that I spotted a correction in the press apropos of what Senator McGonagle was reported as saying about neutrality being negotiable.  There was an apology to Senator McGonagle and a statement of what he had said in the debate in the Seanad.  In Ireland neutrality has become one of our sacred cows.  Every so often we take it down and we dust it off and have a look at it, groom it and talk about it, and then lead it back to where it came from.  We are a small nation.  We are non-aligned militarily and I suppose for the great majority of our citizens neutrality has no great impact on their consciousness.  It is rarely debated with any vehemence and it is something that is in the recesses of people's minds rather than to the forefront of their consciousness. I feel, however, that there is a growing and very concerted lobby from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament people, and from all of those involved in peace groups and solidarity groups with oppressed Third World countries.  This is bringing this issue more and more into the forefront of national debate.  I would like to place on the record of this House my welcome for this kind of activity, my support for groups like the Campaign for <Col N="170" /> Nuclear Disarmament and the Third World solidarity groups which are springing up in the country and facing us with the reality of nuclear armament and of what this means to every man, woman and child in this country.</P>
    <P>The recent screening of the film &ldquo;The Day After&rdquo; has given all of us something of an insight into what would happen in the event of a nuclear war, although many people felt that it was presented in a very softened way, that the actual and the real effect would be far more devastating than anything depicted in that film.  In general the reaction following the screening of that film by RTE was one of horror and despair.  Of course, there is a natural tendency with all of us when things become too horrendous, too horrific or too awful to contemplate that we just push them out of sight and out of mind.  This is what a feeling of helplessness can do.  It can bring about a relegation of something important into the &ldquo;lost property&rdquo; compartment of the mind.</P>
    <P>This matter of neutrality and of nuclear disarmament is something about which we cannot be lethargic.  We must take a constructive, positive attitude.  In Ireland we are perhaps a little too modest about the impact that we could have in this area.  We should be in the business of making our country a centre for peace studies.  I do not see why we cannot in our third level institutes set up faculties of peace studies.  This has been done successfully in other countries.  In Ireland we are ideally placed to institute a faculty of peace studies in one or more of our universities so that we could become a centre and a focus for peace and peace studies in the world.  It may seem something of a contradiction that a small country which is experiencing such inner turmoil should dare to consider setting up a peace faculty, but because we have known the actual effects of hostility, violence and struggle, we are the very people who are best placed to bring forward this idea.  I suggest that it is something we could do in a very positive and concrete fashion to underscore and underline our neutrality. We are not powerless in the face of nuclear armament.  We have a moral responsibility to act and it is one way in <Col N="171" /> which we could be a force for peace.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Honan say she felt that peace and peace education begin in the home.  I would absolutely concur with this.  It begins from the very moment a child is placed in the arms of its parents.  It begins with examining issues of conflict.  It beings with negotiating. You can negotiate with a three-year-old and with a four-year-old.  Too many Irish parents are not prepared for the hard slog that that kind of negotiating with a tiny child demands.  How often do we see in a public place children slapped, children shaken, children just very forcibly told to pipe down or keep quiet, or &ldquo;You cannot have that&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop shouting&rdquo;. It is the very beginnings of peace education when somebody takes time to take a child aside and to explain, to persuade, to cajole and to bring about a situation of non-conflict.</P>
    <P>I know that in Irish schools, often under the auspices of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, there is a programme of peace education.  In the Waterford area recently under the aegis of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, there was a very interesting weekend of peace education for primary school children. I was intrigued to learn from some of the participants that it had been very successful and that they had actually enjoyed the whole experience of being shown how to solve conflict, albeit in a very minor way when we compare it with the possibility of global conflict or national conflict.  These children were shown how to solve a conflict of a very mundane, everyday nature &mdash; the sort of thing that would perhaps make them speak the harsh word or use physical violence in order to solve a disagreement. This is the way we must begin, both in the home and at primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>In the context of the setting up of the Curriculum and Examinations Board, and particularly in the area of the reexamination of our curriculum, it should be possible for us to incorporate peace studies in our primary and secondary schools on a statutory basis or on a curriculum basis.  All children would have a <Col N="172" /> possibility to examine conflict, both in a personal and in a community and in a global sense.  They would see that there are ways of handling conflict which do not mean that the first thing you do is to resort to violence or harsh words.</P>
    <P>The other part of this motion deals with development.  We recently had a debate in the Seanad in relation to the IDA loans.  Some of us have gone to great lengths to discuss the area of disarmament and development and how the one takes from the other and the obscenity that exists in today's world which sees vast amounts of expenditure on arms. Then there is the awful tragedy of so many people living in under-developed countries, starving and hungry and deprived.  There is not a Member in this House who would not agree that something has to be done to bring about a balance.  It is even worse when you consider that in so many of the Third World countries so much money is being spent on arms right in the eye of the poverty, degradation and deprivation which so many people are suffering so needlessly, if there was but the political will, the effort and the energy expended to bring about a just allocation of resources in this world.</P>
    <P>The motion also deals with solidarity with the oppressed of the world, and I would like to make a comment on that. Recently, Bishop Casey of Galway took it upon himself to fly to the Philippines as a gesture of solidarity with Father Niall O'Brien and the other people who are on trial in the Philippines.  Father O'Brien's case has been highlighted in this country, and rightly so.  He is one of our missionaries in the Third World.  He is a signal or sign of oppression right across the world, and in reacting to him we are reacting to all oppressed people.  He is the one we can identify with, the one whose situation we understand.  Bishop Casey did us all a service in taking it upon himself to go out there as a gesture of solidarity.</P>
    <P>I would also commend the decision of the Government to send somebody from our embassy in Australia to Father O'Brien on behalf of the Irish Government and people.  All these gestures are <Col N="173" /> important.  The fact that the Irish Philippino group are holding a vigil tomorrow outside the American Embassy between 12 and 3 p.m. as a sign of solidarity with Fr. O'Brien is to be welcomed.  I am confident that a large number of people, who would not be able to speak in any great depth or detail on oppression or nuclear arms or the Third World, will have a gut instinct and will want to express themselves in this gesture of solidarity.</P>
    <P>Today in Managua in Nicaragua, there is a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the death of General Sandino whose political aspirations gave rise to a revolution there.  Some Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas were asked to be present as a gesture of solidarity with the Nicaraguans at this time.  To my knowledge people did not find it possible to attend.  Such far-flown gestures of solidarity are not granted to all of us.  I would like to express solidarity with the Nicaraguan people in their difficulties and wish them well in the peaceful development of their country.</P>
    <P>The recent visit of the Minister of State &mdash; whom I am pleased to see here &mdash; to African countries, in particular Lesotho to examine the development work which the Irish Government are carrying out there under the aid programmes, is a gesture of solidarity with those who are working in the field of aid and with the people who are benefiting from the aid. As such it is done on behalf of all of us. It is important that it is so done.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment to the motion.  I regret that all the disparate elements could not have been teased out as individual motions.  It made it difficult for all who contributed because there was so much to say about each section that it was difficult to make a global comment &mdash; I use that term advisedly.  I thank the proposers of the motion for bringing it forward for discussion and I am pleased to have been able to add my comments to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

      <P>For me, as for people throughout the world, the thought of nuclear warfare is horrifying.  The thought that mankind can be eliminated <Col N="174" /> by a nuclear war is far too horrible even to contemplate.  Yet from what we see and read it is a possibility.  As Senator Bulbulia has commented, the film &ldquo;The Day After&rdquo; was unbelievable and caused shock waves throughout the nation. Indeed the picture painted by Senator Robb last week of what might happen was horrifying and something that we would hope never to experience.</P>
      <P>For all of us and in particular for the young people of Ireland and throughout the world, the threat of nuclear war is something they worry about far more than the older generations.  I know from listening to teenagers and students that it is a problem that worries them far more than we realise.  We have cause for worrying because we are aware that East-West relations have worsened in recent years.  We are aware that the nuclear arms race is continuing.  We know from the Minister's speech that a figure of $550 billion per year is spent throughout the world on armaments.  All these matters cause us concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the conflicts in so many regions throughout the world &mdash; Central America, the Lebanon, the Middle East and so on &mdash; and realise that in those conflicts there is a super power rivalry, we must express our concern that these super powers are directly or indirectly involved.  That in itself is sufficient to cause concern and genuine worry.  Nuclear war could have a devastating effect on countries far removed from the conflict, and is totally different to any other type of warfare.  We have some experience in that the nuclear waste problem from Windscale has affected us in some way.  News of an extension to the British fuel plant &mdash; at a cost of £2,000 million &mdash; must further worry us.  The Government are correct in making their views known to the British Government, but more needs to be done.  We need to be fully informed about what is taking place at Windscale.  We have every right to be fully informed.  In my opinion the British need to be far more forthcoming with information than they have been up to now.  There is suspicions about the nuclear waste being poured into the Irish Sea, and assurances will have to be given <Col N="175" /> about the effectiveness of our monitoring of the nuclear waste which finds its way into the air we breathe.  These are matters which the Government should insist on and they should take every opportunity to have discussions with the British to find out exactly what is going on.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of neutrality, it is my opinion that the Irish people feel strongly about neutrality and they are as proud of what happened in 1939 as they are of any event in the history of the State.  Neutrality is as important as it was in 1939.  History has shown that Eamon de Valera, even when subjected to a measure of economic blackmail by the British for the return of the Treaty ports, or even when he was bullied politically by the British and Americans at a later stage of the war, remained cool, calm and knew exactly what he wanted.  He favoured neutrality, the Irish people favoured neutrality and that was that.  He steered the Irish ship of State safely through those turbulent years.  The leader of the Government today can in some way take example from Eamon de Valera.  Eamon de Valera in his international speeches did much to enhance his reputation in his own country.  The Irish people were gratified to see their leader being accepted as a global statesman. Likewise for the leader of our country today, if he adopts a similar attitude and frame of mind, if at every international gathering he attends, in the United Nations or wherever, he assumes that type of role both in terms of neutrality for the Irish nation and in terms of his attitude to a possible nuclear war, then he too will emerge extremely high and proud in the minds of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>People often ask what can we do and what should we do and as a small nation are we not very unimportant?  I say, no, we are not.  We can certainly take example from the late thirties.  Whether it be the Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or whatever Minister is present, should speak out on our behalf at every opportunity to explain our abhorrence of the arms race, <Col N="176" /> to tell the world that we want to retain our neutrality.</P>
    <P>When one looks at it from a different angle, there are billions of dollars being spent on nuclear arms, and considering the large number of lives being lost in the Third World through malnutrition, hunger, lack of medical care and so on, what could this money not do for them?  It seems to me to be clearly a world disgrace. Our role can be an effective role. We are a small nation but we are in many ways a respected nation of the world and our leaders can use every international platform available to highlight what we think of the problems of the world today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us is one of the most comprehensive motions to come before the Seanad.  It tends to deal with four distinct and different matters, some of which are interrelated or connected but some of which are not interrelated or connected.  In my analysis the following are the four different elements which are contained within the motion which is before the House. Firstly, it deals with and makes reference to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Secondly, it deals with arms expenditure, in particular arms expenditure of a non-nuclear type in respect of poor countries. It attempts to deal with what it alleges to be a war in Ireland and, fourthly, it expresses support and solidarity for the oppressed people of the world.  Individually each of these topics reflects great credit on the social awareness and social conscience of the movers of the motion. But I think the motion tries to deal within itself with all our foreign policy and tries to make judgments within that motion that are in conflict with our policy.  It is too ambitious a motion.  A series of motions on each individual topic would have contributed to the foreign policy of the Government of the country in a more comprehensive and constructive fashion. The amendment while not taking from the serious and comprehensive nature of the motion, seeks to limit it, in so far as it is possible, to a certain internal coherence, to bring a certain internal coherence into the motion, and it nearly succeeds <Col N="177" /> in doing that.  I would not make any further claim for it than that.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that everyone in this country is not only against the proliferation of nuclear weapons but we are against their very existence.  Our objection is not only to the fact that more are being manufactured but to the fact that they were manufactured at all.  We would not be satisfied with a policy by the great powers that would stop the manufacture of more nuclear weapons. We want to eliminate those nuclear weapons which are already in existence, so our policy in that regard has to go beyond the mere proliferation of nuclear weapons to the very core of their existence. In that regard the breakdown of negotiations in the various forums which are being used by the great powers to discuss disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament in particular is a source of very serious concern not only to the people and the citizens of the countries directly involved but also to the citizens of this country.  It is timely that we should use this motion as an opportunity of expressing our support for the recommencement of those negotiations.  We should not be too willing to ascribe bad or incorrect motives to what we would instinctively culturally and socially feel are the other side, the Communist power.  The USA is not without its faults in this regard.  The agreement which was called SALT II was signed by the United States of America but never ratified by the United States Senate.  That was a very serious setback for the cause of world peace.  Having said that, there is no doubt that the USSR has now or at least had in the recent past a substantial lead in terms of nuclear power aimed at the European Continent. But it was only a lead which made reference to a multiple of the capacity to destroy the whole Continent.  There is a need for these powers to resume talks, and if it is necessary in order to resume these talks to include the United Kingdom and the French nuclear weapons in these discussions it is in the interest of the countries of western Europe that that should be done and that these talks should recommence without any further ado.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> The problem of the arms exploitation, the money spent on arms and the effect which it has on the poor of the world is twofold.  On the one hand the spending by countries who can ill afford it of a substantial portion of their gross national product on the purchase of arms is in itself something which should be condemned. In addition to that, the effect which the resulting arms can have on the internal politics of the country is something which again should make us all examine and criticise the situation.  In this regard we have appealed in this House in the past and we should use this opportunity to appeal again to both the USSR and the United States of America not to base their foreign aid on the basis of an acceptable or friendly foreign policy. There is no doubt that almost all the foreign aid of the USSR has a political basis and a political bias.  It appears to those of us who are friendly disposed to the United States of America that under the present administration their foreign policy is moving in the same direction.  It is something which we should insist should be stopped.  Aid should be given because it is needed and not because of a particular foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The motion goes on to consider the question of the resolution of the war in Ireland.  I could not accept this.  As far as I am concerned there is no war in this country.  Passing this motion would give a status to violence in this country which I cannot agree with.  People have said that violence is violence and calling it war will not make it any different, but, whether we like it or not, the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; has a special legal status.  If we mention war in a motion in this House, even though we do so without any particular significance, without meaning any particular thing, it will be portrayed outside as meaning war in the legal sense.  It will be portrayed by the most objectionable and violent fascists in Europe who profess to act in my name and in the name of the Republic.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the motion goes on and discusses support for the oppressed of the world.  Of course we must support the oppressed of the world, the poor, the victims of governments who have a political <Col N="179" /> system that does not grant to their citizens the level of personal freedom which is compatible with every individual's personal rights.  The poor of the world include the victims of dictatorship, even though they might be materially well off.  It includes the victims of cultural deprivation.  It includes emigrants who are badly treated in countries throughout the world.  All these people are entitled to our support and our help but because the motion gives a status to the conflict in Ireland which would be misrepresented by those in whose interest it would be so to misrepresent them, the motion itself, as far as I am concerned, cannot be acceptable, much as I sympathise with three of the four headings of those who propose the motion.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment, while staying, in so far as is possible to do so, within the comprehensive framework which was the intention of the movers of the motion, corrects the defects which are inherent in the motion itself and I hope the Seanad will pass the motion as amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity of speaking to this motion.  To begin with, I look at both the wording of the original motion and the wording of the amendment and I find, in a way, that I have a sympathy with both sides in that I take Senator O'Leary's point about the use of the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; and indeed I am inclined to share his feelings about it, that the use of the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; carries a connotation which I think perhaps we ought not to bring into this. On the other hand, I would have liked to keep the acknowledgment of non-violent action as a form of resistance because I feel that in the way in which the various demonstrations and protests about nuclear weaponry have been carried out recently it is important to show that one can resist these things by non-violent methods and that we can support that kind of non-violent action which has indeed a very respectable history behind it.  One has only to think of the campaigns of Gandhi in India and various other non-violent leaders who could successfully bring about a change in policy without <Col N="180" /> the necessity of trying to destroy, maim kill or act in a way that would injure their neighbours.  I feel that an acknowledgment of non-violence as a method of working is an important thing.</P>
      <P>I would hold also with the idea of a policy of positive neutrality as in the amendment and the need to support development policies in solidarity with the oppressed of the world because neutrality, non-violence and anti-nuclearism are not just matters between east and west, between the powers of the Western World, as it were, the Americans and those who support them, the NATO powers, and the Warsaw Pact powers.  If we are to have peace in the world and a lasting peace and a peace based on justice, we also have to deal with the gaps between the developed nations and the underdeveloped nations and we have to follow out the ideas that were included in the Brandt Report which was debated some time ago in this House.</P>
      <P>In a sense, I feel that there are good things in both the original motion and in the amendment.  This is not the first time that this House has dealt with this or related factors and in December 1981 Professor John A. Murphy, who was then a Member of this House, and myself put forward a motion: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to declare unequivocally that Ireland will not join a military pact&rdquo;.  That was also a debate which turned out to be a debate on the issue of positive neutrality.  It is important that we should keep on standing by this policy and not let it be nibbled away or gradually eroded by people who say that we need to support one side or the other, or that it is important to us in the context of the EEC to be prepared to trade in our neutrality for this, that or the other, or indeed, even more temptingly, by people who suggest to us that we may have to trade in this policy in exchange for a united Ireland, which puts a difficult choice in front of us.  We should not allow ourselves to be put into a position of choosing between these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that this kind of policy, this policy of positive neutrality, of &ldquo;anti-warism&rdquo; has a very respectable history in Ireland and it goes back much further than <Col N="181" /> the beginning of the State.  Theoretically one can say that we could pursue a policy of neutrality as a State only from 1922 onwards or, indeed, maybe even from 1938 onwards when the British evacuated the various ports and so on.  If we look back into our own history there are several threads which come together in this, the reason why we feel the way we do about world affairs nowadays.  There were in the past about three aspects of Ireland's international involvement before we were a State on our own, as it were.  The first of these, perhaps, was our missionary activities in which we involved ourselves in the underdeveloped world, in various other countries of the world through our own mission, through our missionary religious activities, and by that means we learnt a great deal about how other people lived and the needs of the less well off countries of the world and we created a kind of sympathy between ourselves and, say, the countries in Africa who even nowadays very often prefer to have Irish consultants and so on advising them rather than consultants from a country in Europe that they know is committed to some particular side in the Cold War as it were.  I think this was one of the threads.  Another thread was our support for anyone who was an enemy of Britain because we felt that they were friends of ours, and this is something which went on through the centuries but which has now been overtaken by history.</P>
    <P>The third and perhaps the most important aspect in connection with this motion is that the real ancestor of our present feelings about neutrality is that we have a general sort of nationalist unwillingness to become involved in imperial wars. There were numbers of imperial wars in the past, carried out by England but by other countries as well, and we rejected this particular type of war and we still do so.  In this connection I would like to quote from a pamphlet written by Wolfe Tone in 1790.  He wrote a pamphlet referring to the danger of Ireland becoming involved in a war between Britain and Spain.  This pamphlet was entitled &ldquo;An Enquiry: How far Ireland is bound as of right to embark in the impending contest <Col N="182" /> on the side of Great Britain&rdquo;.  He pointed out that with us the question was not who was wrong or who was right.  He said that ours were discussions of a very different nature, to foster and cherish a growing trade, to cultivate and civilise a yet unpolished people, to obliterate the impression of ancient religious feuds, to watch with incessant and anxious care the cradle of an infant constitution.  These are our duties and these are indispensable.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the duties listed here by Wolfe Tone are, in fact, still with us.  We still have to eliminate the impression of ancient religious views.  We still have to guard the cradle of our infant constitution. We still should concentrate on doing this for ourselves without becoming involved in imperialist wars.</P>
    <P>We saw this feeling arising in the nationalist attitude of Sinn Féin to the Boer War in South Africa where there was the wish not to become involved in what they saw as an imperialist war; and again in our neutrality in World War II, in our refusal to join NATO, which was connected with the position with regard to the Six Counties but was not entirely due to that, I would suggest.  Our policy of neutrality throughout the years has not been just a matter of ideology or a matter of mere Government policy, it is firmly rooted in our history and in our feelings as a nation.</P>
    <P>There have been times recently when one has felt that this policy is being nibbled away.  There are newspaper articles, there are interviews with various leading people, NATO military men, different kinds of experts on foreign affairs, in inverted commas, who are trying one way or another in a subtle fashion to push us into the nuclear camp.  We need eternal vigilance to make sure that this does not happen to us, particularly when it comes in the guise of people telling us: Well, after all, we support the Christian way of life and, therefore, our hearts are on one side, our hearts are obviously going to be on the side of the West, because they are supporting the Christian way of life.  I cannot see what can be more supportive of the Christian way of life than a total rejection of nuclear weapons and a seeking after peace on all sides.  I cannot see <Col N="183" /> how one can argue that the preparation of a nuclear holocaust can be part of the Christian way of life.  To me the people who are seeking, not only as Senator O'Leary said, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but to progress the dismantling of nuclear weapons, are the true Christians.  We must at all costs resist any efforts to push us into a nuclear camp of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>I would also feel, as I have said, that we need to couple this, as is suggested in the amendment to the motion, with the development of the Third World so as to end the North-South disparity as well as the East-West conflict.  It is true, of course, that we, in common with all other countries in the developed world, are suffering very badly from a recession. Nevertheless the difference between our standards of living and our way of life and that of many of the countries in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world, the countries where we see not only famine and starvation but also oppression, is really extremely marked.  We cannot evade our duty to try to do something about this, to try to evolve development policies that will end this kind of disparity or at least work towards its ending.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would like to support the motion, as amended, but I would have preferred had they not cut out the phrase about non-violent action as a form of resistance, because I feel that we can be a non-violent example to the rest of the world if we continue in our policy of rejecting nuclear arms and pursuing a policy of positive neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this subject.  I do not want to go over the ground that other speakers have gone over.  The reason for the amendment was the inference in the original resolution that there is a war in Ireland, which would be quite a dangerous decision for this House to make or to agree that somebody else had made it on our behalf.  It was because of that that the Leader of the House and myself decided that it would be proper that the House should discuss the whole area of our neutrality, <Col N="184" /> our positive attitude to a continuing role of neutrality and a commitment from the Government to support development policy in the Third World.  It was a reasonable way to approach the resolution which had been moved by Senator Robb and Senator Ryan.  I was certainly glad of the opportunity which was given to us by both of these Senators to have this House express an opinion as to how we feel.</P>
      <P>The great powers in the world are progressing down the road to a nuclear holocaust which, if it happens, is likely to affect all of us.  If we maintain a positive role of neutrality, not taking part in any of the requirements of NATO or any other military alliance, the most we can hope for is that we would not become a target, deliberately or accidentally, for nuclear attack.  Because of our stand on neutrality from the foundation of the State our voice is a very important voice. It has been used with tremendous force in assemblies such as the United Nations where we are listened to because of the power we carry as a small nation which has promoted the interests of underprivileged people thoughout the world and the fact that we are pacifist in our attitudes to war, nuclear war in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, who is with us tonight, has had several opportunities of spelling out in detail in this House his particular attitude and his interest in this field for which he has shown a tremendous enthusiasm since assuming the office of Minister of State in that Department.  His voice is recognised in many areas throughout the world as one representing a neutral nation such as ours.  Naturally, we in the Labour Party will never be satisfied with the amount of money that we can make available to underprivileged people.  Taking our limited resources, certainly the oppressed nations of the world must know that there is a commitment on our part to sustain to the highest possible degree the level of support that we would give to people who are suffering and in underprivileged conditions in parts of the world, not because nations are in a nuclear race with one another, the East <Col N="185" /> or the West, but because of the overemphasis of the available capital that they have which is used for military purposes. The demands of these poorer nations get ignored by the major countries in the world, and that is a tragedy.  That is why I feel the poorer nations, particularly in South America, could be helped in a much more positive way by people if they did not spend so much money on the arms race.</P>
    <P>Several excellent documents were prepared on this subject by many leading people in the CND movement. The Irish trade union movement have a very positive view on our neutrality.  In the twenties the Cosgrave Government endeavoured to pursue a policy of neutrality within the British Commonwealth, and later Mr. de Valera adopted a positive role on neutrality.  All Governments since have followed that line of policy, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement goes back much further than the foundation of the State as we understand it.  It goes back further than 1922.  At the outbreak of the 1914 war the executive of the Irish Council of Trade Unions and the Labour Party issued a proclamation, &ldquo;Why should Ireland starve?&rdquo; in which it declared that &ldquo;a war for the aggrandisement of the capitalist class has been declared&rdquo; and warned the women of Ireland!  &ldquo;It is you who will suffer most by this foreign war.  It is the sons you reared at your bosom that will be sent to be mangled by shot and torn by shell, it is your fathers, husbands and brothers whose corpses will pave the way to glory for an Empire which despises you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude of the trade union movement and the attitude of Connolly to the then Irish Parliamentary Party when they were pledging support for the British war effort.  Indeed, when Connolly set off for America at that time he had a banner stretched across the front of Liberty Hall with the slogan, &ldquo;We serve neither King nor Kaiser.&rdquo;  That attitude of the trade union movement would be confirmed today in even more vocal terms.  If there was ever any doubt about our attitude to positive neutrality, <Col N="186" /> the trade union movement would be to the forefront in ensuring that the strongest possible lobby would be launched in the defence of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Spectacular figures have been quoted which are spent by the large and powerful nations on armaments.  They show that 15 million people are engaged throughout the world in providing military goods and services.  That is a colossal number of people engaged in providing war materials or machines for the destruction of mankind.  They show that a total of half a million people such as world scientists and engineers are involved in military areas and half a million qualified professional research and development workers are engaged in military programmes which currently consume $35 billion every year from world resources.  If so much money was not spent in the area of armaments, look at the benefits to mankind throughout the underprivileged parts of this world in food, in assistance and in health services.  People are starving because the nations who can afford to look after them do not do so.  As a socialist I feel that richer nations should look after poorer nations.  People are suffering. Because of this vast expenditure of public funds on armaments the poorer sections are neglected.</P>
    <P>There is another statistic which is important in the context of the United States: 50 per cent of all their taxation is recycled not into making social progress but directly into military funding.  As a small nation we will have to look at that. We are friendly with America.  We have generations of historic connections with that country.  We will have an opportunity in the near future, if the President of America visits us, to extend to him the courtesy his office entitles him to, but the opportunity should be availed of to express our concern about this policy and that of his administration on the whole question of the arms race.</P>
    <P>Naturally the same would apply, and much more vehemently, to the Eastern bloc.  Much of the information coming from there may be classified but from what we can gather, the USSR spent even a larger proportion of the money available to them on the arms race, instead of <Col N="187" /> looking after people who are obviously in need.  They spend money on armaments for status and to threaten the other side who already have a finger near a button with the fact that they have a finger near a button also.  What worries me is that nations like ourselves are between the two buttons and people can fall between two stools.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a deployment of nuclear missiles in Britain is a frightening concept for us.  We must compliment the women of Greenham Common who, over a number of years, have dedicated their energies to protesting about the deployment of that kind of missile so close to large areas of population.  If one consults with our civil defence organisations and looks at the possible target points for a nuclear attack in Britain, they are so close that it is inevitable that we as a nation would suffer here in the event of an attack.  I am glad that in the coming week through the national media the civil defence people will be alerting people to what they could do in the event of a catastrophe like that happening.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Irish people should know we have people, voluntary and otherwise, in civil defence who have a specific programme to help people in that unfortunate situation.  Please God it will never happen, but it is appropriate that we should be aware of it.  They are about to launch a campaign which will confirm that they have a progressive programme which will be of benefit to ordinary people in the event of somebody in the east or the west losing his head and pressing buttons that could destroy half the world.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that because people have deployed nuclear missiles wars have been prevented.  In the 35 years since the last use of an atomic weapon, there have been outbreaks of violence all over the world, but there has not been any nuclear war, I contend that the deployment of these missiles created not an atmosphere of peace but an atmosphere of fear. Whether people will over-react in an atmosphere of fear worries me.  I am pleased that the Government are following the line this House has expressed on <Col N="188" /> numerous occasions in the past.  The Government have reiterated it.  That view has been expressed going back to Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. de Valera and the trade union movement in various forums throughout the world.  Our stance on this issue is recognised.</P>
    <P>We have to be extremely careful as a member of the European Community. The majority of the members are closely associated with NATO.  There can be no doubt about our attitude.  Our members out there should be in no doubt whatsoever about the attitude of the parties here and the Government's stand on this issue. That could be dangerous.  It almost happened in recent times and I was extremely worried about it.</P>
    <P>The amendment is reasonable.  It covers the spirit of the original motion without getting into the area of a war being declared in this country which we know is not true.  There are some minority sections on this side of the Border.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, although I feel that you are perhaps being a little generous as I understand a quarter of an hour is the time allotted for summing up.  Am I correct?  Secondly, I wish to thank Senator Ferris for being so generous as to take his seat and allow me to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Coalition parties felt disposed to amend the original motion proposed by Senator Brendan Ryan and myself, and although the overwhelming majority of speakers could not accept the full implications of the original motion, I would very much like, on behalf of both Senator Ryan, an expectant father, and myself, to thank Senators for their extremely constructive criticism of the proposal which we brought before the House, and to thank them also for their interesting and, at times, provocative and <Col N="189" /> informative contributions.  Even though Senators have chosen not to accept the motion in its original form, and even though some, at least, will be voting in favour of the amendment, there has been a very good spirit throughout this debate as one might expect in a debate which not only deals with the local situation in Ireland but tries to give relevance to the Irish situation throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We are both very grateful for the generous allotment of time, a Chathaoirligh, given to this motion.  Perhaps in view of the comments that have been made by many Senators, it is not altogether surprising. We were both conscious of the fact that we presented the Seanad with a banquet of motions and Senators barely had time to enjoy one single course in the banquet so presented.  However, this leads me on to another query.  Have we allowed enough time and enough occasions to debate motions?  There are 52 weeks in the year and we certainly do not have 52 motions.  It is an opportunity for Senators to debate a wide range of issues, to get publicity for them, and to promote discussion of them.  I welcome such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>Because of the impossibility of finding time to discuss all the various elements in this motion throughout the course of a year in the Seanad, it is, perhaps, just as well that we endeavoured to put too much in to it and to embrace too much as a result.  The issues encompass some of the most important matters of our time, such as nuclearism, both in the form of the arms race to oblivion and also in the form of nuclear pollution such as we have seen so well followed up and described in &ldquo;Windscale Pollution of the Irish Sea&rdquo;. The Windscale pollution is only one aspect of pollution with its intra- and international implications.</P>
    <P>Only this week we read in the Sunday newspapers in Northern Ireland of hundreds of tons of toxic chemical waste being dumped into the bar of Belfast Lough.  We now have the Irish Sea being polluted from both the western and the eastern side of it.  As I emphasised in proposing this motion two weeks ago, that also has implications for the food chain of fish life in the Irish Sea.  Of <Col N="190" /> course wherever pollution occurs for the food chain of animal life it ultimately gets into the human food chain.  Not only do we have parthenogenic and genetic concern, particularly in relation to the effects of nuclear radiation, but we also have the toxic effect on vulnerable cells and organs such as the liver and the kidneys.</P>
    <P>Pollution moves us into the whole area of ecological constraint to technological growth, and the need to develop new attitudes which are consistently pro-life in earnest, and not selectively so.  It is a matter of a new attitude of mind to cope with the new dimension and the new propensity for self-destruction which mankind is now launching upon itself through the dark side of our nature to which Senator Higgins referred, and which refers to the dark side of technological development when so much could be expected of it for the benefit of mankind.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins developed his theme by appealing for a changed mentality or, as he put it, an integrated rather than a fragmented nature of approach.  Like other Senators, he emphasised the irony of poverty and pollution side by side with plenty, the pleading of so many people in the world on the one hand and the hoarding by the lucky few on the other.  In this respect while President Reagan chose to allocate &mdash; and let me say this for the benefit of the press who quoted me wrongly on the last occasion &mdash; $650 billion for the new MX system of missiles, $40 billion, as was pointed out by Senator Ryan, would be enough to meet the basic needs of the deprived people of the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge introduced a warning about the pollution of outer space through militarism and militarisation. Let us not divert our attention too exclusively to nuclearism.  There are many other things we should be concerned about &mdash; the potential development of accuracy for destruction of laser beams and such like.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the remarks made by Senator Hanafin.  He stressed a very important point &mdash; speaking from the heart as he always does &mdash; when he emphasised the effect Russian youth had on his daughter when visiting <Col N="191" /> that great country.  He referred to the horror that youth have in Russia just as much as they have in the West for the potential of these ghastly weapons. Someone else emphasised that while we are free to protest in the West, they are not free to do so in the East.  He emphasised the peace loving as well as the peace-making challenge to people such as ourselves and he alluded to Mother Teresa of Calcutta.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers chose to emphasise &mdash; with a point which was picked up in the press &mdash; that the victors would be those who had died in a nuclear holocaust, that the ones who survived would be the real losers.  Senator Eoin Ryan dealt with the Russian dimension, too, when he suggested that there was a lot of myth perpetrated in the West about the potential for nuclear violence on behalf of the Russian people and that they are just as scared of America as America seems to be scared of them and that we should consider this when we are dealing with the whole matter of East-West relationships. Senator McGonagle also emphasised this point.  He said there was a great fear in Russia of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs making an absolute commitment to neutrality on behalf of the State.  He gave a graphic account of the £1 million spent per minute on arms, and he indicated that this could be spent on Third World development and for the use of the poor and the needy.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan, speaking from the heart, reminded us, as she always does, that just as County Antrim is in Ireland so is County Clare, and that we speak for the whole country when we speak about these matters because they affect us all. I was glad to hear Senator Bulbulia emphasise that there was a danger of making a sacred cow out of neutrality. That brings us on to what we mean by positive neutrality.  I must apologise to Senator Fallon as I was called out during his speech but I look forward to reading it.  Senator O'Leary confirmed what we realised early on, that the motion was <Col N="192" /> perhaps too ambitious, although as I have said we do not make any apology for it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the war in Ireland, however, I must emphasise that having lived in it and close to it for the past 15 years, it may not be a declared war, but there is a simmering undeclared civil war situation in the North of Ireland.  It has been allowed to persist because neither London nor Dublin have been prepared to face up together in relation to Northern Ireland to the implications for them of the resolution of a conflict which they failed &mdash; and I emphasise it again &mdash; to resolve completely some 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>Again, I appeal to the press to make a correction.  In extrapolating the casualty figures for Northern Ireland into Britain, we are talking in terms of 75,000 dead and three quarters of a million wounded if these figures were transferred to Britain. If that is not a war, I do not know what is.  On the night before last the hopes of 175 people were blown out when they lost their jobs as their factory was blown apart.  Last night, within six miles of my own home, three people were killed.  There is now a wall in Belfast that separates the two sides.  Unless we come to grips with this fact, we are doomed in Northern Ireland to continue to go round in circles, participating in a debate in a climate of unreality.  Until we face up to the reality of the unresolved conflict in relation to Northern Ireland between Dublin and London, we in Northern Ireland will be unable to break out from the trap into which we have been pushed for far too long.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to non-violent action, which was the other contentious issue, I am glad Senator McGuinness dealt with this.  It is time we questioned and threw this challenge to people who perpetrate violent acts.  A violent act &mdash; and I speak from very close personal experience of people who have been involved &mdash; does not just affect those against whom it is directed.  It also affects the perpetrators both in their spirit and in their minds.  Violence is defined elsewhere as the physical, sexual or psychological penetration of one human being by another against their will, and force is the threat to use such violence.  It matters <Col N="193" /> not whether one is wearing a uniform or not.  You cannot change the definition.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to emphasise that a uniform confers legitimacy which helps many people to live with the result of violent acts they have been obliged to do in the course of duty.  Once we talk of legitimacy, however, we are faced with awkward questions in a country where there is, as yet, no consensus, where we have not as yet come to an accommodation which would give the forces of law and order the legitimacy of acting on behalf of a united people.</P>
    <P>If we are to move towards a non-violent society, we urgently need a constructive political solution to sectarianism in the North, to partition on this island. Only then will we start to get rid of the serious psychological and social problems associated with the guilt of violence which comes to us from our past.  Positive neutrality is something that starts in one's own heart.  It is to do with peace and it is to do with returning to the hearths in our homes, or, as Schumacher has called it, becoming a home-comer and leaving the ford stampede.</P>
    <P>Positive neutrality should be seen, therefore, as an expression of Ireland's message to the world.  We are uniquely placed in relation to the Third World, having suffered from colonialism, and having been part of the colonial problem. We have a network of missionaries, to which people have alluded, around the world who relate to what is best in the tradition of service among the Irish people.  We have a young generation who require a new lead.  Prepare them to meet the youth of the world to promote an anti-nuclear, peace-making pro-life global society.  Prepare them to do this by opening up the languages of the world to <Col N="194" /> our Irish school children so that they can go out once again as the new missionaries in the technological age to promote the new technology for constructive purposes and to persuade the youth in the rest of the world that we have had enough destruction in our time.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senator Ferris for his generosity in allowing me a few extra minutes.  I thank him also for highlighting for us the problem of how capital gets caught up in militarism, and how we will need a new politic to divert capital employed for military activity towards the needs of a starving Third World.  He referred indirectly to the button brains on the two sides.  Button brains are a symptom of the disease which I discovered two years ago of advanced nuclear sclerosis which has affected the aged men and the middle-aged woman who inhabit the Kremlin, the White House and 10 Downing Street.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity to support the women of Greenham Common.  Those women have stood out for something which, if the world is to survive, will be recognised as a turning point in history.  Therefore, as I conclude I am disappointed that Senators have not come to terms with our original motion, but I am glad that in the terms they have chosen to discuss it, we have had such a constructive and such a generous debate. I do not intend, therefore, to oppose the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Motion, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 February 1984.</P>
