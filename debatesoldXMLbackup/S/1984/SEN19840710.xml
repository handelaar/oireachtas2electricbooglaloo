      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1 is purely formal; the matter was debated last week on the expediency motion.  In regard to No. 4, it is proposed to take the Second Stage only today and to take the Committee Stage after lunch tomorrow.  In that connection I would suggest that even when it comes to 8 o'clock, if the Second Stage is nearly completed we should sit beyond 8 o'clock to complete the Second Stage.  Tomorrow it is proposed to take the Criminal Justice Bill, Second Stage in part, in the morning and, as I have already mentioned, the Committee Stage of the Misuse of Drugs Bill in the afternoon.</P>

On the procedure for reporting back from Joint Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; I am thinking particularly of the Joint Services Committee who deal with the restaurant &mdash; could we be assured that there would be a facility afforded to us to discuss the findings of that committee?  As a Member of this House I read about it in a newspaper. Yet there is no facility whereby I can make a contribution on a matter about which there is widespread public concern, particularly in regard to subvention of the restaurant by the taxpayer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 10 to 12, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>I have read and re-read virtually everything that has been said in support of the allocation of £600,000 toward the renovations of the King's Inns.  I might repeat that I do not think anybody is arguing about the aesthetic and architectural value of that building.  I would associate myself with something Senator Magner said, that is, that if it is to be a Philistine in these days to suggest that we reorder our priorities in the light of current realities, then there is no doubt in my mind that I shall be classified as a Philistine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of this recommendation that need to be addressed.  The first needing to be disposed of is the suggestion that, because previous administrations gave a commitment, we are bound thereby.  Clearly that is not a decision that can in any way be <Col N="988" /> sustained because commitments of both the previous Coalition administration and the intervening Fianna Fáil one have been broken for what various Governments saw to be very good reasons such as the changing state of public finances, the need to give good example to the public in terms of the use of funds, the need to get the public well attuned to the fact that funds that come up for disposal by the Government are now extremely restricted, are under extreme pressure and cannot be in any way controlled.  In that context the question of the allocation of a sum of £600,000 to the renovation of a building would have to be examined with great consideration of and sensitivity to the perceptions, the feelings and, above all, the needs of so many other groups in our society.</P>
    <P>One thing which has not been answered in either the Dáil or the Seanad is the question not of the need for the work to be done but as to why this need is apparently infinitely more important than a long list of other needs that all of us could produce to every Minister in Government of various more or less deserving groups.  That is the issue which has not been addressed in the debate and which needs to be addressed fundamentally. Why is this more important than so many other areas?  What is so important in this project that the feelings and the perceptions of the public at large must be ignored?  There is no Member of this House, I would respectfully suggest, who is not aware now that public opinion generally is, to say the least, somewhat taken aback at the idea of the Oireachtas directly or indirectly financing the renovation of the premises of what is publicly recognised and identified as a wealthy profession.</P>
    <P>I would like to address some of the arguments that I have been given to sustain this point.  The suggestion has come before us again and again that somehow this is a benevolent society providing free or relatively inexpensive access to third level education.  I do not think that the public are in the least persuaded by that argument.  If that body had asked for incorporation in the State sector of third level education, had sought assistance under the State's umbrella of third level <Col N="989" /> education, had, for instance, to come under the aegis of the National Council for Educational Awards and have their awards awarded by them and had all their procedures and regulations scrutinised by an external agency, then I for one would cast a more favourable eye on their benevolence and would be less inclined to suspect that what they are running is a very effective closed shop whereby they determine the rules for admission and for continuing in practice and whether you are fit to be a member of that profession.</P>
    <P>There is at the basis of this discussion a very important symbolic value.  In a time of extreme economic exigency, many people are suffering continuously from what both major parties in this House recognise as the necessity for financial rectitude.  Many voluntary charitable organisations are being stretched on the one hand by the growing demands of increasing poverty and on the other hand by the increasing restrictiveness of public funds.  Many groups are beginning to observe for themselves the effect of financial circumstances on marriage and, as the stress on marriage develops as a result of high unemployment, more and more of these problems come to legal advice centres and various other counselling groups all of whom are suffering from extreme financial hardship.  All of these people and groups therefore want to know why the Houses of the Oireachtas will decide that £600,000 of money available apparently for the Oireachtas to dispose of should go to this project rather than to the hundred or two hundred other projects.  A failure to address that issue as to why the needs of those premises are so much more important than all the others, is effectively saying that we here have fundamentally different priorities from the rest of Irish society.  That is why I move this amendment, to indicate that priorities should be different fundamentally.  I will be very interested to hear why this project was given the priority it has received.</P>
    <P>Let us forget about the decisions of other administrations.  They do not hold water here.  There are ample cases where previous commitments have not been <Col N="990" /> found binding.  Let us not hear about benevolent organisations.  That is not the central issue.  The central issue is the decision to allocate over half a million pounds to the renovation of one premises which are used, in the eyes of the public, by a relatively privileged profession.  That is what the public fail to understand and in it many people see a very effective symbol of the detachment of both Houses of the Oireachtas from and their irrelevance to the sufferings of an enormous number of people in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I explained on Second Stage, the Bill is providing the amount of £600,000 for the King's Inns project.  The Government in deciding this decided to honour the commitment given by previous administrations.  Substantially the same provision was contained in the Funds of Suitors Bill, 1981 which passed all Stages in the Seanad on 8 October 1981.  It was welcomed by those Senators who contributed to the debate on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that what is involved here is State intervention to ensure the future preservation of one of the finest pieces of architecture in our capital city.  The Government accept that the present occupants of the one-third of the building which is not owned by the State have not got the resources required to have the urgent and major renovation work carried out.  It is important to realise that the question of State intervention would arise in these circumstances regardless of who occupied the building. The work will be done by the Office of Public Works in tandem with their work on the two-thirds of the building which is State-owned.  The work which may be carried out by the OPW is limited in relation to both the amount which can be expended and time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various people in this House, in the other House and outside the Houses have commented that the Society of the King's Inns is an alien and elitist organisation. Critics who express such views either seek to mislead or are misinformed themselves about the facts.  The graduates of the King's Inns include Wolfe Tone, <Col N="991" /> Robert Emmet, Thomas Davis, Daniel O'Connell, Isaac Butt, Henry Grattan and Pádraig Pearse.  Since the State was founded, five graduates of the King's Inns, Mr. John A. Costello, Mr. Jack Lynch, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, Deputy Charles Haughey and Deputy Garret FitzGerald have occupied the office of Taoiseach.  The present leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste Deputy Dick Spring, and the previous leader, Deputy Michael O'Leary, were likewise graduates. There are also illustrious Members of this House and the other House who are graduates of King's Inns.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not doing a noble roll call of illustrious graduates of the King's Inns just for the sake of doing so. I am trying to illustrate that the Society of the King's Inns have been at the centre of Irish political life for many generations and are neither elitists nor alien to this country.  The King's Inns students are drawn from all walks of life.  They include people who have been teachers, nurses, gardaí, accountants, civil servants and people from many other fields such as insurance and journalism.  Seán Mac-Bride, for example, whom many people in this country admire, graduated from the King's Inns.</P>
    <P>There are three main reasons why I am bringing the proposal forward here. Firstly, it was a commitment given in 1981, and in reintroducing the Bill with additions it was appropriate that the commitment given and carried through all Stages in the Seanad should be fulfilled. Secondly, the King's Inns is one of the finest buildings we have in Dublin, and if this intervention is not made it will fall down, and I do not think that this city can afford the loss of another fine building. If it is not funded from the funds of suitors I cannot in all honesty tell the House that it will be funded from any other source, either private or public. The money has been used for the kind of project which would not be funded from another source and certainly this is one such project.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan making his contribution on Second Stage spoke about his own profession which, I gather from what he said, is the engineering profession. <Col N="992" /> We have many fine professions in this country, engineers, architects, dentists, doctors, barristers, solicitors, but who built Belfield?  Whose money paid for Belfield?  Whose money paid for UCC and UCG?  Whose money repairs it &mdash; only the taxpayers?  Whose money builds the colleges for the engineers, for example?  Whose money repairs the premises for engineers when they need repair &mdash; only the taxpayers?  Here we have a situation where we have a third level institution to which public funds are not allocated, the building is falling down; they educate students and if we do not intervene the building will fall down. We are saying that the funds of suitors is an appropriate source for allocation of funds for the preservation of this building. I do not think the Senator's argument stands up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week on Second Stage each member of my party expressed the gravest reservations about the specific allocation of this amount of money for the unkeep or repair of King's Inns.  We made it clear that we did not object to the actual spending of the money through the Office of the Public Works for which one of our colleagues, the Minister of State, has charge.  We objected on principle and on the basis of priority and last week on Second Stage there was no priority specifically mentioned in the Bill that would fundamentally meet the arguments put by members of my party in the House.  In fairness to the Minister, in subsection (3) (e) there was a vague reference to the provision of services for the legal aid system.  It was because of that that our party decided to put down an amendment specifically to have our priorities right and to designate this amount of money, which is mentioned in the section, for the civil legal aid system.  In the parliamentary party it is common knowledge that all the Senators expressed reservations and because we expressed such strong reservations to the Tánaiste and the other members of our party a meeting was arranged as a matter of urgency with the Minister for Justice who has responded to Senator Ryan's criticisms.  I am glad to put on the record of this House that arising <Col N="993" /> out of that meeting between the Tánaiste and Leader of our Party and the Minister, an agreement has been reached to set aside £400,000 from the residual funds arising from the Funds of Suitors Bill and that this money will be devoted exclusively to the improvement of civil legal aid services.  We would like the Minister to elaborate further on the exact details during the debate if possible because we would like as a party to ensure that that system would be sustained and continued by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  But it was a question of priorities for the Labour Party and with that commitment from the Tánaiste and the Minister we are satisfied that our fundamental objections and priorities have been met.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's amendment is an amendment to the whole section but it does not indicate specifically how he wants the money to be spent.  If we were deleting the section we would be specifically allocating the money to the civil legal aid system.  The Minister has now met us on that point.  So at the moment we have no objection to the money being spent on the preservation of what is, in fact, a minor classic building.  I said on Second Stage that the possibility of public ownership of this building should be pursued by the Minister and I still hold that view because there is something fundamentally wrong with a minor classic building being allowed to fall into such disrepair as it has fallen into without somebody taking responsibility.  The people who frequent it and use it and all the illustrious people who graduated from it in the past should have a commitment to it.  I am sure we could pursue that and still ensure that the investment of public money would be done in a rightful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to see that this is done. Although technically it is not public money, it is money that technically the public are accountable for and because of that the removal of this section would certainly not have met any of our wishes as it would leave it hanging in the air.  We were being most specific and because of <Col N="994" /> that we have secured an agreement for the actual preservation and improvement of the civil legal aid services.  I want to thank the Minister publicly for having met the Tánaiste and for giving the commitment that we were looking for.  I am quite sure that the Members present would like to make their own contributions also.  We presume that the Board of Works, who are a public body, will be actually doing the work and that it will be paid for by the State.  If that is the case, something useful will have come out of this whole debate and there will have been recognition by the Houses of the Oireachtas of the importance of the building.  We are serving notice on those people who are in the privileged position of being able to use the building that it must be maintained by them in future and, if not, a transfer of ownership must take place so that the State can look after the building properly.  For that reason it would be unwise of us to support the amendment suggested by Senator Ryan which would in fact just delete the section and not be specific on where the money should be spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Ryan was opening his speech on this section he in a sense answered his own case.  He said there are hundreds of things that could be done with this money and that anybody here could think of other and better things that could be done with it.  Of course that is true.  If any one of the hundreds of things that could be done with this money was put before the Seanad as a means of availing of the money, there would be people in the Seanad who would say that that is not what should be done with the money; that one of the other hundreds of things should be done.  So no matter what is proposed as a useful object for spending this money on, as a worthy purpose for it there are some who will say they can think of better ways of spending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, hundreds of ways in which this money could be spent.  This is just one way and I support this particular way.  There is a very strong argument for using it this way.  But I do not deny <Col N="995" /> that there are other worthy purposes to which the money could be put.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has acknowledged that it is an outstanding building and that it would be a pity to see it collapse.  It is not merely from the aesthetic point of view that it would be a pity to see it collapse, because if it collapsed another building would have to be built to accommodate the activities taking place there now.  The State would have to erect a building for the Registry of Deeds.  They use approximately two-thirds of the building.  There would have to be a building for the education of the legal profession.  At the moment this is being done there without any cost to the State.  If that building collapsed, in the same way as the State takes responsibility for so many other professions and so many other aspects of education, it would have to do the same there.  That would cost the taxpayer far more money.  It was pointed out the last time that part of the building is now regularly used as a court.  Again, that is something that the State would have to make other provision for.  Senator Ryan and possibly some other Members or members of the public have some idea that this is a building where members of the Bar disport themselves.  That is completely fanciful and contrary to the facts. The fact is that the average member of the Bar rarely, if ever, visits that building. On average he might go up there once or twice a year.  It is used for the purposes I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The only involvement a member of the Bar has is that approximately 10 per cent of the fee which he pays to the Law Library to enable him to use its facilities goes to the upkeep of the Inns.  So he subsidises the upkeep and the maintenance of the Inns.  That is the only involvement he has in it.</P>
    <P>The building serves very useful, essential purposes, and I believe this grant is something which is badly needed.  I support the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the sentiments put forward by Senator Brendan Ryan when he proposed this amendment. My contribution on Second Stage and those of the other members of the <Col N="996" /> Labour Party, underlined the collective feeling we had, and still have and the sense of outrage we feel at the fact that public money should be spent in this way at a time when each of us in our constituencies is faced with genuine cases of deprivation and the lack of State funds to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Brendan Ryan on the net effect of his amendment which would simply leave £600,000 in the funds of suitors.  The deletion of section 3 (b) would simply take that money away from the purpose outlined in that section and leave it in the funds of suitors.  I would be much happier to see it spent.</P>
      <P>The problem for us in the Labour Party was that we were met with the apparent consensus and unanimity of the two major parties about this issue.  We saw that the money would be spent and, therefore, were obliged to set our own priorities.  What we set before us was to achieve a proper funding of a free legal aid system.  I am pleased with the outcome of the stand we have taken.  An agreement has been made as a result of the Tánaiste meeting the Minister for Justice whereby a sum of £400,000 is to be set aside specifically for the funding of the free legal aid system.  The situation whereby the moneys allocated were simply the residue left over when everybody else had got their cut was totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable, for instance, the question of the new Children's Court with the obvious possibility of overruns on that.  For that reason we must be happy with our lot and accept that since the money will be spent on the King's Inns at least we put up a good fight and won something for the benefit of the general public.  It does not placate my conscience or the consciences of most of the Labour Party.  I am a little taken aback at the list of the famous the Minister rattled off when responding to Senator Brendan Ryan's opening proposition. It is hardly a roll call of the common man.  Every name given would support the contention that it is a school for the élite.</P>

      <P>As regards his point that all other professions are trained in schools financed by the public purse, it must be remembered that these are all owned by the State whereas this institution is not.  This is a private institution.  If it was handed over to the State my view would be totally different and the Labour Party objections to spending the money in this way would be overcome.</P>
      <P>I reluctantly accept that the Labour Party got the best deal open to it and it is with the greatest reluctance that I see money being given, albeit after other moneys have been dispersed, to the King's Inns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to join the debate on this amendment because Senator Eoin Ryan has said a good deal of what I would want to say and what I have already said on Second Stage.  I intervene to correct Senator Howlin.  The Minister indicated that other professions were educated in buildings which were largely provided and repaired by the State.  Senator Howlin agreed but said they were owned by the State.  The universities are not owned by the State.  They are, happily, subvented by the State and my university is grateful for the fact that its historical buildings which, like the King's Inns, are architecturally important, have received a great deal of money from the State in order to preserve them.  However, there is no way Trinity College is owned by the State. Exactly the same applies to the National University of Ireland.  The State money put into those buildings does not constitute ownership.  The State owns two-thirds of the King's Inns which is more than can be said about the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards privilege or non-privilege, anyone who enters third level education or any of the professions is, to some extent, privileged.  In many of our professions we have a more open entry system than in other countries but to some extent all professions are privileged and that applies to the legal profession. I accept that the Minister's list of famous <Col N="998" /> graduates of the Inns includes people whom I would not say came from privileged backgrounds.  There are those among us who come from less privileged backgrounds and they are much more part of the common man.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of money to the Civil Legal Aid Board.  As will be clear from my speech on Second Stage, I attach a great deal of importance to this.  There is need for more civil legal and centres.  The £400,000 can be spent in a capital way rather than feeding the scheme's normal expenses over the years. We need more solicitors.  We should try to avoid spending more money than is necessary on the administration of the scheme.  Quite enough is spent on that already.  From time to time the existing centres have to close to the public through lack of personnel.</P>
    <P>As regards the Coolock law centre and the Government civil legal aid centres, I support the giving of money to the Coolock centre.  I should like to see the present legal aid centres become more community centres in helping people to understand the law and educating them about their rights and so on.  When one is told that the Coolock law centre can be run for £40,000 and is extremely economic by comparison with the Civil Legal Aid Board centres it should be remembered that the Coolock centre constantly employ counsel for their cases and no counsel who appears for them is paid a penny.  The Coolock centre can survive on less money because their barristers are not paid and because they have only one extremely overworked solicitor.  The previous lady and the present lady are trying to cope with enormous workloads. The standard of service they can provide is thereby lowered.  I am not saying that there is anything wrong with either of these two solicitors.  They are highly efficient and very committed people but one person can only do so much.  As far as I can see they work 23½ hours a day.  The kind of service that can be provided through a centre run on that amount of money is limited.  It would be a good idea if another solicitor for the Coolock law centre could be employed or if another centre were set up on the south side of <Col N="999" /> Dublin or in a rural area.  This could be financed out of the £400,000.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that when the whole civil legal aid system was brought in an agreement was made between the Department of Justice and the Bar Council as to the fees to be paid to barristers for appearing in civil legal aid cases.  One of the clauses of this agreement was that the Bar Council agreed that barristers would accept a level of fees in these cases which was considerably below the commercial rate of fee because they felt that it was part of the service of the profession to the community. It was felt that it would, to some extent, replace the cases which were done on a charity basis.  I am not saying that all barristers are marvellous because they accepted this kind of situation.  I am, however, suggesting that in other professions it might not be all that common. Is there, for instance, a stated agreement with the Department of the Environment that civil engineers work for less than their normal fee because they happen to be putting up a bridge in a poorer district, or anything of that sort? When we look at the civil legal aid system, various people are putting in a certain amount of service to the community and that is a good thing and something which should be continued.  When we go to spend our £400,000 on the civil legal aid scheme, it should be spent in such a way that it will, to the greatest possible extent, enlarge the service that is available to the people who so badly need it.</P>

      <P>There is no place for amateurs any more.  When the Minister was giving a list of illustrious names, I remembered a remark which Seán Lemass used to make, &ldquo;It would be a poor day for Ireland if the Houses of the Oireachtas were peopled by experts&rdquo;.  It looks as if they are becoming peopled by experts.  On a more serious note, much has been said about minor classics.  Previous Governments, not just the present one, cut down on renovation grants and local authority repairs.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  To me, my house is a minor classic, because otherwise I would be foolish to pay a mortgage on it. It is where I live and is important to me. Thousands of houses around the country require work to be done and the owners cannot afford it.  Should they try to have their houses classified and appeal to the Minister on the basis that they are minor classics?  I would not have minded so much if the King's Inns came under the same strictures as community associations or councils on a pound for pound basis.  I thought that fair.  They were getting this money without any input.  It has become a college, an institution, a university, all sorts of things in the last couple of weeks &mdash; things which I never knew.  I suppose it will be open to the public next week, with guided tours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of the situation as regards the Labour Party is that it was a compromise. We were extremely concerned that the Bill as at present did not seem to give any guarantees in terms of quantifiable amounts for civil legal aid.  That was one of our main concerns, our objections, as Senator Howlin put it very well, to the Funds of Suitors Bill in regard to the £600,000 to the King's Inns.  I appreciate that the Minister listened to what we had to say and I hope he will indicate a specific sum, for which I should be grateful. His Funds of Suitors Bill is an imaginative one.  He has taken all the money whereas before it was simply the interest.  In that case, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the Youth Employment Scheme, civil legal aid and now, unfortunately, the King's <Col N="1001" /> Inns all benefit together.  Our objections to the latter remain but nonetheless we are glad that when legislation such as this comes before the House there is a Minister who is prepared to be reasonable and to listen to the case which we put forward.</P>

      <P>Like other Members of the House, I feel that there are many other deserving projects which perhaps should be helped under this Bill, but it would be impossible to please everybody. There is serious decay in this very important building of the King's Inns.  The State has a responsibility for the preservation of all buildings of architectural merit but, in addition, in this case the State owns two-thirds of the composite buildings.  It seems that the State has a direct responsibility for the maintenance of two-thirds of the building.  I asked on Second Stage what exactly that ownership meant.  Is the State paying rent for any portion? However, the Minister did not answer that question.  I must accept the Minister's words that the Society of the King's Inns are unable to contribute the other third, although strictly they should.  If this amendment is passed there will be a further delay in providing funds, and further deterioration.  At the end of the day, the State will still have to provide the funds for the maintenance of the building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, during Second Stage debate, Senator O'Leary made the point that we are making choices about how money should be spent.  We are talking here about a very small amount of money in contrast with the amounts in the Government's current expenditure programme &mdash; £2.8 million, which is minuscule in comparison with £5,000 million.  It may seem strange that we in the Labour Party decided to make an issue of how this £2.8 million should be spent.  It is quite simple and quite straightforward.  When the idea of funding the King's Inns came first in 1981, it was in the context then of Government commitment at that time to introduce a comprehensive civil legal aid programme nationally.  Now, three years later, we were concerned that while some progress <Col N="1002" /> had been made, we are still a long way away from a comprehensive programme of civil legal aid.  Indeed, some portion of the civil legal aid programme was under severe pressure because of the financial and manpower resources at present available. In my case, I was very concerned, as were others, at the fact that the most outstanding neighbourhood law centre in the country, in Coolock, which costs a minuscule amount of £40,000 a year to run, was under threat of closure and had been consistently over the last two years, despite the best efforts of all concerned to secure that small amount of money so that people in the north city area could have access to law through the only means available to them.</P>
      <P>We examined this Bill and saw that given the nature of the fund it is probably appropriate that the money be spent on matters related to culture and to law in the general sense.  It is a small amount of money.  Given its nature, the broad areas that the Minister has designated for it are correct &mdash; the arts, culture and the law. However, when we were faced with the reality that the civil legal system is breaking down for want of a very small amount of money in the centre in Coolock and, indeed, in the case of the whole scheme and then saw that it was proposed to give £600,000 for the restoration of the King's Inns building, we were faced with a very clear choice.  We in our group had no option but to choose civil legal aid, despite the fact that we are aware and conscious of the value and merits of this building and the need to retain and maintain it for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Leary said, we had to make a choice at that stage and we made it.  We were prepared to put down our amendment to substitute civil legal aid for the King's Inns for the expenditure of that £600,000 until agreement was reached between the Minister and the Tánaiste last Friday afternoon.  If that agreement had not been reached, we would have put in our amendment and we would have voted on it.  The Oireachtas is constantly making choices.  However, the greater number of choices made are made in the interests of the privileged, the elite and those with means, <Col N="1003" /> and against those who are poor and unemployed, and who are in need of the support of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The net composition of the Oireachtas is dominated by two conservative parties. They act that way and that is fine, but we had the opportunity to inject our philosophy into this last week, and we have done so.  I am pleased that we have been able to do this.  It is a compromise but at least the choice in this case has been bent somewhat in the interests of the under-privileged and it is the function of this party to do that.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the other proposals in the Bill.  The arts are the right area for some expenditure, given that we are talking about a small amount of funding anyway in this context.  I would like the Minister to indicate to us &mdash; and I am sure this will not cause him any difficulty &mdash; that £400,000 will be left after the Children's Court is built and that it will be available for civil legal aid.  I agree with Senator McGuinness that we should focus as much of that money as possible on neighbourhood law centres because not only are they more cost-effective but they also provide a much wider range of services to local communities than the institutionalised civil legal aid system which gains most of the public funding which is available for this service.</P>
    <P>We have reached a compromise that our party can go along with.  I found the Opposition's performance extraordinary because on Second Stage speaker after speaker welcomed the Bill and said it was an outstanding Bill and then they voted against it.  I do not have to talk about hypocrisy like that.  This Seanad Labour group have indicated how we expect public expenditure programmes to be directed in the future.  We expect a shift in favour of those who are at the bottom of the heap and whom we seek to represent. I hope the Government have taken on board what happened here, and that it will influence their decision making in the coming months.  If not, there will be a similar reaction from our group in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not get too carried away by the insignificance of this sum of money.  Now, £2.8 million is a very small sum of money but, nevertheless, it represents close to 30 per cent of the total allocation from all health boards to voluntary organisations in a given year under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953. The last time I looked at Estimates for the Department of Health that sum amounted to about £10 million.  So this £2.8 million is admittedly small, but it is very big to all those organisations who get small, but much boasted about, assistance from health boards.</P>
      <P>My friends in the Labour Party have made the good point that, notwithstanding the excellence of the individuals the Minister listed, they all have one thing in common.  They are rich and probably were rich before they went into the King's Inns and their passing through the King's Inns enabled them to become considerably richer, intellectually as well as in every other way.  Nevertheless that was the effective contribution the King's Inns made to their career, and I am not decrying that fact.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the fact that a large part of the King's Inns is owned or used by the State, but so is every rented, decaying, unmaintained, broken-windowed local authority house and flat in this city and country and no money is available to repair them.  Therefore, the argument that because the State has an interest in this building certain funds should be allocated to it does not hold.  People have made reference to university funding.  If ever I regretted anything I regret the rather intemperate remarks I made about my own profession, because they gave the Minister a magnificent &ldquo;out&rdquo; from talking about the real issue.  Instead he talked about my profession.  My profession is well able to defend itself so I will not pursue that any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference.  Universities are <Col N="1005" /> funded by the State through the Higher Education Authority.  Every proposal they make is assessed and they are accountable for the way they use that money in the interests of the community. So the niceties of the university being a private institution are somewhat different from the niceties of an entirely private institution which draws up its own regulations, determines its own entry standards and determines a number of other things.</P>
    <P>I do not understand where this £400,000 that has been promised has come from.  The Minister talked about cultural and community centres and then said:</P>
    <P>I estimate that the balance of the funds available after the above payments have been made will be about £1.19 million. the residue would be spent in building a new Children's Court...estimated to cost about £750,000....</P>
    <P>As reported at column 712 of the Official Report of 3 July he said:</P>
    <P>As to the question of what other courts projects might be financed from the remaining funds, I think that until such time as the priority item, that is the building of the new Children's Court, has been completed, and the final cost of that project is known, it would be unrealistic to speculate on what other projects might be included.</P>
    <P>What was unrealistic to speculate upon one week ago has now become £400,000. I would like to know &mdash; and I am sure other people would like to know &mdash; where this money will come from.  An accusation was directed against my amendment that it did not specify where the money would go.  Let me remind Members that there is a Report Stage on every Bill.  It would have been my clear intention, if my amendment had been accepted, to propose an amendment on Report Stage for the allocation of that sum of money to the deserving cause of free legal aid, as has been achieved in a somewhat circuitous route by the Labour Party.  A maximum of £440,000, according to the Minister's estimate, was left for the two <Col N="1006" /> items mentioned, the courts and legal aid services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he could not be sure how much would be necessary to pay for a Children's Court.  The estimated figure is £750,000.  What will happen if that figure becomes £850,000.  £900,000 or £1 million?  Will there be less money available for legal aid services, or will public funds be used to finance it?  In other words, is this a binding commitment irrespective of the cost of the new Children's Court, or is it a well-directed good intention of what we hope to do if there is money left over?  We have no specific information on that.</P>
    <P>The most authoritative statement we had from the Minister was that we could not be sure how much the Children's Court would cost and, therefore, we do not know how much would be left over. Suppose the £750,000 estimate turns out to be more or less correct and there is £440,000 left, the effect of the agreement the Labour Party have achieved, for which they have taken some credit, will be to transfer funds for the renovation of courts and similar projects into the provision of law centres.  That sounds like a very good idea, but we would do well to remember who passes through the courts of this city in the greatest numbers.  It is the poor, the wretched and the marginalised who pass through the courts of this city.  By and large the people who go through the courts in this city are the poor, marginalised outsiders of our society, the victims of our society.  Therefore, the consequence of this provision will be to transfer funds from one poor section in society and to give it to another group. What we are effectively doing by this agreement is transferring funds which would have benefited one section of the poor in our society in order to benefit another section of the poor and leave untouched that sum of money which was allocated to the self-esteem of the wealthy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that my amendment addresses the central problem of this Bill, which is its distorted priorities.  We could still remove this £600,000, make provision for some renovation of the courts and then provide extra funds for that <Col N="1007" /> most necessary of functions, the provision of legal aid in civil cases.  As far as I am concerned, while this agreement is a step forward it is effectively a transfer of funds for one good cause to another good cause and leaves the objectionable case untouched in any way.  Therefore, I still insist on my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Senator Fitzsimons asked a specific question.  He inquired if the State pays a rental on the part of the King's Inns building occupied by the State.  It does not.  Historically the position is that work originally began in King's Inns in 1795.  An official of the society was asked to draw up plans but later James Gandon and Francis Johnson took over the task of designing a new building.  In 1813 legislation was enacted to enable the Benchers of the King's Inns to transfer to the State the plot of land on which the Registry of Deeds now stands.  As a result of that, the State constructed and owns about two-thirds of the building which is generally described as the King's Inns.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what several Labour Senators have said: certainly I have no difficulty in accepting the concept contained in their remarks.  Senator O'Mahony talked about an injection of Labour Party philosophy.  I moved an amendment in the Dáil to allow for the spending of this money on civil legal aid.  Certainly the injection of philosophy would have no side-effects on me.  I appreciate it and I have no problem there.</P>
      <P>On the question which Senator Ryan is still pushing the Bill states:</P>
      <P>the cost of the provision of court rooms and ancillary accommodation and services in the Dublin Metropolitan District for use for the purposes of the Children's Court of the District Court,...</P>
      <P>That is a specific commitment and it has to be funded out of the funds of suitors. Subsection (2) (d) (ii) of section 3 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>any of the cost that would, apart from this subsection, fall to be defrayed by the State of the provision, extension, <Col N="1008" /> repair and maintenance of such other buildings, and the provision of such services, for use for the purposes of or in relation to the courts as the Minister for Justice may determine.</P>
    <P>There is a similar provision for legal aid and for civil legal aid, as the Minister for Justice may determine.  The position is that the residue at the moment, with all commitments fulfilled, would stand at £439,205, on figures available to me from 31 May 1984 but the interest is accumulating at the rate of about £5,000 per week.  Obviously while some bodies like Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann will want to draw on their money immediately, other allocations will have to wait.  For example, the Arts Council have various talks with local bodies before the money is actually designated to projects all around the country so that interest will be accruing there.  I do not think my Department or the Office of Public Works will be in a position to go to tender on a Children's Court until very late in the year or early next year, so that the provision for the Children's Court will remain in the fund and interest will be accruing.</P>
    <P>I feel very confident, without inhibiting the completion of the Children's Court or without depriving it of funds in any way, that a commitment of £400,000 for civil legal aid is a commitment which I can give to the House.  The commitment to provide money for legal aid is in the Bill already and what is at issue at present is the specific amount.  The residue is more than £400,000 at the moment and the money is accruing weekly.  I think there is money to fulfil all commitments made now.</P>
    <P>I would like if there was some money left for the repair of courts in various parts of the country.  People looking casually at the Bill would imagine that most of the money is being spent in Dublin. That is true of the major items but I understand from the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach that quite an amount of the money being allocated to the Arts Council will be spread throughout the country as a whole outside of the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>With the provision of legal aid Senators <Col N="1009" /> should not think exclusively in terms of Coolock and Tallaght in Dublin.  There are other places.  There is a world beyond Newlands Cross which people should remember.  Subsection (2) (d) (ii) would await a decision of the Government to enable a Minister for Justice to fund repairs in district courts because it is the function of local authorities now to repair district court buildings.  I would be happy if some money were available from the residue to repair District Court buildings if the Government decided it was appropriate that central funds should be allocated to such buildings.</P>
    <P>In response to what Senator Brendan Ryan has been getting around to, the only net difference now as a result of the commitment I am making to legal aid here and in specifying the amount is that the freedom which I enjoyed up to now to decide how much I would give to District Court buildings as against legal aid has been reduced somewhat.  I presume and I hope that there will be some residue available for the repair of court buildings down the country also.</P>

      <P>There is a magnificant clarity coming into the numbers in this game that was not apparent in the Dáil. I think the Seanad has fulfilled some function. Since the Minister has now done his calculations about interest and so on, can he give us some idea of the sum that he envisages will be left for the provision of repairs to the courts?  As I said, it is those at the bottom of society who, unfortunately, tend to be the most frequent attenders at court.  That is the system of justice we have in this country.  How much is going to be left?  I am intrigued at the fact that in the Dáil, and indeed last week, the Minister was unable to be too specific about these things.  Obviously some new computer was installed in the Department of Justice in the last week or so and that which was confused a week ago is now precise.  Perhaps we can have a little bit more precision before we pass on.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The information which I have supplied here today was supplied in a general way to the Senators the last day.  It was not difficult to do the calculations and subtract them from the total amount.  It was a simple enough sum, even for a member of the engineering profession.  What the illustrious Member of the House and a member of the engineering profession is now asking me to do is to get involved in creative accounting and to try to calculate when each individual group &mdash; over which I have little enough control &mdash; will actually withdraw the amount and to make a stab at calculating what the residual amount will be and what interest will accure.  I am not prepared to do that.  I am saying to the House that the specific commitments which I have now made &mdash; including the £400,000 for legal aid &mdash; will, I believe, still allow a residue.  I am not prepared to quantify how much that residue will be but I hope it can be allocated to the repair of court buildings.</P>

I think also that a Fine Gael point of view, as distinct from a ministerial point of view, should be brought to bear on some of the points that were dealt with today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points made by Senator Brendan Ryan in moving the amendment today was that the Society of King's Inns were in some way preventing people from studying there.  As far as I know there is no screening process, no individual who <Col N="1011" /> is educationally qualified to study at King's Inns has been refused entry on the basis of his political, religious or other beliefs.  If Senator Brendan Ryan is aware of any individual case he should bring it to my attention and I will pursue it because it is very important that such a case be brought to our attention.  If there is no such case Senator Brendan Ryan should not indicate that that kind of screening process exists, because it does not.</P>
    <P>One comment of Senator O'Mahony's today was a very serious reflection on public life as it exists in the country and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas I could not allow it to remain uncontradicted on the record of the House.  If I am incorrect in my summary perhaps Senator O'Mahony will correct me.  He indicated that the Houses of the Oireachtas act for the benefit of the privileged members of the community.  I do not think that is right.  If there has been any benefit of representative democracy it is that the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas act by and large to reduce the adverse effects of the existence of a particular economic structure and to even out of the benefit of the less privileged members of society the adverse effects of the unbridled operation of a system of capitalism.  That has happened.  He may well argue that they do not go far enough and I will not take issue with anybody who expresses that view, but to suggest or to put on the record of this House that the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas act on behalf of the privileged members of the community is flying in the face of reality when so much of the resources of the country are transferred from the privileged to the less privileged by actions of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am not claiming that they are right. Senators may not agree with it but that does not necessarily make it wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking about civil legal aid and we indicated the desirability of putting public funds into this area.  It is also probably true that there is another means by which we can get effective legal programmes to people at a price they can afford, that is to deregulate the legal profession and to see to it that they have to enter into competition in the future for business.  Competition of course would involve competition in fees as well.  Probably the time has come to supplement the present civil legal aid programme which operates in a period of economic stringency and, therefore, presumably over the next few years will not be as comprehensive as we would like to see it.  We should supplement it by having a look at how both barristers and solicitors operate cartels in their own interests in the area of fees and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also favour their right to advertise <Col N="1013" /> as part of this competitive concept of how people would have access to the law through competitive legal structures. Then we would sort out the whole question of what the benchers do when they are in the King's Inns and how they control everything to do with access to the law, in their interest.  If Senator O'Leary is keen on the notion of competition he should extend that competition to his own profession and that of solicitors.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Oireachtas act to modify the worst elements of capitalism in the interests of the majority who are not privileged is patent nonsense.  The Oireachtas creates capitalism, sustains it and introduces legislation day after day, week after week, year after year to ensure that that system which discriminates against our people is sustained and improved and continues in the interests of those people.  I do not think this is the right time to go into a long explanation of why that is.  It is a democratic Oireachtas and I have no complaints against Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  They are fulfilling their mandate in acting in the interests of those they represent but to say that in some sense this Oireachtas is designed to modify the worst effects of the system is to turn the thing on its head. The Oireachtas through legislation creates this system, sustains it and opposes anybody who is seriously concerned with transforming what is an unequal and unfair economic system into one which is based on justice and moral principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>Senator O'Leary was very eloquent on the open door policy of the King's Inns.  It has been said and it is almost a clíche at this stage that the doors of the Shelbourne Hotel are also open to anybody who can afford to pay there.  He said King's Inns do not operate a screening system.  There is no need to do so because the economic system which most barristers support and subscribe to does the screening for them.  As 25 per cent of the population leave school at or before the age of 15 they will never trouble the doors of the King's Inns.  The screening is done for all third level institutions in favour of the privileged by an <Col N="1014" /> economic system which leaves half our population out of school before they can even think of third level education.  I fully support what Senator O'Mahony said, that since most members of the legal profession, be they barristers or solicitors, publicly and privately subscribe to the private enterprise market economy, the least they could do would be to sell their services within the private enterprise market economy system on the basis of competition and advertising and not in the sort of cartel that they operate. The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, instigate the necessary legislation to bring about free competition in those two most privileged and cossetted professions.</P>

      <P>We have had a fair debate on this.  I did not speak on Second Stage of the Bill.  Having listened to all the arguments it is time we faced reality.  So far we have not had a clear indication from Senator Ryan as to whether he will press his amendment.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party Members spoke on two areas of concern in the Bill on Second Stage, law centres and allocating money to the King's Inns.  After the Second Stage debate, Labour Party Senators got together to consider the situation.  In view of the fact &mdash; and I would like to emphasise this &mdash; that sufficient attention had not been paid in the Dáil to the £600,000 for the King's Inns, it seems that it was going to be more difficult to deal with that problem than with the law centres. Having regard to precedent, and after discussions with the Tánaiste, our leader, the reality is that we were not going to make much progress on this.  This is an area about which the Labour Party are particularly concerned, and in all the circumstances, having regard to the precedent and the Minister's Second Stage reply, I cannot see where we can go at this stage.  We must accept what the Minister said, and Senator Ryan's amendment could be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (c), line 13, to delete &ldquo;£300,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£500,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire glacadh le £500,000 a thabhairt do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in áit £300,000 atá sa Bhille faoi láthair.  Creidim go láidir go bhfuil liúntas den méid seo tuillte ag an eagraíocht de bharr an tsaothair mhóir atá á dhéanamh acu ar son ár gcultúir dhúchais agus ar son an Ghaelachais i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the Second Stage I intimated my intention to table an amendment requesting an increase in the allocation proposed in the Bill to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann from £300,000 to £500,000.  In moving the amendment I sincerely believe that the organisation are fully entitled to such an allocation and I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment accordingly.  I outlined the reasons why such an allocation should be given to the Comhaltas and I do not propose to argue from figures again.  In 1978 the Comhaltas received an annual grant of £100,000 from the Department of the Gaeltacht; in 1981 that was increased to £125,000; in 1982 there was a decrease to £110,000 and in 1983 and 1984 the figure remained at that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It matters little whether we call a portion of that grant a capital or an annual grant.  What matters to Comhaltas and what has severely affected their financial position is that in 1978 the organisation <Col N="1016" /> received £100,000 and in 1984, six years later, they received only £110,000.  The annual grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta has remained more or less static in that period.  This is a grave disappointment to the Comhaltas, particularly when we are aware that other such organisations have received annual grants.  The puzzling point is that while other organisations have been given increases, proportionate to inflation or otherwise, the position of the Comhaltas has been as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly has taken credit for increasing the grant provided for in the Bill from the original £200,000 to £300,000, but in the original Bill there was no mention of an allocation to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  That is significant and it has not been mentioned so far in the debate.  In the Bill brought before the House in 1981 there was no reference to any allocation to the Comhaltas.  That should be remembered because it is significant.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House unduly, but I should like to deal with a few misunderstandings which have arisen on the Bill.  The present financial position of the Comhaltas needs to be explained. It has been said that it is due to decisions made at the top.  I reject that totally and categorically.  There are no bad decisions, or good decisions, made at the top in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann: all decisions are made democratically, as democratically as in any other body in the country.  I can verify that and I will explain it very briefly.  There is a management committee of which I am a member.  The committee discuss any proposed changes or advances and submit their proposals to the Ard Comhairle of An Comhaltas which are representative of the four provinces and of Britain.  Delegates from the four provinces attend the ard comhairle meetings when they are called, which is frequently.  Every decision made is arrived at after full discussion by the members and a full and democratic debate.  So there are no decisions, good or bad, made at the top in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann; they are made by the organisation and not by any individual <Col N="1017" /> or any small group.</P>
    <P>There are other misunderstandings. The impression has been created that the Comhaltas have done nothing themselves to provide funds for the organisation. That is not so.  Comhaltas, through their own activities, as I explained the last day, such as sending tours abroad, conducting raffles, concerts and other activities and levying a certain amount on their members, have provided £240,000 to their general fund.  That is the truth. These figures appeared in the certified audited accounts passed by congress last May.  The Comhaltas annual congress is held on the first weekend of May and last May that position was before the organisation. It is literally true.  It is not fair to say that the organisation have not done anything worth while to provide their own funds to help themselves.  In fact, in that audit report to the annual congress an item shows £67,000 of personal loans from our own members.  I am aware of these things and I do not speak lightly about this but, as a trustee of the organisation I speak with some concern and a sense of responsibility in everything I am saying.  I do not wish to say anything that might offend anybody but I want to put the truth on record in this debate.  It is important that it be made known that the organisation provided £240,000 from their own efforts to their own funding.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House, and the Minister, that an allocation of £300,000, or £500,000, to Comhaltas will not solve their financial problems.  The only way this can be done is to have a reassessment of the needs of the organisation and provide adequate State funding annually to enable them to carry out their expanding and substantial work programme.  Whether that funding comes from Roinn na Gaeltachta, the Arts Council, or elsewhere is immaterial. What matters is that the funding be adequate and equitable in the light of our present needs and of the work the organisation is doing for the preservation and restoration of our native culture.  I say with pride that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are doing a very important job to save and hold our national fabric <Col N="1018" /> together, to preserve and promote the fundamental basic elements of our nationhood.  It is because of that that I do not think the efforts of the organisation, or the value of it can be measured in matters of money or financial considerations.</P>
    <P>Last October Seanad Éireann was convened specially for a two-day debate on Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge as outlined by Bord na Gaeilge.  That was a very interesting and important debate.  In fact, it was unique that Seanad Éireann was summoned for such a purpose because it conveyed to the public that the Oireachtas was responsible and interested in the promotion and fosterage of our native culture of which the language is the most central element.  The debate was good, and constructive.  Most Senators contributed very satisfactorily and expressed grave concern in regard to the need for a solution to this important problem.  The reason I mention that is because the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is inseparably associated with the promotion of the language and the work of Bord na Gaeilge, the work of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and of Conradh na Gaeilge or any other organisation working for the promotion of the language and seeking a solution to our cultural problems.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are really appreciative of that as Members of this House we should support their efforts in carrying out their duties and in carrying out the very auspicious and ambitious work plan they have before them.  Nobody doubts that the organisation is doing a very good job.  I am sure most Senators watched on television the welcome given to President Reagan in Ballyporeen not so long ago and I am sure Senators were very pleased with the exhibition and demonstration of our national culture they saw.  When the President attended a function in Dublin Castle it was a family who are very efficient exponents of our native music, song and dance who were invited to entertain him.  For those reasons alone my amendment should get sympathy and support.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the possibility of finding some source from which he can get aid for us.  He <Col N="1019" /> should give recognition to my amendment and accept it.  We are all aware that when the allocations named in the Bill are dealt with there will be a residue of £1.19 million.  The Minister referred to the possibility of other allocations from that.  Somewhere there he should find it within his capability to allocate the £200,000 our amendment is seeking for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and try to find within that source a means by which he can accede to our request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment with which I have a lot of moral sympathy.  I know of Senator de Brún's commitment to this organisation and I share many of the sentiments he has expressed.  When Senator de Brún suggested last week that he might have an amendment to this section, I warned that it would be dipping into the residue in the funds.  The Minister encountered difficulties in trying to be as specific as requested about how he would use this residue.  The commitment of my party, on a priority basis alone, is that money should be available for the civil legal aid system.  If we follow this amendment through we will be taking a further £200,000 out of that fund.  Much as I would admire all the sentiments expressed by Senator de Brún, I find myself unable to support the amendment for that specific reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again would draw attention of the House to my request to the Minister last week.  There is an allocation available to the Taoiseach under section 2 (a) of the Bill.  In view of the difficulties which Comhaltas have encountered, I asked that a special request be sent to him to see if it would be at all possible to increase that sum or allocate a special sum out of that subhead towards Comhaltas.  They are in a tremendously difficult financial situation.  I thank the Minister for his commitment, which is on the record of the House, and I hope he will pursue it with the Taoiseach.  I certainly will do so and I hope that the Taoiseach, having listened to the views expressed in this House on the allocation of Comhaltas, will see fit to make an additional sum available to this cultural and artistic <Col N="1020" /> organisation of which we are all very proud.  I look forward to further discussions we will have with the Taoiseach and to the advice he will give to the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator de Brún that the previous Funds of Suitors Bill had no allocation whatsoever for Comhaltas.  It dealt only with the King's Inns building which was then in crisis.  A commitment was given by Deputy Haughey in 1982 that a sum of money would be made available from this fund.  That commitment is now being honoured by the Government.  Unfortunately, because of the various elections which have taken place this promise has not yet come to fruition.  That promise was for £200,000 and the Government and the Minister in the Dáil have gone further and increased the figure from £200,000 to £300,000. That would adequately meet the commitment that was previously given and allow for any inflation that might have occurred in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas have incurred debts which have caused them tremendous hardship. They have used some public finance institutions which have pressured them about interest payments.  They borrowed in all good faith because they were made a promise by a party leader who felt he was in a position to deliver.  Due to this dilemma their economic affairs have got out of hand.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister suggested that Comhaltas were a widely respected organisation and that they should make an effort to get contributions from their members.  Everybody in this House knows, and the Minister is aware, that Comhaltas have done that.  They have sent out an appeal to every householder through An Post who are delivering post at a relatively commercial rate.  It is only right that if people feel as strongly about the language and our culture and heritage as we do, they would also be given an opportunity to subscribe to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I hope that the response from the public will be beneficial to Comhaltas and to the Irish language and culture.</P>
    <P>Since the previous debate on this Bill I and Senator de Brún visited the premises <Col N="1021" /> of Comhaltas in Monkstown.  It would be an understatement to say that I was impressed with it.  I am very proud of the fact that a voluntary organisation could produce what they have managed to produce, albeit that they are in debt as a result of it.  It behoves every Member of this House and of the other House to avail of the opportunity to visit the Cultúrlann. They would have a completely different attitude towards Comhaltas and what they are doing.  There may be misconceptions in some people's minds as to what this voluntary organisation are doing.  People should familiarise themselves with what exactly they are doing. I was tremendously proud of what I saw and very impressed.  I do not think that the Oireachtas can at any time in the future give them too much money for what they are doing.  I do not think any other organisation or any State agency could take on as effectively what they are managing to produce out there.  They have accommodation for tutors, adjudicators, people involved in competitions and in classes.  It is amazing what they have managed to do through various voluntary collection agencies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the Minister's own statement in previous contributions both on Second Stage and on an earlier amendment that he presumed Comhaltas would be drawing down on this fund immediately.  I want to confirm to the Minister that it is imperative.  I would ask Senator de Brún to consider that if his amendment were to be successful today there would be a delay until at least the end of October which would cost Comhaltas about £1,000 a week.  I want to assure the Minister that they will be calling down this fund immediately and I would ask him to communicate that fact to Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Bill is peculiar.  It states that the sum shall be not more than £300,000.  Technically we could give them £5 and it would comply with the Bill.  I presume that the figure is £300,000.  I would prefer to see a Bill more positively worded and I would respectfully suggest that the parliamentary draftsman would <Col N="1022" /> look at the terminology used in 1984. Section 3 (2) (c) States:</P>
    <P>not more than £300,000 may, on the application of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the extension, completed in the year 1983, of the premises of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann at Monkstown in the county of Dublin known as Cultúrlann na hÉireann,</P>
    <P>If we read that literally we could give them £5 and say it is in compliance with the Bill.  I know from what the Minister has said today that he intends to give them £300,000 and I hope that he will request the Minister for the Gaeltacht to make that fund available as quickly as possible.  In the light of that I think the amendment is unwise.  It would delay it further and because it might dip into the funds for the other commitments the Minister has given I certainly could not support it, although in every other way, apart from voting, I would support the contention that Comhaltas are entitled to every penny that we could possibly give them from any source.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for the Gaeltacht to advise the officers in the Department that this Bill does not tie any strings to the payment of this money.  It is to be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the extension.  I am reliably informed now that on 26 June a written request issued from the Department of the Gaeltacht asking them to produce audited accounts fairly quickly.  Of course they produce audited accounts annually but it does not make sense to produce audited accounts at this juncture when it is common knowledge that anything we give will be only a pittance in comparison to whatever amount they have spent.  Certainly any additional request that we make of them and which would have financial implications would be seen by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas as unreasonable.  To make a prerequisite of the payment of this £300,000 the production at short notice of half-yearly accounts is not reasonable. I would ask the Minister to convey to his colleague the Minister for the Gaeltacht <Col N="1023" /> the fact that this House is placing no strings on payment.  I wonder who instructed the officals of any Department to seek other strings not required. Another condition I do not accept is their requiring to know what comprehensive plans Comhaltas have for clearing off the balance of their debts.  Of course they are undertaking a national campaign to get money from all sorts of sources to help them.  But to predict how successful that campaign will be before they receive this subvention is being somewhat unreasonable.  I want to place on the record that the two provisions Roinn na Gaeltachta are seeking before this money is paid are not included in the Bill.  I do not want it to be held against them in the future, that, as the Minister said, this organisation would be drawing on the Funds of Suitors Bill at a very early date.  Indeed the sooner this occurs the better because every week that passes costs them £1,000 or £1,100 in interest.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann survive.  We owe it to our culture, heritage that this organisation survive in a healthy state.  The only way we can do so is to ensure that of the funding given them through the Arts Council a specific amount will be indexed-linked.  Otherwise they will not be able to survive.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister in his introductory remarks suggested that perhaps it would be appropriate for Comhaltas Ceoltoírí Éireann, in consultation with Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Arts Council, to talk seriously before the 1985 budget figures are agreed so that they can advance a proper and adequate case for future funding, placing them on a sound financial footing, so continuing the work we all want to see continued.  They should not have to compete with minor cultural organisations, however worthy they may be.  They do not want to be placed in the position of competing with ballet, the theatre, opera or anything else, all of which are worthy in their own right.  None of us should have to go out with a begging bowl to get people to subscribe to our traditional culture which we all love and cherish and which Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are preserving continuously on <Col N="1024" /> a very limited amount of money.  Many of its members work voluntarily throughout this country and elsewhere where there are branches to stimulate an interest in our culture.</P>
    <P>I cannot support this amendment as drafted but I have made the best possible case for the money being released to them as soon as possible, with no strings attached.  We should have a future commitment under the other subheads of the Department of Finance vote &mdash; whether it be through the Arts Council or Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; so that this cultural organisation be properly looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not question the sincerity of any Member of this House who would speak in glowing terms of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann as have so many Members and indeed the Minister also.  The question we should ask ourselves today is: what amount of money have Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann contributed in real terms to our economy since the foundation of the State?  We must face facts.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have contributed far in excess of any other voluntary organisation, more in real money terms, to our economy than has any other organisation.  Their functions are attended by 750,000 people annually.  I will not go into detail again about their achievements &mdash; I mentioned some of them.  Their branches established here, those in England, Scotland, Wales, America, indeed throughout the world, have secured world wide attention and appreciation for our culture which but for them could possibly have died.</P>
      <P>As Senator de Brún said, when a two-day debate took place in this House on our national language, great importance was placed on it.  I read a book on the Irish language, published over 50 years ago, at a time when a renewed effort was being made to have Ireland an Irish speaking nation.  The first sentence of it said that, despite all the sincere and brave efforts of so many people over the past 50 years, people were frustrated that so little progress had been made.  Now, 50 years later we find that the situation has changed little, if at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all felt despondency at some <Col N="1025" /> stage with regard to the progress or lack of it made with regard to various aspects of our culture.  At times our games appeared to sink low, as did our language, our music and dancing.  Indeed in my lifetime these seemed to have been pushed very much into the background. I am of the firm belief that our culture is like the three leafed shamrock; there is our music and dance, our language and our games.  They must all be preserved and promoted with the same degree of enthusiasm, and simultaneously at that. When Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann took the decision to provide a cultural centre through which to promote their ideas, aims and objectives it was a very wise and necessary one.  What have we done for that organisation considering all they have done for us as a nation?</P>
    <P>As Senator de Brún outlined, £100,000 was granted in 1978 from Roinn na Gaeltachta, yet we find outselves in 1983 and 1984 with grants of £110,000.  In real money terms and in line with inflation, we are now giving something over 50 per cent of the grant that was given to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in 1978 when we should be bending over backwards trying to help them to solve their financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Last week I mentioned the part that Comhaltas have played in fostering harmony and peace in Northern Ireland.  It is on record that musicians from Sandy Row and the Falls Road play in groups together and form a mutual bond.  That was what we sought when the New Ireland Forum sat down to discuss what could be achieved.  We have a duty to provide funds not alone to preserve but to propagate everything Comhaltas stand for, everything for which they were founded and everything for which their members give voluntarily of their time and money to preserve for love of country and of the Irish people.  All that is at stake and here we have the opportunity to do something positive &mdash; not enough, maybe not half enough &mdash; by the extra allocation which Senator de Brún and I and others are proposing of an extra £200,000 for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I hope that the Members of this <Col N="1026" /> House will listen very carefully to what we have to say today and that in six months, 12 months, two years they will not be regretting that they did not take action when they had the opportunity to do so.  If we respond and give the example to the rest of the country then the country will row in behind us and in the coming six months the financial problems of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann will be solved.</P>
    <P>We must remember that Comhaltas were founded as a voluntary organisation which expanded and developed far beyond the bounds of the imagination of their founders one of whom, the late Dr. Brian Galligan, was a great friend of mine.  Now the organisation have grown so great that many of us take them for granted.  We talk of promotions, tours and concerts.  I know the cost of these.  I know what it costs to send musicians abroad.  We should be with Comhaltas in every step they take, ensuring that they have the funds to promote more concerts abroad so that we will get the return in an influx of visitors to this country.  What have we to offer to people coming from abroad?  Certainly not the price of drink, cigarettes, hotels, food or petrol.  We have our countryside, our scenery, our music, language and games and those are what we should be thinking of here today.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, I would like to re-echo what many Members of the House have said about the great work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  There is no doubt that their work has encouraged and revitalised the music which is such an important strand in our culture, not just something to be wheeled out with the shillelaghs and the leprechauns for the benefit of tourists but something living and vibrant which provides joy and pleasure for many people in our country.  That is why it is important to repeat that when this Bill becomes law Oireachtas Éireann will have voted in 1984 a sum of £473,900 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann from all sources.  That is made up of £110,000 from the Department of the Gaeltacht, approximately £59,000 from the Arts Council, over £4,000 from the Department <Col N="1027" /> of Foreign Affairs and the amount that concerns us here, which is the amount I am proposing of £300,000 from the funds of suitors in this Bill.  To evaluate whether that amount is adequate or fulfils adequately the commitment made by Deputy Haughey's last Government, it is necessary to consider a few facts.</P>
      <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann were given a commitment before the summer of 1982 that a sum of £200,000 would be provided from the funds of suitors.  They claim that the money did not materialise, and of course it did not.  However, they go on to claim now that the money I am proposing here is inadequate and that somehow or other the commitment of £200,000 has not only grown to beyond the £300,000 but is now somewhere in the region of half a million pounds.  Comhaltas got a loan from the ICC of £200,000 in October 1982.  Naturally they had to pay some interest on that, but the Comhaltas audited accounts for the year ending 31 December 1983 show that the ICC are owed £235,000.  If one adds, for example, interest at 16 per cent to that for the half year up to 30 June, last week, the amount due would be £253,000.  Even if we are to say that they did not fulfil all their interest commitments &mdash; I am not sure whether they did and that interest on interest would not be mounting up &mdash; and even if we were to allow another £10,000 and bring it to over £260,000, the sum I am proposing, the sum in the Bill, is still approximately £40,000 better in real money terms than the sum committed orginally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, any group benefiting from moneys voted by the Oireachtas will seek to maximise the benefit.  We have seen examples here and in the other House where Deputies and Senators advocated an increase in an area of expenditure which appealed to themselves, and that has happened in the case of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I have here a letter to me dated 15 July 1983 and signed by Labhrás Ó Murchú, Ard Stiúrthóir. After extolling the virtues of Comhaltas and outlining in detail the work they are engaged in both at home and abroad he says: &ldquo;We would require a minimum of £400,000 to correct our financial difficulty.&rdquo;<Col N="1028" /> A subsequent letter dated 3 October 1983, again signed by the Ard Stiúrthóir, Labhrás Ó Murchú states: &ldquo;Our present position is that if we are to avoid a financial catastrophe we will require a grant in the region of £400,000.&rdquo;  Taking this into account and working on the basis that people normally ask for more than they expect to get in matters such as this, the Bill which was published proposed a sum of £250,000.  On the basis of representations made to me by people both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas this was increased by amendment to £300,000.  Then I got letters from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann saying that the sum they needed was £500,000.  On what basis a requirement of £400,000 last summer and again last autumn could suddently have become £500,000 when the Bill was published I am at a loss to establish. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann need a lot of money, they need as much as they can get.  The money that is being proposed in the Bill is more in real money terms than the commitment given in 1982.  It is more than the outstanding demands on Comhaltas as a result of a loan raised from ICC together with the interest payable on that loan as a result of the commitment in 1982.  Taking into account that in 1984 Comhaltas will get a sum of £473,900 from public funds and taking into account the fact that in two letters to me prior to the publication of the Bill their demand was for £400,000 not £500,000, I think what I am providing is a generous contribution.</P>
    <P>I wish Comhaltas very well in their fund-raising.  I hope their advertisements will meet with a very good response and that people who express a great interest in Irish music and culture will contribute. They talk about the year the music died. If the music dies in 1984 it will not be the fault of this Government because the Government are providing £300,000, and <i>in toto,</i> are providing £473,900.  As I said on Second Stage I will take up the suggestion made by Senator Ferris.  I will communicate to the Taoiseach the concern expressed by the Seanad.  I do not hold out any great hope but I will ask if there is any posibility of a further allocation <Col N="1029" /> for Comhaltas being provided by way of this Bill from the £600,000 which is allocated to capital projects at the discretion of the Arts Council.  I give the commitment to communicate the views of the Seanad but I cannot give any commitment that money will be forthcoming from that source.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we accept this amendment there is only one place the £200,000 advocated for Comhaltas can now come from and that is from the £400,000 we decided to give to civil legal aid some time ago, and the residue is running very low.  As Senator O'Leary said we have to make choices and I am not prepared to make that choice.  The provisions in the Bill are balanced and very good and I would ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear the Minister scotch any myth that might have been circulating as to the commitment of this Government to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  When he did his sums, and I have no doubt the Minister did his sums very accurately, the total amount voted to the Comhaltas was £473,900, no mean amount by any standard. It underscores the commitment of this Government to traditional music, to the living culture which we have, which we want to see continue, and to the fact that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are a group who have given enormous service and dedication to the preservation of our traditional music, language and culture in general.  I, too, availed of the gracious invitation from Labhrás Ó Murchú to go out to Monkstown to see what all the fuss was about because while I knew of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann &mdash; it would be very difficult to be in Ireland and not to be aware of Comhaltas, so successful are they &mdash; I never had the opportunity or never had been so specifically encouraged to go out to Monkstown and see the Cultúrlann and partake in its festivities. I was most impressed by what I saw.  They have a wonderful facility out there.  All credit is due to them for their optimism and confidence in going ahead and providing this splendid building.  I found the <Col N="1030" /> theatre to be a most tasteful building.  It is completely woodlined, the floor is flagged and there is an open fire which is extremely welcoming on arrival.  They made a point of serving tea and brown scones in the interval of the concert.  It was a very nice touch to present traditional food like that to the people who were there.  There was a delightful atmosphere. The concert was a lovely exposition of good dancing and music.  I found the theatre somewhat stylised but that is a personal reaction.  It went down extremely well with the audience there. I should like to have seen more people there.  I cannot exactly calculate what the seating arrangement would facilitate but the theatre was about one-third full.  In conversation with the stiúrthóir he intimated that there was a difficulty in promoting the Cultúrlann adequately, which is a pity.  I hope that the debate that has surrounded this Funds of Suitors Bill will in itself act as a promotion and an encouragement to invite people to go out there and spend an evening participating in the entertainment.  The majority of the audience there were tourists, mostly American. That is good.  What was available in the Cultúrlann was the only specifically Irish entertainment available in Dublin during that week.  Comhaltas are to be commended for ensuring that at Monkstown every evening there is available Irish traditional music and culture to native and tourist alike.</P>
      <P>All those who spoke both for and against the amendment were loud in their praise of everything that Comhaltas are doing and will continue to do.  However, facts must be faced.  Comhaltas are in receipt of £174,000 of State aid this year &mdash; £59,900 from the Arts Council, £110,000 from Roinn na Gaeltachta and £4,000 from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Since 1978 Comhaltas have received almost £1 million in State aid, that is according to a recent reply to a Dáil parliamentary question by the Minister of State with responsibility for the Arts, Deputy Nealon.  Comhaltas have also received an interest-free loan of £50,000 from the Arts Council.  It is important to note that the repayment of this loan has been extended twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> The Minister for the Gaeltacht in responding to Comhaltas representations indicated that £90,000 had been provided by Roinn na Gaeltachta towards the purchase of their original building in Monkstown. The subsequent building programme had been undertaken, according to the Minister, without prior Roinn na Gaeltachta sanction.  This may account for the interest which is being shown in the Comhaltas by Roinn na Gaeltachta. The annual accounts presented by Comhaltas give cause for concern.  Comhaltas management have been twice requested by Roinn na Gaeltachta to clarify the position with regard to a number of items in the accounts of 1982 and 1983.  The latest information which I could obtain indicated that, to date, Comhaltas management have not satisfactorily responded to these requests.  All of this is somewhat disturbing and needs fairly close examination.  It is important that in the context of the funds of suitors Roinn na Gaeltachta should be fully satisfied with Comhaltas accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see Comhaltas figuring in the Funds of Suitors Bill.  So many organisations could look enviously at the £300,000 that is being provided for Comhaltas in this Bill and ask: &ldquo;Why not my organisation?  We work hard.  We promote what we are about.  We collect.  We have a large membership and we believe in what we are doing&rdquo;.  It all boils down to choice and I am pleased that the Government have chosen to put Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann into this Bill. For me it boils down to the ultimate choice: do I want to see more money on top of the £300,000 in the Funds of Suitors Bill devoted to Comhaltas or do I want to see money going towards free civil legal aid?  I have no difficulty in deciding where I want the extra funds to go.  While I admire Comhaltas, while I want to see their work continue, while I pay tribute to everybody involved and to their vast membership, both in my own county and throughout the country, nevertheless they have been dealt with very generously and satisfactorily in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator de Brún dealt with the works, aims and ideals of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and I do not intend to repeat any of those points.  I will speak on this matter in a general way because the Senator has made a very moving case.  Senator Ferris also spoke in glowing terms about Comhaltas but at the end he said he was not prepared to be supportive with his vote.  This is an area where he could give the most tangible sign of where his heart really lies.</P>
      <P>The preservation of our cultural heritage is of primary importance.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are fighting a losing battle.  I could focus on many areas but I will just mention the area of the language which has already been referred to.  I will mention the language because in my native county of Meath we had many pioneers who contributed in this area. We had Fr. Eugene O'Growney with his works and grammar.  We had Brian O'Higgins, Brian na Banban from Kilskeer and the great Meath poet and hedge schoolmaster, Peadar Galligan from Kilbeg.  I am pleased that his great-grandson works in this House.</P>
      <P>This is a battlefield where the State should be the chief protagonist.  The Minister asked on what basis could Comhaltas look for £200,000 more.  The basis is that it is the responsibility of the State.  It is our duty to preserve this rich culture for posterity even though cynical people &mdash; and the number is increasing daily &mdash; would ask what has posterity done for us?  I am not cynical and therefore I welcome this contribution of £300,000 under the Bill.  It is not ungenerous but because of the importance of the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and increase the grant to £500,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Contributors to the debate seem to find it necessary to state how much they admire the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and I feel compelled to go along with that train of thought.  I have had a long association with Comhaltas and with the promotion of Irish music and dancing.  I am from County Clare which is generally regarded as the home of traditional music <Col N="1033" /> although some people may dispute this.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest admiration for Senator de Brún, his commitment to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and for the promotional work he has done for Irish music, song and dance.  The only occasions on which I have met Senator de Brún outside this building have been at Comhaltas functions.  Despite the excellent case made by the Senator I am not prepared to support the amendment put forward by him for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>It has not been specified where this £200,000 would be transferred from within a budget of £2.8 million.  If I was prepared to agree to this increase of £200,000, I would be tempted to take it from the fund that we discussed at length this afternoon.  Senator de Brún and the people who support him did not feel that it should come from that source and that opportunity was let pass.</P>
      <P>The next source is the source Senator Ferris mentioned.  I would partially support his point of view.  I would be prepared to support a recommendation that the Taoiseach would favourably consider that part of the £600,000 which has been allocated to capital projects in the arts field be devoted to Comhaltas not to the Monkstown part of Comhaltas but to projects throughout rural Ireland where the roots of traditional Irish music, song and dance exist.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons said that this was a battlefield and that the State should become involved because it was its responsibility to do so.  I respect his view but if the State takes responsibility in this area I guarantee that everything that Comhaltas have tried to promote over the past 20 years will be smothered.  The involvement of the State would eliminate the spirit and commitment that inspired the revival of Irish music, song and dance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the loan that is due by Comhaltas to the ICC, the maximum that it can be at present is about £260,000. The provision being made in this Bill will more than cover that.  The Minister indicated that the sum was increased from £200,000 to £250,000 and now to £300,000.  When the £200,000 was promised <Col N="1034" /> to Comhaltas it was on the basis that the capital cost of the project in Monkstown would be £400,000.  I have been told that the capital cost of that project is at least double that figure.  I am appalled at the ease with which we in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; particularly in relation to the semi-State sector &mdash; will tolerate overspending, and overspending which is done in the knowledge that the taxpayer will be there to pick up the tab.  We have tolerated that for far too long in the semi-State sector.  I would not be consistent with the views I have expressed elsewhere if I were to agree to a voluntary organisation grossly overspending on the strength of commitments of a stated amount given by the Oireachtas and expecting the taxpayer to pay for it.</P>
    <P>By increasing the State grant from £300,000 to £500,000 we are encouraging overdependence on the part of an undoubtedly splendid voluntary organisation on State resources and State funds. The strength and resources of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Eireann and the success of their efforts in promoting and developing Irish culture and everything that goes with it will depend on the extent to which voluntary effort and voluntary commitment are available to them.  The more one moves towards dependence on State resources, the more voluntary effort and voluntary commitment decline in proportion. As far as I am concerned, it is not in the long-term interest of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to over-depend on the State for the resources they require to achieve the task they set out to do 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I know Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are engaged at the moment in a national fund-raising effort.  I welcome that.  It is through that source of finance that the resources they need can best be obtained. The extent to which those who pay lip service to the promotion of Irish culture, subscribe to that fund will be a measure of their commitment.  I believe that fund will be substantially subscribed to.  In the long-term interest of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, it is best that the funding should come from these.</P>
    <P>Senators Ferris and Bulbulia were most impressed when they went on a tour <Col N="1035" /> of Monkstown.  I was taken by Senator Bulbulia's description of the parana pine on the walls, the flag floors, the open hearth, the tea and the homemade scones.  If Senators Ferris and Bulbulia ever have the opportunity to come to my town, I will bring them to a new Comhaltas building in that town, where what was described so splendidly and with such clarity by Senator Bulbulia is there, but on a minor scale.  The difference will be that she visited a building in Monkstown, which she saw to be one-third full but when she visits Cois na hAbhna in the town of Ennis, it will be packed to the doors.  That is the difference and that is part of the argument I am making.</P>
    <P>I met Senator de Brún in Cois na hAbhna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDeBrun" hpid="Séamus de Brún Séamus de Brún">
      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Senator will, again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows it.  A dozen Cois na hAbhnas throughout rural Ireland would be of far better advantage and benefit for the promotion of Irish culture song, dance and music than the building in Monkstown.  In fact, long before the present theatre that cost so much in Monkstown was erected, there was already a headquarters for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in Monkstown.  I was there and thought that would be adequate to fulfil its purpose as a headquarters. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, with only the support of £9,000 of a county development fund grant, by voluntary subscriptions and voluntary effort, have erected a Comhaltas building in my county.  It is a success and is making a substantial contribution to the aims of the organisation.  I am sure it will be accepted that I have every right to disagree with the building of this very substantial structure in Monkstown when a dozen Cois na hAbhnas like that in Ennis could be erected where the roots of Irish culture are strong, where they can flourish and be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a lot of documentation from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in connection with this matter.  I am rather intrigued by the capacity in their correspondence to combine capital and current expenditure <Col N="1036" /> where that suits and to segregate them where it does not suit.  There is little point in their saying that they got £125,000 in one year and that that figure dropped back to £105,000 the following year.  By doing that, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are combining capital and current expenditure.  If we accepted that, then the figure which the Minister has mentioned here comes into perspective. In relation to 1984 and on the strength of this Bill we will combine current and capital expenditure and we will arrive at a figure of something like £475,000.  That is a massive contribution.</P>
    <P>I agree strongly with one point that has been made by Senator de Brún and perhaps by other Senators also.  I genuinely do not believe Comhaltas are getting a fair proportion of the funds administered by the Arts Council.  I would hope to see a better and more justifiable balance being achieved there.  The £300,000 proposed in this measure is needed.  It will more than cover the loans due to the ICC.  Should we decide to amend the Bill today, as Senator Ferris pointed out, that would delay the payment of any sum to Comhaltas until the matter goes back to the Dáil, and that means next October. I do not know that we would be acting fairly there.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by summarising what I have been saying.  I do not believe that it is in the long-term interests of Comhaltas that they should become more and more dependent every year that passes on the State to underwrite and finance their operations.  Their success to date &mdash; and it has been an excellent success &mdash; has been achieved on voluntary effort, by the support of people committed to what Comhaltas stand for.  The day you begin to replace that kind of support and that commitment and that spirit by State funds, then you are definitely on the road that leads to the eventual elimination of the effort that is required to bring success in that field.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been generous here. I support the Bill as it stands.  I give conditional support to the suggestion of Senator Ferris that the Taoiseach would look favourably at giving some finance to Comhaltas from the £600,000 for capital <Col N="1037" /> projects in the arts field, but I would add to that the rider or condition that any moneys allocated from that source should go towards financing and supporting additional Cois na hAbhnas.</P>

      <P>There are a few points to which I want to refer very seriously.  When I spoke last week and today I did not refer in any way to what was offered by any administration. I wish to keep political overtones out of this debate.  I did not refer to what was done by the previous administration or the present administration.  I kept to the merits or demerits of my point of view and my contention.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister repeated that £473,900 would accrue to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in this current year from the State.  That is academically correct.  He itemised that previously, and it was itemised here again today by other people.  I want to put this in perspective.  The £57,900 allocated to Comhaltas from the Arts Council is not really an allocation to Comhaltas.  It is an allocation to provide for a national entertainment scheme that even crosses the Border into the Six Counties, an allocation for an entertainment project sponsored by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann initially in co-operation with Bord Fáilte to provide entertainment for our own people and particularly for visitors from abroad during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That scheme is now in progress and the administration of that scheme costs Comhaltas a great deal of money.  It has to be administered from head office in Monkstown. The seisiún group is made up of eight performers and a producer.  These people have to be transported to a catchment area adjacent to the centre of entertainment, be it an hotel, or a teach ceoil, or whatever else, but mostly hotels.  This scheme is in the little booklet I had here the other day, &ldquo;Ireland in Musical <Col N="1038" /> Mood&rdquo;.  There is a full calendar of Comhaltas events in that booklet.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £57,900 goes directly towards providing for the expenses of those people.  They have to be brought to the hotels.  They have to be brought home.  They have to sacrifice their time. It is not accruing to Comhaltas.  It is of no value to Comhaltas financially.  It just passes through their hands as will the £300,000 or the £500,000, whichever it may be, that will accrue from the funds of suitors allocation.  It will merely pass through our hands to pay for the loan we were lucky enough to get, in fairness to and to the credit of the Department of the Gaeltacht on foot of the promise given that the momey would be forthcoming and that the ICC therefore would have their grant or loan duly paid back. That is the position in regard to that £57,900.  It is not a direct grant to Comhaltas.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas are not by any means getting their fair allocation from the Arts Council.  The Arts Council get a State grant of £5½ million per year for culture and the arts.  The allocation which we receive &mdash; £57,900 &mdash; which is much talked about in this House is only 2 per cent of their grant.  Two per cent to a nationwide movement which has branches abroad: 40 in Britian, 25 in the US, and branches also in Europe.  All we are getting from that grant is 2 per cent. Will any Senator or any Minister deny that that is far too low a proportion from the Arts Council to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann?  I do not think it can be denied.</P>
    <P>The very small sum of £4,000 which the Cultural Relations Committee in the Department of Foreign Affairs give to Comhaltas is just a token sum in small recognition of the immense importance of the tours which we sent abroad every year on these tours 25, 26 or 27 artistes are accorded great receptions in America. They are often feted by diplomatic representatives and by representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs abroad. I know that because I was on the first tour to the US in 1972.  That is the position in regard to the allocation, and the £4,000 is merely a token recognition by the officials in the Department of Foreign <Col N="1039" /> Affairs of the immense value of the tours in attracting visitors and tourists to this country.  It should not be £4,000.  It should be several times £4,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned letters he got from An tÁrd Stiurthóir of Comhaltas, Labhras Ó Murchú.  That was in 1983.  The value of money in 1984 is not the same value as it was in 1983.  I see the Minister is smiling.  I suppose from his point of view he has reason to smile.  I am speaking sincerely.  I am speaking from my heart as one who has given a life long commitment to the promotion of all these matter we are talking about today.  The sum of £200,000 has been mentioned as the initial or original figure proposed in 1982.  That is correct.  The figure then was £200,000.  Surely the value of money early in 1982 was far different from the value of money today.  If an organisation were worthy of £200,000 then, it should be worthy of much more now.</P>
    <P>The presentation of accounts has been mentioned.  I am a trustee of the organisation and this carries some responsibility and concern particularly when one realises that the organisation of which I as a trustee is in debt to the extent of £750,000.  People have asked me if I feel concerned at that situation and I have said, no, I do not feel concerned.  I believe that the vast majority of people are in support of our organisation and in support of what we are doing.  Therefore, I am not concerned that I am one of three trustees of our organisation because I have faith in the Irish people.  I also have faith in the Government of the country, and I mean all the Governments we have had.</P>
    <P>We present accounts each year both to the Department of the Gaeltacht and to our annual congress.  These accounts have been prepared and certified by auditors. They have also been accepted by the Department of the Gaeltacht for 14 years.  If they have been right and proper for all that time, what is wrong with them now?  Senator Bulbulia mentioned there was concern about the manner in which the accounts were presented.  I do not think there should be any concern.</P>

      <P>I have had consultations and it seems to be the view of the various groups that we should continue without rising because of the wish of the House to complete Items Nos. 2, 3 and 4 or at least the Second Stage of No. 4.</P>

      <P>Senator Howard said the initial estimate of the cost of the Cultúrlann in Monkstown was £400,000. That is correct.  It finished at £800,000.  In my contribution on Second Stage I said that even in respect of a private house, the ultimate cost is always in excess of the initial estimate received from the contractor. When I built my house a number of years ago I did not build it within the initial estimated cost.  To my knowledge, very few State building projects finish up within the initial estimate given to the various Departments.  It is no great wonder, particularly in view of the time, of the fact that the money was not forthcoming and of the escalation of the cost of building materials that there should be a doubling of the costing of An Cultúrlann.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard mentioned Cois na hAbhna.  I have been to Cois na hAbhna on many occasions.  I was there at the official opening and I shall go there again, le cúnamh Dé, if I live for much longer. Cois na hAbhna is a development of the concepts of Comhaltas, a development of our ambitions and our initial perspectives. In various areas throughout the country there should be such buildings but you must have a central administrative area and that is Cultúrlann in Monkstown. Croke Park is in Jones's Road. Teach Laighean is in the centre of Dublin.  Nobody would suggest that Croke Park, Teach Laighean, the National Library or the College of Art should be moved down the country or should have been built in the country.  I do not think there is anything wrong with having Cultúrlann na hÉireann in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cois na hAbhna is a subsidiary body of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Cois na hAbhna had to be ratified and its deeds signed by the trustees of Comhaltas.  That <Col N="1041" /> shows how well administered Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is.  We had to sign deeds for that building.  There is a similar building being prepared for Wicklow, and another such building is in prospect for Mayo, but that is going outside the scope of this debate.</P>
    <P>At a time like this when one comes up against difficulties, whether they be financial or otherwise, one feels dejected and frustrated.  The objectives of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are essentially idealistic.  History will record, and historians have already accepted, that it was the spiritual revival in this country that led eventually and inevitably to the founding of the State.  Without that spiritual revival of which the founding of the Gaelic League was the central part and the other developments that followed thereafter, possibly we would not be here this evening discussing the merits of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann or discussing whether we should allocate £200,000, £300,000 or £500,000 to the organisation.</P>
    <P>At a time such as this one wonders and one becomes somewhat dejected &mdash; but as far as I am concerned I go back to the sources of inspiration for the philosophies and aspirations of our people in the hard days.  I refer to people like Traolach Mac Suibhne, Terence McSwiney, whose philosophy was in his <i>Principles of Freedom.</i> I have it as a regular companion beside me and I reread it now and again whenever I come up against difficulties of this kind.  I am not saying that I am in very serious difficulty this evening, I am not, as I am amongst friends.</P>
    <P>Traolach Mac Suibhne said we must not only have philosophies but we must live our philosophies.  The personnel and administrators of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are living their philosophies. They are not merely preaching them.  I also think of people like the man who was known affectionately as &ldquo;fear na muintire&rdquo;, Willie Rooney, a man who worked hard and may possibly have shortened his life by working for the national inspiration and the leadership of his time.  He died, if my memory serves me right, in 1901 at the age of 27.  He said &mdash; and we must remember this &mdash; that <Col N="1042" /> history has never been made by the millions. The few who sacrificed themselves have done all that the world is proud of, a single seed eventually fills the corn field.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are symbolic of that single seed because in 1951 the level of respect and involvement in Irish traditional music was very low. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have brought it a long way since then.  They deserve the consideration that we are asking in this amendment.  The amendment deserves the support of this House and the recognition for their work throughout the last 32 or 33 years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to reappraise the importance of this organisation to the fabric of the State.</P>

Cé go bhfuil an-mheas agam ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí &mdash; agus dúirt mé é sin an lá cheana agus ní rachaidh mé siar air arís &mdash; is dócha go dtuigeann Séamus go bhfuil tuairimí eile agam nach n-aontaíonn leis na tuairimí atá aige féin.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday I had the privilege of being on top of the Mourne mountains, at Biddy Doyle's Cross, where Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann had an open air concert.  The people of County Down assembled in large numbers and the parish priest arrived with a fiddle under his arm and took part in the music.  Even though he was not a singer he sang a song.  It typifies what Comhaltas have done to rouse the spirit of the people and get them organised.  I enjoyed that session and I hope to enjoy another in Kilmihil at the August weekend where the best fleadh is held despite what Senator de Brún might think about his territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the work of Comhaltas, <Col N="1043" /> and I readily accept that the Minister has done admirably well in allocating almost £500,000 overall this year to Comhaltas.  I know that figure has been disputed by Senator Howlin but it is not enough to say that money passes through hands.  I would like to think that the money I get as a Senator would stick to my hand but unfortunately it seems to pass through.  That is what getting money is all about.  It goes through and maybe it is a way of arguing for more, but the case could not have been put any better. All grants are spent on expenses in promoting their cause.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters about which I am not very happy.  I do not agree that decisions are not made at the top if they are made by either the Ard Comhairle or a management board.  Ministers would certainly fall for that piece of logic in a big way if they could blame the electorate for decisions that are made.  When people get to the top the buck stops with them.  It does not matter whether the recommendation comes from the grassroots in County Clare or County Monaghan, in the long run the decision has to be made by those at the top.  I do not accept that you can defend a doubling of the cost of a building from £400,000 to £800,000.  That is indefensible and I do not care whether it involves a semi-State, private or a voluntary body like Comhaltas.  There must be control and common sense and I say that as an admirer of Comhaltas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard when he said that if the voluntary part of Comhaltas is taken over by paid workers there will be trouble.  Senators are here mainly because they have spent their lifetime working on voluntary bodies, freely giving their time.  There is no way one could be compensated for the time spent working with voluntary bodies.  The spirit goes out of most things when people can claim expenses.  I know that running costs are one thing but I worry that Comhaltas might over-kill in their efforts to look for more money.  It would be nice if they received more money but £300,000 is a fair contribution nowadays.  I would not like people to turn sour and say even though they are getting a good lot they want <Col N="1044" /> more.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would like to think that I am justified in voting for the Minister's decision in giving £300,000 and in voting against the amendment, much as I would like to give extra money to Comhaltas. There is a limit and everybody has to be seen to get a fair crack of the whip. The Minister has done that in allocating £300,000.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa tacú leis an leasú seo.  Ach amháin nárbh bhféidir le Fianna Fáil a shocrú cén áit a bhfaighfear an chéad míle punt eile agus to raibh seans acu nuair a bhíomar ag caint faoi rud éigin níos luaithe inniu socrú a dhéanamh i gcaoi is go mbeadh airgead ar fáil chun cabhrú le Comhaltas agus chun a lán rudaí eile a dhéanamh, toisc nach raibh siad ábalta aontú le chéile cén tuairim a bhí acu faoi King's Inns agus rudaí mar siúd, tá siad ag iarraidh airgead a thógaint as níl a fhios againn cén áit chun cabhrú le Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Is beag duine san Teach seo nó in áit ar bith sa tír a labhródh i gcoinne na hoibre atá á déanamh ag Comhaltas, ach má táimid chun cabhrú le Comhaltas caithfimid a rá cén áit as a thiocfaidh an t-airgead.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have been a little too clever in proposing an extra £100,000 to be given to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann without apparently saying where it should come from, because we now have a very clear picture of where the funds are being allocated.  As it stands, the major loss would appear to be in regard to the Minister's proposals for doing work on courts and so on.  I am a little worried that the cost of a new Children's Court may well exceed the Minister's estimated £750,000 in which case it would be very difficult to maintain the commitment which has been given of £400,000 to legal aid.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil had wished to propose an amendment on the first proposal in this Bill to give money to the King's Inns perhaps, for instance, to halve it, then they would have a logical case for supporting the allocation of substantial extra funding to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands, they are trying to be a little <Col N="1045" /> bit of Tadhg an Dhá Thaobh, supporting all the good causes without indicating what their priorities are.

      <P>Please allow me to clarify something I said and which was commented on by Senator Howard.  I was not advocating that the State would take over the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Far from it.  The point I was making was that it is the responsibility of the State to preserve our rich cultural heritage for future generations.  That work is being done for the State, and being done very well, by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and recognition of this should be shown with sufficient funds.  As Senator de Brún said, the funds they are getting are not sufficient and that is the reason for the amendment.</P>

      <P>The appeal to the nation for funds has been mentioned not by me but by other Senators.  I did not say this earlier &mdash; although I had something quite important to say about it &mdash; because I did not wish to trumpet our deeds.</P>
      <P>Fleá Cheoil Chonnachta was held in Strokestown, County Roscommon, on 23 and 24 June.  I mention this to relate to the importance of the efforts we are making to provide funds for the organisation. We are not begging for money.  I want to make that quite clear.  We are here because we believe in what we are doing. I have here the clár of the fleá in Strokestown on 23 and 24 June.  As a trustee, I felt a responsibility to issue an appeal that would be printed in that clár in the knowledge, and in the belief, that a great many people attending the fleá would read this appeal and possibly be influenced by it to contribute towards the project for which we are seeking funds. This is the appeal:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As musicians, patrons and competitors <Col N="1046" /> assemble here in Strokestown over the weekend to participate in the various activities and enjoy the festive spirit of Fleá Chonnachta 1984, many will not realise that the future of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is very seriously threatened because of its present enormous financial problems.  This, unfortunately, is the stark reality.</P>
    <P>To ensure the survival of Comhaltas, the Ard-Chomhairle has embarked on a nation-wide fund raising campaign. Details of this campaign will be available on the national media: radio, television, local and national newspapers. During the coming weeks a letter from Comhaltas Ceoltóiri Éireann appealing for financial aid will be delivered to every home in the country &mdash; to every home in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a Trustee of the Organisation, I earnestly appeal for your full and wholehearted support for this most worthy cause.  I sincerely hope you will support it in every possible way.</P>
    <P>And there are many ways in which you can help.</P>
    <P>You may offer assistance to your local Comhaltas branch, or County Co-ordinator; encourage your friends and acquaintances to assist; and, of course, contribute to the fund as generously as you can.  Any subscription, no matter how small, will be greatly appreciated.  By giving such assistance you will be playing your part to save and strengthen our great national movement which has done so much to revive and restore Irish traditional music from the most lowly status to its now rightful premier position among the Arts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our native culture &mdash; language, song and dance &mdash; is the heart and soul of our beloved country.  To neglect or let it die, would be a national disaster.  I am fully confident that this will not be allowed to happen, and that the people of Ireland will rally to the call of Comhaltas and so will make the year 1984 a memorable one in the struggle for the preservation of the basic elements of our nationhood.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything in the Road Traffic Acts in the case of the inadvertent non-insurance of a vehicle a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a minimum penalty of £100 and in the case of deliberate non-insurance to a minimum penalty of £350.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the amendment may I, with the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, refer to comments made by the Minister in his reply on Second Stage?  I was singled out as one of the contributors one of the black marks, in that debate on Second Stage.  As spokesman on the Environment it is my duty here to hold a watching-brief for my party and ensure the effective passing of legislation. That is my role.  I am delighted the Minister singled me out in that regard.  As we have been very good friends since I arrived in this House I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that there was nothing personal in his contribution. It is now crystal clear that since the Minister thanked all other speakers for their contributions and left me out that I hit some very controversial points. I hope the Minister will consider accepting some of the amendments before him.</P>
      <P>I should like to clear the record in connection with Senator FitzGerald's remarks.  He seemed to be somewhat confused with regards to my contribution. I should like to quote from Volume 104 of the Official Report of Tuesday, 3 July last, at column 830:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...Senator O'Toole, said, if I understood <Col N="1050" /> him correctly.  He was all but encouraging people to park illegally in the towns and cities of our country although they know parking restrictions are well and truly established as part of the law.</P>
    <P>I did not say any such thing.  I do not encourage people to park in unapproved locations.</P>
    <P>My first amendment is in connection with inadvertent drivers.  We are all human and from time to time we may run out of insurance cover through an oversight. There may be a delay or overlap in sending back a renewal premium.  For that reason one may be caught in between these stages.  That is the type of person who is caught badly under this Bill.  He will now come under the same type of jurisdiction as the non-insured driver who avoids paying insurance deliberately. Our amendment is a fairly practical one that the Minister should definitely take heed of.  I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>My second amendment states:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (4), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3A) Notwithstanding anything in the Road Traffic Acts, in the case of the deliberate non-insurance of a vehicle a person shall on summary econviction be automatically disqualified from holding a driving licence for twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That amendment is different from one submitted in the other House.  I do not hold any brief for deliberate non-insurance and that is the reason why there is such a high premium for the honest insurer who pays his permium annually.  His premium is rising continually.  The reason it is rising is that there are so many uninsured drivers.  In the region of 140,000 or 150,000 uninsured people are driving around this State without cover.  From time to time they are found in uninsured cars because they do not have a driving licence, sometimes deliberately and on other occasions for accommodation purposes. For such an offence the disqualification for 12 months is a sufficient penalty. <Col N="1051" /> On a drunken driving charge, which to my mind is more serious, the penalty is disqualification for 12 months in most cases.  It can be appealed after six months and successfully in many cases, when one gets one's licence back.  Disqualification for 12 months should be sufficient for that offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with this amendment.  It should be borne in mind in relation to it that the inadvertent non-insurers fall into two classes. There are those who run into real difficulty in relation to, perhaps, a change of address, do not receive the reminder from the insurance company and do not carry on their insurance.  I am quite certain that in court the maximum would not be applied in cases of that kind and the judge would be very lenient and sympathetic to those who would find themselves pleading a case of not having received a warning of the renewal of their insurance relating to the following year.  What must be borne in mind over and above all of that is the protection of the third party, the protection of not just those driving but, equally, those pedestrians and others on our streets who are the recipients of very sizeable amounts of money from the Motor Insurers Bureau for hit-and-run accidents and other accidents where there is not the necessary cover.  It would be very unfortunate if we reduced the cover that is given to people at large, the incentive that is given to them to insure in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my contribution on Second Stage I raised the question of enforcement and I said that in many instances it was quite inadequate. The Minister in the course of his Second Stage speech indicated that he was opposed to mandatory minimum penalties because he would wish to see the courts' constitutional prerogative in administering justice preserved.  However, this does not answer the fairly common practice in the District Court of the imposition of normal fines, or fines well below the maximum, for uninsured driving. The average fine imposed by the courts, for example, in the case of uninsured <Col N="1052" /> driving is £50, despite the fact that at present the maximum is £100.  Indeed, in some cases the fines imposed are of the order of £20 or £25.</P>
      <P>I take the point that the ability of the convicted person to pay should continue to be taken into account by district justices but surely the imposition of fines as low as £25, where a £100 maximum fine is available for uninsured driving, can only encourage disregard of the law.  I would ask the Minister to examine closely the merits of minimum mandatory penalties in the case of uninsured driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my support to this amendment.  I would suggest to this Government or any Government that if we are really concerned with reducing insurance premiums we can do so in one quick swoop by the elimination of the jury system.  However, we are not dealing with that issue in this Bill.  Yet we have to look for positive ways of reducing motor premiums if we can do so.  We can do so in some way with this amendment in the name of Senator O'Toole.  What we are endeavouring to do makes sense, having regard to the fact that the present maximum fine is £100 and, as a Senator Hillery has said, often this is reduced in the District Court to £25, £35 or thereabouts. If there was a suitable minimum penalty as outlined by Senator O'Toole it would be very worth while and would help in the reduction of uninsured driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The uninsured driver today is hitting at the insurance companies in a very real way.  He is clearly not paying them anything. They estimate a loss of £50 million in premiums, yet they are paying out every year through the Motor Insurers Bureau.  In 1982 they paid out £3 million, in 1983 £5.6 million and the estimated liability for outstanding claims for 1983 is £42 million.  They are not getting the premiums, yet they are having to pay out. Why have they to pay out?  They have to pay out &mdash; and it is very important that the Minister be aware of this &mdash; under the operation of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  We have to try to find out how this came into operation.  It came into operation in 1955 because the <Col N="1053" /> Government of the day asked the motor insurance companies to come together to try to do something about people who were victims of accidents that were not covered by insurance.  The bureau was set up by the motor insurance industry in consultation with the Government in 1955 to provide a means whereby persons who sustained personal injuries in motor accidents would recover damages which had been awarded to them but which could not otherwise be recovered because the driver responsible was not insured.  It is a black and white situation. At the request of the Government of the day, the motor insurance people were responsible in their attitude and came together to form this bureau.  That formal agreement is with the Minister for the Environment.  It was made of 30 December 1964.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurers Bureau interest themselves not alone in uninsured driving but find themselves paying <i>ex gratia</i> payments for hit-and-run cases.  They do not have to do this but for the protection of the good name of the industry they have done so many times.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a person who had an insurance policy but because he had not read his insurance certificate in detail thought he was entitled to drive other cars and borrowed another car thinking he was insured.  The situation may also arise in the case of someone who borrowed his neighbour's car thinking he was a named driver while in effect, this was not the case.  Strictly speaking, the company do not have to deal with a claim arising from an accident but because they are the insurer concerned they will deal with that claim.  Why is this happening?  Why are they doing this? They are doing this in response to the request by the Department of the Environment in 1955 that they get involved and prepare a scheme to do so.  In 1955 an uninsured driver was virtually unheard of, but the problem today has escalated to such a degree that the insurance companies have to cry halt.</P>
    <P>The report of the inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance made the point exactly as outlined <Col N="1054" /> by Senator O'Toole's amendment.  It would favour a minimum fine of £100 and, in the case of deliberate non-insurance, a minimum fine of £350 rather than the fine of £1,000 because, for whatever reason, the Judiciary are not applying the full penalties.  It is far better to have this subsection inserted in fairness to the insurance companies who have set up this scheme and are now being &ldquo;creased&rdquo; left, right and centre because of their decent generosity.  What would happen if they were to say to the Government that they were going to break up the Motor Insurers Bureau because they could not tolerate it any more?  They are asking for some degree of consideration in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is a perfectly fair and responsible amendment.  It is the fairest and most responsible request the motor insurance industry ever presented to Government.  They want to see the uninsured driver off the roads.  They think this constitutes the best way of doing so rather than having maximum fines which will never be introduced.  One might ask why will they never be introduced.  The answer is that a person might plead that he tried to get insurance cover for £1,000 and could not get it.  He could not do so because he did not have the money and the fine will be reduced from £1,000 to £100.  That is no use.  It is hopeless and will not do anything for the problem.</P>
    <P>This amendment constitutes a practical suggestion.  In 1955 the motor insurance industry were good enough to comply with the wishes of the Government of the day and continue to do so.  If they pulled the plug now, who will pay?  The Government will be forced to do so.  The motor insurance industry is feeling the pinch and surely are entitled to some measure of protection.  If they pull the plug now and said no more Motor Insurers Bureau &mdash; I am not saying they will do that &mdash; it would be left to the Government to take up the tab.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to agree to this amendment.  It is a perfectly straightforward legitimate aspiration.  It is a real way of getting the £50 million not going into the insurance companies into their coffers, or some of it and, at the same <Col N="1055" /> time it will reduce the number of uninsured drivers on our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the penalties here we are dealing with one half of a whole.  Punishment is one thing but I often wonder do we put the cart before the horse when it comes to insurance.  I make the plea that not alone should we punish those who do not pay vehicle insurance but we should encourage those who do, particularly young drivers.  For example, if a young driver is loaded with a cover of £300 at the start &mdash; if there is a minimum insurance fee of £300 &mdash; at the end of two years if he has not had an accident, he should be reimbursed that loading and in that way encouraged to act responsibility.  As the position obtains he may as well go out and have an accident because he is being fleeced.  We are doing nothing to encourage the careful driver.  Insurance companies should study the feasibility of ensuring that those who have not had accidents are not treated as potential criminals before they start driving.  That is what is wrong with our present law.  They are regarded as criminals before they start because they cannot afford to pay for the insurance cover.  If they were given any encouragement that by being careful they would recoup some of their expenditure in two years time, or at least that the loading would be cast aside in two years time, it would do a lot to eliminate some of the uninsured drivers on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense I support what lies behind this amendment in that it is certainly desirable to try and take any steps we possibly can to stop uninsured driving.  Senator Browne's suggestion of trying to provide some incentive to drivers to have an accident-free carrier, particularly for young drivers, is an important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole system of fines as it obtains may not be the right way of dealing with these offences.  Even if we bring in a minimum fine of £100, or £350, it can still be worth a person's while not to insure himself.  It is really very serious to have the large number of uninsured drivers <Col N="1056" /> that we have.  I am not sure that I would entirely share Senator Fallon's extreme sympathy for insurance companies in contending that they are being bled to death by providing for uninsured drivers through the Motor Insurance Bureau.  I would have thought that it is the insured drivers who are paying more on their premiums in order to keep the insurance companies' books going, in order to keep the Motor Insurers Bureau going.  I feel the insured driver is more to be sympathised with than are the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>However, I should like the Minister to consider that in other countries, particularly the Scandinavian ones, systems of weekend open prisons, and weekend community service orders have been used to cover a period when driving offences occur, whether they be cases of drunken driving or uninsured driving.  In my opinion both drunken driving and uninsured driving are very serious offences.  While one does not want to put a person in jail to the point that it would destroy his livelihood, his family, or whatever, it would not be a bad idea &mdash; particularly where people do not feel the pinch of fines very much, because they have plenty of money but they are still driving around uninsured &mdash; to bring in a system like this under which they would lose liberty, say, over weekends for a year, or something of that sort, rather than try to operate a system of fines and, if the fines are not paid, then putting them into prison.  It would be worth while looking at some different way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments expressed particularly in regard to the minimum penalty of £100 in the case of the summary conviction and for deliberate non-insurance, a minimum penalty of £350.  I hold the strong view that tying the hands of the court like this is not the wisest method.  If the Legislature feels that there should be a fine of £100 in one case and of £350 in another &mdash; though the maximum be £1,000 &mdash; that could be interpreted <Col N="1057" /> by the courts as appearing to be the norm.</P>
      <P>If we want to deal with this matter in a serious fashion then we should leave it to the discretion of the courts.  The point has been well made in the House that there are certain reservations held about the operations of courts, that judges do not tend to be sufficiently strict.  I hope they observe and take note of what is said.  I am concerned that if we do this the penalty of the £100 and £350 would become the norm.  We are not increasing it to £1,000 as a window-dressing exercise. We want that £1,000 fine to operate.</P>
      <P>Even on the question of a first offence carrying a fine of £100, it could be a minor offence on the part of an elderly person who, through oversight, forgot to insure. We are going to impose a £100 fine on such a person.  One has to ask is that right, or should we leave it to the courts to decide what is right?  I have enough faith in our courts to give them guidelines and at the end of the day let them decide what in their view is right and wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I should say that last year there were 91,147 non-insurance cases before our courts.  If one were treating all of them on a minimum fine basis, one would be tying the hands of the courts considerably.  Given that number there will always be a number in which fines will impose grave hardship on people who genuinely forgot, people who would not have the means or income to meet such fines.  I must stress that it should be our courts that should decide these matters. Therefore, for the reasons I have stated, minimum and maximum penalties are not a good idea.  We would be tying the hands of our courts.  There can be extenuating circumstances at the low end as well and we would be giving a judge no option but to impose this proposed minimum fine.  I do not think it is right and I would have to oppose it on that ground.  Our judicial system works well. They will take note of what is said here and what was said in the other House.  I believe that justice will be done in that way, but if we take this amendment on board I do not believe that justice will be <Col N="1058" /> done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the automatic disqualification of people from holding driving licences for 12 months on summary conviction, again I would advise caution.  We have that only in the case of drunken driving and dangerous driving where life has been lost, both very serious cases.  In the case of a second offence we are increasing the automatic disqualification period from six to 12 months.  Therefore, we recognise the need for change but I do not recognise that it is necessary on the first offence, given the way we operate for the other two serious offences. For that reason I reject the second amendment also.  It is not that I do not understand the spirit of these amendments. I understand it, and I know that Senators all feel that it is a very serious offence to drive without insurance, and I recognise that by increasing the fine to £1,000.  However, I do not believe that we should tie the fine down, and we should not exercise the automatic disqualification for 12 months on the first offence.  Deliberate non-insurance and accidental non-insurance represent something which is difficult to prove in court.  Normally if somebody is convicted a second time then we can take it that the offence is fairly deliberate and the person will be automatically disqualified for 12 months.  On that basis I regret to say that I will not accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister is right in hoping that the members of the Judiciary will take note of what is being said here about the level of the penalties imposed.  For my part I am rather doubtful.  It is worth pointing out that widespread dissatisfaction exists among the public at the inadequacy of the fines imposed not alone in respect of traffic law but in respect of many other laws.  With regard to second and subsequent offences of uninsured driving, a tougher line should be taken, and I said this on Second Stage.  The Minister has said that there is a recognition that more severe action is necessary and, therefore, the disqualification period is extended. However, given the gravity of the problem, <Col N="1059" /> there is a compelling case to impose a penalty, by which I mean forfeiture of the vehicle for second and subsequent offences of uninsured driving.  I would welcome the Minister's reaction to that suggestion, especially in the light of the very major problem of uninsured driving which everybody admits is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I take the point regarding second and subsequent offences and confiscation of the vehicle.  We should consider that.  The House is aware that we are dealing with penalties in this Bill but we are also reviewing the whole traffic code and traffic law.  Therefore, in any changes we make we can examine that point.  We will see if the changes will have any effect and if they have no effect then certainly we will consider the question of confiscation of the vehicle.  I am slow to be as arbitrary as that, but we are making a change.  We are moving the penalty up a grade, making it harder.  If that does not operate satisfactorily then we will examine the question of heavier penalties and that would include reviewing the question of confiscation of vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the Minister has come into this House today with his mind made up in connection with this Bill, especially as regard the amendments.  I cannot accept what he has stated about the minimum and maximum penalties.  He is saying to us here today that it is up to the Judiciary to impose whatever fine they consider suitable from £1 up to a maximum of £1,000 and he has defined categories of people whom he thinks it would be an injustice to fine £100 minimum.  That immediately defeats the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on a previous occasion things which perhaps the Minister did not like me to say and I will say them again now. It is not to solve the problem that this Bill is being brought in but to collect money. The Minister has said that a minimum fine for certain categories could be nil on the one hand or it could be £5 or £10, depending upon the type of people who will come before the Judiciary.  That will not solve the problem of uninsured drivers <Col N="1060" /> in any way, and that is why we put this amendment down.  I regret very much that the Minister is not accepting it and that his mind was made up completely on his way to the Seanad in connection with these amendments.  The Minister's rejection of our amendments will do nothing to curb uninsured driving or inadvertent non-insurance of vehicles. We thought we were fair in mentioning £100.  We thought that that was a sizeable amount and that the Minister would agree to it immediately if he is to solve the problem at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has indicated that we were not serious and that really the purpose of this Bill is to collect more money.  If we were to take that view on board we would certainly accept these amendments for minimum penalties because that might be a means of collecting more money.  However, we are not accepting these amendments.  We believe in justice and in its operation and application.  The courts are there to apply justice.  We set the terms of fines and, as I said earlier, I have faith in the Judiciary. They know the problems and we are giving them discretion in this, but if we tie their hands their response would be, &ldquo;This is what the legislators want and this is what we will give, the minimum fines, the £100 and £350&rdquo; and they will operate on an on-going basis.  That would have the effect of defeating the whole purpose of what I am about by increasing these fines from £100 to £1,000 and, on the question of insurance, in the second offence increasing the disqualification period from six months to 12 months.  I do not think that what is requested by these amendments would be helpful or would do what we are setting out to do in this Bill which basically is to increase penalties to ensure that people feel the effects of breaking the law.  Any attempt by me to impose the minimum penalties would be detrimental to that.</P>

      <P>Because of the serious nature of the offence I believe it should be five years.  In 1961, 30 motor vehicles were unlawfully taken and in 1983, 19,484 vehicles were taken.  That gives you an indication of the seriousness of this problem.  We have to deal with this in a serious way.  There has been loss of <Col N="1062" /> life and serious accidents.  People have been taking cars habitually and walking out of the courts free.  While for the normal summary conviction we are talking about £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both, the Garda may refer a case to the Director of Public Prosecutions to see if the offence warrants a trial by judge and jury.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions decides that the seriousness of the case warrants this measure, then the defendant will go before the judge and jury and will be subject &mdash; because of the seriousness of the offences &mdash; to the five years in jail.  That is a reasonable approach given the carnage we have seen as a result of the unlawful taking of cars. I may have used the word &lsquo;joyriding&rsquo; but I withdraw that and call the offence vandalism of the worst type.  It must be stopped.  We are not seeking a five-year sentence for people who take a car without the owner's consent because we have the fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both for that.  But, if in the view of the Garda the situation is serious and warrants heavier penalties, they have the right to refer it to the DPP who will decide whether the defendant should be sent for trial by judge and jury.  Thereafter it is up to the courts to determine what sentence is passed, with a maximum of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has a very interesting and colourful history because it first surfaced not in a road traffic Bill but in the original draft of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I quote from the Official Report of the Dáil of 2 November 1983, columns 1263 and 1264 when the Minister for Justice said that the taking of cars&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>is now a major social problem that is causing deaths, serious injuries and damage to property.  There are frequent reports of people being terrorised by high-powered cars being driven at reckless speeds through the streets, or police cars being rammed and so on. Cars are not just taken by youngsters ... This offence has got to be stamped out.  Section 12 of the Bill proposes to make the offence indictable and to increase the penalties.  On conviction <Col N="1063" /> on indictment the penalty will be a maximum of five years imprisonment and a fine of up to £2,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The fact that there is already a power of arrest without warrant for the offence and that it will henceforth carry a five-year sentence means that the Garda will be able to detain suspects under the powers given by section 3.</P>
    <P>That was section 3 of the Criminal Justice Bill.  The Minister is being, to say the least of it, coy by giving us all sorts of reasons why a five-year sentence is being introduced and leaving out the precise reason.  Again, this particular clause surfaced when it was transferred to this Bill. In the Dáil debate on 20 June 1984 the Minister for the Environment said that because the unlawful taking of cars is now a more serious and pervasive problem than was the case when the 1961 Act was introduced, it was proposed to provide also for the option of trial by jury, conviction on indictment and so on.  It escapes me why an offence becomes more serious because it becomes more frequent.  For instance I do not think parking becomes more serious because it becomes more frequent.  Both Deputy Molloy and Deputy Brady agreed.  Let us get this offence into perspective.  We are not talking about people who vandalise cars, because that is an offence.  We are not talking about people who dangerously drive cars, because that is an offence. We are not talking about people who ram Garda cars, because that is an offence.  I am surprised at the Minister in that I would have thought he would have had the original Act at his disposal.  The offence is not just taking possession of, it is that &ldquo;a person shall not use or take possession of a mechanically-propelled vehicle&rdquo;.  The best advice I can get is that that incorporates somebody who is knowingly a passenger in a car which is unlawfully taken possession of.  What we are saying is that somebody who is knowingly a passenger in a car which is taken possession of is, at least in theory, liable to a five-year sentence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> The Minister made some comment during the Seanad debate in reference to something I had said.  Let me make it clear: I was not under an illusion that there was a mandatory five-year sentence.  I fully appreciate what the section in this Bill means.  The fact that I appreciate it is the reason I find it quite extraordinary. Let me be perfectly clear.  What this proposes to do &mdash; as the Minister for Justice said but as the Minister for the Environment left out and as the junior Minister left out &mdash; is to bring the unlawful taking possession of or the using of a car within the ambit of those offences for which somebody can be arrested and questioned under the proposals contained in the Criminal Justice Bill.  Let me read out what is in that Bill as it will be introduced here tomorrow:</P>
    <P>The section applies to any offence for which a person of full age and capacity may...</P>
    <P>and I am reading selectively from it</P>
    <P>...for a term of five years or to an attempt to commit any such offence. </P>
    <P>What the section proposes to do is to enable any member of the Garda to arrest, detain, and detain for questioning anybody who he believes or has reasonable cause to suspect, has either taken possession of or attempted to take possession of a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>
    <P>I do not know the logic behind this.  I do not understand what is behind this and why there is such extraordinary panic about it.  Of course, there is a problem about cars being stolen.  Nobody is trying to deny that, but to change from a position where the maximum sentence was six months to a position where the maximum sentence is five years requires a little bit more elaboration than the Minister has given us.  Let me remind the House again that recent figures &mdash; I quote from the Minister's Second Stage speech &mdash; show that 46 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents had a high blood alcohol level.  In other words, the evidence is there that drunken driving is still a major problem and results in substantial numise <Col N="1065" /> bers of death.  We do not know anything about the innocent victims of such drunken driving.  Yet the maximum custodial sentence for that fundamental anti-social behaviour is six months.  The maximum custodial sentence for stealing or taking possession of a car &mdash; not for doing anything else, not for crashing it, or driving fast, knocking anybody down with it, or being involved in an armed robbery &mdash; is five years.  What that effectively will do is give <i>carte blanche</i> to a garda to arrest anybody he suspects of stealing a car.</P>
    <P>Since the incidence of this particular problem is very high in our built-up urban areas and since the evidence from the Garda Commissioner's report is that one-third of serious offences can be attributed to people under the age of 17, this provision will apply in a special way to young people aged 17 and under.  I do not think that anybody has thought out the consequences of this.  As the Minister says, there were something like 19,000 vehicles taken without the owners' permission last year.  Does that give us 19,000 suspects?  Let me remind the House that in other areas where gardaí can arrest people without warrant on suspicion, for instance the Offences Against the State Act, there is about a nine to one ratio of people who are arrested and not prosecuted to those who are actually prosecuted for something.</P>
    <P>We had 19,000 offences of taking cars. How many people will be arrested on suspicion because this proposal will enable people to be arrested on suspicion when or if &mdash; I hope it is an &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; the Criminal Justice Bill becomes law.  That is what I find objectionable about this; to pick out one offence out of all the list of offences under the Road Traffic Acts and say this is the one under which people will be able to be arrested without warrant. I know there is a provision under the drunken driving offences for people to be arrested.  We can all understand why.  Of all the other offences and crimes, we pick out this offence of unlawfully taking cars and we make it an indictable offence.  The Minister for the Environment made it clear because it is worrying many people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> I do not believe that increasing penalties of itself makes the least difference to people.  I do not think the people who stole the 19,000 cars last year would be particularly impressed by the fact that they can now be imprisoned for 12 months or for five years.  The evidence of criminologists who studied this over and over again is overwhelming.  Penalties for offences do not seem to act as a deterrent. This is true in the case of capital punishment and tragically it is true in Belfast because there have been a considerable number of young joyriders shot dead and it has not stopped the problem, or the possibility of being shot, as a Senator Rogers would tell us if she was here.  If anything, it apparently has increased the tendency to do it.</P>
    <P>In this proposal lies a representation of the values of our society which says that taking a car without permission is a more serious offence than taking a car out on the road when you are unfit to do so through the consumption of alcohol and are a threat to the rest of humanity.  It says that the penalty for that is substantially higher than the penalty for driving while drunk or driving while uninsured, two things which endanger the health of the rest of society far more than the unlawful taking of a car.  That is what is wrong and that is why I object so strongly to this proposal.  It is a statement of our society's values which is extraordinarily perverse.</P>
    <P>Somebody who was in the country at the weekend said when addressing politicians that there was a battle raging outside. There is a battle raging outside.  It is a battle about whether we, as politicians, understand anything about what is happening out there.  In the offence where our age group and our class are most liable to be culpable, that is the crime of driving while under the influence of alcohol, we have a reasonable but severe penalty.  It is six months imprisonment and the deprivation of a driving licence.  For a crime that is identifiably associated in large parts with younger people we produce this extraordinary draconian proposal of a five-year sentence. What it will actually produce is something equivalent to the British laws <Col N="1067" /> where a garda will effectively be able to stop and arrest any young person he sees acting suspiciously in or around a car. The provision in the Criminal Justice Bill means that either the offence or an attempt to commit the offence will enable a person to be arrested.  That is why it is so important that such a wide-ranging and sweeping proposal as this extending as it does into the Criminal Justice Bill, should be taken out of the provisions of that Bill.  It is not a sufficiently serious offence.  As it stands, this amendment is probably the first major abuse of the Criminal Justice Bill.  What will happen is that every time there is a furore about an offence we will produce an amendment with a minimum sentence of five years.  The new offence can be investigated irrespective of the seriousness or otherwise of the offence.  What it does is give a licence to the Garda to detain, which will be used against not just ten or 20 people but thousands of people.</P>
    <P>The public pressure on the Garda to do something about stealing cars because of the symbolic value that cars have to those of us who are well off in society will be such that they will have to be seen to take action.  The action that will be taken will be the effective sweeping detention of suspected car thieves which this section will make feasible.  I object very strongly to this proposal.  It effectively identifies the Oireachtas for what it is: a collection of more or less middle-aged people with the preoccupations of middle age, with their bits of property and their extensions of themselves which they polish up every Sunday when they cannot polish up anything else.  It is objectionable in principle. It should not be there and it should not be used in order to satisfy an immediate and short-term worry of public opinion. That is why I put in a simple amendment to reduce the penalty to four years.  I do not feel happy about four years but it keeps it out of the category of what are called serious offences.  I will not accept that a youngster taking a car without the owner's permission is somehow guilty of a vastly more serious offence than anyone of the respectable members of society who drives home regularly and frequently under the influence of alcohol. <Col N="1068" /> The second is a far more serious offence and I fully support the amendment introduced by Senator O'Toole.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan stole my thunder.  The Minister did not answer my two questions.  To the question what offences are covered by this subsection, the Minister replied that with regard to a person taking a car, the word was changed from joyriding.  That, of course, was covered adequately by Senator Ryan in his submissions.  If I was asked to travel across this city this evening in any Senator's car to collect a message, if I were pulled up and asked the registration number of the car, I probably would not know because the car belongs to somebody else.  Under this legislation, I could be taken in immediately on suspicion of having stolen the car.  I can, first of all, be held for six hours and on the intervention of a chief superintendent, detained for a further six hours.  If it goes over the overtime period of that investigator, I could be held for 20 hours.  I am an innocent person on a message for a colleague, but under the Bill I would be a suspect.  If approached by a garda, I may not give him sufficient information to satisfy him that the car has not been stolen and I could be taken into custody on several counts.  The Minister only covered one of the counts.  He gave the impression to the House and, I believe, misled the House.</P>
      <P>Thousands of the cars stolen are stolen by juveniles.  If they continue to be imprisoned for five years, no number of Loughan Houses or any other houses provided by the State will harbour the many people who will come under the Bill.  They are very plentiful in the city of Dublin and in other cities.  They will continue to come on stream, day in, day out Senator Ryan is correct in his objections to the penalty.  Who knows the penalty for an offence before he commits the offence? People parking on a double yellow line do not know what they are going to be fined, prior to this Bill and will not know after it.  Many Senators including myself do not know the penalty for minor or casual offences, to which I will be coming in another amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what the Minister evaded and on <Col N="1069" /> which he misled the House completely was that the only reason for the five-year imprisonment was to bring it under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Justice Bill, as rightly said by Senator Ryan.  We want it to be four years imprisonment so that it will not come under that Bill.  The Minister has not given sufficient information to us and we will be opposing this with all our might.  We hope to get support. It is a dangerous thing to cause many more people to be brought into the net without having the prisons or juvenile homes to harbour them.  Innocent people will be brought in off the street.  People going about their business can now be arrested on suspicion and held for up to 20 hours under the Bill.  That is why we are objecting to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has said many of the things that I would wish to say.  The amendments were put down to try to stop innocent people being brought in under the Criminal Justice Bill.  Juveniles who are stealing cars from Prussia Street or any other place will continue to do so and no amount of penalties will deter them. More education and better upbringing in the home will do more than this Bill to curb that type of offence.  We will be opposing this bitterly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators opposite are underrating the importance of this section because car stealing in itself is not simply, as Senator Ryan has been suggesting, the stealing of the comfortable man's and woman's car from the driveway outside their house.  It is also the vehicle that is used so often in the course of robberies, kidnapping offences, or a wide range of criminal offences that are all too well known to every Member of this House.  Only a matter of a month ago, I was speaking to a detective-sergeant in Kevin Street Garda station who told me from his recent experience that during the Saturday night period for which he would be on duty, he would come upon six to eight cars that he knew were stolen and were used in robberies or some other heinous activity, including perhaps assaults on people in their homes in the middle of the night by those who stole <Col N="1070" /> the cars.  These vehicles are being used to get to and get away fast from a scene of not just robbing a household but giving the individual living there the greatest degree of harassment possible.</P>
      <P>The only way in which that detective-sergeant or anybody else can deal with it is to ask somebody suspected of being in a vehicle that is being stolen to present the insurance certificate at the Garda station within 10 days.  As I understand it, the presentation of the insurance certificate is about the only way in which gardaí can operate at present.  Car stealing has become a vast problem.  It involves not only the 19,000 that the Minister has just spoken of but the consequent expensive claims for malicious damages on the local authorities &mdash; and many Members of the Seanad are or have been local authority members.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Donnybrook district superintendent, not in my public capacity but in connection with my car which was stolen four or five months ago and has not been seen since.  He said 750 or 800 cars are stolen there annually, ranging now from two to three per day.  This is having very unfortunate effects of huge financial consequence to many who are depending on their cars for work and for their daily lives.  In a period when people find it difficult to replace their cars, one can give too scant importance to the motor vehicle in conducting business, getting children to school and so on.  The particular time of the day or night of the stealing will dictate whether that car is being delivered over the Border into Northern Ireland or taken on a ferry across the Irish Sea.  Car stealing is a very large bonanza to people who are obviously dealing with the stealing of cars in a business way and it has led to a very big racket to which this country has to respond and the Seanad is right to do so.</P>
      <P>We are obviously talking here about an indictable offence which should only be involved as the Minister has stressed, in rare circumstances when the Garda Síochána believe that there is a situation which has to be dealt with severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendments proposed by Senator <Col N="1071" /> O'Toole and Senator Ryan.  Their effect would be identical and would reduce the maximum penalty in subsection (b) to four years.  There is not very much I can add to what Senator Ryan and Senator O'Toole have said with the utmost eloquence.  In reply to what Senator FitzGerald has just said, neither amendment is trivialising this offence or suggesting that it should not be penalised. They would still allow a sentence of four years which is a considerable sentence. Either amendment would make a very considerable difference in that it would bring the offence out of the Criminal Justice Bill, which Senator O'Toole, Senator Ryan and I are particularly concerned about.</P>
      <P>I am not standing over the right of people to steal cars.  Like Senator FitzGerald I had my own car stolen and it was involved in one of these cross-Border rackets he referred to, of large numbers of cars being stolen and taken across the Border.  On the other hand, those are separate offences.  They all carry penalties.  If we want to deal with the use of stolen cars for committing offences, or the use of stolen cars in various other ways, or dangerous driving in stolen cars, we can deal with them under those particular offences.  This is not the offence of running a cross-Border racket. It is not the offence of dangerous driving. It is not the offence of using a car in the commission of a robbery.  It is simply the offence of taking a car.  Therefore, it is misleading and confusing to try to mix up the two things.  If there has been culpability of another sort, it is up to us to bring charges and to adjust penalties for those offences, and not to attach the whole thing to the offence of taking a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to underline what Senator Ryan said about the contrast between this and the penalties for drunken driving which, after all, is also an extremely frequent offence and one which is very serious and can lead to loss of life, as can the dangerous driving of a stolen car.  To change the maximum penalty to up to five years in contrast to six months for drunken driving seems to me to be adopting a wrong set of priorities.  Another thing that worried me about bringing it <Col N="1072" /> into the ambit of the Criminal Justice Bill is the business of being able to arrest without warrant where any kind of suspicion arises.  Senator O'Toole has dealt with this to some extent, but there is one aspect I should like to remark on.</P>
    <P>Many young people who never commit offences and who are perfectly law-abiding citizens are developing a very poor attitude towards the Garda Síochána, partly because they are stopped and questioned quite often when they are going about their legitimate business.  If we bring in this sort of penalty for an offence which undoubtedly is committed very much by young people and allow this kind of treatment of suspects, we will build up more and more resentment between the young population and the police force.  This is a very bad situation.</P>
    <P>Our obeying of the law is not dependent only on what offences are brought in by statute or under the common law.  Nor is it only because of the penalties we impose.  It is also because of the attitude of the community to law breaking, to keeping the law and to the functions of the police.  If young people see the police as their natural enemies, even when they are not committing any offences, and when they are perfectly law-abiding people, this is a very dangerous move to make.  In my experience that is growing among people in their late teens, early twenties and so on.  They never commit offences and they are perfectly normal citizens but they are beginning to feel the police are their natural enemies.  This section which brings in all the powers of the Criminal Justice Bill for this type of offence will aggravate this situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think taking a car is necessarily a trivial offence.  The amendments which I am supporting still leave a sentence of four years which is no mean sentence.  It takes the matter out of the Criminal Justice Bill and that is something we should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which is contributing to the growing problem of joyriding and car stealing is the poor quality of the locking systems with which most cars, even very expensive cars, are fitted.  On Second Stage the Minister said <Col N="1073" /> he proposes to make regulations requiring the fitting of laminated windscreens to all new motor vehicles registered on or after 1 July 1985.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is considering making regulations requiring the fitting of more effective locking systems or anti-theft devices in all cars at some future date. Even the most expensive cars are fitted with locking systems which would appear to present very little difficulty to even the most amateur car thief.  If more complicated locking systems were provided, they could alleviate the problem of the taking of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer some of the points raised.  Senator Ryan indicated that this aspect of the Bill was singled out, that is the taking of cars, and made an indictable offence under the Criminal Justice Bill.  Dangerous driving, which is at present the only indictable offence, also carries a five year sentence. There is a certain degree of consistency in making this an indictable offence.  It also comes under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is not correct to say this is singled out.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise what we are talking about here.  We are talking about serious crime.  We all know that most serious crimes, armed robberies and subversive activities are committed in stolen vehicles.  There is no question about that. When the Garda are satisfied that a serious crime is contemplated, or has taken place they have an obligation to use the powers given to them.  For summary offences the penalty is 12 months in prison or £1,000, or both.  That will be the norm.  Nobody should be under any illusion about that.  We all know serious crimes are taking place night after night. Stolen cars are used to commit these serious offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are updating the law and making it more meaningful.  The Garda can refer a case to the DPP and he will make a decision as to whether it should go to a judge and jury, or he may tell the Garda to deal with it themselves.  The Garda will decide whether it is a summary case. When they have reason to believe that <Col N="1074" /> serious offences have been committed or are about to be committed, in my view they have an obligation and that is the underlying factor in this Bill.  It is not, as some Senators have said, an attack on the younger generation.  It is an attack on serious and violent crime which has been allowed to run riot and rampant over the past few years.  It is time we dealt with serious crime in a firm and effective manner. Basically that is what we are talking about and what we are proposing under the criminal justice code and to say otherwise is denying the facts.  What we are doing here is to get at the hardened criminals and subversives who are driving a coach and four through the legal system, who are walking into our courts daily and walking out, smiling and laughing at us. It is time this House and the other House took this matter by the scruff of the neck and dealt with in a positive way.  That is why I would have to reject the amendment. We are not about to hound people. We are after people who are stealing cars and we are attempting to cut down this dreadful theft of 20,000 vehicles a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever reflections I was casting the Minister has thrown a few around himself.  I wish the Minister would explain if we are talking about armed robberies.  I thought Committee Stage of a Bill was a very precise procedure in which we talked about precisely defined issues.  The precisely defined issue we are talking about here is section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  It does not say anything more except:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person shall not use to take possession <Col N="1075" /> of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner thereof or other lawful authority.</P>
    <P>That is the offence for which we are proposing a maximum sentence of five years. I assume the Minister is right.  I am not sufficiently knowledgeable on procedure to say it is for the Garda and the DPP whether the matter be sent forward for trial by jury or be dealt with summarily. I assume that is the way it operates but that is not the entire implication of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If it was simply a question of dealing with those who use stolen cars to pursue one or other crime.  I do not think we would have much objection.  Surely it is not outside the wit of the parliamentary draftsman to draft a clause in a Bill which says precisely that, that it shall be an offence punishable by a maximum sentence of five years in indictment for using a mechanically propelled vehicle for some purpose like robbery.  To produce such a global proposal as this to deal with the admittedly serious problem of the use of cars for armed robbery or for serious offences is not in any way to develop a proportionate response.  We could just as easily have said that using a car without insurance could involve a maximum sentence of five years because presumably all those who take cars for armed robbery and things like that are not insured either. We could go through a whole list of things but this one is picked out.  The reason this one is picked out is because there is a public outcry about the alleged widespread stealing of cars.</P>
    <P>Of course we are all concerned that cars should not be stolen.  The Minister can produce all the smokescreen he wants about people walking free from the courts.  The interesting point is that people keep saying this but nobody has produced any hard factual evidence to sustain that particular contention that people are walking free out of the courts because of inadequacies.  If there are such cases we would be interested to hear of them and we would love to hear the Government's proposal to deal with them.  What we hear are allegations and <Col N="1076" /> opinions of people who produce nothing to sustain them.  The Minister produced a magnificent smokescreen of armed robbers and God knows what else terrorising the countryside.  Of course that is a problem but that is not the problem we are talking about here.  The problem we are talking about here is that any garda in the country will have the power under the Criminal Justice Bill where he suspects that a person driving a car or in a car is guilty of being unlawfully in possession of the car to detain that person for questioning for six hours and then with the support of his chief superintendent for another six hours.  That is the issue here.  It is not armed robbery, it is not terrorising old people, it is the fact that without any qualification anybody can be arrested if a garda believes that he has a reasonable suspicion that that person is in unlawful possession of a car.  As any of us who have been stopped at a garda checkpoint knows, one of the garda's favourite questions is to ask what is the number of your car.  Is it a reasonable suspicion if somebody does not know the number of the car?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is being fair or reasonable.  He is not addressing the question that we are putting to him, he is addressing an entirely different one. What cars are used for is not the question. We are not talking about cars being stolen for material gain because that is a separate offence, as the Minister for Justice indicated to the Dáil last year.  Taking a car to sell it is a separate offence as against taking a car without the owner's permission.  There is no connection between the two and the other one is adequately dealt with in respect of penalties. The issue here is that every single person whom a garda suspects of being unlawfully in possession of a car may be arrested and detained for questioning, not because the garda suspect the person is going to do something else unlawful, not because he thinks he has done something else unlawful, not because he thinks the person has robbed a bank or a house, but just because he thinks he should not be in that car.  That is the issue.  I wish the Minister would address himself to it and explain why it is necessary to have a <Col N="1077" /> penalty here so that anybody who is suspected of unlawful possession and nothing else can be detained for questioning. Why is that necessary &mdash; not why is it necessary when something else happens but why is it necessary just for that issue because that is what is in the Bill the Minister has before him and nothing else?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we were acting responsibly here this evening.  I thought it was our duty to do so and that we were teasing out this matter as best we could.  We have examined this matter in depth.  We do not stand up here and make statements that we cannot stand over.  I do not like the remark of the Minister that we are pussyfooting here for any particular reason.  The crime he is trying to portray here, of armed robbery, of kidnapping and taking cars and ramming them against squad cars is punishable in its own way.  There is legislation to deal with that.  We are not asking for very much: we are only asking for a reduction of one year.  As Senator McGuinness said, a four-year penalty is a fairly stiff penalty for anybody who takes a car to go joyriding or whatever a few miles down the street, abandons it and is caught for doing so.  A four-year period in Loughan House or some other juvenile prison is a substantial time.  We are approaching this very sensibly.  The Minister seemed to be somewhat ruffled, which indicates that he is not happy with that section.  We are only asking him to accept the amendment substituting four years for five years.  That will satisfy this side of the House and will meet the requirements the Minister may have in mind.  Innocent people going about their business should not be taken in for questioning and that is what is being proposed in this Bill.  The Minister is bringing innocent people into the net and I cannot see why he will not accept our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Garda are satisfied that an offence has been committed and that somebody has stolen a vehicle, they have a right to arrest and detain that person for a period but they <Col N="1078" /> must be satisfied that an offence has been committed.  I do not think that is being unreasonable.  When they are satisfied that the car may have been used or was about to be used for more serious offences they should refer that to the DPP. If they were not satisfied, they would institute a summary case before the District Court and the 12 months suspension from driving or £1,000 fine or both are imposed.  I do not think there is any great terror or problem here.  I accept Senator O'Toole's point that he wants to take it out of the Criminal Justice Bill by lowering the sentence to four years but, given the experience over the last number of years and the serious escalation of crime, especially in relation to car stealing, it should remain.  I am satisfied that the Garda will use discretion where they are satisfied that the car was taken for reasons other than for serious crime and that it would be dealt with in a summary way.  If a passenger is in the car knowing that the car has been stolen or is in the process of being stolen, then he is also guilty by association as he is in other cases; there is no question about that.</P>
      <P>I do not share the anxiety of Senators that this will cause tremendous hardship and will be seen as some penal and draconian way of getting at young people. We are trying to get at people who are engaged in serious crime and about to be engaged in serious crime.  It is important that they are held and that when the Garda are satisfied and have evidence, that such an offence should be referred to the DPP I am satisfied that that is an appropriate way to deal with this aspect of the Bill and I do not see any reason for accepting the amendment.  Given what has happened and what is happening on a day-to-day basis this is a reasonable approach to dealing with serious crime and it is only the question of serious crime that we are talking about and making this an indictable offence.  As I indicated previously, dangerous driving is an indictable offence and it is covered under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Bill as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been much more responsive on this occasion <Col N="1079" /> but it is not a question of the Garda having evidence that somebody has stolen a car.  If they have evidence they can charge them.  Under the combination of this section of the Road Traffic Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill a garda who with reasonable cause suspects a person of either committing the offence or attempting to commit the offence can then detain him and can then go and look for the evidence afterwards.  That is what I am bothered about.  It is not a question of the Garda having evidence; it is a question of the Garda having a reasonable suspicion.  The second and related point is about taking possession of a car.  If I, for instance, borrow my brother's car without his permission I am now technically under suspicion.  The implications of taking possession of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner are far more widespread.</P>
      <P>It is bad law to concentrate on the extreme manifestation of an offence and use that as rationalisation for dealing with the offence.  There are a great number of possibilities and considerations for the taking of a vehicle, which range from the one the Minister has justifiably outlined about the use of cars for serious crime to kids who foolishly borrow a car or foolishly joyride in a car and do no more harm that that.  The offence is so widespread and has such variations in gravity and seriousness &mdash; I repeat it is in many cases so predominantly an offence which is attributable to young people &mdash; that the consequence of this section, coupled with the Criminal Justice Bill, would be to create very serious tension between large sections of our young people and the Garda.  If I were to be too emotive I could say we were building the fires of far more of the sort of thing we regrettably saw in Slane last Sunday.  If we create this sort of widespread power for the Garda to detain and question people about what is in itself an offence of very varying gravity, I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the case of dangerous driving is completely opposite to the case which carries the same offence, because in the case of dangerous driving the occupants of the car <Col N="1080" /> are not taken in and are not questioned. Therefore, it is not fair to say that a case of dangerous driving is the equivalent of an indictable offence.  The people in the car are not taken in for questioning as will be the case if this Bill is passed where all the occupants of the car are liable to be taken in for questioning and held for a period of 20 hours.  I can see tractors all over the country being taken by farmers &mdash; because they know that the owner is away at the mart &mdash; and being used for chores on their own land.  If they are accosted and approached on the way to their own farms they can be brought in technically under this Bill also.  There are many such cases, and we are trying to avoid bringing this category of person under the Bill by asking for the four years.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in connection with the four years so as to avoid bringing such cases under the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the other indictable offence, that of dangerous driving, and the question of arrest.  The only person who would be committing the offence there would be the driver who would, and can, be brought in for questioning.  If two, four or more cars are stolen, the drivers could be committing an offence.  For that reason they are all guilty by association and can be brought in for questioning.  I do not think there is a relationship there in that sense.</P>

      <P>No. Senator Ryan indicated that this legislation was singled out under the traffic code and I indicated that dangerous driving was also an indictable offence under section 4, carrying a five-year sentence.  All I said was that it was not singled out and for that reason I do not see any relationship at all.  I think we are being consistent and the law too will be consistent.  Only people who may be guilty of an offence will be questioned or arrested if the Garda are satisfied that an offence was committed.  Senator Ryan may have misinterpreted what I said &mdash;<Col N="1081" /> that where the Garda have reason to believe that a car was stolen, they can arrest and detain.  That is not being unreasonable.  It is not a question of driving wedges between society and young people, or some sort of witch-hunt on young people.</P>

      <P>That is not the spirit of the Bill.  The stealing of cars is a serious offence.  As I indicated earlier a number of persons have lost their lives as a result of dangerous driving by people who steal cars.  They do not set out to cause such accidents but because of their inability to drive or because of their recklessness they cause loss of life.  We should not take lightly the question of stealing a car <Col N="1082" /> and I do not think the House does, but there is a much broader area which we have to look at and that is what I am endeavouring to do.</P>
      <P>This is not intended to be a draconian measure, or some sort of witch-hunt on young people: it is there to plug gaps in our laws that are being used and abused by people for devious and serious ends.</P>
      <P>I understand why the amendments are put down and I understand these reasons, but I hope Senators will appreciate why I cannot accept them.  I have strong views on this.  We have considered these amendments and believe that in the interests of public safety and the community this is the best way forward.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> We think the increase in fines here from £50 to £150 is too severe for the type of trivial offences being provided for &mdash; the wearing of seat belts and parking offences of a minor nature.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator knows I do not wish to be awkward, but I cannot accept the amendment.  The offences relate to dangerous parking of vehicles and we are all aware of the very careless way in which many people park their cars on roads and at dangerous bends.  This involves serious loss of life.  A colleague of mine in this House was the victim of such careless parking when he ran into the back of a vehicle and suffered serious injury.  The offenders are people who do not care, and to contemplate reducing the fines provided for in the Bill would be wrong.  Senator Ryan indicated earlier that penalties did not make any difference, but when the penalties were increased for drunken driving in 1978 a substantial difference was noticeable. The penalties must bite, but many of the penalties now in existence have no relevance whatsoever &mdash; people just take the easy way out, take the chance and completely disregard other road users.</P>
      <P>If people are not prepared to consider others we have to impose fines and introduce penalties to change their attitudes. Those responsible for companies must be held liable also.  It is for that reason that I do not wish to accept the amendment. I agree with the penalties suggested.  We should keep this area of legislation under review and if it is found that the penalties are not adequate we should introduce an amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of reply I expected from the Minister.  He quoted again the dangerous truck that was parked when his colleague, the late Mr. Gerry Sweetman, lost his life, and other similar cases in the same way that he quoted offences in relation to my other amendments.  I agree with the Minister that parking a truck on a dangerous bend <Col N="1084" /> unattended and unlit could cause death and I would favour the heavy penalty for such an offence.  However, I am concerned about the minor offences.  He did not make allowances for the man who casually delivers or collects a message.  I quoted such cases as an ambulance pick-up, delivery by Post Office vans, ESB trucks or vans.  In their ordinary day-to-day chores under the Bill they will be liable to increased fines.  If the Minister defined in the Bill the categories of people who would be exempt I would be satisfied.  I put down the amendment in the hope that the Minister would accept that too many people were taken into this net and liable to increased penalties.  This Bill will penalise many people and force them to park outside a town.  If I am travelling to my home town of Louisburg I have to ask my son to drive me there because of the bad parking facilities.  If I double park in this town I am liable under this Bill to increased penalties.</P>
      <P>There are no facilities provided by the Department of the Environment for parking.  Whatever the Minister may have said on Second Stage he must realise that people must get some type of parking area before he introduces this legislation. It was mentioned on Second Stage that the Minister was putting the cart before the horse and that is exactly what he is doing.  He is introducing legislation to increase penalties without providing sufficient parking areas.  That is the only objection we have to the Bill.  We support the Minister in providing the maximum fine for dangerous parking, parking that may result in road accidents, and have done so in the past.</P>
      <P>As Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned, those who drafted the Bill did not take into consideration the type of people that will now be liable.  The garda who has completed four or five months training in Templemore will be deciding whether to charge a person or not.  It will depend on the person one meets.  The Bill should be defined more clearly.  We should have maximum penalties for the people who are creating the hazards and exclude the people who park casually to hop into a shop or other location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that in relation to the increased fines, the courts have discretion as to the amount of the fines that will be imposed for parking offences?  If there is discretion many of Senator O'Toole's fears are unnecessary. I expect there is discretion.  One criticism I have with certain aspects of different Road Traffic Acts is that for some offences the district justice or the judge has no discretion but is obliged to impose a certain penalty.  I would depend on the common sense of the justice hearing the case to decide on the degrees of danger or risk created by the unlighted dirty truck on a roadside at night or the farmer stopping in a gateway to drop in a bale of hay or even the person who is obliged to stop to change a wheel.  There is a scale there.  If the justice has discretion within that scale I would not worry about the fines being increased.  I would like the Minister to confirm that there is discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the justice has discretion.  We are not imposing any minimum obligation on a justice.  Senator O'Toole was concerned about casual parking.  That is dealt with and one is still liable to a fine of £150.  As the Senator is aware, that will be an on-the-spot fine. When the Bill is passed we will determine what the on-the-spot fines will be in relation to the various offences.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals specifically with dangerous parking.  We must emphasise that. If people park in an area where they are not entitled to park they will be subject to an on-the-spot fine which will be determined later.  Where we are satisfied that somebody is parking in a dangerous way that could cause a serious accident, then obviously that will not be subject to an on-the-spot fine but will be a matter for the court.  The justice will exercise his discretion based on the presentation of the case.  Casual parking will be dealt with by an on-the-spot fine.</P>

      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister to provide weighbridges every five miles?  This could not be done. We will be lucky if we have a weighbridge in every town or every county.  There are only a couple of weighbridges in County Mayo at the moment and the same applies to every other county.  The Minister should be more specific as to where he is going to provide weighbridges.  Will there be checkpoints throughout the country at given places, whether it be across the Shannon, at the entry to Dublin port, at the entry to the Rosslare ferry service?  He should tell us now before we begin to tease out this section. I spoke about the harassment of an articulated truck driver in trying to get a weighbridge when he is stopped by a garda.  If he passes Mullingar with 50 or 60 tonnes, unloads 10 tonnes in Kinnegad and is stopped by a garda in Enfield he avoids the penalty.  It depends on where the checkpoints will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money being provided each year from the Department of the Environment for the upkeep of our roads is not being used satisfactorily.  The amount now provided is less than was provided previously and the output is less still on maintenance.  Is the Minister saying that these weighbridges will be located at the <Col N="1087" /> ports of Dublin, Rosslare, Cork or elsewhere and that all the roads throughout rural Ireland can be carrying overweighted articulated trucks?  In fairness to the Seanad he must be more specific.  The idea of providing a weighbridge within five miles of where the truck driver has been accosted by a garda does not seem practicable.  I do not understand how it could be done but I would like to hear the Minister explain it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight misunderstanding here.  The Bill says that a truck driver cannot be obliged to go more than five miles to have a check done.  In other words, if he is stopped by a garda at a particular point which is not within the five mile radius he is not obliged to go further to have a check carried out. We are in the process of providing four more weighbridges in the coming years within the areas of Limerick Corporation, Dublin County Council, Louth County Council and Wicklow County Council.  That is only a start; there is an on-going programme.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole talked about a driver being checked after he had unloaded. The whole purpose of the penalty is to discourage people from breaking the law. There is no question of harassment.  We just want to ensure that the law is being enforced and that nobody is going to take advantage of carrying excess weights as against his competitor who is operating according to the law and is at an economic disadvantage.  People in the haulage business will see the equity in what we are doing.  We have relaxed the weights and, despite what the Senator said, we are spending £127 million this year on roads. That is a substantial sum of money and an investment that we have an obligation to protect.  It would be remiss of my Department if we did not.  I know from talking to hauliers that they themselves agree that people should not be allowed to overload while others are obeying the law.  If this is allowed it will cause serious problems on the roads because nobody will then feel obliged to obey the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weighbridges will be constructed in major traffic areas so that heavy vehicles can be monitored on an on-going basis. <Col N="1088" /> The monitoring will not cause any harassment. It will be done speedily and in the interests of all.  I assure the House and the Senator that we are not in the business of making life miserable for people who want to run a business but we want to ensure that we have reasonable rules and regulations and that some people are not allowed to abuse them to the disadvantage to their competitors. This is a reasonable approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>What criterion was used?  The Minister has chosen Louth, Dublin and Wicklow, three adjacant counties.  There is none in Connacht, none in Cork, none in Waterford, one in Limerick, Wicklow, Dublin and Louth. Could the Minister tell us what criterion was used in the selection of the locations for monitoring this heavy traffic?  There is only one in most of Munster and there is none at all in Connacht.  Did he say as was said before, &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo;? There is nothing for Connacht again, not even a weighbridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter directly related to this section.  With regard to the location of these weighbridges, very little of Clare is within five miles of Limerick.  The damage done to our county roads has been enormous in recent years.  Admittedly some of it was done in the interests of a good cause, the development of the lower Shannon region.  Massive loads of steel were carried on roads through south-west Clare. I do not know who is going to repair these roads or when they will be repaired but they have been simply split assunder.  A lot of that traffic would come through Limerick and if there is a weighbridge there it would cover that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have another type of traffic originating in the county and it is to that problem that I would refer the Minister. Most hauliers within the county, particularly the county council, will exercise the greatest care with the weight of material that they will transport on their trucks but there are other operators who are emerging, for example from concrete plants with very heavy loads of readymix concrete.  There are yet others emerging <Col N="1089" /> from quarries with twice the load a normal haulier would carry.  They need only travel four or five miles on a country road to do it permanent and extensive damage. In each of those cases that material will have been weighed as it leaves the quarry.  Can the Minister say if the certification of that weight is on the weight docket each lorry driver is supposed to carry?  Is that sufficient for the implementation of what is proposed here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I commend the Minister for endeavouring to tighten up the provisions of this section.  I share Senator O'Toole's reservations which have now been further articulated by Senator Howard.  If somebody is caught and is not within five miles of a weighbridge this law becomes inoperable.  Obviously we cannot compel that driver of a truck &mdash; even if the garda or whoever stops him has reason to suspect that he is carrying more than the required weight &mdash; to drive more than five miles to have the load weighed. There is not a sufficiency of weighbridges throughout the country in order to make this law operable.  Any Bill whose provisions are inoperable is a bad one.  Whereas I realise the Minister is trying to lay down standards, unless we can follow them up and implement the provisions to ensure such standards we are wasting our time. I am thinking particularly of country areas &mdash; one can talk about one's county better than anywhere else &mdash; where there is tremendous activity on the agricultural and forestry scenes, neither within ten miles of a town.  Because they are all country, minor, nondescript roads the local authority have to maintain them somehow out of a limited source of funds. They are all now being subjected to tremendous stress and strain.  This section of the Bill tells us we can do something about it whereas we are unable to do so. We have allowed an &ldquo;out&rdquo; as a result of the Minister's commitment that he would not enforce this law if there was not a weighbridge sited within five miles of where a person is stopped.  It is inoperable and from my knowledge it would be totally inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1090" />
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the five-mile limit, this is the law.  We may examine that to ascertain if we should extend it.  But I do not think the five-mile limit is the real matter at issue.  Senator O'Toole asked about Dublin County Council, Louth County Council, Wicklow County Council. Why?  I do not have specific reasons.  But I can say that in regard to Dublin County Council a lot of very heavy traffic comes through Dublin port.  In regard to Louth County Council, a large amount of traffic flows from the North of Ireland there, so I believe it is a reasonable place to site one.  In regard to Wicklow County Council there is a fair amount of traffic emanting from Rosslare, throughput, roll-on traffic.</P>
      <P>When you are making decisions like this, on an ongoing basis, as to where to site weighbridges you have to make judgments. They may not always be the best, depending on how one views it.  But I am satisfied that where they are to be sited makes reasonable sense.  We have an ongoing programme of providing weighbridges. This will not in any way inhibit what we are doing.  Once we are siting weighbridges we are endeavouring further to enforce the law.  I do not think the law we are creating is a bad law.  We may not have a sufficiency of weighbridges or mechanisms for testing but that should not prevent us from making a start.  There are 106 appointed weighbridges at various locations throughout the country, of which 43 are capable of weighing the largest combination of vehicles.  So we are not talking about four new weighbridges only.  We are also talking about existing ones.  The four new weighbridges form part of an ongoing programme.  A dynamic axle weigher was developed by local authorities a few years ago.  Cork had one.  I know its use was challenged in the High Court.  Now it can be used only for axle weight determinations.  Its use is limited.  Nonetheless it has a role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we have this ongoing programme.  On the question of a five-mile limit, I should say it could be ten miles and still it might not be the best or ideal mileage &mdash; but we can always <Col N="1091" /> look at that.  It is important that we site them in areas which carry heavy traffic. That will be the criterion for the installation of any kind of weighing machines. That will be the policy.  Limerick Corporation have one such machine in use.  Senator Howard mentioned the Clare area.  I am sure a lot of the traffic coming into Clare would come via Limerick.  I am not saying all of it does but once it is within a five-mile radius of Limerick it can be checked.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are making a positive and determined start on this.  It is important that we carry it out to the letter of the law as far as we can, given the equipment we have and where it is sited.  If we do not do that our roads will deteriorate before our eyes.  We have this impelling obligation to implement this ongoing programme. I am not satisfied that we have sufficient weighbridges but this year we have gone for four.  With such an ongoing programme the whole matter will be resolved fairly quickly.  I depend on the faith of good contractors who obey the law, who do see their responsibilities in obeying the law.  They form the great majority.  They are the people we respect. These provisions are geared only at the minority, people who will insist on doing what is wrong.  The great majority of the people using our roads are responsible and want to comply with our laws.  We are installing equipment only to ensure that those who take a mean advantage are stopped and dealt with in the appropriate way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to material leaving quarries, whether it be readymixed concrete, lorries overladen with broken stone, gravel or that kind of material, all of which is sold by weight and emerges with an accompanying certification, is that certification sufficient to deal with the problems arising?  The Minister might clarify that point.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Senator a specific answer to that.  As the House is aware it is the Garda who enforce the law here.  I have no doubt that the Garda Síochána, where they are satisfied that people possess a document <Col N="1092" /> which is a reasonable one conveying the weight of the vehicle concerned will be satisfied with that document.  If they were not satisfied they would insist on weighing.  Again it is a question of the Garda Síochána &mdash; who are our law enforcement agency &mdash; using good sense. I have no doubt that they always use good sense in matters like this.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is prepared to look at the five-mile limit again I would be prepared to accept this.  In practice a garda might not be able to form a judgment. Then he might discover that the nearest weighbridge was sited six miles away and he could do nothing about it and the provisions of this Bill will be to no avail.  If the Minister examines the section afterwards in its practical operation, requiring the owner of a vehicle to go to the nearest weighbridge, whether that be sited within six, ten or 15 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is an important point which certainly we will look at.  I take that point.  Whether we should necessarily make them go to the nearest weighbridge would depend on the number and location of weighbridges.  We do not want ot make life harder for the people involved who may be obeying the law.  However, I take the point.  We will examine the five-mile limit and if it does not operate as it should and was intended to, we can make the necessary changes on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Minister did not consider saying that no matter what the distance, they can go to the nearest weighbridge.  The nearest weighbridge could be 20 miles away.  It is difficult for anyone to judge whether a vehicle is overweight.  For stone, sand or gravel the amount a vehicle can take is usually measured in cubic yards and the body of the vehicle is designed to take a <Col N="1093" /> certain weight.  If the material is heaped up or moist, the vehicle might be a little overweight.  If somebody decides that a vehicle with load is overweight and the driver, who is doing a tough job, is sent on a wild-goose chase 20 miles to find out that it is not overweight, who is to compensate him for his time and his lorry?</P>
      <P>Five miles would be a reasonable distance and perhaps that could be extended a little.  To provide that the vehicle must go the nearest weighbridge which might be 15, 20 of even 30 miles away would be crazy.  I have the same faith as the Minister has in a garda using his common sense, but a garda is not a judge of the weight of what is in a vehicle any more than a draper is a judge of what is wrong with the engine of a car &mdash; each to his own job.  Some counties have no weighbridges capable of taking some of these vehicles and the driver may have to go into the next county.  Therefore I ask the Minister to consider this point seriously. While I would agree with a distance of five miles and even a small extension to that, I would not agree with giving freedom to send a man into another county because somebody might think his vehicle and contents are overweight.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly is right and the matter is more serious than he says.  Consider a truck driver trying to catch the ferry at Dublin or Rosslare being asked to turn back and go 20 miles; he is late for the ferry and he has a consignment of material for some factory in Düsseldorf or some such place where his cargo is awaited for continuation of production at a plant.  If he misses the ferry and cannot proceed until the following day, will he get any compensation?  If his weight is found to be in order and he is obliged to travel that 20 miles, will he get compensation if he misses the ferry and loses his contract with the firm for whom he is hauling?  Who is at fault if that firm brings an action against the driver and he in turn brings an action against the Minister for Justice?  I suppose the Minister will tell me that nobody will be compensated in such a case.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly raised the point of the five miles and talked about the undue hardship of having to travel 20 or more miles.  I said that we would consider the five-mile provision to see if it was working.  I did not indicate or consider that the distance might be 20 or 25 miles.  As I have said, we are not in the business of creating hardship.  We could use dynamic axle-weighers and if we were satisfied that we had a reasonable case for a further check that then should and could be done.  The idea behind the five miles is that we would not be forcing big trucks to travel long distances. However, if the provision does not work then we will examine it again.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked, if a driver misses the ferry and is sued by his employer whom does he sue?  He sues nobody.  He does not sue us.  We have the enactment of law.  The Garda are entitled to stop a vehicle and if they are satisfied that the driver is committing an offence, under the law as it stands they may ask him to go five miles to a weighbridge and if in the course of that he happens to miss the ferry he is not in a position to sue the Garda because they are doing their legitimate job.  They are not contravening or breaking any law or liable to be sued for that.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  That Act constitutes the basic legal framework for a wide range of controls over the supply and distribution of certain dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs.</P>
      <P>Since its enactment in 1977 the whole drug scene has changed considerably. The level of drug abuse has increased dramatically, particularly the level of heroin abuse.  Statistics from the National Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre in Jervis Street show that in January 1984 a total of 336 attended for treatment whereas the corresponding figure for January 1983 was 232.  This represents an increase of 45 per cent approximately.</P>
      <P>Because of their concern with the significant increase in drug abuse and drug-related crime the Government established a Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse in April 1983 to review and report on the problem.  Following consideration of numerous oral and written submissions from experts and various other bodies with an interest in the problem the task force made a number of recommendations in the areas of law enforcement, treatment facilities, education, research and community and youth work services.  The implementation of these recommendations is currently being monitored by the task force and a substantial degree of progress has been made to date.</P>
      <P>The task force highlighted in particular certain deficiencies in the 1977 Act.  They recommended a number of amendments and these have been incorporated in the Bill, together with desirable changes recommended by other parties concerned with controlling the drug problem.  I believe that the provisions in the Bill, which have been drafted after wide consultation and careful consideration, deserve the wholehearted support of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> The Bill is primarily designed to facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of the 1977 Act.  Certain technical difficulties have been experienced by the Garda which have impleded their work in enforcing effectively the current statutory controls.</P>
    <P>The new definition of cannabis, as provided in section 2, will greatly facilitate prosecutions in relation to the cultivation, possession, and so on, of cannabis. The existing definition failed to capture much of the home-grown variety.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have had occasion to refer a number of cases of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs for investigation in accordance with the procedures set out in the 1977 Act.  I have found these procedures to be very cumbersome and time-consuming, involving referral to the registration authority concerned, followed by the setting up of various committees.  In cases which call for the prohibition of prescribing as a matter of urgency a separate advisory panel must be established.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for a streamlining of the machinery involved in the investigative procedure.</P>
    <P>The professional registration bodies, in particular the Medical Council, were themselves dissatisfied with the existing procedures and the provisions of the two new sections are along lines discussed with these bodies.</P>
    <P>They provide that the Minister, and not as heretofore the registration authority concerned, may establish a committee of inquiry where he considers that there are grounds for giving a special direction prohibiting a practitioner from prescribing controlled drugs.  Pending the report of the committee of inquiry, the Minister may issue, where he considers it necessary, a temporary prohibition.  The committee of inquiry will investigate the allegations, consider any representations made by the practitioner and report on the matter to the Minister.  It will then be a matter simply for the Minister to decide whether to issue a special direction.  In cases where the Minister decides to issue a special direction, the practitioner will <Col N="1098" /> still have the right to appeal to the High Court which is provided for in section 11 of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the power of the media to influence our thinking and everyday actions.  Young people are particularly vulnerable in this regard. Section 5 provides that books and magazines which encourage drug abuse and advertise equipment for use by drug abusers may not be printed or sold.  This prohibition is necessary to guard against the introduction of publications of this kind into this country.</P>
    <P>The growing level of drug abuse has indicated a need to increase the penalties for those found guilty of drug offences. Section 6 provides for an increase in the maximum monetary penalties which can be imposed on summary conviction in order to take into account the change in money values since 1977 and the increasingly serious nature of the drug-pushing problem.  The current maximum monetary limit of £3,000 for serious indictable offences, such as drug pushing, has been removed.  This provision is designed primarily to apprehend those well organised drug pushers who are involved for financial gain.  The section provides also for an increase in the maximum sentence for a convicted drug pusher from 14 years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the application of the appropriate penalties in section 27 of the 1977 Act, as amended by section 6 of this Bill, to offences under the Customs Acts relating to the importation or exportation of controlled drugs. It is absolutely essential that there should be effective customs controls in the fight against drug abuse.  A significant shortcoming in the Customs Acts, as indentified by the task force, is the inadequacy of the penalties provided for dealing with persons convicted of smuggling drugs. While the powers available to Customs and Excise officers are, according to the Revenue Commissioners, adequate the penalties provided for offences under the Customs Acts in relation to the importation or exportation of a controlled drug are completely out-dated.  This has led to a situation where instead of using their own powers, which carry minimal penalties <Col N="1099" /> the Customs and Excise personnel have had to call in the Garda Síochána in most situations involving illicit drugs as the suspects could then be charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 which carry much stiffer penalties.  The provistions in section 7 will remedy this situation and will, in effect, also implement a recommendation of the task force which suggested that the penalties in the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876 and the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 should be aligned.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the court may remand persons convicted of drugs offences under the Customs Acts and apply similar procedures to those provided for in the case of charges taken under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  These procedures provide for medical reports and so on, if the background of the person charged warrants it and in certain cases for the medical or other treatment or for the care of such persons.</P>
    <P>Since I propose to apply in section 7 the appropriate penalties in section 27 of the 1977 Act, as amended by section 6 of this Bill, to certain offences under the Customs Acts, it is logical that similar provisions as are in section 29 of the 1977 Act relating to offences generally, should apply to these offences.  This is the purpose of section 9 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 10 of the Bill will mean that members of the Forensic Science Laboratory no longer have to attend court to give evidence in relation to inspections and analyses carried out by them on drugs which are the subject of prosecutions.  Instead, a certificate of analysis signed by the officer who has carried out the analysis will suffice. Section 11 extends the current prohibition on the cultivation of cannabis and the optium poppy to include the coca plant.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Bill provide the Garda with clearer powers in relation to the search of persons and vehicles, vessels and aircraft and in relation to the issue of search warrants.  For example, section 12 makes it explicit that the power of the Garda to search a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, where he suspects an infringement of the law, includes power to search <Col N="1100" /> containers, and so on, thereon.  It provides also that the owner or person in charge of the particular vehicle, vessel or aircraft may be required to remain present for the duration of the search.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the issue of search warrants in cases which were not covered before, for example, where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the illegal cultivation of cannabis, opium poppy and the coca plant.  Provision is also made for the issue of search warrants in respect of lands, caravans and tents in addition to &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the courts have been hindered in passing sentence on drug pushers as a result of the current mandatory remand provision pending receipt of reports on their medical and social backgrounds.  Section 14 of this Bill provides for the substitution of a discretionary remand provision for the mandatory one as it is obviously inappropriate to defer sentences in serious cases such as drug pushing where the problem of addiction does not arise.  It must be emphasised that we cannot hope to tackle successfully the drug problem with legislation alone.  The legislation must be backed by a comprehensive plan of action covering such areas as education, health services, a community and youth strategy and research.  The recommendations of the task force, currently being implemented, comprise such a plan of action. I believe that the implementation of these recommendations will provide the necessary background against which the legislation will have the greatest effect.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time the Minister was in the House he was speaking on the Dentists Bill which was updating legislation which was 54 years old.  There is another Bill on the Minister's desk, the Nurses Bill, again updating old legislation. Very few of us would think that a Bill which was a mere seven years in existence would need updating.  Yet, that is the regrettable fact.  This Bill which has been recommended by the task force on drug abuse is vitally necessary.  It is a <Col N="1101" /> feature of our life which does none of us proud and which has to be tackled.</P>
      <P>I abhor the entire drug scene as we know it in Ireland today and the element of gang warfare in our cities, particularly in Dublin, because of the huge financial rewards that are to be made in drug trafficking. My hope is that this Bill will add to the full public debate and that there will be a greater awareness of the drug scene by parents and the community.  The drug scene is not yet, and we hope will never be, a rural problem in the same way as it is a problem in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  If it is not nipped in the bud in these areas, then it will grow and spread in our towns and cities in the same proportions as exist in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There have been documents, publications and so on about the drug scene over the past few years.  One that I read was the Medico-Social Research Board Survey for 1982-83.  It was made clear that in most cases youngsters, even of 12, 13 and 14 years of age experimenting with drugs, unfortunately came from families where there was a drink problem.  They found themselves, due to lack of parental control, experimenting with drink, glue-sniffing, cannabis and heroin.  The crime report for 1983 states that almost 2,000 people were charged under the 1977 Act. In 1982 15 or 16 per cent fewer people were charged.</P>
      <P>The role of the Garda Síochána is vital in the whole area of drug abuse.  The commitment of the Garda and particularly that of the Drug Squad is vital and necessary.  I know there has been some criticism that the Drug Squad is not as large as it might be.  If that is correct, it should be enlarged.  They have come a long way since 1967 when the Drug Squad was set up.  Great credit is due to Detective Mullins and those people who were there from the beginning for the great work they have done over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from the Department of Justice figures that more gardaí are being trained in the area of drug abuse.  I welcome the fact that ban ghardaí are being trained in this area.  It seems to be an area where they might be especially useful and it is right and proper that they should have <Col N="1102" /> adequate training.  I do not have to spell out that the abuse of drugs has led to a massive increase in crime in our community. An addict resorts to crime in order to get money to feed his unfortunate habit.  It can cost up to £500 a week for a heroin or other drug addict to feed his habit.  That has led to a massive increase in handbag snatching, larcenies of one kind or another and burglaries to such an extent that many insurance companies are now querying whether they should continue to give comprehensive cover on homes in Dublin and other cities.</P>
    <P>There must be liaison between the Garda and the community resident associations and community leaders.  The task force, which I have referred to, made many recommendations to the Minister particularly in the area of education. They have a number of videos available which should be used as extensively as possible in schools and in the community. The television advertisement at present being shown on RTE is one that I welcome. It gets the message across to the home that drugs are not just got in murky alleyways in Dublin or the big cities but that a start can be made at home with excessive drinking and lack of parental control.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the task force are important and they have obviously been helpful to the Minister.  The fact that so many gardaí are now better equipped to deal with the problem and know much more about the drug scene is a help.  They should not be forgotten about even though they may be in a town where the drug scene is not as great as it is in the cities.  They should give lectures, for example, to teachers.  I know that secondary teachers and third level lecturers have meetings from time to time. They should invite trained gardaí to their meetings to advise and educate them about the drug problem.  It would be a further way of getting the message home.</P>
    <P>I have already paid tribute to Detective Mullins.  He is to be congratulated for the work he and all his men are doing.  There must be very close liaison and co-operation between the Garda and excise officials. It would seem that this is happening, <Col N="1103" /> because the number of seizures that have taken place over the past years have increased.  We have to remember that we are an island country.  The number of ports and airports we have might make it easy enough for people to bring drugs into this country.  I understand from people who have studied this problem that any of us could carry in heroin having a street value of £1 million in our pockets, underpants, stockings and so on.  It might be difficult to detect that heroin.  At a lecture a few years ago Inspector Mullins produced what looked like a flake of dandruff, but it was heroin which had a street value of £10 or £12.</P>
    <P>In 1981, the Revenue Commissioners introduced an American testing kit which has proved very effective and reliable and which is now used in other European countries.  Obviously that was a huge help, but how does one deal with the swallowers and stuffers, people who carry it in the body?  This needs attention and the custom and excise people need our help in every way possible.</P>
    <P>The Customs (Consolidation) Act, of 1876 made it almost hopeless for the customs, and excise people.  I welcome the Minister's statement on section 7 of the Bill, that the task force's recommendation that penalties under the Customs (Consolidation) Act of 1876 and the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1977 should be aligned.  That is certainly something positive and a gesture that I would welcome. It is necessary because the custom and excise officers are in the firing line and should have power equal to that of the Garda.  There is a case to be made for having a drug squad within the customs and excise area.  It is a point worth thinking about and certainly makes sense to me.  Powers and aid should be given to those people if they are to have a realistic chance of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The sections in the Bill which provide for greater examination of irresponsible prescribing by the medical, veterinary and dental profession are welcome.  I know, and the Minister knows, that we have a small number of rogue doctors.  It is terrible that these people should be over-prescribing in a most irresponsible way.  It is irresponsible in many ways and <Col N="1104" /> we all know what I mean by that.  The Minister is right to endeavour to make life more difficult for such doctors and, indeed, the medical profession have a vital role to play in telling these people that they will not be tolerated on their medical lists.</P>
    <P>Another important proposal is that which makes it an offence to produce and bring into the country books which encourage drug taking.  I know these publications are not as freely available here as in other countries but it is right to act now and nip it in the bud.  The reference to passing information or documents to another person in order to acquire drugs is to be welcomed.  What I am talking about here is the looseness of the medical card system.  Obviously, the health boards should be aware of this situation and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The recommendation that a special district and circuit judge be allocated for drug work only must be welcomed.  This would be a very important development. There must be consistency in sentencing and so on.  Whoever are appointed to these posts should get expert training, expert knowledge, expert education in the whole area of drugs before they take up duty on the bench.  I do not have to say that because I am sure it will be done, but it is important that they have this necessary training.  It would give consistency in this area which is necessary.  It is not yet operational but was one of the recommendations of the task force.  Generally, the task force have been a very great help to the Minister in the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 10 which refers to the fact that a member of the forensic science laboratory does not have to be present, that his certificate of analysis is sufficient.  Obviously, this is far less time-consuming; it will speed up matters and be less costly.</P>
    <P>We all agree that drug pushing is a most serious crime.  The pusher, and particularly the commercial pusher, deserves to be removed from society. Undoubtedly, the godfathers must be removed from our streets.  If we have pushers unfortunately we have willing customers in the persons of addicts.  If the <Col N="1105" /> Minister does not mind my saying so, this is one of the weaknesses in the Bill.  There is a much greater need for the development of treatment facilities.  This should be examined again and maybe carried out as part of normal Department of Health progress.  Because of the seriousness of the problem all areas have to be tackled. The problem must be contained and eventually eliminated.  The inclusion of the provision of treatment facilities would be very welcome, indeed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new definition of cannabis. There are many who say that cannabis should be made legal.  On the 1.30 p.m. news on the radio today I heard that two non-nationals had been imprisoned for three years by a judge in Dublin.  This was the correct decision.  I may be wrong, but I got the impression from the news announcer that there was an attempt at a suspended sentence.  That did not come and the judge stuck to his guns.  We had criticism of a judge last week but I certainly would have to give this judge my congratulations.  It is the right approach and certainly he acted wisely and responsibly.</P>
    <P>Many people, most of whom might be described as liberal commentators in our area say that cannabis should be legalised. I totally disagree with that because if our young people turned to cannabis and drink and the other soft drugs that are about to relieve their anxieties, they are forming a pattern for life, a pattern of escaping rather than dealing with the realities of life.  There must be no encouragement for this.  To me it is clearly a lead on to the harder drugs.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the increase in drug abuse but one is obviously unemployment.  I am not blaming the Minister for that, but certainly unemployment and boredom can add to the problem.  I am almost certain that 90 per cent of those who are on drugs are unemployed people.  Obviously, any reduction in the number of unemployed people would be a tremendous help.  I want to say that I welcome the Bill.  We have a very serious and growing problem. We must stem this drug tide in every way we can, whether by way of education, or <Col N="1106" /> legislation, or community development. I am not saying this Bill will solve the problem, but it will help enormously.  It has my total support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is main liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, Bille na nDrugaí, agus comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Rialtas as ucht an reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt os comhair an tSeanaid.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleague, Senator Fallon, who has dealt with this matter very comprehensively, in welcoming this Bill.  The Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984, is designed to amend and extend the provision of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The 1977 Act provides the basic legal framework, but it is interesting to note that in a short period of seven years, despite the good work of Ministers and parliamentary draftsmen, it has become incumbent on us to look again at the situation.  The pattern of drug abuse has changed considerably since 1977, both in terms of its nature and the magnitude of the problem.</P>
      <P>Few people would disagree with the way in which Senator Fallon highlighted and emphasised the problem here this evening.  Few people would deny the inadequacy of the various existing facilities we have for dealing with the fight against illicit drug taking.  We all agree that in seven years the nature of the problem has changed dramatically.  Most drug addicts are now abusing not cannabis but heroin.  This is a relatively new phenomenon here.  The nature and the magnitude of the problem have been summed up by a lecturer, Mr. Usher, in a recent article entitled &ldquo;Some Current Initiatives at National and Regional Level &mdash; Projects and Approaches.&rdquo;  I will quote briefly from that article:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social profile of the typical drug abuser has changed.  The drug problem now affects young people particularly, without any reference to intellectual or educational attainment and no particular social class is exempt.  Another remarkable trend which emerges is the increasing number of adolescents who are beginning with the immediate <Col N="1107" /> abuse of hard drugs rather than by way of the long-established procedure of graduating from so-called soft drugs.</P>
    <P>Our young people today unfortunately are starting on the hard drugs.  In this context I should like to pay tribute to the special task force headed by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, who examined these problems in great detail and identified the range of measures which we should enact to prevent the importation and distribution of illicit drugs.  They emphasised the need for the provision of a comprehensive health education programme which would become part and parcel of our school curriculum and the introduction of appropriate youth and community development strategies.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for this House to record the progress made in regard to the implementation of the many recommendations of the special task force: the provision of additional ban-ghardaí who have been assigned to the drug units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as recommended by the task force; the more rigorous checking of passports to combat the use of false passports by Irish and international drug traffickers.  Like Senator Fallon, I welcome the suggestion regarding the appointment of special district justices here in Dublin, but I should like to suggest also that perhaps there is need for two or three extra district justices who specialise in this area in the provinces.  I welcome the recommendation regarding the appointment of at least one solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office who would specialise in drug offence casework.</P>
    <P>Because of the experience of various people like the Garda, the customs officers, and so on, in regard to the operation of the 1977 Act, and because of the radical way in which the drugs scene has changed, the Minister for Health now finds it necessary to amend the 1977 Act in a number of ways.  I am a little disappointed that there has not been greater discussion on this area.  In regard to drug pushing, the concept of <i>mens rea</i>, the concept of the guilty intention which would be associated with the act of drug pushing may be a little outdated.  We may <Col N="1108" /> have to come back to this House in a few years time and provide for strict liability in certain areas.  Some lawyers in this country and in other parts of the world think that the concept of strict liability is appropriate in trying to combat this problem of drug pushing.  The idea that the prosecution must go into court and must prove the coincidence of <i>mens rea</i> and <i>actus rea</i> is not the best way to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the provisions in this Bill.  It provides for a redefinition of cannabis to capture some types of plant which would not normally be caught before.  We may have to go a little further and introduce the concept of strict liability in order to catch the people I would like to catch.  I welcome the provision in regard to simplified procedure to investigate the allegations.  Some allegations have been substantiated in recent times of irresponsible prescribing of drugs.  The Minister is wise to take this responsibility and this duty unto himself rather than to have a very elaborate procedure for dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome &mdash; and there are Members of this House who might not welcome &mdash; the provisions increasing the maximum sentence for convicted drug pushers from 14 years to life imprisonment.  I welcome the provisions regarding the four-fold increase in the maximum monetary penalties imposed on summary convictions. I welcome giving the courts discretion on whether to require medical and social reports on convicted drug pushers.  At present the courts must remand for such reports.  The existing and proposed legislative provisions are important in the drug prevention field but this legislation must also be backed up by a comprehensive drug control policy which covers such areas as education, health services and youth and community services.  I know other Members of this House want to talk about these areas and I do not wish to pre-empt what they may say.  We will have the opportunity to speak later on Committee Stage on the details of the provisions.  I welcome these provisions and I hope they will help us to arrest and contain the drugs menace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of fundamental importance.  Whatever my reservations are, and there are a number of them, we are all at one at this stage in Irish society in the sense of horror and shock that we have a problem that until relatively recently we regarded as entirely a problem of the big, urbanised cities of western Europe and North America.  That problem has suddenly landed firmly and forcefully at our own doorstep.  To reiterate the research of the Medico-Social Research Board, they indicated that within the inner city at the height of the problem &mdash; and there is some evidence the problem is decreasing &mdash; around 10 per cent of the 15 to 24 age group, around 12 per cent of the 15 to 19 age group and somewhere around 13 per cent of females in the 15 to 24 age group were involved in the abuse of heroin.  It is very difficult to envisage somebody being involved in the abuse of something as dangerous as heroin and not to assume that they are addicted.  Extrapolated throughout the entire inner city that suggests in or around 1,500 heroin addicts in Dublin city.  The Medico-Social Research Board suggested that those figures could be comparable with areas in Dublin city or areas in other big cities which we would regard as the ultimate in dereliction in terms of the incidence of heroin abuse.</P>
      <P>The response of the authorities &mdash; and no particular Government is to be blamed for this &mdash; was somewhat slow.  There was a period when, despite the warnings of many concerned people, official agencies pooh-poohed the suggestion that there was a horrific heroin epidemic in Dublin. The response subsequently has been, at least in terms of analysis and proposals, quite generous and efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable reference to the report of the ministerial task force on drug abuse.  I do not think any of us apart from the Minister have actually seen that report.  What we have seen is the decision the Government have made on the basis of that report.  We do not know if they accepted all, most, or some of the recommendations or if there were recommendations which were ignored.  It is traditional that such documents and <Col N="1110" /> proposals are not divulged.  It may well have been published but I could not find it either in the Oireachtas Library or from any other Member of the House, so perhaps it has not been published.  That is a pity because we cannot really assess what the Government have decided to do.  The proper way to assess that would be in the context of proposals that came before then.  Perhaps that is not the way we do our business but we could do with an increase in information.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions about revamping the customs procedures.  I read the Minister's Second Stage speech.  I try always if possible to read Second Stage debates on these matters so that we do not repeat the same business. There is a need if you are talking about dealing with the problem at the point of entry, to coin a phrase, to extend and expand the customs staffing.  The customs officials' union are very vigorous in their insistence that they lack the staff resources to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Whatever my liberal soul might suggest, I cannot really take issue with the penalties that are in principle contained in this Bill.  In particular the offence of selling addictive drugs to young children is one that is an affront to all of us, irrespective of our political views.  If you are going to attempt to increase the powers of the customs to deal with drug offences or with the attempted importation of drugs, then you must make sure that they have the resources to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the numbers of people involved in the drugs squad in Dublin.  The suggestion is that it is in or around 30 to 35 or so.  The usual answer to that sort of question is, of course, that every garda gets some training in drug abuse.  That is only right. Nevertheless, if you think about a drug squad who are supposed to be on duty 24 hours a day and supposed to deal not just with petty offenders but with organised, criminal conspiracies of a sophistication and with an interest in terms of financial return far in excess of anything that used to exist in this country, then I think a 20-, 30- or 40-member drugs squad is quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Since it is not usual for me to throw out plaudits to the Garda too easily &mdash; and perhaps I should do it more often &mdash; everybody owes an enormous debt of gratitude to the work of the Garda Drugs Squad.  Although I come into contact with a considerable number of complaints about many areas of Garda activity, I have rarely, if ever, heard complaints about the way the drugs squad do their work, about their commitment to their job and about their sensitivity in dealing with the incidence of drug offences they come up against.  By that I mean that they seem to be very well able to distinguish between a youngster who is experimenting with something like cannabis and somebody who is either a serious heroin addict or a major dealer in drugs.  They are able to exercise discretion so as not to damage permanently the future of a young person because of some foolishness or mistake on his part.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know from the Minister if there are any Government proposals as distinct from what the task force said about keeping the matter under constant review.  Constant review is, unfortunately, a term that most of us associate with a Government decision to do nothing in the immediate future but to keep the possibility open for the future.  I do not think we can envisage an enforcement of these properly stringent regulations on drug abuse without an extension of the specialist skills of the Garda Drugs Squad.</P>
    <P>There were proposals to deal with the courts and work out, if possible, the appointment of a specialist judge and of a special prosecutor.  I am anxious to know if the Minister can elaborate on what he said in the Dáil on that matter which was that this was being pursued with the appropriate authorities.  It is extremely important that there should be a fairly intelligent and balanced response from within the Judiciary to the success, or the hoped-for success, of the Garda in dealing with this absolutely frightening problem.</P>
    <P>Related to that is the question of sentencing policy.  It is to be hoped that the appointment of a specialist judge or a specialist justice in the District Court <Col N="1112" /> would alleviate or get rid of that problem. The trouble is that if we are to get rid of that problem, first we need to know to what extent it exists.  Regrettably, on the information available to us at present, we do not know.  Deputy Tony Gregory sought an answer to the following question. He asked the Minister for Justice the number of convictions in the courts between March 1982 and 1984 for the possession of heroin, the amount of heroin involved in each case, the sentence given in each case and the name of the presiding judge.  It seems to me that in terms of an intelligent response to the problem of dealing with drug abuse, in terms of ensuring that what the Oireachtas envisages should happen, which is that those who are more seriously abusing or breaking the law should be more seriously punished, there should be a consistency of penalties.  That sort of information should, logically, be available. The Minister for Justice said that the statistics sought were not available in his Department or in Garda headquarters. They would have to be specially compiled from records at local level and he did not consider that he would be justified in asking gardaí and court officials to undertake the task which could only be carried out at the expense of other duties.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that those priorities should exist because this is not a marginal problem for many areas in this city.  The problem of drug abuse is a central problem. If we are to have an adequate and proper response to that problem it is vital that we have the best possible information at our disposal.  Therefore, for the Minister for Justice to suggest that it is not sufficiently important to devote the necessary manpower resources is an attempt to relegate that problem in terms of priorities far below where it ought to be.  I, therefore, ask the Minister if it would be possible to provide that information, not necessarily for publication if the Government do not wish it, but so that decisions about future appointments to the Judiciary and decisions about all these issues can be dealt with on the basis of the facts and not on the basis of individual perceptions of those facts, <Col N="1113" /> because there is a major difference.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister when, if ever, adequate residential provision for addicts under 16 years of age is going to be made available in this city.  I read and reread his Second Stage speech in the Dáil, his reply on Second Stage and his speech here.  This seems to be a major area of inadequacy in the treatment facilities that are available, and ought to be of major concern.  I have no reason to think, nor am I attempting to suggest, that the Minister is not concerned.  That is not the issue.  The issue is the general collective will to get things done and done quickly.  It would be a terrible reproach to us all if we did not immediately produce a response that would provide facilities for young people under 16.  In a special way they are innocent victims of this dreadful illness that besets our society.</P>
    <P>One wonders when the much promised modifications in Jervis Street will take place.  If we have to wait until the transfer to Beaumont takes place it will not convey the sense of urgency that many people hope for in terms of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>There was a controversy during the debate in the Dáil about the number of people who have died from drug-related causes.  There was some difference between the Minister and the Deputy who produced this claim.  I have here the names of five people and a sixth case of whom I have been told have died in the last three weeks from drug-related conditions. I hope the Minister will not tell me he has not got this information because he has better sources of information than I have.  The information I have is confirmed because the Garda on the day after this claim was made in the Dáil stated, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 June, that seven or eight young people were believed to have died in the Dublin area over the past ten days directly as a result of heroin abuse.  Deputy Gregory had mentioned a figure of five in the Dáil, the Garda said seven or eight.  The Minister was at some pains to pooh-pooh those assertions.  He said he did not have that information and that the Garda Drug <Col N="1114" /> Squad were aware of seven deaths in the past six months.  He also said that the Garda spokesman informed them of seven or eight cases of young people in the past ten days.  Somebody is wrong. The reason I produce this apparent contradiction is not to score a point off the Minister on a particularly sensitive issue but because I think we are entitled to know the reality and truth about drug-related matters.</P>
    <P>It is true that somebody may die of heart failure or from what appears to be suicide or perhaps something other than the direct evidence of drug addiction. Therefore, the verdict of inquests may not say this person died from heroin addiction. Perhaps this is where the distinction arises.  However, it would be disingenuous of a Minister responsible for dealing with the problem of drug abuse to attempt to minimise its horror by using artificial distinctions to escape the fact that there seem to be an increasing number of drug-related deaths in our society. I hope the Minister will clarify that apparent confusion.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now that will probably get me into trouble with the Minister, not for the first time.  I have very few reservations about the activities of those groups who have described themselves as concerned parents.  It is somewhat patronising of those of us who do not have to live in areas with the problems that those people have, to give them lectures about the possibility of being manipulated by the Provisional IRA or some other body.  These people have had to live with the problem of drug pushing on their own doorsteps and in their own flats.  They have had to live with the permanent horror of people injecting themselves with heroin within their own communities.  Nothing else seemed to work so they used the pressure of the moral authority of that community to deal with the problem.  I congratulate the brave people of St. Theresa's Gardens who had the ability to ensure that whatever other social problems they have in that area &mdash; and I am more familiar than perhaps the Minister might imagine with St. Theresa's Gardens &mdash; they have managed to deal with the drug problem. <Col N="1115" /> There is, of course, an alternative solution and that is that members of the Garda should reside in those areas so that those who have the responsibility of enforcing the law can be where the law badly needs to be enforced.  But to suggest that gardaí living and spending most of their lives outside these areas can enforce the law by descending upon them once, twice or three times a night is confusing the issue and diffusing the possibility of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>There have been disturbing reports about the incidence of drug abuse in prison.  I am satisfied that the people who are making the reports are endeavouring to tell the truth.  There are also disturbing reports about people going into our prison system with no knowledge of drugs and coming out addicted to heroin.  This is probably the most serious allegation that could be made and I do not think a denial is adequate, and investigation is required.  I am satisfied that the people who express these concerns have a legitimate concern in the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, as far as it goes, an attempt to address the problem.  I do not think anybody can argue with the extension of a definition of cannabis to encompass areas or forms of that product which otherwise might not have been encompassed. I have to say again that while we have a drug problem and while I would not encourage any young person to use any drug, including cannabis, we should make a very clear distinction.  Far more people in our society than we either acknowledge or, as they become respectable citizens would themselves acknowledge, have used that drug.  To suggest somehow that there is almost this inevitable link between the two is, to say the least, somewhat simplistic.  I think you could find that most of those who unfortunately end up addicted to heroin probably drank cider in their youth. Nobody would suggest for one second that that would, therefore, automatically prove that cider should be made illegal. You have to do a little bit more than say because a person does two things one follows from the other.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not favour the legalising of cannabis.  I have some reservations <Col N="1116" /> about the level of penalties being imposed, or potentially imposable, on people for possession for their own use of small amounts of cannabis.  I do not know that it will stop anybody from having possession of it, and in some cases it may well portray an image of the user of cannabis which is far worse than the actual quality of the person involved.</P>
    <P>As regards the changes in penalties from 14 years to life, I would be grateful if the Minister would explain what effective difference it will make in terms of the normal policies of the Department of Justice about remission, relief and so on. I suspect it will make very little difference. But if it is there simply as an attempt to indicate the revulsion of our society towards those who would sell addictive drugs to children or adults, then we must have it.  I do not think it is particularly useful to pretend the length of sentence people will serve will have much impact because I do not believe the length of prison sentences is much of a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I am extremely unhappy, as are the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, about the decision to leave medical assessments to the discretion of the courts.  I do not have much faith in the ability of a district justice or a judge of the Circuit Court to tell by looking at somebody whether a person is addicted or not.  Therefore, I have no idea how an individual judge is going to be able to decide whether one person needs a medical report and another person does not.  Do they have to come in in a state close to major withdrawal symptoms or what?  I read the Minister's speeches and I cannot see why it is necessary to remove the obligatory medical, social and other assessments.  If the Minister was worried that certain people had absconded while those things were being done, he could have made proposals to deal with that, but to suggest that it would now be at the absolute discretion, in some cases, of the Judiciary to decide whether people should get these assessments seems to be attributing even greater wisdom to the Judiciary than that which they usually claim for themselves. I have profound reservations about that because, whether we like them or not, <Col N="1117" /> there is a distinction between an individual addicted to heroin who sells heroin to feed his own habit, and the ruthless, powerful individuals who seem to be immune from the law, however extensive or strong the powers of the Garda.  There is a distinction between those two groups and it is not a distinction that will necessarily be apparent to a member of the Judiciary in the way that it would be apparent to the specialists who would make the assessments on these people.  I regret that decision.  I cannot see and, I have not seen, any evidence in what the Minister has said or in my own reading to justify it.</P>
    <P>I never cease to be astonished at the things that slip through the Oireachtas. I am particularly frightened at section 5 (1) (a) (i) and (ii) which relate to the &ldquo;Printing etc. of certain books etc., communication of certain information and possession of certain documents an offence.&rdquo; The Minister referred to this in his speech but it was a little bit disingenuous of him to describe it the way he did.  He gave the impression that we were simply prohibiting documents which were being sold to people which would tell them how to buy drugs, or which would encourage them to go on drugs.  The truth is that the section is far more wide-ranging than that.  It says:</P>
    <P>(1) (a) A person shall not print, publish, cause or procure to be printed or published, sell or expose or offer or keep for sale, distribute or offer to keep for distribution, any book, periodical or other publication which either &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The following provision makes my hair stand on end.</P>
    <P>(i) advocates or might reasonably be supposed to advocate or encourage, whether expressly or by implication, the use of any controlled drug prescribed for the purposes of this section, or any product or preparation containing any such controlled drug,...</P>
    <P>That is the paragraph that frightens me. <Col N="1118" /> I would like to quote what the Irish Council of Civil Liberties said about that:</P>
    <P>The proposals to prohibit publications which can be interpreted in any way as promoting or advocating the use of illegal drugs could have the effect of stifling any serious discussion of the drug problem and of constructive ways of dealing with it.  It would put into question the legality of any educational programme on drug abuse which admits&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt you, but what is the reference you are reading from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is a press statement issued by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties dated 22 June 1984.</P>
      <P>It would put into question the legality of any educational programme on drug abuse which admits as a matter of fact that pleasurable experiences can be obtained by the use of illegal substances. It would also lead to the ridiculous position that more than a few works of literature of considerable merit would be prohibited by this act if amended.</P>
      <P>When this section was being drafted was there anybody under 35 years of age in the entire Department of Health or in the Parliamentary Draftsman's office, because in &ldquo;Hot Press&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rolling Stones&rdquo;, or any of the magazines or journals which talk about rock music, there is regularly a discussion and a debate in the correspondence columns &mdash; and some of the regular columns &mdash; about the efficacy or otherwise of taking certain drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's intention is to make those journals illegal or to prevent those discussions or what. Furthermore, there are widely used records that most of our young people listen to which contain implicit and explicit advocating of the use of drugs.  Off the top of my head J.J. Kale's &ldquo;Cocaine&rdquo; is the most obvious one.  Is the Minister suggesting that that record is now going to be banned in Ireland?  I am not defending either the use of cocaine or the advocacy <Col N="1119" /> of its use.  What I am saying is that the perspective that drew up that subsection of this Bill does not understand a large part of the realities of this world, because it is either unenforceable or it is going to make us the laughing stock of the world.  The intention is perfectly right and sustainable, but the actual implications of that section are entirely indefensible.</P>
    <P>In drawing towards a conclusion &mdash; I regret the look of pain on your face, a Leas-Chathaoirligh &mdash; I would like to ask a few more specific questions.  In his Second Stage reply in the Dáil the Minister listed a large number of what he would regard quite justifiably as marks of progress. I would be interested to know the total sum of money involved in all those individual items of progress, because the figure mentioned in his progress report on the health services, page 5, under the heading of Public Health was £600,000. This amount was provided specifically in the 1984 allocation to the Department of Health to pay for activities to combat the consequences of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>If we have 1,500 heroin addicts in this city, then £600,000 is a pathetically small sum.  I do not say this to score points but in an attempt, perhaps, to strengthen the Minister's hand because I know he would wish to spend a lot more.  It is not nearly sufficient, particularly when you think that to lock up an unfortunate addict for 12 months or two years probably costs the State about £25,000 to £50,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, and at the core of this in the Irish context is the need to deal with the social reasons which produce drug abuse. It is not entirely an accident that it is in the deprived inner city areas of this city and of every other city that drug addiction has flourished.  Therefore, it is not possible to deal with drug abuse on a universal scale or completely if we leave areas of this city with dreadful housing, poor education and virtually no employment prospects.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me today that the decision to begin to experiment with heroin must reflect somewhere inside of people a suicide instinct.  It must reflect a perception of the world as an entirely <Col N="1120" /> hopeless and worthless place.  There is an increasing section of our young people who see the world as an entirely hopeless and pointless place, who see all of us who claim to be concerned about them as entirely and completely outside their world, with no overlap in priorities or in concern.  Some of those young people are not helped in their attempts to come to terms with our society by the reports they and I hear of abuses of some of the powers the Garda already have under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>I have an acquaintance living in the inner city who has done an enormous amount of work on drug abuse but who has been the object of some suspicion by sections of the Garda because of other things he did or is alleged to have done. They never managed to prove anything against him, but in a period of six months he was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs, taken to a Garda station and strip-searched on five or six occasions not, I hasten to add, by the Drugs Squad most of whom do not abuse their powers, but by other members in plain clothes.</P>
    <P>I know of a journalist who unfortunately wrote an article about drugs and was promptly visited by members of the Garda with a search warrant, searching for drugs.  A young lady of my acquaintence, who happens to be involved in a far left party, who works with children, who is in day-to-day contact with the Drugs Squad because of her dealings with young people, had her premises descended on by a section of the Garda searching for cannabis.  I know, and the Drugs Squad know, that far from being involved in the abuse of cannabis this lady would have very strong views about it, but when the Garda officers arrived they showed a lot more interest in her political documents than in searching for drugs.</P>
    <P>Powers like these must be used by people who know what they are doing, and therefore it is extremely important that if we are to deal with the problem, the powers contained in this Bill or in the Principal Act must be exercised by people who know what they are doing. They cannot be made a convenient way to ensure that young people behave or a convenient way to exercise control over <Col N="1121" /> young people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle, I welcome all the decisions the Government made.  I look forward to the full implementation of the proposals and decisions the Government made as outlined in the statement in response to the task force. I am interested specifically in the allocation of funds and I am particularly concerned about the section of the Bill in regard to publication because I think it is far too wide-ranging and I hope the Minister will consider amending it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's quick response to the task force.  We needed amending legislation to bring the 1977 Act up to date because it did not control the problem we are faced with today in relation to drug abuse, drug importation and the misery drugs cause to young people who are at the mercy of drug pushers, traffickers and abusers.  It is tragic that new legislation became necessary to solve a growing problem.  I will not repeat other Senators' definitions of cannabis and the simplification of procedures to be adopted about over-prescription of drugs and the increasing of sentences, all in the Bill to ensure that people will realise how serious the Government and the House consider this problem to be.</P>
      <P>The section I welcome most is that which redefines the position and gives additional control and powers to customs officials.  Most of our problem in regard to drugs stems from importation.  The Minister said it was essential that customs would have effective control to enable them to fight drug importation.  Although they have sufficient powers, apparently the penalties they could impose on trafficers were not a sufficient deterrent, and the increase in the penalties provided for in the Bill will enable us to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Mr. Usher of the Department for the interest he has shown in this problem.  I was privileged to attend some seminars at which he read papers on this subject.  Senator Fallon referred to the activities of Detective Inspector Mullins of the Drugs Squad.  He has produced <Col N="1122" /> some spectacular statistics which put this Bill in proper context.  Senator Brendan Ryan read some submissions from various organisations and he commended Inspector Mullins.  I suggest that he read in detail the figures that Inspector Mullins has made available so that he will realise that the days of ambiguity in this respect are over &mdash; that we cannot be running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we have legislation to tighten up the importation end.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that because some drugs are not addictive they are permissible.  It is a trendy thing to say that cannabis should not be in the Bill for that reason.  Dr. Deasy in the School of Pharmacy in Trinity College has produced a document which will leave nobody in doubt about the side effects and the long-term effects of cannabis. It may not be addictive but it leads to all sorts of problems.  In all cases heavy users are most likely to abuse heroin. Though cannabis is not addictive and may be considered to be fashionable and not confined to the poorer sections of communities in any part of the world, its abuse has led to abuse of addictive drugs.</P>
    <P>I will quote from Inspector Mullins:</P>
    <P>A striking feature of international drug traffic in Europe for 1983 has been the phenomenal growth in the amount of illicit drugs seized.  In spite of the best efforts of law enforcement agencies the amount of practically all type of illicit drugs entering Europe is increasing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>Heroin is entering Europe from at least three separate source regions, with the trafficking under the control of sophisticated criminal organisations. Large style shipments of the drug are notably on the increase and the success rate of detection in this field is reasonably high, with spectacular seizures being made in most European countries on a regular basis, but it is the flooding of the Continent with entrepreneur couriers, carrying quantities of 1 kg. or less which give a very serious dimension to the problem.</P>
    <P>The heroin traffic is to a large measure <Col N="1123" /> controlled by nationals of the area from which the heroin originates.  Thus south-west Asian heroin is controlled mostly by natives of Pakistan and is of the type mostly found in the UK and Ireland.  South-east Asian heroin is mostly controlled by Chinese nationals. Turkish nationals generally control supplies from the near and Middle East. </P>
    <P>It is cheaper to produce heroin in south-west Asia and because of that it seems to find its way to our shores.  We will have to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>Inspector Mullins went on:</P>
    <P>The dramatic increase in illicit drug trafficking is also most noticeable in the area of cocaine traffic.  As in heroin, cocaine and indeed all other illicit drugs, the amount seized reflects success on the part of the law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>It may also signify the substantial quantities being directed towards Europe because of the price situation that has arisen in the countries that produce it.</P>
    <P>Detective Inspector Mullins went on to detail the amounts of heroin seized.  It is important to get that on the record of the House so that we can look at the need for this legislation in the proper context.  The total amount of heroin seized in Europe in 1983 was 1½ tons or 1,528 kilos.  In the UK about 230 kilos was seized.  The heroin seized in Europe has an estimated total value of £3,058 million.  The total seizures of cocaine in Europe in 1983 was 1 ton with an estimated value of £2,856 million.  The amount of cannabis and cannabis resin seized in 1983 rose to 106,535 kilos, which has a conservative estimated value of £6,000 million.  That is the type or organised drug trafficking that pushers, their agents and their couriers are imposing on Britain, Ireland and other countries which up to now had been relatively free of it.  Statistics all over the world will refute the claims that it is due to any social situations because it has gone across all social borders.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we seized five grammes of heroin in 1979 and in 1982 we seized 1,264 grammes.  That is an indication of <Col N="1124" /> our control but also is an indication of the increasing amount of drugs being smuggled into this country.  The seizure of cocaine has gone up from 29 grammes in 1979 to 409 grammes in 1982.  The seizure of cannabis &mdash; extraordinarily enough &mdash; has dropped from 439 grammes in 1979 to 220 grammes in 1982. The need for cannabis is not as great because they start with it and then graduate to the harder drugs.  It bears out the point I made about Senator Brendan Ryan's contribution, that just because it is fashionable to suggest that cannabis may not be addictable, the fact that people used it in large quantities in 1979 and have now graduated to harder drugs is an indication of what cannabis can trigger off.</P>
    <P>The Government, and all Government agencies throughout the world, have a lot of international convenants and agreements between them as to how to deal with this problem.  Any legislation that assists this is welcome although I am sorry the Minister should consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>Young people are naturally curious and that is why I welcome the Minister's provision regarding booklets, pamphlets and trendy magazines which seem to promote the glamorisation of drugs.  No longer should we be ambiguous about this area.  They are the kind of books people &mdash; especially young people who are attracted to music and certain cults &mdash; are reading.  Unfortunately, it is the nature of young people to experiment. According to the records available to experts some young people experimented to see what the effects would be. Some of them have been hurt while some got sense.  A small minority of people will always be experimenters, but there are people who are being encouraged to use these drugs by pushers who know they will end up totally and completely dependent on them.</P>
    <P>Detective Inspector Mullins recommends that one of the ways to control the problem is to curtail availability.  He suggests we should have enlightened legislation where the civil rights of the trafficker are balanced against the civil rights of the silent majority.  The silent majority is a term that is often used but it refers to <Col N="1125" /> people who do not express themselves. In this case it could be the unfortunate people who are addicted.  Inspector Mullins said legislation should differentiate between traffickers and their unfortunate victims.  He said there should be vigorous law enforcement which would ensure that the trafficker never gains from his activities and unless any good reason existed, he should serve a very long term of imprisonment when convicted.</P>
    <P>The greatest possible involvement of voluntary organisations at all levels should be stimulated, according to Inspector Mullins.  The inspector specifically mentions sporting organisations because it is healthy for people to be in the fresh air and to be part of a group or a team.  In this Centenary Year of the GAA it should be one of the ideals of that organisation that they would instil an anti-drug cult in the young people who follow them.  Education of a sporting nature at that level is important to show young people there are other things which can give them a lot of happiness, apart from stupidly induced feelings of euphoria by the use of various drugs.</P>
    <P>Inspector Mullins considered the production of accurate and up-to-date information in the community as very important.  There have been examples in Dublin recently where community involvement has to some degree been successful.  There are people genuinely committed to the improvement of life in their community.  However, like the itinerant problem, moving people from one housing estate to another is not the answer.  There will have to be more community involvement and a compassion extended at community level to people who are afflicted with this problem. There should be a certain awareness in the community by parents in particular. They should be caring and supportive of their children who are confronted with these difficulties.  They should be able to identify these difficulties in the home.  All too often we have what Senator Brendan Ryan referred to as problem families. The reality is that a mother may be at her wits end trying to look after a large family and may not notice when some member <Col N="1126" /> of the family goes missing or is slow to report his or her whereabouts.  In a loving and caring way parents can elicit information from their children without building up a barrier whereby they cannot communicate. If that happens we can grapple with this problem.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, legislation by itself is not sufficient.  We will also need a comprehensive plan of action covering the areas of education, the health services and community-based youth strategy and research.  The Minister's commitment in that area is well known and I have no doubt that he will extend that commitment when the time comes.  I am sure he recognises that in parts of Dublin that time has arrived.  I am glad he is investing capital money in the provision of treatment centres for young people who have been afflicted.  The legislation measures should never be taken in isolation but should be integrated in a harmonious variety of measures within the community.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting Inspector Mullins &mdash;&mdash; I have the greatest admiration for him &mdash;&mdash; who said:</P>
    <P>The greatest remedy of all is in the home.  Loving and caring parental supervision, coupled with good example and communication.  Be interested in your own children's activities. Explain to the child that the reason you want to know where he has been is because you care.  Natural gas and possible oil wells off our coast may be great natural assets, but our greatest natural asset is our young population.</P>
    <P>This legislation is designed to protect our young population from abuse by drug traffickers or people who want to make a lot of money.  In this industry much money has been made by people at the expense and human misery of our young population.  It is appropriate that we should legislate to ensure to the best of our ability that the evil of this trafficking is curtailed to some degree.  The Minister in introducing this legislation is responding to that need and to the recommendations of the task force.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. We must all welcome any measure which would help to control this problem. There has been continuous growth in substance abuse and drug abuse, particularly tobacco and alcohol.  This is extraordinary since we all know that smoking is poisonous and results in disease and death.  We still persist in smoking.  The same applies in regard to alcohol.  I have made the point before that many people turn to alcohol to solve or to get over a particular problem.  In fact alcohol solves no problem.  It introduces many other problems.</P>
      <P>In the sixties apparently there was little or no drug abuse in this country, except by the odd returned emigrant.  Then in 1966 one person was charged with a drug offence.  In 1979 the number increased to 594 and in 1982 over 1,500 people were charged.  We have a very big and a growing problem: though Senator Ryan has rightly said we do not know the exact extent and it would be impossible to gauge this from court cases, it is a very serious problem.</P>
      <P>With the other Senators I would like to pay tribute to the work of the task force established in 1983.  We also know that the use of heroin has increased to an alarming rate.  We are told that there has been an almost vertical rise in the graph since 1980.  It is estimated that there are almost 1,500 addicts in the Dublin city area alone.</P>
      <P>A recent study carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board shows that in a particular area of the city 10 per cent of young people between 16 and 24 years of age are using heroin.  I could refer as other Senators have done to the seizures and indeed I want to pay a tribute to the authorities.  I could refer to the treatment centres.  It is important to acknowledge the work that has been done in these areas.  I could refer to health education in the schools and colleges.  In particular I would like once again to pay tribute to the Health Education Bureau and the marvellous work they have been doing.  Education is most important and it is vital that people in their tender years are looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago I completed a rescue <Col N="1128" /> instructors' course in the Civil Defence school in Ratra House.  There was an engineer there who dealt with fire control and, of course, like all the other instructors and lecturers, he was a very able man.  He said that fires are like unwanted pups and should be drowned when young.  This applies very much to drug abuse.  It should be nipped in the bud at a very early age.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer very briefly to the events which took place in Slane on Sunday last which many people claim were caused by hard drug abuse.  We know that free cigarettes were handed around and that there were not enough gardaí there to get the situation into control. Gardaí were apparently using improvised shields; some of them were using bread trays.  They could not win: if they did not make arrests the position deteriorated and, if they did, there was a commotion. We must pity the gardaí on that occasion because the law was suspended entirely in Slane all day on Saturday last.  The position at night was impossible to control. We know that in ordinary life people are prosecuted for such offences as urinating in public, yet people were lying drunk on the road without even being moved.</P>
    <P>Many people have said, and Senator Cassidy has made the point, that these events should be licensed and include security conditions which might make them less attractive for those who want to make a quick kill.  This would help to eliminate drug abuse at those events. Here at the weekend we had 50,000 people paying £12 each, which amounted to £600,000.  Out of that it should have been possible to provide at least £100,000 for security and incidentals such as cleaning up.  There are people who feel that events for more than 10,000 people should be controlled by licence.  For example, in Croke Park adequate provision is made for control of this nature. This control should include the surrounding area.  In ordinary life people who have to build a pier must get planning permission for it.  As long as people organising these functions comply with the health regulations there is no control over them. We had a situation at the weekend where <Col N="1129" /> 50,000 people were congregated in one field.  It brings me back to what I learned at school about Jean-Jacques Rousseau, "Back to the nature" was Rousseau's cry. That was the situation on Sunday.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for an increase in the monetary penalties and an increase in the maximum sentence for a convicted drug pusher.  I feel there should be a minimum sentence.  Section 2 contains definitions including new and more comprehensive definitions of cannabis and opium poppy.  Section 3 provides for streamlining of the procedures for investigating allegations of irresponsible prescribing by medical, dental and veterinary practitioners.  I notice that under this section the Minister for Health may establish a committee where there is suspicion of an indiscretion being committed, not as heretofore the registration authority.  It would seem to me that the registration authority should have some control in this respect but if they have no objection it seems that perhaps this is the right way to proceed.  Under section 4 the Minister may issue a temporary direction and as far as I can recall this might result in a suspension of 28 days which could be repeated for a further 28 days.  I suppose this is essential.  Section 6 provides for an increase in the maximum monetary penalties which can be imposed on summary conviction.  It appears that a minimum sentence should be provided.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators who said that education, sport and recreation are most important.  We discussed this at some length not too long ago.  This constitutes a positive approach.  I agree with those who have said that unemployment is the real problem in regard to drug abuse and alcohol.  I have made the point in this House on many occasions that I feel any Government should be in a position to provide full employment, to engage the nation's workforce in productive areas. I notice in today's papers that there may be some move in that direction which I welcome.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a measure of Senators' concern that at this late hour, 10.30 p.m., there are some people who <Col N="1130" /> are anxious to speak on this Bill, despite the fact that the Seanad has been sitting now since 2.30 p.m. without any breaks of any sort.  It underlines the concern with which Senators view the drug problem. I welcome this Bill, the purpose of which is to amend and extend the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  It is almost axiomatic to say at this stage that drug addiction in Ireland has taken a serious and significant turn for the worse, so much so that one of the first actions of the Government was to establish a Ministerial Task Force to examine the entire drugs situation and make recommendations. This Bill follows on these recommendations. It has become fashionable to decry this Government for setting up task forces, issuing reports or taking it upon themselves to examine a situation. I understand certain criticisms when action does not appear to flow as quickly as people feel it should.  In this instance there can be absolutely no criticism levelled at the Government because, almost as soon as they assumed office they set up this Ministerial Task Force.  Here we are, not too long afterwards, putting into legislative effect some of their recommendations to the Government and the Minister responsible.</P>
      <P>I would say that it was in the sixties that people's attention was first drawn to the problem of drug addiction.  It was borne in on the wave of the whole hippy era.  It was brought to light in Dublin by a pharmacist, Christy O'Connor, and was acted upon by the late Erskine Childers, the then Minister for Health.  It seemed then to be a problem merely of containing drug addiction to the fringe element of hard-core hippies.  Indeed that word "hippy" brings a feeling of nostalgia for those of us who were around to remember that whole era.  It was also hoped to ensure that experimenters from the young and the jet set would not be able to get drugs of addiction too easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the scene has changed radically. Cannabis has become a household word and it is being grown in Ireland.  I see that one of the provisions in this Bill is to extend that definition to include the particular plant which can be grown here. That is realistic and positive and is to be <Col N="1131" /> welcomed.  London has become a major drug distribution centre.  Of course the lines of communication have been shortened which bring its focus home to us here even more.  Formerly I would say that Amsterdam was the major drugs distribution centre.  We had, in the old days of the sixties and early seventies amateurish break-ins to dispensaries, largely in the Dublin area, and whatever drugs could be found there were duly whipped away.  All of this kind of amateurish behaviour has been replaced by organised criminals.  Robberies have become more and more daring and more and more sophisticated.  Very often they are accompanied by violence.  Even the most secure pharmacies have been under attack for selected drugs.  Of course, we were never of a culture to do things by half.  It has been said already in the course of this debate that our addicts now are tending to jump in at the deep end, sniffing or injecting drugs of addiction from the beginning rather than progressing to them as other societies do.  Already I have been told that we have chalked up a first in this society.  We are the first country to lead in diconal addiction.</P>
    <P>The most disquieting aspect of all is that the disease is spreading rapidly throughout our young society.  By the time treatment is sought the young addicts are already severely damaged. Even a three to five year programme of treatment and rehabilitation I am told has less than a 10 per cent success rate which makes preventive measures all the more important and all the more necessary. The kind of measures included in this Bill are of the preventive sort which is where we really must get in, in order to prevent the spread of this kind of abuse.</P>
    <P>Initially I would think that it is true to say that many of the young people involved in drug abuse came from less fortunate areas of our society.  They came from the ranks of the unemployed, broken homes and the less well educated.  Of course it is easy to understand how this was so.  From the very outset these young abusers adopt the syringe as a sort of status symbol.  I know that in certain areas of Dublin the syringe is highly <Col N="1132" /> sought and is regarded by these youngsters as a status symbol.  I think that is really very sad and very sick.  The majority of these youngsters favour intravenous injection or, as they would call it, &ldquo;maintaining&rdquo; as a means of partaking of the drug.  Today it is evident that drug abuse has hit at all sections of society right across the board and nobody is immune from it.  It has hit all social classes.  Everybody who cares should be concerned that this problem is tackled with vigour and skill.</P>
    <P>The Government established their special Ministerial Task Force in response to the urgency of the problem.  This Bill brings forward many features they recommended. It is impossible to consider drug abuse without examining the reasons why it is so rampant in our society today.  Those of us who are public representatives are aware of the anger, alienation, frustration, dissatisfaction, disillusionment and anxiety being felt by so many people in the face of the economic recession and the ensuring unemployment. Job prospects for school leavers are precarious.</P>
    <P>All in all it is fair to say that our young people feel very insecure, that the very ingredients which might tempt youngsters towards drug addiction are omnipresent in their lives and in society.  The results of unemployment and the economic recession generally are often manifested in homes suffering tension and poor communication.  The young person often feels misunderstood and isolated in this situation.  Very often parents, in order to soothe their feelings of unhappiness turn to alcohol and a whole cycle of deprivation starts up in families.  Very often arguments and alienation occur. Young people feel they want to escape this.  Either they remove themselves physically from the unhappy environment or take to drugs in order to provide them with some sort of escape from a reality which they find too harsh and painful.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we do not merely condemn and come in with draconian legislation but that we seek to understand.  I would like to express my praise and thanks to Inspector Mullins <Col N="1133" /> and the Garda Drugs Squad who have dealt with this problem with enormous insight, compassion and understanding. When they are called upon to intervene they are able to sort out the subtleties of situations and decide who needs a quiet word and who needs more direct intervention. They seem to do this with tremendous skill and sensitivity and we all owe them a great debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that young people always display a natural curiosity, which is a good thing, but if it is not curbed it can lead to experimentation in the area of drugs.  Many of the young people who involve themselves in this are naturally curious and the safeguards are not there to ward off this danger.  For others the problems may be more deeply rooted. They may be deeply psychologically disturbed or they may have severe personality problems in adolescence which may tip them over towards drug experimentation. Such people are always susceptible to the pressures to try drugs.  Reference has been made here to cannabis and it has been accepted by many people as being a natural part of our modern pop culture.  I am normally liberal in social matters but my feeling about cannabis is not of any liberal sentiment.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that as people become sucked into a certain sub-culture or drug culture their circle of friends changes, their habits change and the places they frequent change.  All in all, they become very open to being involved in drug taking at a more dangerous level. Therefore, I feel that cannabis should bear the sanctions of society and that we should not in any way appear to be soft on or lenient towards cannabis smoking. It is sad that a young person today does not need to go searching for or trying to find cannabis or any other drug.  Statistics have shown that on most occasions it is offered to the young person.  He or she may be pressured by his or her peers to have a "go" and have a smoke.  Peer pressure in adolescence is the greatest single factor which encourages a youngster to do something which by nature, inclination or training he or she may not wish to do, but the strength of character <Col N="1134" /> and moral courage to say "no" in the face of peer pressure is extremely testing for a young person.  Young persons are afraid to stand out from the crowd and to risk rejection from their peers if they decline to smoke cannabis.  I tell young people in the context of this debate not to be afraid to express their own individuality, display moral courage, stand out from the crowd and say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Escape from life's problems via the drug route is a fraud: it strikes at the very roots of living, at the ability to think, evaluate, learn and live.</P>
    <P>The one bright light in this darkness is the fact that it can and will be prevented, maybe not eradicated but the problem can be lessened, if there is commitment, massive public support, adequate legislation, education, and radical reform of social and economic structures.  This legislation is a step in that direction.  However, while I am speaking on Second Stage, I would cavil with one section of the Bill, and possibly I will come back to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to the influence of the media <i>vis-á-vis</i> our young people and reference is made to books and magazines which encourage drug abuse.  I take Senator Brendan Ryan's point that this section, if it is to mean anything about the influences to which young people are open, should include pop songs and the video films which accompany these pop songs and to which young people in cafes and bars are perpetually glued.  It is a reflection of the age of structure of the people who involve themselves in the preparation of this legislation and the parliamentary draftsmen that some reference was not made to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking young people who involve themselves in drug taking are not particularly into the written word but are very much into oral messages by way of pop music.  If I were closer to their age I might be able to burst into song and give the House an example of the sort of thing I am talking about, but I feel fairly confluent that the Senator who is to follow me and who is of another vintage may, if he does not sing, at least recite the words of some of the songs which I have in mind.  If this section is to mean anything, this area must be addressed, but if, as I <Col N="1135" /> have suggested, you remove books and magazines or pop songs and videos, which advocate smoking pot and drug taking, there is the danger &mdash;&mdash; as in all areas of censorship &mdash;&mdash; that you drive something underground.  Therefore, for young people in particular you make it far more attractive, far more sought after, and achieve an effect which you did not instead.  Therefore, I will be very interested to hear the Minister speak on that area because it is a notable gap in the Bill as it is presented to us.</P>
    <P>On the whole I welcome the Bill.  It is very necessary and it is indicative of the kind of positive, urgent response which Government have made to a most alarming problem in our midst.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to disappoint Senator Fallon.  I do not intend to sing and I do not intend to keep the House long.  Like the previous speaker, I welcome this Bill and I see a need for it.  In my experience of working with people I come in contact with young people especially young people who have access to cannabis.  The problem must be faced and action such as initiated in this Bill must be pursued.  The special task force were set up by the Government in 1983 in response to findings of research carried out on the drug problem not only in Dublin but in the rest of the country.  I compliment them on their immediate action in not alone pointing out the legal deficiencies of the 1977 Act but in recommending that we have a proper health education programme in our schools and that the community become more involved in combating the problem in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some points I should like the Minister to clear up.  The section dealing with irresponsible prescribing is very important.  I believe that people become addicted because of the over prescribing of drugs by doctors.  A report of the Southern Health Board in 1983 indicates <Col N="1136" /> that a small group of doctors were prescribing narcotics to addicts in such large amounts that they could be resold to drug abusers.  It is stated in the interim report which was drawn up by a committee set up by the Southern Health Board that a Garda told the committee that the activities of careless doctors was the single most important factor in the growth of drug abuse in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates the importance of the administration of drugs by doctors being restricted and administered very carefully.</P>
    <P>Regarding the extra powers given to the customs people I should like to ask the Minister how the trafficking in drugs by way of yachts and trawlers and even by helicopter can be prevented and if he has any proposals to prevent this trafficking. The drug ring in Europe is so well organised that the experts will not bring in drugs through the obvious routes or the obvious places.  For that reason it is important that we try to prevent in so far as is possible the importation of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>On the question of the powers being given to the Garda.  I should like to refer to a statement made by Deputy Garda Commissioner John McMahon which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 May 1983.  He submitted that Garda powers were restricted.  This Bill will go some way in eliminating those drawbacks.  He submitted also that the facilities to take more samples of suspects' hair, blood and urine and of fibres for evidence would greatly help the Garda.  Is there provision in this Bill for taking such samples?</P>
    <P>It has been alleged by Commissioner Wren that Ireland has become trans-shipment area for the international drug scene.  I would like the Minister to clarify this and to indicate if there is evidence to suggest that Dublin is a trans-shipment area for European drug traffic.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the power of the media, of video, pop songs and so on.  The Minister would have a problem in trying to curb this type of influence because even most novels are based on drug trafficking.  It is not unusual to see a drawing of a syringe or of some form of drugs on the covers of many novels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> There would very likely be a good deal of opposition to the attempted removal of that influence.  Senator Cassidy is not here at the moment to clarify this, but most pop songs are promoted by way of video, so from the commercial point of view it would be very difficult to control such an influence.  This type of advertising has a major influence on young people, encouraging them to take drugs just to appear to be with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the recommendation on health education.  I have said on numerous occasions in this House that a proper health education programme should be introduced into both the primary and post-primary schools.  This was suggested as far back as ten years ago and as yet nothing has happened in this respect.  I do not wish to lay the blame on anybody in particular but I appeal to the Minister and to the Minister for Education that action be taken in this area and that a proper health education programme, which no doubt would involve education in the use and abuse of drugs, be implemented and incorporated in the school curriculum as soon as possible.  Excuses such as academic pressure and timetables and so on are used but health education is becoming increasingly important for our young people.  School is supposed to be an education for life.  It is important now to be educated just to survive through life and education in how to look after oneself as regards drugs must be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>That is why proper health education programmes encompassing proper education on drugs should be undertaken immediately.  I acknowledge that some schools are making a decent effort but the effort is not being made on a widespread basis.  It is rather piecemeal and fragmented and lacks a simple, co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>The problems that a lot of school principals face is the lack of an expert to carry out a health education programme. Career guidance teachers would be ideal in this respect.  We had a health education programme in the physical education college.  I cannot see why health education <Col N="1138" /> could not be part of degree courses or of teacher-training courses.  No doubt this would have a very significant effect on the health of the community.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill I would say that if we are to combat the drug problem it will take a lot of action on the part of all responsible citizens.  It will take a lot of conviction as well because drug abuse is not confined to the lower social classes. It is spread across the class spectrum and people will have to be very honest and come forward even if it is going to offend their friends or family.  Drug abuse is a major problem especially in this era of unemployment.  One of the major reasons for the growth in drug abuse is that so many people are unemployed, depressed and destitute.  It is a form of escapism which people might not indulge in if they had employment and proper recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill and for implementing the task force recommendations in such a short time.  It is a very positive step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their detailed contributions to this Bill.  A number of Senators spoke about the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. I feel quite strongly that not sufficient cognisance is taken of the fact that significant progress has been made to date on most of the recommendations of the task force.  For example, on the law enforcement side, we have this Bill and in addition we have the Criminal Justice Bill coming before the House tomorrow. As Senators will be aware, the Criminal Justice Bill also deals with the question of drug pushing in the criminal justice context.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Drugs Squad I should point out that in the past few weeks a number of additional ban-ghardaí have been assigned to the drug units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as recommended by the task force.  There was the prospect of a heroin development in Limerick which was contained and eliminated.  There were drugs in use in Cork of a non-heroin nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> I know that ban-gardaí were necessary in this area of work.  A number of them have special training and I know their contributions, as recommended by the task force, will be quite effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, has introduced a more rigorous checking system for applications for passports.  Some Irish passports were abused in terms of criminal activity in this area.  This has been stopped by the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.  The rigorous system of checking has closed off that loophole which resulted in a number of passports being stolen.</P>
    <P>The recommendation relating to the appointment of one judge of the Circuit Court and one district justice, who would have a very special responsibility for all cases involving drug offences in the Dublin area, is being pursued with the relevant authorities.  It is a difficult area. The co-operation of the Judiciary under the relevant statutes has to be obtained. The proposal relating to the appointment of one solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office who would specialise in drug offence case work is also being pursued.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan and a number of other Senators raised the question of education.  Significant progress has already been made in this area.  I could arrange, through the Department of Education, for Deputies or Senators to see a set of five video films which have been developed in co-operation with the HEB for use within the context of the life skills type programme in second level schools.  They are being shown throughout the country in schools, youth clubs and to parent groups.  If any Senators want to have access to those video films in their own areas I would be prepared to arrange that through the Health Education Bureau.  They will see the tremendous merit of that medium.  Senator Bulbulia correctly referred to the impact of that type of video work.  Many of our young people including, for example, about 15,000 people in the inner city of Dublin, cannot read or write.  Videos have an impact in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has also asked the new Curriculum and Examinations <Col N="1140" /> Board to examine the introduction of health education in schools, both at primary and post-primary levels.  This is a difficult and sensitive area.  Health education in schools tends to evolve around the issue of sex education.  I am very much an advocate of the need for sex education in our schools; there is also need for education in relation to life.  It is essential that within the Curriculum and Examinations Board ethos there should be particular training in relation to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>We plan to develop a programme of training in drug education so that selected teachers would be able to attend longer courses and progress would be made towards the stated aim, shared by all parties of the Oireachtas, of having at least one teacher in every school who would be in a position to advise on aspects of the drug problem in each school, particularly schools in the risk areas.  That is progress and work is being done in that area.</P>
    <P>I have also made a substantial sum of money available to Trinity College to enable a diploma course in addiction studies to take place.  That course started last January.  The first group of specialised diploma persons will shortly complete that course.  It will include social workers, teachers, guidance counsellors and members of the Garda.  They will quality, for the first time in the history of the State, with a diploma in addiction studies.  They will have that specialised training.  They will be in direct contact with drug abusers and their families.  This is the kind of work that is being done. The next course will start in September. Persons are now being selected for that course and if Senators wish to bring that to the attention of either the health boards or the local community, persons will be selected and sent on that course.</P>
    <P>On the youth and community and development sides, the task force were quite active.  They met the HEB, Cospóir, the National Youth Council and the National Youth Policy Committee. We were worried about the delivery of services in the Dublin area.  They had been in touch with Mr. Frank Feely, the City and County Manager.  There was a <Col N="1141" /> meeting quite recently in the Ballymun area.  It was generally successful.  The participants undertook to have the various suggestions, which would involve their organisations, co-ordinated under the aegis of the manager.  The co-operation of these groups with statutory and other agencies will do a good deal to improve the social and physical environment in the area.</P>
    <P>There is need for research.  I do not want to decry in any way the work done by the Medico-Social Research Board, but initially the work was somewhat sketchy.  It gave a broad picture.  It did not relate to specific aspects of the drug problem, particularly among adolescents or, for example, fundamental research on peer groups and on socio-economic groupings in different areas.  In my constituency in Dún Laoghaire we have a serious drug problem and the incidence of drug abuse in, say, downtown Dún Laoghaire could be compared with, one might say, uptown Killiney where quite different socio-economic groups are living. That work is now being done.  It is being funded by the Department of Health and basic research is taking place under the aegis of the Medico-Social Research Board.  Only yesterday, Geoffrey Dean of that board told me that some fundamental information was becoming available relating to some 60 case studies in the Dún Laoghaire area, because the drug problem has been quite prevalent there.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of some of the alleged actions by alleged concerned parents drug-pushing has been exported from St. Theresa's Gardens out to Terenure where the drug-pushers now are instead of being in the inner city.  All that happens is that the drug-pushers go out there to get their drugs and that is regarded by the Provos as their solution to the problem.  I will come to that later on, because that superficial cashing in on a social problem is the hallmark of the Provo-Sinn Féin activity in the greater Dublin area.  You can talk to members of the Garda Síochána, social workers or members of the clergy involved in this <Col N="1142" /> area and they will readily confirm the statement that I have made.</P>
    <P>The question of treatment and rehabilitation services was raised by Senator Fallon and by Senator Brendan Ryan, particularly in relation to Jervis Street.  I can assure the House that discussions are going on between the representatives of my Department and the authorities of St. James's and Jervis Street Hospitals and Beaumont Hospital Board concerning the implementation of the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>Only last week I met the representatives of the Jervis Street board.  I want to put on record my thanks and appreciation to the Chairman, Denis McCarthy, and his colleagues, for their outstanding co-operation in relation to the future installation of services in Jervis Street Hospital. As we all know, Jervis Street and Richmond Hospitals will move to Beaumont in July 1985 and in the interim period we must now plan the walk-in, walk-out detoxification services within Jervis Street itself.  It is intended to make both capital moneys and revenue moneys available to the hospital in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the problem of the future of the structure of Jervis Street and the extent to which portion or all of it would be used for that service.  That is the kind of discussion we are having and we have established a clear, co-operative climate with the Jervis Street Hospital authorities and the work will be done.</P>
    <P>It is true to say in relation to St. James's Hospital that there were some original misgivings, as there are in relation to any hospital.  Jervis Street have to cope with a drug problem, but have more than that to cope with.  They have an accident and an emergency unit, also.  Like any hospital in Dublin on a Saturday night anybody seeing the rota of activity on accident and emergency, with many junior and senior citizens turning up half out of their minds from car accidents involving alcohol and so on, begins to wonder about the question of drug abuse.  Nursing and consultant staff are involved in pumping out over-consumption of alcohol, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, I might add.  But all hospitals, including Jervis Street, have to cope with that more <Col N="1143" /> serious problem.  The biggest drug problem in Ireland is alcoholism, the next biggest after that is tobacco substance abuse and a long way after that come heroin, cannabis and other abuses. Nevertheless, this is the problem we are dealing with tonight.  I hope I will receive an equally supportive hearing from the House when I bring legislation relating to tobacco consumption before the House in due course, despite the intense pressures which are now on me not to do so.</P>
    <P>The other hospitals also have been very co-operative. St. James's Hospital for the south side of Dublin will have beds and treatment facilities within the hospital and will provide services.  Regarding other aspects of treatment, particularly treatment referred to quite appropriately by Senator Ryan for persons who are under 16 years, I want to thank the Eastern Health Board and, in particular, the Coolmine Therapeutic Community who have been very supportive and anxious to provide services, particularly for those addicts who are under 16 years.  We have had discussions with Coolmine on that aspect.  I would recommend strongly to Senators that they visit that centre.  It is only 25-odd miles from Dublin, in the area appropriate to where that Senator lives rather than to his constituency at national level.</P>
    <P>The work being done in Coolmine has been quite exceptional and I am confident that that kind of regime and discipline, in the treatment sense, can be of enormous help to young people, particularly those under 16, in trying to rid themselves of this appalling habit.  I have made additional funds available for 1984 to assist Coolmine in meeting the demands now being made upon its services.  These demands, indeed, are quite exceptional, but the work is being done.  The Eastern Health Board also are now examining &mdash;&mdash; again at my specific request &mdash;&mdash; the needs of young people with drug-related problems and my Department are keeping in touch with the board in that regard.</P>
    <P>I referred to the recruitment of additional ban-ghardaí and to the now very large drugs squads &mdash;&mdash; well over the 40 <Col N="1144" /> mark &mdash;&mdash; which are spread throughout the country.  But it is true to say that we cannot just rely exclusively on the excellent work being done by the drugs squad. They cannot do all the work on their own.  All Garda recruits are now given special training in relation to drug problems and the Garda generally are increasingly involved in the fight against drug abuse.  The increase in the number and amount of seizures in terms of value is a reflection of this general involvement. We cannot just continually rely to an enormous degree on the excellent work being done by the drugs squad.  We have to rely on all members of the Garda Síochána and, in particular, all members of the public to combat the situation.  I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that I have been particularly irate about.  While I do not mind people being opposed to me politically &mdash;&mdash; they may not share my own particular political views and in a democracy that is quite understandable &mdash;&mdash; the one thing I get totally frustrated about is the allegation that the Minister of the day, the authorities of the day and the Department of Health of the day are doing nothing in the greater Dublin area in terms of provision of services.  That kind of allegation, quite frankly, incenses the staff of my Department who are limited in number.  The total staff in the Department of Health number only about 350.  They are all experts in their own right, in their own areas.  Likewise, whatever about the bureaucratic deficiencies, real or otherwise, in the Eastern Health Board it is involved in the provision of programmes in the greater Dublin area.  I ask those critics, be they appearing on the Pat Kenny Show on RTE or on the Gay Byrne Show, in Seanad Éireann or elsewhere to go down to the Talbot Centre in Sheriff Street in Dublin to see what is being done there, the group therapy work, the counselling and the literary classes provided in the centre.  It is intended to extend this service to cater for a number of young women.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling fact that a number of young pregnant women in Dublin are on heroin.  That centre is trying to cater for those young women.  I have no medical <Col N="1145" /> expertise but I am assured by a number of obstetricians that babies are born with heroin addiction.  Their plight is absolutely tragic.  Needless to remark, other babies are born suffering from alcohol addiction and the ill-effects of tobacco. That is a reality to which we have become accustomed in our blasé civilisation.</P>
    <P>Some of our critics should talk to the project leader in the Talbot Centre and to the group worker about the work being done in that area.  There is also a day care facility in Donore Avenue.  I have seen the work being done there by individuals such as Paul Humphreys.  I have seen the work being done by the project leader and by the counsellor on substance abuse.  Some people infer that nothing is being done at all even though workers are paid and subsidised by the health boards through the Department of Health and through the taxpayer.  There has to be give and take in this area.</P>
    <P>In the Cherry Orchard-Ballyfermot area, the health board have assigned a public health nurse to act as a tracercounsellor on a non-attached basis.  The service is not based in any centre.  This nurse's availability is well known to all the GPs in the area, and to local community groups.  She traces and counsels drug-related hospital cases who are discharged from Cherry Orchard.  We have an abominable fixation in this country that, for any kind of treatment we deliver within the community, be it hospital care, day care or drug-related care, we have to have buildings.  Everybody wants buildings. Everybody wants receptionists. Everybody wants porters and secretarial assistance.  What is far more important is that we have people who live and work in an area and who do not require this outdated conservatism which public representatives in particular are obsessed with of having the physical existence of the structure.  I find very often in respect of those services that 40 per cent of all expenditure is on the administrative side. Sometimes it is as high as 60 per cent or 70 per cent of those people chasing paper and chasing their own tails instead of being out in the field doing the work they are being paid to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> Even in my own constituency people want centres, major buildings, major facilities, beds and beds.  In my area of Dún Laoghaire-Ballybrack we appointed a senior professional qualified counsellor in substance abuse who works within the health service.  She is a qualified nurse and she provided her own clinics.  She is involved in outreach and counselling work.  She travels around co-ordinating the activities of voluntary groups in the area.  She is of enormous assistance to individual families, but she does not have to sit in an office all day.  In Irish society we have the doctor's surgery to which everybody allegedly goes.  There is an idea that everybody requires the same kind of treatment centre for drug treatment when, in fact, the best treatment given to a drug addict is inside his own home with his or her own family.</P>
    <P>The health board give a substantial grant to the Rutland Centre in Dublin which in recent years has extended its services for the treatment of alcohol abuse to include services for illicit drug abusers.  I have seen the work being done in the Rutland Centre.  People are excessively reluctant to give credit where credit is due in that regard.  In the Dublin area the health board are in the process of building a youth development centre in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  This centre will provide accommodation for 31 disturbed young males and females whose behaviour, including drug-related offences, has resulted in their being directly in contact with the processes of the law.  To the extent that accommodation is necessary it is being provided.</P>
    <P>Some money has been allocated to the Anna Liffey Project which has often been the subject of some interest.  In my own area of Ballybrack where there is a drug problem, we have given a grant to a group there called Team Challenge to assist them in their work in educating young people about drugs and drug abuse.  In addition, other grants are being paid to a number of youth community organisations to help them to expand their existing services.  That is the kind of work being done in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the work being <Col N="1147" /> done in other health board areas because I could keep Senators here all evening. In the Southern Health Board area considerable work is being done towards the establishment of an early intervention and advisory service.  In September 1982 excellent work was done by the committee. I commend in particular the work being done in the Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal areas by the North Western Health Board.  I regard that as a model partnership between the education and health areas of activity, particularly the life skills programme for schools.  I urge Senators to make contact with that health board if they are in that area because a partnership in that area has ensured the delivery of a very positive health programme facility which I have seen for myself.  I spent some time viewing the life skills project.  It is a direct support system to second level schools.  It is <i>in situ</i> and working tremendously well in the schools in the North Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>For example, it provides a framework for the development of a comprehensive health education programme within the school, including sex education and drug abuse education.  It trains teachers in informal teaching methods.  It provides teaching materials and visual aids for implementing a programme and it provides specific training in areas such as drug abuse.  That programme, based on some excellent work which was brought from Scotland and integrated into the programme, has proved to be outstanding. I recommend that those Senators who wish to see the programme in action should contact the CEO, Donal O'Shea, who will arrange for them to view the kind of work being done there.  My only regret is that other health board areas have not shown the same activity in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of concerned parents.  We have to be very careful and I, more than most, must be particularly careful about our observations in that regard.  I want to assure the Senator that we all want to give every encouragement to concerned parents to come together on an organised basis under the aegis, for example, of the Coolmine <Col N="1148" /> advisers.  If they wish to form in the greater Dublin area or in the Leinster area I can do no more than to recommend that they contact Jim Cumberton, the director of Coolmine, who is well known to Senator Brendan Ryan.  He will then attend a meeting and a group of people will formally establish themselves as a group of concerned parents.</P>
    <P>What I object to and vehemently oppose is the Provos deliberately moving into a particular area, bringing in their video cameras and their tape recording machines, and going around talking to young drug addicts and using the information on a purely political basis.  They hold spurious marches and demonstrations and create a spurious heightening of local activity, all on a superficial basis with no relationship to treatment, or to anything other than threats of physical violence against individuals who may or may not be involved in drug pushing. Nevertheless they are tried, judged, and knee-capped and shot at by people who have no authority whatsoever to take the law into their own hands and who then masquerade as the people who are solving the drug problem.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which has emerged in a number of areas but it is one which the law of the land and the Garda will not tolerate and which we as a community should not fall for.  That is the situation we should be concerned about.  There is only one short step from that.  These people say, "We will give you protection from drug pushers but in all other aspects of life you had better obey our diktat".</P>
    <P>I draw the distinction between truly concerned parents and those in subversive organisations who masquerade as concerned parents but who have decided quite deliberately and cynically to avail of the drug issue to gain transient political popularity for themselves in that area. Those of us around long enough in public life can smell that kind of activity a mile away.  I would include Senator Brendan Ryan in that regard because he is long enough involved in voluntary community work to know the kind of sharp distinctions which we must all make.  My advice is very simply that any group of parents who are worried about the situation. <Col N="1149" /> should contact the Department of Health or they should contact the Coolmine director, Jim Cumberton.  They will get basic advice and guidance and will not be taken for a short, sharp political ride whereby the drug pushers will be sent from one area out to another, for example, from downtown Dún Laoghaire to uptown Ballybrack where they are there anyway, from Ballybrack back over to Dundrum or from St. Theresa's Gardens out to Rathmines and from Rathmines to Terenure where they are now.</P>
    <P>Our problem is to combat drug abuse and that includes drug pushers.  The first fight has to be in trying to reduce the number of addicts.  If you reduce the number of addicts and prevent people from becoming addicted, then the rationale of the drug pusher ceases to exist and his lifestyle is determined.  You can shoot one drug pusher but the drug addict will find another drug pusher and you will merely double the profits for the remaining individuals.  That is why I feel strongly about it.  The Garda authorities will endorse what I have said.</P>
    <P>Likewise, we should avoid some of the statements which have been made.  It is easy to become either emotionally involved in this area or to make allegations which are untrue.  I can assure Senator Ryan, although he did not make the allegation, it is not true that there were five or six heroin addicts who died over a particular weekend in June in Jervis Street.  The situation as &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>Deputy Gregory did say it in the Dáil but I am precluded from commenting on that as it is in another House.  That statement was made.  The reality is that there were seven deaths from drug abuse recorded in the first six months of 1984.  It is true that two of them were related to heroin.  It is also true that these two deaths occurred in a particular weekend in June.  That is the reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the distinction in so far as it was clearly stated in the newspapers that the drug treatment centre in Jervis Street had confirmed, which was not true, that five heroin addicts had died over a particular period of 10 days.  That hit the headlines.  It is very difficult to have the media correct what they state as a matter of fact but it was corrected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the seven deaths was related to alcoholism, a combination of alcohol and other drugs.  A <i>post-mortem</i> was carried out on that person and he was deemed to have died of a heart attack, aided and abetted by heroin and alcohol.  That was only one of the seven but there were two directly related to heroin.  One death from heroin is one too many.  We all accept that but we must keep the facts and facts are sacred as regards issues of that nature.</P>
      <P>I refer now to the alleged abuse of powers by the Garda.  As a member of the Irish Association of Civil Liberties, a paid-up member as well, I would be concerned that anyone would be strip-searched in relation to any allegation.  I say to Senator Ryan that if that information is given by him in confidence to me about an individual I will immediately ask the Minister for Justice to have an investigation carried out into the matter. It is easy to make allegations of that nature which are very distressing.  If they happen to be correct and if the person for no valid reason has been strip-searched I would urge that person to institute legal proceedings immediately as he or she would be perfectly entitled to do.  No member of the Garda Síochána can initiate a procedure of that nature unless thre is just statutory entitlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In all such cases I urge that that information should always be followed up with factual evidence and I will certainly deal with it.  It has been necessary on occasion to have strip-searching because it is a fact of life that concealment within the body is an established, conventional way of transmitting drugs.  That is a reality of drug smuggling on a daily basis but it still does not get rid of the particular point I make in that regard.  I defend the need for section 5 because there is readily available both in this country and abroad widespread literature relating to the advocacy and the encouragement &mdash;&mdash; these are aspects within the Bill &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The section makes it an offence to distribute publications which advocate or encourage the use of any controlled drug prescribed for the purposes of the section.  I can well appreciate that in literature of outstanding merit which Senator Ryan and I have read there is many a reasonable reference and an analysis of a particular drug but there are publications which advocate drugs.  For example, <i>High Times</i>, a drug publication, formally advocates drugs, gives various examples of drug abuse and has sales of four million.  It is an American publication and is freely available in this country.  It advocates equipment and particular drugs and there is a supplement with it which gives various analyses of what is available in terms of drugs and their prices.  It also gives a marijuana grower's guide and another section gives the various tests one can avail of to decide whether cocaine is pure or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, this magazine gives subscription rates for other drug magazines.  I could go on and on.  I <Col N="1152" /> make the point in particular to Senator Ryan that it is the kind of magazine which deals exclusively with the question of drug abuse and which advocates it.  Magazines which advocate and encourage the direct use of drugs are beyond the pale as far as this Bill is concerned and need to be encompassed within the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia raised the question of videos and we have considerable difficulty in terms of definition.  I thoroughly sympathise with Senator Bulbulia's view but there is considerable legal definition in terms of videos, records and so on but more particularly I am concerned with those magazines and specific mail order publications which are posted to young people advocating drug abuse.  I will certainly look at the prospect of encompassing that in subsequent legislation but it is an area about which the parliamentary draftsman, the Attorney General and myself wish to exercise considerable care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding medical assessments, the facts which would become available in court would indicate very clearly whether the person is or is not an addict.  As part of the normal process of prosecution and court proceedings, inevitably the question as to whether a person is an addict will emerge.  We have seen instances where pushers, who keep themselves 1,000 miles from any prospect of becoming addicted, have said and their defence has advocated that they must be sent for medical examination.  I remember well &mdash;&mdash; and I speak as the Chairman of the Dáil Select Committee on the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act &mdash;&mdash; debating this issue at great length and the then spokesman on Health for the Opposition, Deputy Charles Haughey, and the then Minister for Health, Brendan Corish, discussed the matter across the House at great length on that occasion and it was felt for the first time in the history of the State that a particular provision should be brought in in respect of medical reports. However, I do not think there is a case for remanding a drug pusher for a medical report when it is clearly known and would become known in court both to the drugs squad and to those bringing forward evidence in relation to a prosecution that the person is not a drug addict <Col N="1153" /> but a straightforward pusher.  For those persons it would not be mandatory but entirely at the judicial discretion to order a medical examination.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned that the application of the law should not be punitive or in any way repressive in terms of the question of drug abuse, particularly relating to addicts coming before the court because an addict above all needs treatment rather than the heavy hand of the law.  That is of critical importance. I will be doing my utmost within the health area to ensure that the judicial discretion will be exercised in that direction. That is why we advocate that as far as possible, there should be a judge specialising in this area.  That would be my main point in regard to the question of medical examination and medical assessment.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for their comprehensive contributions on this Stage of the Bill.  I will conclude by referring very briefly to the minimum 14 years provision as distinct from the life sentence provision.  I assure Senators that the main concern here is to enable the courts in their discretion to provide a life sentence where that is deemed necessary. It can arise in relation to the extremity of drug pushing where very grave evidence is presented before the court that a life sentence can be imposed.  At present it cannot be imposed.  A life sentence is indeterminate.  It is a very grave decision on the part of any judge and the only way a person can be released from a life sentence is at the discretion of the Minister for Justice.  An ordinary life sentence tends to be six to eight years but where a formal life sentence is imposed in particular circumstances, a person can be imprisoned for up to 14 years.  It has been suggested that there should be a minimum sentence of 14 years for drug pushing. I am very much opposed to that.  It can happen that a student, for example, may be addicted over a period of two or three months and could pass on drugs to another student in a college.  We all tend to pick students; God help the unfortunate students.</P>
    <P>They are no more prone to addiction <Col N="1154" /> than anybody else in the community but they are the classic example.  It would be unduly and excessively repressive if one were obliged to impose 14 years on a person because he passed cannabis to another student and was caught in the act, particularly when one must take into account that the purpose of prison is supposed to be reform.  We all have our strong views about the extent to which it is not reform &mdash;&mdash; I have very strong views in that regard &mdash;&mdash; but there are pushers. I know some of them in my constituency and the havoc they have wreaked on human life, on families, and on teenagers. If I were on the bench I would cheerfully give them 14 years, and I would have no compunction about reviewing it at a very early date.  That particular penalty has to be available in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on that note.  I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for being tolerant of my extended contribution by way of reply at this stage and look forward to Committee Stage tomorrow.  We can then get down to the details in this Bill because, as somebody from the Department of Justice remarked, this Bill in many respects is tougher than the Criminal Justice Bill.  The Criminal Justice Bill has provoked greater and more searching analysis and it is a perception of the seriousness with which we view drug abuse in our community that legislation of this nature proceeds through the House with such rapidity.  My pre-midnight comment is that all the law in the world and all the treatment centres in the world, pale into insignificance in relation to our social attitudes towards drug and substance abuse because it is fundamentally a matter for the individual in his cultural environment, an environment where so many young people, so many schoolchildren, grow up; where, in their own homes and in their own society they get massive indoctrination, via the pub in particular, in the first step towards drug abuse.  That is the reality but nobody in our community wants to face up to that.  Where children perceive that the life cycle begins in the local boozer on Saturday and Sunday &mdash;&mdash; for many families every night of the week &mdash;&mdash; where the mother and father smoke 40 fags a day between them at <Col N="1155" /> home, it is no wonder that children automatically gravitate to soft drugs, then to cannibis and from there to hard drugs. When one says that to people, one is accused of being a killjoy wanting to deny the Irish people their legitimate enjoyment while they pursue happiness of that nature.  Before I become entirely paranoid about it I had better conclude.</P>
