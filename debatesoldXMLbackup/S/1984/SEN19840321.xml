      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The extradition of Dominick McGlinchey and future treatment of extradition warrants for terrorist offences committed in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the matter brought forward by Senator Ross is of an obviously complex nature involving a decision by the Supreme Court.  I rule that it is not suitable for discussion under the Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1984.</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 14th March, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contribution Act, 1979, that the Minister for Health may by regulations vary the rate at which health contributions are payable and also the <Col N="502" /> income ceiling up to which contributions are payable.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of that Act provides that a draft of any such proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House deal with the income ceiling.  It is not proposed to vary the rate figure which has remained at 1 per cent since 6 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The income ceiling is at present £11,000.  It is proposed to raise this to £12,000 with effect from the beginning of the next contribution year, namely, 6 April 1984.  The effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £110 to £120, an increase of £10 per annum.  The increase will be collected from most contributors towards the end of the 1984-85 contribution year, that is, in the first quarter of 1985.  While the total estimated annual additional yield is £2 million approximately only about £200,000 extra will be realised in the current financial year ending 31 December 1984.  The balance of £1.8 million will come in the first quarter of 1985.</P>
      <P>The Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that when setting a new ceiling figure the Minister shall take into account any changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries as recorded by the Central Statistics Office since the date by reference to which the ceiling figure was last determined. The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1983.  The average weekly earnings figure increased from £129.33 per week in June 1982 to £141.39 by June 1983.  This represents an increase of 9.3 per cent.  When this is applied to the current ceiling of £11,000, a new ceiling of £12,023 or, say, £12,000 per annum emerges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention the new arrangements applying to the collection of health contributions from farmers.  At present, health boards are responsible for the collection of these contributions from approximately 100,000 farmers and it had been the practice to use a notional system, <Col N="503" /> RV and a multiplier, to determine farm income for this purpose.  In July 1982, the High Court ruled that the use of farm RV and a multiplier to determine farm income was contrary to the Constitution. To deal with this situation and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I made regulations which provide for the assessment of farmers' income on a factual basis as in the case of other self-employed persons.  In effect this means that farm income is assessed on the basis of the profits or gains from farming activities less any expenses incurred in earning these profits and less any superannuation contributions which may have been paid.  Demands based upon factual assessment, including any arrears outstanding, have recently been issued by the health boards to all farmers liable for health contributions.</P>
    <P>With regard to collection arrangements in the case of farmers' health contributions, the general opinion held was that health boards were not an appropriate agency to collect health contributions, the youth employment levy and the 1 per cent income levy from the farming sector.  The situation has been corrected by the transfer of responsibility for collecting health contributions and levies from farmers to the Revenue Commissioners with effect from 6 April next. Regulations giving effect to this decision have been made.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about the large scale evasion of liability for health contributions by the farming community and other self-employed persons.  These contributions form a very important element of the finances available to fund health services expenditure.  Any failure to achieve targets for health contribution receipts in those times of financial stringency could only result in a reduction in the extent or quality of the services provided. It is manifestly unfair that a situation should exist whereby persons who have reneged on their obligations in this regard should be able to obtain health services without penalty.  Accordingly, I have advised health boards to make full use of every enforcement procedure available to them in the collection of outstanding amounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> As an added means of ensuring that all persons liable for contributions do in fact discharge their liabilities fully and promptly, I propose to introduce regulations in the near future providing for a hospital admission charge of £100 in the case of persons seeking in-patient services in public hospitals who have not discharged their liabilities for health contributions. This charge will be additional to any payments for private or semi-private accommodation.  These regulations will come into effect from 1 June 1984 and will apply in respect of arrears as at the end of the previous contribution year, in effect 5 April 1984.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion today is simply to raise the ceiling level for health contributions from the current figure of £11,000 to a new figure of £12,000.  I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give some support to this motion, of which we were aware for some time.  I can recall when the health contribution was as low as £7 per annum.  Now the ceiling has been raised to £12,000 and the new figure will be £120 per annum under the Health Contributions Act.  People would gladly pay that kind of money if they were sure that the services they would receive were increasing but we all know that that is not the case.  Financial contributions from the Exchequer to health boards all over the country are being cut back drastically. We must assume, despite what the Minister says, that these cutbacks will bring about a reduction in services and that the whole area of hospitalisation and services generally will be reduced.  I never cease to wonder why, at a time of economic recession, all our people are being asked to pay more and more in levies, not just in the area of health but local government and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could spell out if there is any kind of a waiver scheme. At some stage we will have to cry halt because the people are feeling the pinch. Under this regulation we are being asked to pay more.  Obviously we welcome the increase in the ceiling to £12,000 because this will bring more people into the net <Col N="505" /> but we have to make the point that there will be a reduction in services and this will not be to the benefit of the people. Was there a waiver scheme?  Could there be a waiver scheme as there is in other areas of Government?  This would be welcome. The question of farmers paying these contributions has been raised.  The health boards do not provide the best way for the collection of funds of this kind, and maybe this procedure would be the best way to do that because farmers and the self-employed are feeling the pinch.  I hope that leniency will prevail in matters of this kind.  With regard to admissions to hospitals, I hope this is not waving the big stick.  It seems a bit unfair and could result in a person who would genuinely need hospitalisation feeling that he cannot avail of it.  This could have a detrimental effect on his health.</P>
    <P>While we would welcome the increase in the ceiling there are obvious disadvantages. The big question is, will we be getting value for money?  I will leave it to the Minister to ensure that when people are paying £120 under the Health Contributions Act full value for money will be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enabling motion with which I do not have many problems. The only people who will lose under this motion will be the consultants because the level of income at which they can appropriately charge their private patients will be raised from £11,000 to £12,000. On the positive side, people will not need to take out VHI cover before they have an annual income of £12,000.  The 1 per cent health contribution is probably the best value for health services in any country.  For £120 a person can have a total health service &mdash; consultants, hospital accommodation, full nursing, outpatient treatment and so on.  I would like to see the day when we would not have differentiation between classes when it comes to the provision of health services but we can only do that if our economic situation improves and the State will be in a position genuinely to look after people's health from birth to death.  We are far removed from that situation at the <Col N="506" /> moment and anybody who thinks that day is near has not looked seriously at our present economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned farmers' contributions. This matter has been raised at many health board, county health committee, county council and trade union meetings and at different fora and there are three different aspects I would like to put on the record of the House.  There are farmers who got bills for health contributions going back to the initiation of the health boards, before the PLV system was in contention or was being put through the legal process to find out if it was constitutional.  Many of them did not contribute until they became ill.  Then they were prepared to pay all the contributions that had been outstanding over a number of years.  I hold no brief for those people because they were entitled to a service and had not paid for it but they were prepared to do so only when they required it.  In that situation I recognise that possibly a penalty should be applied from June this year.</P>
      <P>People with valuations under £40 were brought into the tax net for the first time last year.  They were not obliged, legally or otherwise, to keep accounts and were not in a position to surrender audited accounts to the health boards to confirm their income.  The health boards, at the request of the Minister, sent them a self-assessment profile.  Some farmers returned them but, to my dismay, I heard recently that the health board of which I am a member did not even send bills to those people until last week and the week before.  It is unfair to penalise people if they have genuinely complied with the regulations but were not sent bills.  There is a responsibility on the management of the health boards to ensure that that does not happen.  We have computer facilities available and we have reasonably good office staffing levels in health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another category, those who did not answer the profile but were sent bills after Christmas based on an assessment of what their contributions might be.  This proves what the Minister said, that the health boards are not a suitable agency for collecting money from farmers because to collect money from farmers in <Col N="507" /> the present economic situation one has to visit them, like rate collectors.</P>
    <P>There is another group of farmers, those with valuations over £40.  The Revenue Commissioners advised the health boards what the farmer's income was last year, and that information has been forthcoming to the health boards only in the last number of weeks.  I would like the Minister to be assured that in spite of all the comments that have been made about the non-payment of health contributions, youth employment levies and income levies by the farming sector, there is a great deal of misinformation abroad about this.  The true facts should be known.  I do not hold a brief for anybody who does not pay his fair share because it is only right he should, but it should be recognised that the boards have not been able to meet the requirements put on them by the Minister to act as collecting agencies.  This is a pity because a lot of money is genuinely due and there are many farmers who want to pay but have not been sent bills.</P>
    <P>Some organisations adopted a different attitude last year and even advocated that the documents should not be completed. I publicly condemned that stand. In fairness, other organisations publicly said that if farmers were in doubt, they should make a payment on account.  We had to get the chief executive officers formally to accept payments on account in the absence of full figures being available. In other words, the whole area of health contributions to the health boards has been a sorry mess and the sooner it is taken up by the proper collecting agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the sooner people will pay their contributions as they become due, based on figures that have been agreed by the taxman and by accountants.  This anomaly about the amount of money due to health boards under this heading will then be eliminated. There is a sizeable amount of money involved and all our health boards are trying to live within restrictive budgets. If this kind of money were available to the Department of Health, I am quite sure our jobs as members of health boards would be very much easier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> I commend the motion because it is a step in the right direction.  It increases the number of people eligible for free health services, and it asks them to pay 1 per cent of their income towards the service. I have no doubt that the service being delivered is worthy of favourable comment from all involved.  We cannot speak too highly of those involved in the health service &mdash; consultants, nurses or staff at any other level of the health service.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my support to the motion to raise the ceiling from £11,000 to £12,000.  This is one scheme I have always supported because it admitted a section of the farming community and the self-employed to the hospital services scheme.  These people were previously debarred because they did not make PRSI payments or insurance contributions. Many people have been very glad of this service down through the years but the limit needed to be raised to £12,000.  In welcoming the scheme, I would also like to impress on the Minister certain aspects of it at which he should have a serious look.  One is the refund in the drugs scheme where the lower limit has been raised dramatically over the last number of years &mdash; the last rise was approximately 28 per cent.  This may have been a saving of £2 million to the health boards but the amount of hardship that saving has created is very considerable. I ask the Minister to try to freeze the drugs scheme refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme like this should be supported by everyone because if it was fully supported it would, to a large degree, be self-financing.  Hospitals services have been reduced and staff levels will continue to decline until the embargo on recruitment is lifted.  There has been an increasing demand on services in hospital casualty departments.  I ask the Minister to have a look at the areas where health boards have been making strong recommendations for improvements.  When the health contributions forms have been assessed and the money due by the farming community and the business and commercial sectors is received, much of this <Col N="509" /> money could be used in what I would term emergency services that need to be provided in many health board areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris spelt out the few points I wanted to raise.  In common with the rest of the Senators, I want to welcome the raising of the ceiling from £11,000 to £12,000 I also accept the point the Minister is making in relation to the £100 penalty he intends to introduce for failure to pay.  I suppose something has to be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris pointed out the many problems and confusions on the part of the farming community and I have found this as well.  A number of people were very confused at the amount of money they had to pay this year.  Farmers at an IFA meeting which I attended recently had an axe to grind because they were not given any allowance for depreciation on machinery.  That is a very big item in the farming world.  I hope I am correct in saying that and if so perhaps the Minister would take note of it.</P>
      <P>Many people were not clear as to the amounts they had to pay and were very anxious to pay something.  Naturally nobody wants to pay too much but they always feel they should pay some amount of money at least to keep themselves right.  It is not the same as non-payment of the ESB bill where the supply will be cut off and if people feel that their health is good and that they will not have to darken the door of a hosptial they will keep the money as long as they can.  For that reason there must be every incentive to these people to pay.</P>
      <P>Some Senators pointed out that the health boards are in dire straits for money at present.  We read from time to time about the millions that the farmers owe to health boards but I think these are rather inflated figures.  I encourage people to pay health contributions because it is only right and proper that they should do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers contend that they are not being treated fairly regarding an allowance for depreciation of farm machinery and I would ask the Minister to look at this point.  I am not saying that this is a <Col N="510" /> fact but it is something that has been raised at a meeting.  In common with others I welcome the raising of the ceiling from £11,000 to £12,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the usual measures which we have to support in this House and the other House.  Nobody likes to see costs escalating or to see charges being increased.  We know that the cost of the health service has increased substantially over the last few years, particularly for drugs and treatment in hospitals and so on.  It is important that people who are not entitled to a medical card should have some kind of cover and should be encouraged to pay their health contributions.  There has been an unfortunate failure because of the inability of health boards to collect those charges.  When people think they can get away without paying charges, naturally enough they will try to do so.  They cannot see the dangers involved until such time as they have to enter hospital and look for treatment and then they find that the bills they have to pay are huge.</P>
      <P>Health services are costing a lot of money and we know that the Minister requires money to pay for those services. We have seen a very severe cutback particularly in the Western Health Board area.  Many of the services provided over the years have been discontinued due to lack of finance and this will cause great hardship to many people who have become used to those services.  I hope when the Minister is dividing up the money he will collect from this imposition that he is asking us to support today that he will think particularly of those people in the Western Health Board area who are no longer being provided with those services they previously enjoyed, thus creating hardship in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Department officials recently took offence because the Western Health Board were demanding money for the continuation of those services.  I do not think that is right.  The Western Health Board have a right to demand money for the services they have been providing over the years and which they think the people in the west are entitled to.  They know what the people need, not the Department <Col N="511" /> officials in Dublin who have responsibility for the whole country and who naturally will be trying to save money on certain schemes.  I hope that the Minister will take a more sympathetic view and that he will heed the demands of the health boards.  I am sure they are reasonable in their submissions and he should certainly give them their fair share of the money that will be coming into his Department as a result of this measure we are supporting here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their welcome for these draft regulations. I should like to make four points by way of response.</P>
      <P>The first point is that there are in the country about 150,000 farmers.  It is important to realise that about one in every three farmers has a medical card &mdash; about 50,000 farmers &mdash; and as such they have no liability for the payment of health contributions.  If I may pick a particular health board area, the Donegal-Sligo area, about seven out of ten farmers will not be paying any health contributions because the percentage of population there who are covered by medical cards is in the region of 62 or 63 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is the same in the Western Health Board area.  There is a lot of special pleading made with respect to the Western Health Board because in that area about six out of every ten farmers will not be paying health contributions at all because they have medical cards.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 100,000 farmers who are liable are spread for the most part along the east coast and down the midlands into Munster. That is where the bulk of farmer health contributions are paid.  Even where they are paid &mdash; and this is my second point &mdash; the actual contributions so far have been quite small.  The contrast is striking.  The average contribution last year on the health contribution basis by an insured worker and a pensioner was about £64 for the year.  That was the average paid by nearly a million people who have liability under PAYE. There are about 100,000 self-employed <Col N="512" /> people in the country other than farmers and the average contribution by a self-employed person was about £25.  The insured worker paid about £64 last year, the self-employed about £25, while the average contribution by 100,000 farmers was £7.  That is the disparity.  In terms of income liability there is a very big disparity between a £64 contribution and a £7 contribution.  Many industrial workers are aware of this and they resent the fact that by and large up to now contributions have not been paid.</P>
    <P>The system has militated to quite an extent against an effective contribution liability being established.  Health boards have no incentive to collect health contributions because they do not see the money since it goes straight to the Exchequer.  That is why for the past 15 months I have been seeking to convince my colleague in Government, the Minister for Finance, that it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to collect this money direct, in the same way that income tax is collected.  That has now been accepted by the Government and by the Minister for Finance.  In fairness to my colleague, Deputy Alan Dukes, he did not require much convincing on it. The system had just got out of gear.</P>

      <P>He is now bringing in that new regulation from 5 April 1984. It is still extremely good value for money. I do not know of any country in Europe where for a 1 per cent contribution of one's income, or for £7 a year from a farmer &mdash; assuming that he is not in the VHI, and many of them are not &mdash; one has free maintenance and treatment in a public ward of a hospital, free specialist out-patient services at public clinics and a subsidy towards the cost of maintenance at certain approved private hospitals and homes.  Admittedly the latter are becoming a declining commodity in some respects but the subsidy is still there.  There is still assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines and any family spending more than £28 per month has a subsidy.  For certain long-term illness <Col N="513" /> there is a free drug scheme.  The general practitioner, maternity and infant care services are all free for category 2 persons up to a ceiling of £12,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Health contributions cover only a fraction of the total cost of the health services.  The estimated yield for the year 1984 is £73 million, if I recall the figure correctly, and, to use a colloquial term, it is &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; in terms of total Exchequer spending.  Out of £1,000 million we get £73 million in health contributions. The bulk of the ordinary taxpayers' contributions in income tax, VAT, excise duty and so on goes in very substantial measure towards the cost of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised in relation to capital allowances and we have had a lot of difficulty in that regard.  On the new factual assessment basis farm income is determined on the same basis as that of other self-employed persons.  I know there has been a lot of controversy about this but farm income, subject to health contributions, will be profits from farming activities after deducting expenses such as rent, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchase of seeds and fertilisers, business interest and stock relief.  They are all allowable against profits.  Any sum paid towards a superannuation fund will also be allowable.  After a lot of discussion at Government level &mdash; and successive Governments have discussed this matter &mdash; we have not allowed depreciation.  The depreciation capital allowances are not offset against income for any other sector of the population for contribution purposes and we cannot make an exception in the case of farmers.  Therefore, depreciation on expenditure for construction of fences, roadways, holding yards, drainage, land reclamation, expenditure on construction of farm houses and farm buildings may not be offset against profits when determining income for health contribution purposes. This expenditure is allowed against income tax but not against the health contribution assessment.  I have had to explain that in detail to, for example, the ICMSA and the IFA, many of whose <Col N="514" /> members have understandably invested heavily in capital projects in recent years.</P>
    <P>I thank Members of the Seanad for their support of this measure.  It will ensure the continued delivery of an excellent health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking at the adjournment of this debate following the Minister's introduction of the Bill setting up the Dental Council, I had made some references to sections to which I wanted the Minister to refer in his reply and I hope he will be here when this Stage of the debate is concluded.  I made particular references to sections 51, 54 and 56 and it will be necessary for us to have an explanation from the Minister in regard to how these sections will affect the workings of the new Dental Council.</P>
      <P>In making those points last week I was dealing specifically with the delivery of dental care by health boards.  As a member of a board I am very disappointed at the ability to deliver a service which is due to people who are entitled to the service under the Health Act.  The Health Act provides for full eligibility for dental services to all medical card holders and their dependants and that dental service would normally be expected to be free of charge.  Unfortunately, and for some reason with which I hope this Dental Council can come to grips, the boards seem to be unable to deliver that service in their own clinics due to under-staffing. The health boards are unable to attract dentists into the public service and that must raise the question of the remuneration of dentists by the Department of Health.  If there was an incentive for dentists to join the health service I have no doubt that they would be available and would give of their valuable professional service to the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of my area health board I have found that the dental service we <Col N="515" /> can give is confined totally to children of schoolgoing age and even then it is a minimal service.  It is so minimal that when there are specialised requirements of a very important nature like the fitting of braces and other special treatment a waiting period of up to three years can apply through no fault of the dentists employed by the board.  They are not able to get around to dealing with this problem.  The Department of Health have a responsibility to examine this anomoly in the delivery of the dental service by health boads.</P>
    <P>Last week I complimented the number of dentists who have made themselves available for the delivery of the service to medical card holders.  I wish that all dentists would make themselves available for this particular care but I know there are problems because there is a limit to the working day of any dentist.  I know that it is not physically possible for them to look after their private practice and their social welfare patients, to go through all the documentation and to deal with medical card holders.  If there is an anomaly there which leads to the lack of attention to people who are constitutionally entitled to the service, then certainly we as legislators have a responsibility to look at this and to see why people are neglected at the social level where they are likely to be most in need of the service and definitely unable to provide the service themselves.  If the Dental Council when set up can address themselves to this problem and deploy auxilliary technicians and people who will specialise in the practice of non-dental surgery perhaps we may be able to increase the detection rate at school level among our younger population so that qualified dentists can then apply themselves to the real work which they are qualified to do, that is, to deliver the very high level of care which we have come to expect of that profession.</P>
    <P>Because of their limited numbers and the availability to the board of professional people, we are unable to match the demand.  It concerns me that many people who are in need of this treatment and care do not get it.  I sincerely hope <Col N="516" /> that this council when set up will address themselves to this problem.  I am glad to see that so many dentists will be on the board because they are aware of the problems firsthand.  The consumer on the board will also be aware of this.</P>
    <P>One of the major complaints from parents is that their children have been told by the dentists examining them that they are in need of specialised treatment but that it will be a considerable time before the board can give them what they require.  I hope the new council will look at it as a matter of urgency and take whatever steps they consider necessary. This Bill empowers them to do quite a lot.  For that reason the dental profession have, in principle, accepted the Bill for what it is trying to do and are participating fully in it.  I hope this deficiency that I see in the service will be overcome by trying to ensure that other people could have a reasonable input into initial examination of these problems, particularly among school children.  The adult population who are normally entitled to treatment on the medical card complain also that they find it quite difficult to get the kind of attention that they need.  I hope that that area will also be looked at.</P>
    <P>If we have a good dental service the overall health service will benefit immeasurably.  The number of people who become ill will be cut drastically if we have a good dental service.  One of the key elements in anybody's health is having a healthy mouth and we all owe a debt of gratitude to the dental profession for their action in this regard up to now. If we can make a major breakthrough there, we will have made a major contribution towards dealing with the demands that are now being made on our health services, mostly because of diseases that are self-inflicted.  Many self-inflicted diseases create demands on the public purse, such as alcoholism or smoking or neglect of one's mouth.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to my colleagues on the other side of the House last week when they suggested that possibly the Minister for Education would consider putting a teacher on the council.  That would be a major contribution to make in the field of education.  The educating <Col N="517" /> of children to look after their mouths properly must be one of the basics in any educational curriculum.  Education for one's health is as important as education for one's brain.  I know that the Minister's nominee will have an input from the training and education of dentists and auxiliary operatives in this field.  That is possibly why the Minister for Health is giving to the Minister for Education the specific responsibility to nominate somebody in that field.  I would like to think that that person would match the two responsibilities, the responsibility in the area of education and the responsibility in the area of advice and education to children to be conscious of their responsibility to their own health.</P>
    <P>I will have quite a lot to say on several sections when we come to Committee Stage but I have itemised for the Minister the sections on which I would like clarification in his reply to the Second Stage debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome this long overdue legislation and, indeed, I suppose credit must be given to the right person. It was the idea of a former Minister for Health, Deputy C. J. Haughey, to set up the joint working party of the Irish Dental Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I continue without interruption?  There was an excellent report on our dental service by the joint working party and it was described as the future blueprint for our dentistry programme. Senator Ferris and I have not a lot in common but serving in the west and seeing the service at local level I agree that there are a lot of loopholes and much planning needs to be done.  The service in the health board area is disgraceful.  I would use as severe a word as that.  I understand it is because we are short of dentists.  We are told by one person that we have a shortage of dentists in the nation and we are told by somebody else that they are there but that the health boards cannot pay them the salaries that <Col N="518" /> these persons would like to be working for.</P>
      <P>This joint working party highlighted the absolute need for a prevention-based dental policy and the need to make the public dental service much more attractive as a career.  As a serving member of a health committee, I have said that maybe we should channel some money &mdash; and there is not too much of it around these days &mdash; and give these dentists the proper salaries to get them in to serve. Everybody seem to be going around the country at the moment trying to create the impression that they are creating jobs but no jobs are being created.  It might be a good idea if we got dentists that we need badly into the health boards and let them give the service to the people that we are only pretending to be giving.</P>
      <P>Obviously there is a shortage of dentists but we may have a better service when this legislation is passed.  Concurrently, we must introduce dental hygienists who will act primarily as educators. Senator Ferris referred at the end of his speech to the importance of education. He said the proposal came from this side of the House last week that a teacher or some such person should be on the council.  I presume like all the bodies this Coalition appoint, the Minister will be very careful as to who is put on the council.  If there is someone who even if in the Minister's opinion votes the wrong way but who has the ability to serve on the council, the Minister might be big enough to appoint him and thereby help to provide the people with the service they expect from us.</P>

      <P>A very positive and responsible statement was made recently by the General Secretary of the Irish Dental Association, Mr. Donal Atkins, in welcoming the establishment of properly qualified, registered and supervised persons working under the direction of qualified dentists.  The Association seem <Col N="519" /> to be happy enough with this proposal and they are the experts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health appears to have a priority to introduce certain people on to the council.  If he decides to put certain people on it he will need to be clear in his mind that they have adequate training but anything we may do must not divert us from the real priority which is the protection of our children's teeth.  If our children have proper dental services available to them it follows that in the years ahead the nation will need fewer dentists.</P>
      <P>I must make reference to dental mechanics.  These people have played an important role as members of a team but the ever-increasing sophistication of dental treatment is leading to an equally increasing demand for highly qualified mechanical skills.  It is in this area that the dental mechanics must continue to progress and develop.  It is not my first time to be confused by a Coalition Minister but I am confused in regard to section 54 which states that, &ldquo;the council may with the consent of the Minister...&rdquo; because at the Minister's press conference on March 8 he said: &ldquo;When the Bill has been enacted and the new council has been set up I intend at that stage to bring forward training schemes&rdquo;.  The Bill says &ldquo;the council may&rdquo; and the Minister all unto himself on March 8 said he will bring forward training schemes.  Perhaps he would clarify that for me in his reply.</P>

      <P>Sometime earlier, speaking on another dental Bill, I made reference to different side services, as Senator Ferris has just done now, like this awful waiting list for the orthodontic service.  I know two people in Clare who have been waiting for this service for four years.  We should be united in our efforts to correct that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this Bill before the House today we must always remember that the welfare of the patient must take priority so I for one would not be prepared to interfere with any safeguards which are designed to protect the general public. <Col N="520" /> This is a very important piece of legislation. We seem sometimes to be in the habit of rushing legislation through this House when quite a number of Senators are very committed to the field of health. I am glad we are steadying ourselves this week and only taking Second Stage.  This will give us a chance to take a look at amendments.  Indeed we may even have amendments from the Government side to a Government Bill and we may have amendments from this side to a Government Bill.  I could speak for longer on the Bill.  Apart from affiliations to any political party the persons who serve down in the west of Ireland or outside this &ldquo;Ireland Dublin&rdquo; on health boards are dealing with this problem and realise how serious it is.  I sincerely welcome this legislation and I will be speaking again on certain sections of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  In fact, I give the Bill a triple welcome.  I welcome it for its content in so far as it is an important contribution to an important area of community health.  Secondly, I welcome the Bill because it has been introduced in this House.  That was a particularly suitable move because certainly as Senators in the Cultural and Educational Panel will know, there are among the nominating bodies to this House the Dental Board and the Irish Dental Association, so when we are talking about the operations of the Council that is to succeed the Dental Board, when we are talking about the organisation of the profession to which the members of the Irish Dental Association belong, we are talking about the business of two or our own nominating bodies.  Thirdly, I welcome this legislation because of the format of the Bill.  Senators who have been Members of this House previously will recall the many times I have argued in this House for an end to legislation by reference.  I have argued many times, as other Senators have done, notably Senator Eoin Ryan, who has continually raised this point, that if we are to have an informed public, if we are to make the legislation that comes from the Houses of the Oireachtas intelligible to the public <Col N="521" /> who send us here, we must abandon legislation by reference.  We must get out of the situation where every time we have an amending Bill we have to look up three, four or sometimes more old Statutes in order to find out what exactly a section means.  The way this Bill has been brought to us, whereby the whole of the 1928 Act has been repealed, even though many of the sections have been substantially reproduced here, is the way it should be done and is welcome.  There is an attempt to get a clean sheet so that we have just the one piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I will be returning on Committee Stage to the fact that there has been one slip up.  There is one stain on the sheet that is supposed to be perfectly clean, that is, that we have a reference back in section 27 of the Bill to section 30 of the 1928 Act.  It is not possible to find out the meaning of subsection (2) (e) of section 27 of this Bill without having access to a copy of the 1928 Act.  Perhaps that is something that can be remedied on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as has been mentioned earlier, has been a long time coming.  I, too, would like to pay tribute to those who have been responsible for the Bill being brought forward now.  I join you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in giving credit to Deputy Haughey for the establishment of the joint working party in June 1978 which, I think, we can take as being the start of the final phase of this reforming legislation.  We have seen since then, by the appointment of a Minister of State with special responsibility for dentistry, the value of such an action.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, for the work he did in what were essentially the formative stages of this Bill.  I should like to pay tribute to him &mdash; it is safe to do so since he has moved on to another job &mdash; for the many other initiatives he took during the period in which he occupied the post of Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Welfare.  Perhaps I will mention them now so that the present Minister of State could try to match the record of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw during that time the appointment of senior surgeons for the mentally <Col N="522" /> handicapped, an initiative that many people had looked for; the appointment of consultant orthodontists; the resurrection of the review of State-sponsored dental care; the initiation of a survey on oral health in schools and the appointment of a professor in TCD and a senior lecturer in UCC on community dental health.  These administrative actions have brought us into a new phase in regard to the question of dealing with dental health as a community dental problem.  As part of that whole process, we have the Bill which is before us today.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have mentioned the fact that it is a long time since we had a Dental Bill.  It is 56 years.  It is rather interesting, looking back at that Dentists Act &mdash; and I was curious enough to go to the Library of the House to look it up &mdash; to see how the Dentists Bill of 1928 was handled by the Seanad of the day.  I was surprised at some of the debate which was handled in the Seanad by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. There was a Second Stage which was like a rather disorderly Committee Stage, so often did people talk.  The Cathaoirleach continually intervened to make points of substance.  I do not want to encourage anybody in this House to follow the example of the Seanad in the Second Stage debate at that time.</P>
    <P>The Dentists Bill had an even stranger history in Dáil Éireann where the Bill had to be introduced three times.  We are inclined to think that it is only in modern times that we have had these successive elections but the Dentists Bill was originally the Dentists Bill of 1927 which fell with the dissolution of the Dáil at the end of May 1927.  The second Bill was introduced in June of that year and fell with the dissolution in the following August. It is tragic to think that one of these Bills was moved by the then Minister for Justice, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, whose assassination caused the Dáil dissolution of 25 August 1927.  When the Bill was revived for the third time there had been a critical change in Irish political history. At the time the Bill was substantially discussed, Fianna Fáil were in Dáil Éireann for the first time.  The 1928 Act belongs to history not only because it is <Col N="523" /> old but because it belongs to the political history of this State, because it wound its way rather slowly and jerkily through the Houses of the Oireachtas at that most important time.</P>
    <P>Reading the debate one can see that the Seanad of 1928 did a thoroughly good job on the Bill.  Towards the end of its passage the Cathaoirleach mentioned that rarely had a Bill been discussed so thoroughly.  Even if we seek to avoid following this more leisurely manner of discussion, we could imitate the Seanad of 1928 in giving a thorough discussion to this Bill in the Seanad of 1984.  There were many amendments moved on that other occasion.  People often say to me, &ldquo;Do you not find it frustrating as a Member of the Seanad if you move amendments in the Seanad and the Minister who has put a Bill through the Dáil just cannot be bothered taking your amendments and they are then withdrawn or voted down?&rdquo;  I have always told such people that it is not quite that bad, that even when Ministers do not take one's amendments, one very often finds that his amendment becomes a section in the next Bill on the topic in question when the Minister has had plenty of time to consider it.  It is the Minister's own idea by that time and it then goes through.  So you can affect legislation with a slight delay.  It is rather unfortunate if the delay amounts to 56 years and I have great sympathy for Sir Edward Coey Bigger, a Member of this House in 1928, who argued most cogently for his particular amendment that the control of dental education should not be left in the hands of the Medical Council but should be put into the hands of the new Dental Board so that they could exercise their functions not only in regard to registration but in regard to the training of those who were being registered.</P>
    <P>We have this amendment which was voted down by 21 votes to 14 in the Seanad in 1928 incorporated in the present Bill.  I hope that when we come to Committee Stage amendments which receive support from both sides of the House will secure acceptance by the Minister. Even on those points on which he <Col N="524" /> is not ready to move, I hope we do not have to wait as long as has been the case of Sir Edward Bigger's amendment.  It was a very interesting case he made on that occasion.  It was to give the power from the Medical Council to the Dental Board.  He was a member of the Medical Council so there he was looking at it from the inside and pointing to this particular measure of excluding the Dental Board from education and training as an undesirable restriction on them.</P>
    <P>We have to look at this Bill which is a Bill dealing essentially with the operation and the power of the Dental Council over the control and the practice of dentistry in the general context of dental care.  If we were to look at it too narrowly we could make the wrong decision in regard to how this problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The problem of dental care in Ireland is immense and complex.  We need a dental service for 900,000 children.  We have an inadequate service catering for about 600,000 children who are eligible.  We need a community dental service for almost 600,000 fully eligible adults.  We need an adequate service for the handicapped, for the infirm, for the aged.  Of course in facing this problem we face the same difficulties as we face in every one of our problems.  We have problems of limited financial resources, limited manpower resources and the problem of a distribution of manpower resources that is far from ideal.  We have to face the fact that to tackle this problem it is necessary for us not only to seek to improve financial and manpower resources but to seek to make the best possible uses of those resources we have.  The World Health Organisation has indicated that in general one could operate a dental service which could be considered adequate on the basis of one dentist to 2,000 of the population.  While some countries, such as France and Germany, achieve that figure and while some of the Scandinavian countries have over-achieved it to the extent of having a dentist per 1,000 people, we have about one dentist to 3,500.  I am not sure of the exact figure but it is an improvement on the position ten years ago but it still means that in <Col N="525" /> regard to numbers we are decidedly short.</P>
    <P>This is not the only problem in regard to manpower.  A worse problem in that regard is the distribution of our manpower throughout the country.  While this is a problem in all countries it may well be a more severe problem in Ireland than elsewhere.  We have the tremendous concentration of our population in the east, worse than the concentration in the south-east of mainland Britain, and it is inevitable under those circumstances that whatever may be the overall figure of dentists in relation to the population that figure will vary very widely between the general area of the east coast and the remoter areas of the west coast, if the Minister of State will allow me to appropriate his constituency as an example.</P>
    <P>Not only have we a problem of trying to develop manpower but we also have the problem of trying, even with the manpower we have, to do everything possible to improve distribution.  We are producing considerable numbers of dental graduates. One of the problems that the working party discussed was the way in which we could attract those graduates into working in Ireland, in particular into the health service.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would, in his Second Stage reply, indicate the extent to which progress has been made in regard to the recommendations of the working party on the attraction of graduates.  For example, they recommended sponsorship by health authorities of dental students.  This has happened in the North-Western Health Board.  I would be glad if the Minister would indicate the extent to which there has been sponsorship in recent years and how it is working out in practice.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the working party in regard to entry grades and grade structure generally have been met since the publication of the report but there were other recommendations and I would be glad to know from the Minister what progress has been made, for example, in regard to re-training and in particular in regard to the question of part-time permanent posts, particularly in the areas remote from Dublin and the east coast <Col N="526" /> where there is a very distinct shortage of dentists.  In the Dental College at the moment 40 per cent of the students are women.  It may well be that if we had these part-time permanent posts women at a certain time of their married lives would find these posts very suitable.  They would not have to face a choice between a full-time appointment and full-time home duties.</P>
    <P>While we face a considerable problem in regard to the dental profession, I do not think we should ignore the fact that we have made substantial progress.  It is very heartening when reading something like the WHO Collaborative Study to find that the level of decay revealed in our school children was below the average of other countries and that in regard to adults who did not have the benefit of such progress as we have made, in the age group from 35 to 44 it was about average.</P>
    <P>We should take note of the very substantial improvement in regard to the level of decay in the years from 1961 to 1980 when the figure in regard to teeth decayed, missing and filled, approximately halved.  A very, very substantial improvement.  A good deal of this must be attributed to the fluoridation of the majority of our water supplies through, of course, improved dental hygiene must also have played a great part.  Here again we have the problem of distribution.  It is in the remoter areas not fed by a large water supply system that we will find non-fluoridated water or, even if there is a scheme for fluoridation, we may well find that the standard of operation of the fluoridation is not the same as it would be in a larger undertaking.  I recommened to the Minister that there is a case for an examination of the efficiency with which the fluoridation of public water supplies is carried out in the country.  Once again we will probably find that those in the remoter areas are at a disadvantage from this point of view also.</P>
    <P>The indications are that we have made progress in the past two decades, that our problem is not too bad, but when we come to look not just at the level of decay but at the level of children with decay of <Col N="527" /> various amounts who have not been treated and who are still awaiting treatment, we come up against the problem which has already been mentioned of delays which are well beyond being tolerable. Again I return to the point that, if we were to examine the distribution of those delays geographically, once again we would find that those in the remoter areas are discriminated against.  This picture, then, is the context within which we should consider this Bill before us.  I have already indicated &mdash; and nearly every Senator has indicated &mdash; that we would like to tease out certain sections at quite some length on Committee Stage.  I join in that view and look forward to a thorough discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I would like to mention a number of points in order to elicit a response from the Minister in his reply to Second Stage that would help all of us in the House who are interested in this topic to consider our attitudes towards these various sections and to consider whether or not we wish to frame amendments for Committee Stage.  I would like to comment on the various sections of the Bill and to touch on a few points.</P>
    <P>Part II is concerned with the Dental Council which is to replace the Dental Board.  This will be recognised by all as an important step in the evolution of the dental profession in Ireland.  If we look at the make-up of the old Dental Board and the make-up of the new Dental Council we see a number of changes.  On the old board of nine there were five representatives of practising dentists, three representatives of the Medical Council and one Government representative. In contrast in the new council of 19 there are seven practising dentists, five representatives of educational bodies, two representatives of the Medical Council and five representatives of the Government.</P>
    <P>It may be that some practising dentists will feel they are to some extent being submerged in this new council.  I do not think they have any reason to fear this. They were a majority of five out of nine on the old Dental Board.  They are only <Col N="528" /> seven out of 19 on the new board.  We certainly would expect that the five representatives of the educational authorities would also be registered dentists. Indeed, we could say that there is more consent, more community of feeling, between dentists in educational institutions now than there was at the time of the 1928 Act.  So I do not think there is any fear that matters on which a professional opinion is important will be influenced or decided by non-practitioners.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a number of Government representatives, five out of 19, is a welcome movement.  I am sure the dental profession would agree with me that if their objectives in regard to the improvement of dental health in Ireland are to be achieved, they can only be achieved through the co-operation of the public at large.  It is not a mere question for a profession apart.  The problem of community dental health is not just of interest to both the profession and the public.  It can only be improved, and its major problems can only be overcome, by the closest possible co-operation between the profession and the public.</P>
    <P>The new members of the Dental Council will have a very important function to perform.  They will need to extend their influence in two directions.  Within the Dental Council they will be representing the public at large, but equally I would hope, they will exercise the function of representing the Dental Council to the larger public.  I hope the Minister will appoint people not just with ability but with real energy to these positions, so that they can carry out that double task to as great an extent as possible.  It is always a difficulty that where a committee are dealing largely with professional concerns, non-professional people who come on to the committee can sometimes find themselves at sea.  If 12 or 18 months after their establishment a person listening from the doorway to a meeting of the Dental Council were able to tell beyond any doubt which of those members was a dentist, and which was a non dentist, then I think the new council will be on the road to failure.  The job and the responsibility of whoever is the first president of the new Dental Council will be <Col N="529" /> to fuse these various members together in order to establish right from the beginning this departure &mdash; that there is a break from the old Dental Board, dealing with matters of registration and matters of professional practice, to a new Dental Council who are being charged by the Government and by the Houses of the Oireachtas with a public function in regard to this important area of community health.</P>
    <P>In this Part of the Bill we have, in section 13, the power to set up committees and the duty to set up committees with regard to education and matters of professional conduct.  I would like to ask the Minister in regard to section 13 (1): what is the force of the phrase &ldquo;as in the opinion of the council, may be better or more conveniently performed by a committee...&rdquo;? Now this appears to establish that, apart from the mandatory committees in subsection (2), it is a matter of absolute discretion for the new council as to what other committees shall be formed.  Could the Minister say whether there is an absolute discretion in section 13 (1), or whether that absolute discretion is governed by section 15 (1)?</P>

      <P>The Senator is the Leader of the House and I do not like to interrupt him but on Second Stage we do not take the Bill section by section. He may continue with my permission but he is giving me the impression that we are on Committee Stage as he takes the Bill section by section.</P>

      <P>I will try to relate my remarks more directly to the questions of principle.  Perhaps in trying to make it easier for the Minister to reply I was talking unduly of individual sections.  I assure you that what I am talking about here is the question of how autonomous <Col N="530" /> are the new Dental Council.  They appear to be autonomous under section 13 (1). When we look in section 15 at the power of the Minister to direct the council they appear to lose their autonomy, only two sections later.  This, I can assure you, is no detailed point.  This is a substantial point of principle on the extent to which the Minister may direct.</P>
      <P>I agree it is reasonable that the Minister should have some power to ensure that the Dental Council are acting in the public interest but I think section 15 can create a difficulty if the council fail to perform any function assigned to them. They have the function under section 13 of appointing committees if they so wish, if they so think fit, but it appears from section 15 that the Minister can possibly direct them to set up a committee.  At this stage, to avoid putting down any unnecessary amendments, can the Minister say whether he has the power under Part II of this Bill to direct the council to set up a committee?  This point comes up later in the Bill and I will advert to it again. The principle at stake here is the power of the Minister to direct.</P>
      <P>Talking also about the council and their powers and duties, I notice that in Part II of the Bill the council are required to furnish annual accounts.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be desirable not only for the council to provide annual accounts but also to provide an annual report.  In this very important area where we have had reports from time to time which have given us the information in regard to what progress we were making, it would be very suitable if at the same time they were presenting their accounts the new Dental Council produced an annual report.  If this annual report also contained the reports of the mandatory sub-committees, such as the Education and Training Committee, this would indeed be of assistance not merely to the Minister, not merely to these Houses, but also to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Part III of the Bill which is concerned with registration, there are quite a number of points which will need to be discussed on Committee Stage. Section 27 gives less discretion to the High Court than section 33 of the 1928 <Col N="531" /> Act and I would like to ask whether this is a deliberate limitation of the discretion of the High Court in that they appear under section 27 to have to say &ldquo;register&rdquo; or &ldquo;do not register&rdquo;, but do not have the power to recommend other steps to be taken.</P>
    <P>In section 30 we have a new proposal in regard to a register of specialists.  As Senators know, this has created some anxiety among general practitioners.  I would like to ask the Minister is there a directive or a draft directive which makes it a necessity for the Dental Council to set up such a register.  I would like in this connection to recall what the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, and I am referring to the debate in Volume 103 of the Official Report of last Wednesday, 14 March at column 413.  The Minister said in regard to this special register that although the provisions in the Bill do not compel the Dental Council to set up a register of dental specialists now, they give the council the facility for registering specialists at some future date if they should consider it desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>Here we are back once again to the principle of the degree of autonomy, the degree of discretion which the Dental Council have.  If the Dental Council with their representatives of the consumers, with their representatives of the profession, feel that it is not proper that a register of specialists be set up at any particular time, I would like to ask the Minister has he taken the power under section 15 to compel them to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part IV of the Bill which is concerned with education and training, there are points here which can be taken up on Committee Stage.  I would like at this stage only to ask the Minister about the question of internships which was raised, I think, by the working party.  Has the Minister any view in regard to the question of establishing internships for dental graduates before registration along the same lines as obtain in the medical profession?</P>
    <P>In Part V of the Bill which is concerned with fitness to practise, we see some welcome developments.  Compared with the 1928 Act there is an extension of power <Col N="532" /> and I join with Senator Fallon in welcoming this.  In particular I welcome the fact that it is now open to any person to initiate a complaint, whereas previously under the 1928 Act it appeared that only the Dental Board or an educational establishment were open to do so.  It is in accordance with modern thinking that it should be open to any member of the public to initiate the various procedures. This may lead to certain trivial or frivolous complaints but that is a small price to pay for a public acceptability of the position that if they have a grievance they are entitled of their own right to set in motion the machinery which will adjudicate upon that grievance.</P>
    <P>Also in regard to this &mdash; again it may help us to avoid a long discussion on Committee Stage &mdash; I would ask the Minister what is the significance of the change from the 1928 Act wording of felony or misdemeanour which I think is still maintained in British legislation to the language of section 42 &ldquo;triable on indictment&rdquo;. I am not enough of a lawyer to know the difference.  There are, of course, descriptions of the serious and the less serious, but I would like to know what difference the Minister is asking us to enact when he uses that alternative wording.</P>
    <P>In Part VI of the Bill there is substantial updating in regard not merely to the penalties for illegal practice, but also in regard to the coverage.  The students and auxiliary dental workers are now covered.  I am very glad to see that it is no longer legal, as it was in the 1928 Act, for a pharmaceutical chemist to extract teeth without an anaesthetic.  I am very glad we are not open to that hazard under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill has been mentioned by a number of Senators.  There is a substantial new departure.  Here once again we are seeing a substantial step in the evolution of the dental profession.  This is a subject that was discussed in the working party report which talked of problems in relation to surgery assistants, technicians, hygienists, therapists, and so on.  Almost all Senators who have spoken in this debate have sought elaboration of sections 54, 55 and 56 of the Bill.  I would <Col N="533" /> like to ask a few questions.  The Minister might be able to answer them when concluding on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>First, the working party mentioned that a ratio of one dental surgery assistant per practitioner was probably the minimum requirement.  Are there any figures available as to what is the present position in regard to numbers?  I would like also to ask the Minister whether any action has been taken on the working party report in regard to the method of recruitment and appointment of dental surgery assistants, and whether there are any plans in regard to the formal training and recognition of dental surgery assistants. There may well be openings here in these times of high youth unemployment for action which could help youth employment and at the same time give support to the registered dentists.  I am thinking particularly of those areas which are relatively disadvantaged.  I do not like to use the term density of dentists and I am using it only in a geographical sense.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister if he could give us some information in regard to the present position of dental technicians.  I understand there may be about 100 of them in the country.  I understand also that AnCO have been undertaking some training in this connection. It would help Members of this House if the Minister could indicate what the present position is and whether any action is contemplated in this regard.</P>
    <P>A question that could give rise to a good deal of controversy is the establishment of a class of auxiliary dental workers whom the working party call denturists and who I understand are concerned with the direct supply of dentures to patients. The working party recommended against the establishment of any such class.  The argument used was that the elimination of the waiting list by the use of dentists in general practice would reduce the problem, and that increased dental hygiene and the increased effects of fluoridation, and so on, would lead to a decline in the future in a number of those who were totally without teeth.  It would appear from the Minister's Second Stage speech that he is accepting the question of a need for this particular class of auxiliary dental <Col N="534" /> worker and proposes to establish it.  I would be glad if the Minister would indicate whether in fact I am reading his Second Stage speech correctly here and that it does mean that he is taking a different view to that of the working party and, if so, for what reason?</P>
    <P>This again brings me back to a recurring problem if this is so, of, whether the Minister would be able to use his powers under section 15 to direct the new Dental Council in regard to the recognition or the training of such a group since there would appear to be a danger that he and the professions, may find themselves in confrontation on this point.  I am not suggesting here which viewpoint is correct. I am merely saying that there appears to be a difference here.  I appreciate that there is a question of balance involved.  It may be a very delicate balance but I would like to know exactly what the situation is and what the situation would be if the Bill were to be passed in its present form.  Another group of auxiliary dental workers are dental hygienists.  These are concerned with the preventive aspects of dentistry and would represent a very good use of scarce resources, scarce resources of money for training and scarce resources of personnel. Here we need to develop an Irish type of dental hygienists particularly suited to our problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the category of dental therapists I would like to ask the Minister what he envisages in regard to these operating auxiliaries working under a dentist.  Does he, in fact, intend that they should be used largely in the public service or in private practice?  Here again we have a question of balance and a question of deciding where the scarce resources should be used.  I am not trying to suggest that the dental profession are in any way unscrupulous but I do not think that we would want to leave the temptation open to any dentist that he can establish a row of six chairs for social welfare patients and employ six dental therapists to work under his direction thereby making the social welfare recipients a type of second-class dental patients.  I am not suggesting that this is liable to happen but certainly anything <Col N="535" /> that would tend to leave ourselves open to such a situation should be avoided.</P>
    <P>I have now come to Part VIII which deals with &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; and the number of points I have to make here are few and miscellaneous.  I did commend the Minister in the course of my opening remarks regarding the format in which he produced this Bill and the fact that we are now, with the exception of one section, able to hold everything in our hand and find out what the position is.  There is another difficulty in this regard.  In section 62 there are references to statutory instruments to be construed as referring to the new Dental Council.  It would be of great use to the Houses of the Oireachtas in enacting this legislation, to the new Dental Council in carrying it out, and the general public who I have emphasised in this, as in many other matters, have a right to know, if we knew what statutory instruments were involved and if the Minister could make available to Members, perhaps by depositing in the Library of the House, a list of the statutory instruments made under the 1928 Act.  They should be available in the Library but if we know where to find these statutory instruments it would help us to understand the manner of operation of the 1928 Act and, therefore, to judge more accurately what is likely to be the manner of the operation of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Under section 63 there is the question of regulations made under this Bill and provision for them to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be subject to annulment.  Again on section 15, to which I have returned several times during my remarks, in which the Minister has the power of direction, I would ask the Minister if he would be willing to make any direction issued under this section subject to annulment in the Houses of the Oireachtas so that if the Minister was directing, if the Minister was limiting the discretion of the Dental Council, if the Minister was in the position of making his view prevail over that of the Dental Council at least the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to debate the matter.  As matters stand, of <Col N="536" /> course, annulment of a Minister's order is most unlikely under our political system.</P>
    <P>In section 66 there is a provision whereby the Minister may request advice from the new Dental Council regarding any matter.  In these new days of parliamentary procedures when we have a large number of standing Joint Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas I would like to ask the Minister if it would not be appropriate for Committees of the Oireachtas to seek advice from the Dental Council and, indeed, from other bodies also, without having to go through the Minister.  Prior to this the opinion of a body such as the Dental Council has been available to the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Minister to whom they are responsible but now as Parliament is developing the committee system this needs to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the First Schedule, there are points that can be discussed on Committee Stage.  In Article 6 there could be some discussion about the question of a casual vacancy.  There could be a cooption which could last for quite some time.  I can understand that the Minister wishes to avoid an electoral procedure in this connection but it is a point that could be argued and, indeed, will be argued on Committee Stage.  In regard to the question of a quorum I would suggest to the Minister that the quorum goes both for ordinary and disciplinary purposes seems somewhat small, a quorum of five out of 19.  It is not small by too much, but it is a rather small quorum for such an important body which, in fact, contains representatives from so many different areas.</P>
    <P>May I, in conclusion, say that the Bill is welcome as it has been welcomed by Members of the House?  It is a Bill which needs thorough discussion, and there is much work to be done on Committee Stage.  I talked earlier about the fate of Seanad amendments which, apparently, was much the same in 1928 as it has been in more recent years.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we can, whether by way of sectional discussion or by amendment, do much to probe this Bill, to elaborate on it and to make its effect more clear by having a thorough Committee <Col N="537" /> Stage debate.  This is a good Bill, and there is no doubt about that, but that does not say it may not be capable of some further improvement.</P>

      <P>We will be well prepared to answer the Senator on his amendments when they are introduced.  I do not intend to spend very long on my contribution but I wish to make some general remarks. The Bill must be welcomed by all sides of the House.  In welcoming it we must also admit that the drafters of the 1928 Act did an excellent job when one considers the changes that have occurred in society since it was introduced.  In general the 1928 Act has stood up to the changes that have occurred.  I am not talking alone about the changes that have taken place regarding health practices and services. When one considers the massive hammering children and adults get in the advertising of sweets and other items which are detrimental to dental care it is heartening to know that in adult dental health, at least since 1963-64, many improvements have occurred in that the amount of dental care necessary for adults now is not as great as it was prior to 1963-64.  There are a number of reasons for that.  I am sure that the standard of dental education has improved over the years, just as the standard of general hygiene has.  Indeed, I am sure that fluoridation has helped in this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to have such a debate on this topic, because this concerns everybody. It is not a sectional Bill.  There is no doubt that there is not one person who will not at some stage have to go to a dentist for some form of treatment, whether it be corrective or of another nature.  The Bill deals with the necessity to regulate standards. <Col N="538" /> Much of the debate that has taken place has been on the regulating of standards and the need to produce a dental care ethic and service for our people. Much has been made of the qualifications necessary before people are permitted to deal with oral hygiene or care.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the difference between a dentist, a denturist, an auxiliary dental worker and the various other people mentioned in terms of dental care.  We have at present two excellent dental hospitals and the standard of those graduating from them is improving all the time.  There are problems in those hospitals, and similar problems exist throughout the health board areas.  There are excellent facilities for students and workers and magnificent equipment but a shortage of people to work those facilities.  The resource management we have at present is not adequate in terms of medical care in general and of dental care in particular.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of those who graduate from our dental schools emigrate for one reason, that they cannot be accommodated in the Irish dental care system. In particular they cannot get employment in health boards, an area which is crying out for them.  Mention has been made by some that when a student leaves a dental college he or she should do at least one year in service here before going abroad. There may be some merit in that but I would not like to see somebody being compelled to do that type of service. When I mentioned that resource management was not good I was thinking of the South Eastern Health Board's report for last year.  There is one principal dental surgeon for Carlow-Kilkenny and only six clinical dental surgeons.  There is no orthodontic surgeon.  There is one on the list but he has not been appointed.  It is interesting to consider the number of sessions dentists in the Carlow-Kilkenny health board dental service area had last year, 2,560 sessions for children and 279 for adults with seven of a staff.  The principal dental surgeon cannot be expected to work fulltime as a principal clinical dental surgeon if that person is supposed to be a superintendent in the area also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the adult scheme, in</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> 1981 it was found that the majority of children's cases were being dealt with by health boards while adults, in general, were treated by private practitioners.  As a result of greater dental health care private practitioners are not getting more work while, on the other side, health boards, because of the number of children being treated, have to deal with an increasing work load.  When one considers the increase in the birth rate here one can realise that the demand on the health boards will increase, particularly if they are to deal with children mainly.  Due to bad resource management the position will get worse.</P>
    <P>For severe orthodontic cases in the Carlow-Kilkenny area at present there is a three-year wait for children and there are 500 on that waiting list.  Apart from that there are 800 others who are not considered to be severe and they will have to wait more than three years.  It is horrific to think that in that area for fillings and general treatment, there is a two to three year wait.  There is no waiting list for emergencies because emergencies are dealt with as they arise.  Of course, the more emergencies that arise the longer the waiting list grows for general surgery. It would appear to me that the Bill will not become effective unless there is a greater allocation of resources to the dental service within the health service.  I was glad to hear the Minister when introducing another Bill today mention that he has been fighting the Department of Finance for extra moneys.  I sincerely hope that he will be fighting for extra resources for the dental service because it is a service which needs more and more resources.</P>
    <P>On the question of registration, mention was made of the fact that we are going to have a general register of dentists and then a specialist register.  Listening to the Minister's speech and reading through the Bill it appears that the basic reason for this is not one of essentials but rather to bring us into line with registers in EEC countries.  Mention was made of countries outside the EEC.  I do not feel we would need a registration of specialists. That is a personal opinion.  If somebody <Col N="540" /> has extra qualifications and specialises in a particular type of dentistry that will become known and the general dentist will refer people who need specialist treatment to that person.  However, I am not in favour in general of specialist treatments within the health service at all because quite a lot of the illnesses we have are created by the fact that the referral system is used too often.  A person who goes to a general practitioner is referred to somebody else and the psychosomatic problem the person has, if he has it, will be strengthened.  If such people do not have a psychosomatic problem they will have one if they are referred often enough.  The disease can become a bigger problem because of the referral system.  I would prefer to see in our health service a patient having the full range of services in one place rather than the referral system we have now. That applies more to the general health services than it does to the dental health service.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the make-up of the Dental Council in great detail but I agree with the comments already made as to the need to have somebody from the INTO involved because so much of dental care is tied up with schools and younger people.  The Minister has left scope for that involvement in that he has the authority to appoint four members. I suggest to him that one of these four members should be from the INTO.</P>
    <P>On the question of the preventive maintenance programmes that are needed we will have to make certain that the council give top priority to preventive maintenance services.  If we are to have an improvement in our standard of dental care it can only come if we have proper preventive maintenance programmes. We must ensure that if we are to have auxiliary workers the vast majority of them should be used in the educational system to counteract the very vicious anti-dental care advertising programmes we have on RTE and other channels.  Top priority must be given to education.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill was to ensure that the consumer was protected and that the cost to the consumer would be kept down by <Col N="541" /> allowing certain people outside the dentist profession to supply dentures direct. In the consumer report a price of between £15 and £17 was mentioned as the price of dentures to health boards.  Last year's health board report for the Carlow-Kilkenny community care area states that 200 full sets of dentures to the health board cost £23,998 or £119 per set.  The figures in the consumer report are not accurate and it is highly unlikely that there would be a major difference to the patient if the supply of dentures was to be given to non-dentists.  We have to ensure that the dentist deals with living tissue and that anybody other than a dentist should not be allowed to deal with living tissue.</P>
    <P>I was a little bit disturbed to see in a section of the Bill that extractions could be done by auxiliary dental workers but only of deciduous teeth.  That would not be the way I would look at it because we are dealing specifically with the very young.  It is essential for the proper development of a good dental care programme that a dentist, or a highly qualified person, deals with the child in the first place. There are a number of reasons for that. There is the question of confidence and, equally, it gives a dentist the opportunity to have a look at the general health of the patient.  For that reason I would not agree at all with the suggestion that extractions of deciduous teeth could be carried out by non-dentists.</P>
    <P>We must have a closer look at the orthodontic scene.  There are two types of orthodontics.  We have the actual orthodontic situation where there is a fault which for medical reasons must be changed.  Equally, in the case of girls, there is a situation where if a girl does not get proper orthodontic treatment she may have a personality change.  She might not be as outgoing as another girl who would have had orthodontic treatment. Unfortunately, at present people who can afford private orthodontic treatment can get it reasonably easy and those in the health services cannot.  There is the cosmetic orthodontic treatment which while not totally necessary must be <Col N="542" /> considered when one is dealing with this part of the dental service.</P>
    <P>As far as fitness to practise is concerned, I can never understand what makes one fit to practise. Does it mean that one has strong wrists, or that one's morals are of a certain nature?  We can discuss that on Committee Stage.  There is mention in the Bill of unfitness due to physical or mental disability.  There are people who might be mentally disabled in certain areas, but that would not mean that they would not be able to practise in any profession.  The same goes for physically handicapped people.  We must be very careful what we mean when writing into legislation that people are unfit because of either of these two inhibitions. I would not like to try to define physical or mental disability but I am sure we can get a definition on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill has been introduced. It will have far-reaching effects, but if it does as good a job as the 1928 legislation, it will be for the good of all the people of this State for a long time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations to make on this Bill.  In welcoming the Bill as a major contribution to the possibility of improving dental care throughout this part of Ireland, the key lies in how the council is composed and how it will conduct its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one looks through the composition of that council, there is no doubt that there will be a number of very well-informed people on it.  The question I ask is whether they will also be very aware people.  Section 9 (f) says that of four persons appointed by the Minister, at least two of them shall not be registered dentists.  This, in effect, means that we have only two consumers assured on that council.  It is vital that the council should be apprised of the defects in the system, not just in the neighbourhood of the Dublin Pale but throughout the Twenty-six Counties and, dare I say it, beyond. Therefore, I would recommend that the Minister should very seriously consider increasing the input from the consumer and ensuring that that input comes from the different regions.  I am quite certain <Col N="543" /> that the availability and standard of dental care varies throughout Ireland from county to county, and locality to locality, as much as it does anywhere else in Europe.  It is very important that the council should be aware of the defects as they exist.</P>
    <P>There is another body who could have a very important input.  Before I mention who I have in mind, I would remind this House that in my own profession only some 10 per cent to 15 per cent of hospitalised ill health requires the attention of the super-specialist attached to the super-technology.  Yet virtually all the power to determine undergraduate attitudes to matters of health, to determine post-graduate training profiles, and also the patronage to determine who gets what job, is held in the hands of those 10 per cent or 15 per cent of practitioners in our profession who are primarily concerned with that very important element of medical care &mdash; super-specialisation. Therefore, it is important to have a balance when we are discussing matters dealing with training, the dispersal of dentists, the location of dentists, the availability of dental care in the different communities, the standard of dental care and so on.  I would suggest that at least some endeavour should be made either through a seat on the council or in assuring that one of the committees has representation from the dental student body of Ireland.  These young men will be training for approximately five years. They are all citizens of the country over the age of 18.  Many of them go in with a certain degree of youthful idealism, and many will have ideas about the future as it will affect them and the society into which they are going to emerge.  Then there is also the body of young dentists who will be temporarily registered.  There is a great advantage to be obtained by ensuring that there is some representation from the student dental body and/or the junior dentists.  I would define junior dentists as those who are not more than five years qualified.</P>
    <P>The ideas expressed in this Bill and the hopes for it will be realised if we do what various Senators have suggested, that is, <Col N="544" /> ensure that there is representation from those who are interested in education outside the dental profession &mdash; teachers &mdash; that there is adequate consumer representation and that junior dentists &mdash; and I would also advocate the student dental body &mdash; are represented if not on the council at least by statute on some subcommittee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Bill because I believe it will be a decided help and advantage in this area of dental care and dental health. In particular, I want to refer to example and encouragement in this area.  I am speaking from personal experience.  At a very young age I was influenced by another poor boy like myself who took care of his teeth.  At that time all we had to clean our teeth was soot on a piece of cloth.  Nevertheless, providentially, I still have all my teeth and they are still pretty good.  That may be one of the reasons why I am seldom seen around this House without a smile.</P>
      <P>From an early age I attended a local dentist who looked after me for a very modest charge.  He did not have a university degree but he looked after me and many other people very well.  This man had served his time with another dentist. For this reason I feel that in this area of dental care there is a place for many people to help who have not gone through university.  I believe there is still a place for people to help out in the dental services.  I say that notwithstanding what Senator Dooge said about retraining.  This is most important, for people in any profession because at present in any profession it is necessary to spend a half day every week to keep in touch with improvements and trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to fluoridation.  Senator Dooge said it would be necessary to examine the efficiency of fluoridation schemes carried out in country areas.  I agree with him completely.  I have five children and was always anxious to live inside the urban areas where the waters were fluoridated.  I lived with four of my children outside the urban area for long periods, but my fifth child has lived in the urban area where the water was fluoridated <Col N="545" /> yet he is the only child who has serious dental problems.  At local level I questioned if fluoridation was taking place and if it was done in accordance with regulations and was told it was, and I believe it was, but as far as I am concerned, fluoridation has a big question mark after it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the progress which Senator Dooge mentioned.  He spoke of the old Act under which a pharmaceutical chemist could extract a tooth without an anaesthetic.  I welcome this progress. Some years back an old man told me that in his youth it was usual to get a tooth extracted at a fair or a market by a man who was travelling around&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is long overdue and eagerly anticipated. Both the Minister, Deputy Desmond, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, must be complimented on their efforts to introduce the Bill after a relatively short period in Government.  I welcome the suggested composition of the membership of the new board.  Like Senator Robb, I am in agreement with consumer involvement: the suggestion that two non-dental persons should be on the board is good and should be extended.  It has been suggested that a member of the INTO should be included on the board. I recommend that members of the other teachers' unions &mdash; both the TUI and the ASTI &mdash; should also be included, because if any dental preventive programme is to be successful in the schools, it will take the co-operation of both teachers and the people involved in dentistry.  This relates not only to national schools but to secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> Recently I read of a very successful programme carried out in Zurich, Switzerland, under the guidance of a man who is renowned in the field of preventive medicine in dentistry.  This programme achieved a very high success rating.  It would be useful to have a programme like this introduced here.  Up to now, the programmes we attempted to introduce were half-hearted, non-conclusive and very badly planned.  There is a definite need to have an adequate health education programme on our curriculum.  I hope the new curriculum board will have a serious look at health education when they are considering any suggestions for curriculum revision.  Dental health should play an important part in any health education programme.</P>
    <P>A dentist should be appointed to the Health Education Bureau.  At the moment, there is no representative from this body in the Health Education Bureau, and there is a void in the bureau in this respect which should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The present VEC pilot schemes on health education should be expanded to include dental health education.  We are all impressed with the success rate of the recent &ldquo;Crest&rdquo;, &ldquo;Colgate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Palmolive&rdquo; projects that have been developed in the national schools, with the agreement of the Department of Health and the Society of Chief Dental Officers in Ireland but we need more initiatives like this if we are to make a favourable impression on the dental health of the nation.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will deal with sections 54, 55 and 56.  Like most Senators, I have reservations about these sections and their operation.  There is a great need for preventive medicine.  I welcome the whole concept of dental auxiliaries, especially as it has definite employment potential.  This must be considered in relation to this concept.  There is no doubt that more specialists are needed in the area of preventive and treatment dentistry. Recent figures quoted in a newspaper indicated that there is a 60 per cent untreated need in the child population from eight to nine years of age and 89 per <Col N="547" /> cent of the population are suffering from gum disease of one type or another.  The fact that these alarming statistics prevail is due no doubt to the lack of sufficient personnel and their availability to administer any effective type of service.  With all due respect to everybody concerned, I must say that the present service is not very successful, especially when one compares it with the services of other countries, particularly our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer here to my own constituency of north Kerry, especially in relation to orthodontic care, which has been mentioned already, and which I am sure is a problem throughout the country. In Kerry we have a huge waiting list. There are children in urgent need of growth corrections and so on who are not being attended to.  It is embarrassing when parents come and ask us to do something to get their child called for treatment after a period of four or five years.  It is very difficult to defend such complaints.  The parents have a right to feel that their children are being neglected.  In some cases, by the time the children are called, the damage has been done and it is very difficult to make any proper corrections.  I should like to express my regret that recently the Southern Health Board failed to appoint a whole time consultant orthodontist, although I am glad that the other five health boards have recognised the need and are in the process of appointing consultants. I should like to compliment the Minister on setting up the national children's survey and I am delighted that the first county visited was Kerry.</P>
    <P>In relation to dental auxiliaries, I should like to point out that this concept will provide wonderful job creation possibilities during the next five years.  It is estimated that there could be as many as 300 to 500 auxiliaries employed by the regional health boards, and another 300 could easily be employed in the private sector.  This is an area of job creation which must not be overlooked.  There is also the possibility of a new professional grade being opened as a result of this Bill.  I also welcome the fact that dental surgery assistants will be registered and <Col N="548" /> trained.  This will give recognition and status to the job which at the moment is labelled under various headings, such as dental nurse.  The training of dental technicians for clinical work is essential.  Here is another wonderful job creation area to be explored.  I should like to point out, and it is probably a well known fact, that we import large amounts of dental technology &mdash; estimated at about £5 million a year.  This could be easily substituted by home produced goods.  This is an area the Industrial Development Authority should definitely have a look at.  The Ministers for Education, Labour and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism should have a look at this area too because it has the potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Universities currently training dental surgeons now have professors and lecturers in the area of community dental health on their staff.  This is a major development.  I am looking forward to closer links between the regional health boards and these universities.  It is time to have more liaison between the universities and the health boards for research, scientific experiments and so on. I should like to mention the recent important development at Cork Regional College which carried out various dental projects which have been very successful. I am glad ties now exist between UCC and the Southern Health Board, and this must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a very welcome Bill.  No doubt it will be a very important development not only for the dental profession but also for preventive dental health, an area in which we are lagging behind.</P>

      <P>It is nice to have a Minister in the House and to be able to say something complimentary about him. The Bill is a great step forward in one specific area.  I suppose I can slip in a disorderly compliment to him for yesterday's announcement about the combat poverty group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill raises the whole question of the relationship between any important profession and the community and the laity.  It would be remiss of me to let the opportunity go without putting on the record that well known suggestion that <Col N="549" /> all professions are a conspiracy against the laity to a greater or lesser extent.  The whole idea of the regulation of professions is one that has a good, honourable historic basis, but it needs to be looked at again in the context of a more complex, a more consumerist, a more demanding and a better educated society.  The basic concept that needs to be elaborated on and explored in much greater detail is the concept of the accountability of professions to the community at large and the underpinning of that accountability by the legislative structures that we develop. This Bill is a development in that direction because it now leaves one major profession regulated by a group on which that profession no longer has majority representation.  I regard that as a major, significant and worth while innovation. What is even more impressive is the apparent acceptance, from what I have seen, by the dental profession of that principle.</P>
    <P>Would it be out of order for me to look forward to the day when the Bar Council are similiary structured so that barristers will not represent the majority of those who regulate the bar, and solicitors will not represent the majority of those who regulate the legal profession, and indeed my own profession to the extent we are regulated, although more than most, by a competitive market place and therefore do not have the same capacity to protect our interests through self-regulation. It would be a worthwhile principle to extend to all the professions that the minority representation would be for the profession and the majority would be for the community through the consumer and various other interests.  One could extend this idea of the professions and professional accountability beyond what are regarded normally as the profession, because medicine, dentistry, architecture, engineering and those in the law have always been regarded with a certain awe, but there are professions now which are so sophisticated and, without being too unruly, as powerful as those &mdash; banking, insurance and accountancy &mdash; that are as much in need of regulation by the community as the traditional professions which are, to a considerable extent, <Col N="550" /> under the detailed scrutiny of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the dental profession seem to have accepted willingly would be a welcome and useful innovation for other professions.  The uniqueness of the whole area of health care and dental care, and particularly of dental care, is that it is an illness of degeneration in the way that the advancing ailments of western society are less a product of neglect, malnutrition and poor health and more a product of our deliberate abuse of ourselves through overindulgence. It is somewhat of an irony that we have to spend more and more time in our western affluent society looking after more illnesses that are not accidentally caused, not caused by factors outside our control, but are caused almost entirely by our own over-indulgence in things that do us no good.  I wish the Minister would convey to the Government his reforming zeal in all the other areas of professional self-interest and powerful vested interest.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the extension of the principle of auxiliaries having rights.  As one who participates in the non-university technological sector where there are many specialist technicians and technological people being produced in many areas, it is very important that the unique role of people outside the old limited concept of the professions be recognised and be extended into the areas of engineeing, the law and so on.  The incorporation into the Bill of at least the possibility of specialist auxiliary dental work being done by people other than graduates of dental schools is welcome, and I am glad the Minister has introduced it.  I hope no lobbying from one force to another will in any way water it down.</P>

      <P>There are many sections in this Bill on which people could speak, but the one that interests me in particular is section 7.  Regardless of the standards of education of dentists, and their regulations, the one fault I have with this profession is that there are not enough dentists to do the work that needs to be done.  Section 7 will provide extra people to teach oral hygiene.  This is an important factor if it means that the dentists will be free to do the work they are trained to do.  It is appalling that children lose their teeth because they did not get care in time.  This is one medicine where prevention is better than cure, because there is not any cure when things go wrong.  An extraction is not a cure; it causes other problems.  Despite the best efforts of the dentists in the public health scheme, in my area they are run off their feet trying to catch up on the backlog but they will not succeed because we do not have enough dentists.  I would like to see the Minister providing this extra help and giving more time to dentists, or if possible providing more dentists.</P>

    <Title>Local Authority Financing: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator M. O'Toole on Wednesday, 14 March 1984:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the inadequate financing of local authorities for the financial year 1984 with the derisory increase for rates support grants of 0.8 per cent over 1983 which <Col N="552" /> will lead to further unemployment and a deterioration in services, and calls on the Government to take immediate action to rectify their position.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the level of Government support for local authority finances as reflected in the increase of 10.3 per cent in the aggregate of grants and subsidies being provided for 1984 and the fact that almost two-thirds of all local authority spending on current account is provided, or recouped, from the Exchequer; and that taking account of these facts and of the extended powers which have been conferred on local authorities to raise revenue from local sources, any adverse effects of the current economic difficulties on local authority services and employment in 1984 will be minimised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator O'Leary).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of the motion.  Local Government is an essential element in a democratic state and is also the machinery by which important services are provided.  A local government system permits more direct contact with local people in the process and responsibilities of government.  Conditions, needs, opinions, resources and aspirations of local significance differ and therefore it is essential that there should be means of converting national policies in relation to such matters as housing, roads, water, sewerage services and other amenity services into action programmes suited to the circumstances of different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are responsible for providing many services.  They are responsible for the upkeep and safety of our roads.  They are expected to provide houses and also expected to provide water and sewerage services for our community, along with several other needs so essential for the development and preservation of the environment generally. In order that local authorities can <Col N="553" /> provide these services adequately they need finance.  There is no need to state that local authorities are not properly financed.  The present disastrous state of finances has reached a crisis point, and something more than talking is necessary.</P>
    <P>The first urgent requirement is that national Government should admit inadequacies in the present system of financing. As the Government they have control and they are to blame.  It must also be admitted that most of the functions being carried out by local authorities are costing a fraction of what it would cost to administer the same services nationally. The proper thing to do would be for the Government to give as many administrative responsibilities as possible to local authorities and provide sufficient finances for them so that they could effectively administer these responsibilities by levying a special level of national taxation for local government services.</P>
    <P>If one were to compare administrative costs of semi-State or State operations to local authority administrative costs, it would be obvious that it is tantamount to economic madness not to use local authorities more.  For instance, there are a number of agencies employed by the State for youth development, training schemes and industrial development, apart from bodies like the Office of Public Works who carry out the maintenance of public buildings and drainage schemes. By comparison similar types of work carried out by local authorities have been found to be more economically and effectively organised and much more amenable to local and public participation, co-operation and satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Government are spending a sum of £6,500 annually per unemployed person. This money would be more usefully employed if the Government examined the use of local authorities as providers of jobs.  If local authorities had sums of money available to them, not alone would they reduce the unemployment figures but they would carry out improvement works in drainage, tourist facilities and development of national resources which are necessary and in turn would be of economic and social benefit and lift the <Col N="554" /> depression which in recent years has beset our people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be empowered to develop training programmes for a variety of schemes which would provide much needed training for young people who are denied training opportunities at present.  Development of a new training programme could be organised and operated better at county level under the existing county development teams in co-operation with the vocational educational committees, the county councils, ACOT committees and IDA.  If present legislation makes that impracticable, it should be amended immediately to make it workable.  It costs 12½ per cent to administer schemes at local authority level; it costs three and four times that amount to administer the same schemes at national level.  Local authorities need much more finance from the Exchequer than ever before.  Inadequate distribution of replacement charges must be replaced urgently with an alternative simple system.</P>
    <P>It would not be fair to ask local authorities to increase charges or introduce more charges for services, as the public are taxed to the hilt already.  In 1983 water charges were estimated to bring in an income of £22 million if collected, whereas £23 million was left uncollected in motor tax evasion.  There seems to be something drastically wrong here. Twelve million pounds was paid towards supplementary welfare in 1983 for a scheme in which the councils had no involvement except to pay.  The sum of £15 million was paid in malicious injury claims, £1½ million was paid in courthouse maintenance and £9.792 million was spent by authorities in contributions to drainage.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that the National Economic and Social Council are carrying out a limited review of local authority finance.  I hope that when carrying out this review they will get submissions from members of local authorities and that when the Minister receives the report he will act on it expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole when ably introducing this motion referred to statutory <Col N="555" /> demands.  If councils were to shed responsibility for supplementary welfare, malicious injuries, courthouse maintenance, arterial drainage and if the State forwarded advances of money, £31.6 million would be saved, water charges would not be required and the councils would be able to provide the services that are expected from them. Alternatively, if even 1 per cent of income tax and VAT were paid to councils it would mean an alternative income of £28 million.  Senator O'Toole was right when in moving the motion he demanded the removal of statutory demands from local authorities.  These demands are hindering local authorities in fulfilling the work of providing the necessary services that are expected from them, and unless the Government make some finances available to the councils to meet these statutory demands, the councils will not be in a position to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the major road schemes undertaken and planned by local authorities that the staff are highly effective and efficient in carrying out such schemes.  The Nass by-pass is one great example of such, and it reminds me of signs that people regularly pass announcing that a project is being grant aided by the European Regional Fund.  I understand that before such a sign appears the particular county council will have been waiting a long time for the Minister for the Environment, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, to sanction this new road scheme or bridge for which the regional development moneys have been earmarked.  This is another example of the frustration of local authorities in not having direct access to the European Regional Fund.  The Minister and the Government should examine this.</P>
    <P>When the Department of the Environment are allocating funds for youth employment schemes in the future, regulations concerning such schemes should be as simple as possible so that local authorities can implement really meaningful training schemes for the purpose that they see fit.  The regulations should be simple and drawn up so as to ensure <Col N="556" /> that meaningful training schemes for the youth can be undertaken in the summer time.  Local authorities should be responsible for the provision of recreational and amenity facilities and such schemes, would be undertaken by them to great advantage.</P>
    <P>It is frightening to think about local government planning for 1984 in view of the fact that local authorities are already carrying a debt of over £60 million into the current financial year and are expected to find an additional 10 per cent to maintain services at last year's level because of increased costs and no corresponding budgetary increase.  How can local authorities even maintain services at last year's level, never mind provide additional services, with an increase of a mere 0.8 per cent?  Many councils are frustrated because of such a derisory increase in the rates support grant from the Government.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, the councils are demanding that he meet deputations to discuss the grave financial problems.  I understand that the Minister of State met a deputation today.  He has been meeting deputations for the past week.  The only publicity about these deputations is that the Minister is refusing to meet some elected members who form part of these delegations.  I know that a group from one county met the Minister last week and a member of the council could not be part of the deputation, but when the Coalition partners in that county saw fit to deprive Fianna Fáil of the chairmanship of that authority they did not tell him that he should not vote but used him to ensure that Fianna Fáil would not get the chairmanship.  I am referring to Frank Glynn who was not allowed into this House last week.  He was not good enough to meet the Minister in a deputation but definitely found sufficient to be Chairman of Galway County Council because it would ensure that Fianna Fáil could not get the chair.</P>
    <P>There will also be a need for a local government system run by people with local experience and intimate knowledge of local conditions.  Elected members are fundamental to the survival of local government.  It is they who must interpret <Col N="557" /> public feeling and enliven it with leadership. If there were no elected members to interpret the wishes of local people and to give effect to policy decisions, then democracy would be in jeopardy.  In this instance reform is badly needed.  The local government elections were postponed this year because local government reform was being implemented.  I think that local government reform was only used as a disguise, an excuse to postpone elections, because the Coalition partners, Fine Gael and Labour, were afraid to meet the electorate, knowing that if they did so they would have far less local authority membership than at present.  Our county councillors who had to face the people to get elected are doing a great job.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed some time ago when a Government backbencher, a member of the Fine Gael Party in the other House, passed some remarks which castigated the work of public representatives. I decry these remarks and would always hold these county councillors in high esteem.</P>

Their work should be appreciated, because they have no remuneration for the work which they do and only get expenses for attending meetings, while their work is on much broader terms than attending meetings.  You could say that they are full-time public representatives.  The Minister recently recognised their work by increasing the travelling allowances for councillors, but I do not think he went all the way.  I feel councillors need and deserve more, and I am sure it is not beyond the capacity of local government to provide stationery, postage or telephone facilities for its members.  I mean it could be provided on <Col N="558" /> some limited basis.  Such people may not continue to present themselves for election if their work is not recognised and especially unless they feel the system gives them scope to make an effective contribution to local government.  It behoves us all to have the necessary financial and other reforms carried out by central authority so that the local government system in the future will elect suitable public representatives and officials to serve in it.</P>

I welcome that, because that is the kind of dialogue that we will have to set up.  The Minister would welcome it in his review of local authority financing, which is a major challenge to all of us at both sides if we are to ensure that local democracy survives as we know it and want it to survive.  I could not agree with him more in his compliments to the voluntary work that members of local authorities put in on a regular basis, at considerable expense to themselves and to their businesses, to represent their constituents and to try to ensure that the best possible level of service is given at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appended my name to an amendment to the original motion.  I agree that an increase of 0.8 per cent in the rates support grant would not on its own be sufficient to do a lot of work necessary at local authority level.  It would not be in keeping with my principles in this House just to vote against the motion and I thought it appropriate to put down an amendment which actually states the case correctly and reflects other areas of increases from the Government.  They face financial constraints for which they must put some of the blame on their colleagues on the other side.  They left the situation pretty tricky and there is not a great amount of money left in the kitty.  In view of that, a reasonable effort has been made by the Government to ensure that local authorities are properly financed until their workings are reviewed properly and correctly and the members come to grips <Col N="559" /> with their responsibilities in a whole lot of areas.  I have mentioned them before in this kind of debate.  Until that happens the level of increase of 10.3 per cent in the aggregate of grants and subsidies being provided in 1984 is a pretty good gesture in the light of the problems that we have to contend with.  The fact that it is almost two-thirds of the level of local authority funding is indicative of the Government's concern that local authorities should continue to function in a constructive manner pending this full review.</P>
    <P>We are faced with this dilemma in local authorities and it is one for which we can blame ourselves.  Rates on domestic properties were abolished partly by one Government and totally by another Government.  Water charges and other charges which were still remaining at county level were not being applied at urban or corporation level.  This was an anomaly.  As a county councillor I feel that the people I represent at rural level should have the same crack of the whip as people living in cities and other urban areas.  There should be an across the board regulation empowering all authorities to implement the same charges.</P>
    <P>The levels of charges were matters for councillors.  How they implemented the charges and on whom they implemented them were matters for councillors but unfortunately councillors ran away from the problem and gave the power to the managers.  Some of my own colleagues were also guilty of not being able to face up the responsibility of devising a scheme which would be fair on the consumers of the sanitary services.  They had the power to have three or four different categories of charges for water in towns, from the poorer dwellings, the local authority housing schemes to the very wealthy mansions &mdash; of whoever lives in them &mdash; with four or five bathrooms.  One finds the anomaly now because the councillors did not accept that challenge; they handed that power to the managers. Administratively the managers decided on a flat water charge for most of them, with the exemptions that we agreed in this House the day the order was made, for certain pensioners and others.  Councillors <Col N="560" /> to a large degree ran away from their responsibility and I do not hold with that. Either you are responsible and do your job or you are not.  In many counties councillors just ran away from it and then blamed the managers and blamed the Minister for giving the manager the power.  If they read the regulations they would find that the opposite was the case. I had it checked out and got it confirmed from the Tánaiste of the day.  I had reservations as to why people were not implementing the proper schemes.</P>
    <P>The Opposition also were faced with the same problem.  I do not have to quote from <i>The Way Forward</i> because I think they have scrapped it now.  Page 96 of <i>The Way Forward</i> stated that the matter was being examined in the context of legislation to empower local authorities to charge for services generally.  I am glad they are not in power because the charges under that section apparently would have been about twice as high as they were when we tackled the problem. They also left a deficit in local authority funding when they went out of office in 1983.  We were forced to put in another £31½ million to try to hold the thing together.  Literally all it did was to hold it together.  We did that consciously.  We knew there was no way in which local authorities could have survived with the kind of restriction imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I remember &mdash; and my colleagues across the House will remember &mdash; many a year when a limit was placed on the powers of local authorities to strike a rate.  Often the limit placed on them by previous Ministers was something like 10 per cent.  Inflation at that time was rampant. We have 20 per cent inflation and we had a governmental limitation of 10 per cent on the amount of rates that could be struck.  That was to try to avoid local authorities making unnecessary demands at central Government level.  It rebounded because, due to our inability to strike correct rates, the demands on central Government became greater under other headings.</P>
    <P>That is why this year I was pleased to see in the budget a genuine effort being made, particularly in regard to roads, through the sum of £98 million being <Col N="561" /> made available directly to councils.  The problem about money coming from central Government is that we have no ability at local level to determine how and where we spend it.  We are told how to spend it and where to spend it.  We are unable to use it on many of the minor roads and the county roads which are now totally dependent on the dwindling number of ratepayers who are still left under the tottering system.  People in small businesses, shops and factories are the only people left paying a rate.  They have to carry the can for all the other services we hope to give in our counties. That is why we are faced with the dilemma of trying to get some income from some of the services that we give to people.  When there was a threat of their being cut off under a previous administration because we were unable to maintain them, there was an outcry from everybody: &ldquo;We are all prepared to pay for them.  Could we please have them?  Could we have an extension of the refuse collection into the country and we will pay so much a week?&rdquo;  I heard it all.  When it actually came to striking a rate or making a decision along those lines, the members handed all their powers to the manager to devise a scheme because they thought politically that was a suitable thing to do.</P>
    <P>I have reservations too about the level of block grants.  The block grant system is one that we have operated for a long number of years. There are discrepancies in block grants to various councils.  If they were distributed fairly around the country I would be happy.  Some counties seem to do better than others.  It is in the area of block grants that there is some degree of flexibility for the councillors, in consultation with their engineers.  They can get useful work done within an area that is not otherwise identified specifically, like the main road grants which are 100 per cent recoupable and other primary urban roads which are 50 per cent recoupable.  Those are confined to specific areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely made a further important comment regarding the inability of councils to make submissions directly to the European Parliament through the <Col N="562" /> Regional and Social Funds for moneys that they could usefully employ for the development of infrastructure, particularly in rural Ireland where there is a total neglect now, because of the rating system, of the county roads that weekly we all traverse meeting our constituents and over which most of our constituents have to travel.  We are neglecting those roads now because we do not have sufficient funds to maintain them.  Therefore, the reform of local authority is a matter of urgency.  The Minister and his predecessor in that Department have done a lot of work already, but I should like to be assured that consultation will go on with the elected members through the various bodies of county councils, municipal authorities, local authority members, county managers, county secretaries and so on.  Discussion should be going on now with all of these so that we can make the correct decisions and enact legislation that will provide for the kind of responsibility that local authority members would like to have and which one would hope, they would live up to.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the area of statutory demands.  There is no doubt that this is an area over which we have relatively little control as local authority members.  Even those of us who are on the sub-committees or other statutory bodies which are appointed by the county councils and even those involved in the compilation of statutory demands have little control but this does not take away from the anomaly that the funding authority have no power to decide what the other statutory authority can demand of them.  That involves ACOT, the health boards, the vocational educational committees and in some counties the Board of Works and other agencies like that. They can put in demands which the council can find quite difficult to meet depending on rateable valuations and the system which they adopted in the past under these headings.  There are anomalies, but an effort has been made in the level of increases in all the grants. Regarding the grant mentioned in the motion itself &mdash; admittedly not the kind of figure I would have liked to have seen there &mdash; I recognise that in other areas <Col N="563" /> there are increases.  In some areas there are some spectacular increases.  In other areas there are minuses.  In a budgetary situation we cannot hope to get all the money we would like at local authority level.  In all our consultations with trade unions and so on in my county council reservations have been expressed about the possible risk to employment, and after having long discussions with them and with the county manager I am confident that we will be able to maintain the level of employment.  If councils were progressive in the past in this area there is no doubt that they could maintain employment and can use it fruitfully in areas in which the most manpower possible should be used, and not just by the use of machinery.</P>
    <P>The movers of the motion could accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is put forward on the basis that there is an increase.  We recognise the financial difficulties local authorities are in.  We hope that the review will be swift and decisive and that the necessary power to maintain local democracy will be given to the members of councils and that we will have the courage to follow that through because it would mean some form of taxation on property, whether on private houses, land or whatever in terms of benefitting from local authority services.  All properties benefitting from local authority services in some way should be expected to contribute.  If they are dependent on the central fund, the PAYE payer and the taxpayer in general are the people who will have to pay for all the services. We can never put enough money into the central fund to be able to satisfy the demands of all the county councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that the amendment is a reasonable one.  It sets the record straight, and I hope that the movers of the motion will accept it in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I support the motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the inadequate financing of local authorities for the financial year 1984 with the <Col N="564" /> derisory increase for rates support grants of 0.8 per cent over 1983 which will lead to further unemployment and a deterioration in services, and calls on the Government to take immediate action to rectify their position.</P>
    <P>Almost every local authority are in a disastrous financial state.  However, there are rumours, and I gathered from what Senator Ferris said that he is aware of those rumours, that a few local authorities have received more favourable financial allocations than others.  If this is true I can only guess at the identity of these local authorities and the reason for the special treatment they have received.  I am sure the Minister is aware that these rumours have caused widespread dissatisfaction among local authority members in the less-favoured areas.  It appears &mdash; and Senator Ferris seems to bear this out &mdash; that there is a certain amount or may be a good deal of truth in what is being said.  I would be interested to know, for example, what the percentage increase was on last year's allocation for the Minister for the Environment's own local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the proposer of the motion stated, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 is the major cause of the financial problem now being experienced by local authorities.  Prior to the passing of that Act local authorities were compensated in full for the relief from rates granted on domestic dwellings and agricultural land. Admittedly in the 1978 Act the Minister was given the power to limit the amount to be provided in the rate poundage, but the agricultural rates relief grant and the domestic rates relief grant which were paid by the Department each year to local authorities were based on the rate in the £ and consequently they increased each year by the same percentage as the rate poundage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new arrangements brought in by the 1983 Act mean that there is no longer an obligation on the Minister to recoup <Col N="565" /> to local authorities a specific amount in lieu of domestic rates or agricultural rates.  The Minister now has discretion in regard to the amounts to be paid to local authorities.  The domestic rates relief grant and the agricultural grant paid to local authorities are no longer determined by reference to the rate in the £ but are decided by the Minister.  In my own county of Roscommon, if the grants this year were based on a rate in the £ of £21.67, which was the rate recommended to the county council by the county manager and which showed an increase of 10 per cent over the 1983 figure of £19.70 in the £, the total of both grants would be £7.384 million in the current year whereas on the basis of an increase of 0.8 per cent on last year's figure these grants will amount to only £6.199 million.  The shortfall is £1,185,000.  In a predominantly agricultural and rural county like Roscommon it is impossible to make up that shortfall from other sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>The 1983 Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act conferred on local authorities a general power to charge for the services they provided.  We were told at the time that this power would enable local authorities to raise additional revenue, and this was presented in such a way as to convey the impression that as a result of these service charges local authorities would have more money to spend.  I pointed out at the time that the service charges were being introduced to bridge the gap between the grants that the Minister would provide and the amounts which should be provided and which were heretofore being provided in lieu of rates.  What has happened since has proved that my analysis of the situation was correct except that in the case of the majority of local authorities the revenue raised by the service charges is not sufficient to go anywhere near bridging the shortfall which arises from this year's allocation.  It was made quite clear from this side of the House during the debate on the introduction of the service charges that we had no objection to the principle of such charges provided they increased the revenue of local authorities and enabled the services being provided by <Col N="566" /> local authorities to be improved and expanded</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris tried to give the impression that we were opposed to the introduction of service charges.  We were in favour of the introduction of service charges provided those service charges supplemented the income of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Opposition not vote against them throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>We pointed out then, and this has been borne out by what happened subsequently, that the revenue which was raised from these service charges was used to relieve central government of its obligation to provide full recoupment to local authorities for the relief of rates on domestic dwellings and on agricultural land.  Since that is what has happened and since that is what we anticipated would happen I think it was quite fair, honest and accurate to describe the imposition of these charges as the introduction of rates under another guise.  Most local authorities are heavily dependent for the funding of their operations on the amounts received by way of the agricultural grant and the domestic rates relief grant.  This is particularly true of local authorities in counties which are predominantly rural.  The scope for the introduction of service charges in such counties is limited and the amount of revenue which can be raised by way of service charges in such counties is limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of such counties, to describe the increase of 0.8 per cent in the agricultural land domestic rates relief grant as derisory is not an exaggeration.  When this increase of 0.8 per cent is considered in the context of an inflation rate of approximately 10 per cent last year and a projected or anticipated inflation rate in the region of 8 per cent in the current year, derisory is the mildest word one could use to describe the increase.  Consequently, the vast majority of local authorities find themselves with no option but to cut back drastically on services.  In many cases employment will <Col N="567" /> suffer and will suffer seriously.  The circular dated 22 December 1983 and issued by the Department of the Environment to local authorities notifying them of the 0.8 per cent increase went on to state:</P>
    <P>The public service estimates for 1984 reflect the tight financial constraints within which public agencies must operate in consequence of the serious economic conditions.  It is essential that local authorities subject their expenditure programmes to the tightest possible scrutiny so as to eliminate waste, promote cost effectiveness at all levels and ensure that the available resources are deployed to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>Every public representative and every local authority member is conscious of the current economic conditions.  I also believe that many Government Departments could learn a lesson from local authorities as regards the way in which they subject their expenditure programmes to the tightest possible scrutiny so as to eliminate waste, promote cost effectiveness and ensure that the available resources are deployed to the best possible advantage.  Yet the Government have allowed an 8 per cent increase in current Estimates for Government Departments as against the 0.8 per cent increase allowed to local authorities.  It is no wonder that the Government shied away from holding the local elections which were due to be held in the current year.</P>
    <P>Many speakers, including the last speaker, have referred to the burden placed on local authorities by the many statutory demands which they have to meet on an annual basis and which in many cases have increased substantially in recent years.  I was pleased that the Minister stated in his address that it is his intention to have these statutory demands examined urgently in the context of the review of local government. There is a limit on the demands which can be made on local authorities by committees of agriculture and vocational educational committees but it is impossible <Col N="568" /> for any local authority to know where they stand in relation to the statutory demands from the health boards for supplementary welfare allowances. Here again local authorities are unfairly treated by the Government, since decisions to grant increases in supplementary welfare allowances or increases in the free fuel scheme are Government decisions but the increases have to be partly funded by the local authorities.  This arrangement means that each year local authorities are presented with revised demands towards the end of the year which they have no choice but to meet.  This is a most unfair and unjust arrangement, and it needs to be changed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Down through the years local authorities have made a major contribution to the development of this country.  They have provided essential services and infrastructure.  They have created employment for large numbers of workers.  If local authorities are to continue to serve the needs of the country and of the local community as well in the future as they have done in the past, the Government will have to face up immediately to the serious financial difficulties with which these bodies are now confronted. In due course they will have to come up with realistic proposals for local government reform.  These proposals will have to be implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Opposition in tabling this motion did not do so in the hope of presenting the Government in any favourable light but rather hoping that the Government would be embarrassed or shown to be shying away from their responsibility with regard to the financing of local government.  If this was their purpose in tabling this motion I would suggest they are in for a rude awakening. Far from the Government being embarrassed in any way or making any effort to shy away from or shun their responsibilities in this matter, the Minister expressed his gratification and his delight that this motion enabled him to examine the position and to explain in detail exactly what the position was.  I <Col N="569" /> know that the Opposition will try to belittle the efforts of the Government in this regard.  However, the Government themselves feel that there was much more that they would wish to do if they were in a position to do so but due to the present recession and the present economic position in the country generally, it is only fair to say that they have gone as far as they could in trying to remedy the position with regard to local government finances and to put them on a proper basis.  This year they took sufficient steps to try to ensure the continuation of services at the existing level and at the same time to maintain employment at the same level.  They have been reasonably successful in this.  It is entirely wrong to say that the Government are not fully aware of the need for the restructuring of local government finances.  Indeed we do not need to say it, though Senator Mullooly would try to attribute other reasons to the Government for postponing the local elections: their reason was the recognition of the necessity not alone to restructure the finances but for the complete restructuring of local government. For example, in the Dublin area we have the town of Tallaght which in the not too distant past was a mere hamlet.  I read only last week that several people remember when it had a total population of 352 people.  The population is now 60,000 and it is envisaged that in the near future it will rise to 90,000.  This shows the remarkable change which is occurring in Dublin and the need for regular and periodic revision of the total structure of local government.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully aware of their reliance on all local authorities with regard to the matter of giving effect to housing, road development, provision of infrastructure and in dealing with planning matters and services generally.  They are also aware of how much the local communities look to those local authorities and rely on them.  It is sufficient to say that we can gauge the importance of those local authorities from the fact that in 1983 the Government provided £1.4 billion in capital and provided employment for 35,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In very difficult times, such as the present, <Col N="570" /> when everyone knows the need for curtailment and saving in all matters, there is a very serious problem with regard to local authorities due to the fact that rates have been abolished in the fairly recent past.  We heard that all parties agreed to the abolition of rates, particularly the two main parties, and that therefore this cannot in any way be regarded as contributing towards the present position with regard to local government finances.  Our party were the first party to advocate the abolition of rates.  As far back as 1963 our Ard-Fheis passed a resolution to remove the health charges, as a start, from the rates. Indeed, we all know how long it took the party on the opposite side to realise that domestic rates could be abolished.  In 1972, the then Government, now the Opposition, issued a White Paper saying that rates must remain as the basic method of providing finance for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>This was their attitude then but in the 1973 general election when Fine Gael advocated the partial abolition of rates the then Government said it could not be done.  It was only by way of a very hasty decision on their part in the midst of the election that the late George Colley made the announcement that not alone were they going to give partial relief of rates but they were going to give total abolition. So great was the conversion that it could be compared to the conversion of St. Paul on the road to Damascus.  Their own supporters were taken completely unaware.  I am sure country Senators will appreciate that it is necessary to send in advertisements early in the week for inclusion in the provincial papers on the Saturday.  In one rural constituency there had been sent in to the paper on behalf of Fianna Fáil a notice saying that it was all nonsense and all propaganda on behalf of Fine Gael to say that rates could in any way be eased out and urging the electorate not to be taken in by this, but in the mid-week Fianna Fáil announced that they would abolish rates.  On the following Saturday the notice appeared in the paper concerned saying that it was nonsense to think anything could be done at all.  That will give an idea of the haste <Col N="571" /> and the ill-conceived way in which they dealt with it so while it is true to say that both parties advocated the abolition of rates there was an entirely different approach in both cases.  On the one hand, our party only advocated the gradual abolition of rates and the replacement by an alternative method.  It was all fully considered and thought out, whereas the Government of the day just rushed in in an effort to salvage something when they felt they were in danger of defeat.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government of 1973 had given a guarantee that during their term of office they would gradually abolish rates in various stages and in fulfilment of that policy they had granted a 25 per cent removal of rates by the time the 1977 election came about.  Fianna Fáil, when they came back to power, were forced to honour their commitment so in 1978 rates were abolished without there being any effort to work out a reasonable, fair and workable alternative.  It is true to say that to a certain degree the ill-conceived and hasty method of the removal of rates contributed in some part to present conditions.</P>
    <P>Since then the Government have been committed to the recoupment of rates which would normally be levied on local residents.  However, year after year the amount fell short of the sum required and we had the position where the Government decided how much they would give and that was far short of the amount required.  The local authorities were powerless to decide how to solve the discrepancy that was created.  In 1982 the discrepancy between what the Government gave and what was required had amounted to £10.7 million.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Government of the day had prepared the Estimates for 1983 and they showed absolutely no increase in the amount available from Government sources.  However, after the change of government the Coalition Government felt that, despite the stringent circumstances prevailing, and despite the recession, something had to be done about this, and they provided £31.5 million. While Senators on the opposite side of the House may lament the lack of funds <Col N="572" /> at present, it is easy for them to envisage what the position might have been had this £31.5 million not been provided &mdash; which was their policy.  The Government may be, and indeed have been, criticised for the removal of the commitment to recoup the full amount of rates.  The Minister no longer has responsibility to give full recoupment.  This has long been the case.  In theory it was supposed to be given, but in actual practice for a long time it fell far short.  Senator O'Toole told us that the increase was 58 per cent while inflation accounted for 74.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>While this Government are fully aware of the fact that they have not done everything they would wish to do, they are also fully conscious of the need for total reform.  Dublin City Council caters for 11 areas, each of them the size of a normal Dáil constituency.  Therefore, the need for reform in the Dublin area is great, as I am sure it is in other parts of the country. It behoves members of the Opposition, some of whom say they are entirely opposed to local charges and others that they agree with local charges but not the present local charges, to offer an alternative. Instead of complaining about the shortcomings of the Government, they should realise that in present circumstances the Government have done all they could and are fully conscious of the need to do much more in this line.  They should offer constructive suggestions for the complete reform of the system of local government.</P>

If the Government side want to check on that they will find that that was the position. In my own county the highest rate of increase was 7 per cent while the local authority members had the right to determine the rates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he is slightly antagonistic towards me.  It is not personal, but he probably knows that I have a different view as regards the future of local authorities. The powers given to county managers at the moment are excessive.  Local authority members are nothing more than rubber stamps in the provision and running of county services.  Last year when the Minister introduced the Bill in this House and in the other House allowing the imposition of charges, he gave power to the managers to do so if the local councils would not.  The local councils were right in most cases in refusing to do the Minister's dirty work for him.  The intention was to supplement the reduced income to local authorities from central funds.  This year the rates support grant given by the Minister to the local authorities was .8 per cent.  Somebody referred earlier to some of the lavish allocations given to other counties.  I wonder would any other county with the exception of mine take a 50 per cent reduction in the amount of money allocated for house construction in the coming year?  We got a 50 per cent reduction, not allowing for inflation.</P>
      <P>We must also look at the road grants. Our roads are being allowed to deteriorate. We have new EEC regulations which we are bound to implement.  The net result is that our roads are being forced to carry a weight of traffic which they are not able to carry.  We need massive injections of money if our road surfaces are to be maintained at any sort of reasonable standard.  Probably the Government will construct a number of national primary roads which will act as links to the dirt roads we will have in the next few years.  Roads which were black-topped down through the years are now reverting to dirt tracks due to the lack of Government money to maintain and repair them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of revenue coming in to local authorities from service charges is a bit of a laugh.  The Minister stated in <Col N="575" /> the House last week that the amount of money coming in was very small.  The highest return was in Cork city at 65 per cent.  The Minister did not tell the House about the local authorities with a 20 per cent collection who are unlikely to get anything more due to the fact that some people are unable to pay.  How can people with mortgages and those who are unemployed be expected to pay charges for services when they are not in a position to buy the daily needs of their own households?  The Minister has decided that the local authorities should try to get blood from the proverbial stone, because there is no way in which those people will be able to pay the proposed charges.</P>
    <P>In my county the proposals of the county manager on cutbacks in services and increased charges are unlikely to be sanctioned by the local authority. Recently I have wondered whether we should waste the money we are paid in travelling expenses to attend local authority meetings.  This money might be better spent by the county manager on some of the potholes that need to be filled around the county.</P>
    <P>We have had suggestions from the Government side that all is well with the local authorities and that the state of their finances is due to Fianna Fáil being in Government for four years.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House how much in the red these local authorities were when the Coalition Government took office in December 1982.  In December 1983 what was the position?  How much had been under-provided for them?  The Coalition Government said they accepted the Fianna Fáil Estimates because they had not time to prepare their own.  This year they had time to prepare their own and what have they come up with?  They have come up with this .8 per cent increase which, with service charges, will mean that every local authority will have to run down the services they have given to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no wonder that the Minister has before him applications from no fewer <Col N="576" /> than 23 local authorities to meet him in regard to their financial position &mdash; this is by his admission.  At a local authority meeting yesterday our council were informed that they are now No. 24 on the list.  We have 27 local authorities, excluding corporations and town commissions.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend to do when he finds that, by the latter half of this year the local authorities have not got the necessary finances to keep going? Will he close them down?  What will he do with the workers who will lose their jobs due to the fact that local authorities will not be in a position to pay them?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Ellis has misquoted the Government's action on the 1983 Estimates.  He said the Government accepted the estimates, which we did not: We added £31½ million to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris is worried about that £31½ million which was supposedly not included in the Estimates prepared by Fianna Fáil.  If those Estimates were wrong.  I am surprised that the Government's Estimates came out so well.  We heard prior to the budget this year that the Minister for Finance had done a good job in the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking about the number of local authorities waiting to meet the Minister. The Minister of State will soon be up at night meeting them on behalf of the Minister due to the fact that the Minister is busy.  They are all going home with one <Col N="577" /> arm as long as the other after their meetings. The Minister has told them that the Department of the Environment is not in a position to give them any further financial aid.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the amounts of money being allocated for local improvement schemes.  In my county we had a reduction of 27 per cent on the 1983 allocation.  Add 10 per cent inflation to this figure and it is very close to the 50 per cent mark, which means that this work, which is very necessary to provide rural areas with a reasonable standard of roads, will be slowed down due to Government action.  Large amounts of the money used for local improvement schemes came to the Government via the EEC.  Further EEC funds which would have been available to us will not now come here due to the fact that the Government are not prepared to back up the allocations.</P>
    <P>I have one last suggestion to make to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister.  Will he ask the Minister to go to the Minister for Social Welfare and get him to transfer some of the money being paid in unemployment benefit to the local authorities to allow them to employ a larger workforce to try to improve our roads, work such as the cleaning of culverts and trimming of hedges?</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion.  People on the other side of the House who say their amendment is a compromise are only kidding themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the motion we submitted here in all sincerity is not acceptable to the Government. It gave the Minister a real opportunity to give a comprehensive report in this forum to the many local authorities throughout the country who are in dire need of aid.  I protest at his procedure of coming before the House with a prepared statement and with his mind made up. That is regrettable.  He should have listened to the debate and then replied, as was the practice in this House for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary to put down this motion to bring to the notice of the <Col N="578" /> Government the serious constraints on local authorities.  I regret that the Minister came in with a prepared script, read it out and walked away from what is his only responsibility.  We asked the Minister for an extension of the statutory period to enable county councils to meet him to discuss their problems.</P>
    <P>While some Senators who are not members of local authorities may feel that the same problem applies in each local authority, that is not correct.  Each local authority has its own difficulties.  In County Mayo if we met the demand of our county manager we would have a rate of over £30 in the £, whereas in the midlands, in Meath, Carlow and Kilkenny, the demand is in the region of £15 to £18. People in some of the western counties are asked to pay considerably higher rates than people in other counties. There was no mention in the Minister's speech about rates equalisation and I think that is on the cards.  He mentioned reform and restructuring of local government financing, but there was no mention of rates equalisation.  We will have to have a hard look at that.</P>
    <P>If the IDA sell an advance factory in Mayo to an industrialist, regardless of where he might come from, he will have to pay £12 to £14 in the £ more than he would have to pay in Meath, Kilkenny or any of the other midland counties that have a reduced rate.  That is a fact and I defy contradiction.  It is very difficult to sell that to an industrialist, even though in our county we give a concession of two-thirds remission of rates over a period of ten years.  That is the penalty we are paying.  If we removed the two-thirds remission of rates to industrialists &mdash; Senator O'Leary is nodding his head &mdash; he will have to check his facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could help the Senator, in the western counties the valuation put on the building would be considerably lower than in the rest of the country.  So the amount of money being paid in the western counties would actually be less.</P>

      <P>The Senator can have his view, but I am giving the facts.  He may be trying to help me.  I should like to thank him for his comments on my contribution last week when the motion was first introduced.  On two occasions he referred to comments I made on some issues.  He could only compliment me because they were facts.  We give a two-thirds remission of rates in the western counties to any industrialist to set up in our advance factories.  We have to do that to compete with our counterparts in the east.  The Minister should have referred to that when he spoke about the finances of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County councils throughout the country are now trying to strike a rate.  The other night in Mayo we failed to strike a rate after four meetings, and we have until Friday night to finalise our rate.  We thought we would have a meeting with the Minister beforehand and that we would be in a position to assess the result of that meeting.  That did not happen and I regret that very much as indeed do many local authorities who are trying to meet their demands.  We even put forward a resolution last night for a charge on calls to the fire brigade to try to recoup some money.  We suggested that a small fee would be charged depending on whether the fire brigade was called to a private house, an industrial or commercial building.  That was a proposed change.  It is not fair to say we have offered no alternative to the system in operation at the moment.  My good friend Senator Belton made a very good case about the history of the abolition of rates and I do not want to disagree with what he said.  He made a fair contribution on how we arrived at the abolition of rates, but he spoke about haste.  Possibly we <Col N="580" /> jumped the gun on the Fine Gael Party on that occasion and that is what he was talking about.  We claim credit for that. It was not as a result of that decision that we are in this predicament.  It is as a result of the Finance Act passed in March 1983. Every county manager now has two alternatives. One is to go back over their programmes and reduce their estimates if the county council do not agree and if there is a shortfall.  The other is to increase charges.  This is the first time any county manager has had the power to increase charges under the new Finance Act.  Last night we proposed a resolution with a shortfall of £72,000 in Mayo.  The manager would have had two alternatives to resolve his position: to re-address himself to the programme presented and to his estimates, or to increase charges.  It is not fair to say that everything that happened to the local authorities was the result of the abolition of rates on domestic buildings.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I regret very much that the Minister has not given us any green light.  He came in here with a prepared statement.  Early in the debate, without listening to what Senators had to say, he had his mind made up.  My proposals were that the statutory demands would be removed from local authorities, namely, the OPW statutory demand, the health statutory demand, our commitment to courthouses, malicious damages and other statutory demands.  It would relieve the local authorities considerably if they were abolished.  I regret that he did not give us any green light.  If he could give us an idea as to when local government reform which has been talked about for ten to 12 years would come about, people in local authorities would have patience.  I do not think there is any light in the tunnel with regard to local government reform.  Neither do I think there is any light in the tunnel with regard to the restructuring of local authority finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, inherited this and that is the only score I will let him off on.  He inherited the position because the people who brought about this plight are not in that Department any longer.  They left the Minister <Col N="581" /> to carry the baby.  I accept that he is trying his best but he is not here to reply to the Senators who have made very useful contributions.</P>

He is capable of speaking.  It is regrettable that local authorities even as a result of this motion will not be any better off or wiser.  I have not been told when reform will take place or when we can expect the financial restructuring of local government finances.</P>
