      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (1), line 5, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is to make this section a much more positive section than it read in the Bill as initiated. We are asking the Minister to concede that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is a much more positive word than &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If the Council in this section then is instructed that it shall, with the consent of the Minister, make a scheme for establishing classes of auxiliary dental workers who shall... it makes the section very positive and makes the necessity for a section to be initiated later by the Minister much less likely.  This amendment in doing that <Col N="306" /> will remove any anomalies.  The Dental Council might feel that the Minister might want to retain some powers himself at a later stage.  All of us accept that the Minister, in discussions we have had with him on this Bill, is trying to make it as good a piece of legislation as has ever come out of this House.  I am convinced that if the Minister accepts this amendment this section will be very strong and the likelihood of having to insert another section afterwards will be less likely.  For that reason, I propose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure Senator Ferris and Senator Dooge that the amendments are acceptable.  Amendment No. 22 will change from permissive to mandatory the Dental Council's function of specifying the type of dental work which is work that auxiliary dental workers may undertake. Amendment No. 23 means that the Council will be obliged to do all the things listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (2) in respect of any class of auxiliary dental workers established by it.  Therefore, as drafted the subsection allowed the council to decide which of these things it wished to apply in the case of any class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the acceptance of this amendment.  It was quite clear from the discussion in this House on Second Stage that it was the desire of the House that the problem in regard to auxiliary dental workers should be tackled.  There may have been differences about exactly what the coverage should be, about how the position should be tackled.  Faced with the situation that we are faced with in regard to the dental care and dental manpower, in order to achieve the objectives of our community policy in this regard it is essential that something be done.  To lay this charge <Col N="307" /> firmly on the shoulders of the Council is the appropriate way to legislate here.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (2) (a), line 10, before &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;training and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are up against one of these problems when words can have different widths of meaning.  It is possible to define &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; in a narrow sense and &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; in the broad sense.  If it is defined in the narrow sense then there would be a doubt as to whether &ldquo;training&rdquo; was fully contained in &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;, was explicitly contained.  It is of course implicitly contained because nobody is likely to approve a qualification without regard to the training.  Since we do not have in the definition section definitions of these terms in fact we may well then find them left to interpretation by the courts.  It might well be that the chink would be found here in which some educational body could resist the oversight of the Dental Council in regard to certain aspects of training.  This would be undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. My notes indicate to me that what I would say is that training is vital in this area. Qualifications and training are two separate issues.  Training is clearly vital in this difficult profession.  It seems that if you do not include the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; you are leaving a possible loophole situation. Its inclusion is making for a far more definite section in the Bill.  I support it for those reasons.</P>

      <P>On the Explanatory <Col N="308" /> Memorandum on the Dentists Bill, 1984, page 3, I would ask the Minister to define auxiliary dental workers.  Who are they. Are they dental technicians and other persons serving in the field at the moment?  Would the Minister tell me who comes under that term &ldquo;auxiliary dental worker&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deal with the question of training first?  I have considered the insertion of this amendment, but the general legal advice, including the advice of the legal adviser of my Department, is that the particular words are not necessary in this regard.  I am advised that the right to determine qualifications would automatically include the right to determine that the training leading to those qualifications was satisfactory.  It is self-evident that to accept a qualification the council would have to be satisfied that the course of training was considered adequate and fully acceptable to the council, and only then would the qualification be determined by the council. We gave considerable thought to whether the amendment should be inserted or not, and the general thrust of the parliamentary draftsman's approach and legal adviser's approach in the Department was that the insertion of the term &ldquo;training and qualification&rdquo; was unnecessary, because the council has full power to withdraw recognition of a qualification. As such the council lays down the type of training to be undertaken and as a consequence of that it deems a person to be qualified.  Therefore, the general reaction I have had on considering the amendment was that by and large it would be considered excessive to put it in the Bill and would be deemed to be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister and his parliamentary draftsman looking at the narrow legalistic requirement of inserting the words &ldquo;training and&rdquo; before &ldquo;qualification&rdquo; and that they might deem it to be unnecessary, but we are now talking about a special category of auxiliary dental worker which we are requesting this council specifically by law to set up, and because there are existing auxiliary dental workers of some description <Col N="309" /> practising in this country the council will be inundated with requests from people to confirm that they already have qualifications of some description since they have been practising and it is known that they have been practising &mdash; I suppose, unethically practising &mdash; in the past.  They may consider that because of that longterm service they have been giving they are sufficiently qualified, but it could be the opinion of the council that they may not have been professionally trained to act in this capacity.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister and to his advisers that there is no harm in putting in the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; because we feel it is important if we have auxiliary workers whom the council will be asked to recognise and help to train so that they can qualify.  If there is no harm in putting in that I would suggest that for the protection of the consumer, who will in the end be the beneficiary of this type of auxiliary dental worker, that dental worker should be properly trained in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the council. By strengthening the council's hand to ensure that there is adequate training before qualification we will assist the council and will make better legislation and will protect the consumer in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ferris in the line of argument that he has taken.  This is not legislation <i>in vacuo</i> and it is easy for a parliamentary draftsman to look at it as being such, as not being related to an existing situation.  We know that in all these cases of professional qualifications there are great difficulties in regard to what are often known as the grandfather clauses.  There was extreme difficulty in the 1928 Act, so much so that there had to be a special committee of this House to examine the cases of individual dentists and their entitlement to registration. Senator Ferris is quite right; there could be considerable difficulty in this regard. It is, of course, right that there should be transitory provisions in a case like this, but it is not right that there should be a loophole whereby people who are inadequately trained could, in fact, claim registration <Col N="310" /> and recognition in this way.  I am not saying that we are urging legislation which would indicate that the Dental Council would set up the most modern standards of training and insist that nobody who had not that training could possibly be considered.  There must be a transitory provision, but by just leaving it that qualification will include training, of course they will for the future: the future method of gaining a qualification will be set down, but when the Dental Council come to the question of handling those who are at present, some of them legally, some of them perhaps illegally, acting in this particular regard, they will need to possess a modicum of training, whether it was training on the job or not; they will have to satisfy themselves in some way.</P>
      <P>Because of this transitory provision I would ask the Minister if he would look again at this amendment.  He indicated that, in fact, he had no strong feelings either way on this.  I think the feeling in this House would be that unless the draftsman indicates to him that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;training and qualifications&rdquo; does positive harm to the operation of the Act, it is safer to put those words in.</P>

      <P>Lest the House should get the impression that I am asking when this legislation goes through that the people who are not properly trained or have not A, B and C qualifications should be surveyed and that the people of the nation should be getting a better dental service, that is not what I am talking about.  I lived in a house for 30 years where I saw two of the best dentists probably that this nation ever turned out. Both men are dead and buried now, because it was in my early years of marriage. They were two of the best dentists in the country who were serving the people of Clare.  I hope the Minister will listen to me.  I saw those men being backed up by a dental mechanic.  I am not pontificating and asking for persons not fully trained to be allowed to serve in this field.  I saw this person back up these two top-class dentists.  I only wish we had some dentists today as good as those two <Col N="311" /> men.  I saw a dental mechanic back those men up for 25 years.  I am asking the Minister are all these persons like that man gone when this legislation is passed? That is all I am asking.  Do not think that I am standing up here and asking that people who are not properly trained be allowed to serve.  I am as concerned as any other Senator that when this Bill leaves this House every person involved in dentistry is trained and fit to serve the community.  This is what I am concerned with, and I feel we are badly served at the moment.</P>

      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister on this.  I feel that this amendment &mdash; indeed I will go further if needs be with it, or anything that makes the section stronger and better and more definite &mdash; should be welcomed.  The Minister should welcome it and certainly the consumer would welcome it and the dental profession would welcome it.  I would say, perhaps, that not alone should we have &ldquo;training and qualification&rdquo; but we might even include the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; because it is a positive attempt to make this area much stronger and much more positive than it is.  That is the effort we are making and that is what the Senators here this morning are endeavouring to do in the best interests of the profession and of the dental consumer.</P>

      <P>I appreciate this is a very sensitive matter.  I gave my views earlier and I have no desire to leave a vacuum in any way in the Bill on this issue.  In the event of the Senators feeling that there is a substantial degree of validity in inserting the term &ldquo;training&rdquo; before &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo;, I am agreeable to do so if it will help the speedy passage of the Bill and if it will help to clarify in the minds of everybody the general import of the section.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 30, before section 55, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>55.&mdash;(1) An auxiliary dental worker shall, in the performance of any dental work which the class of auxiliary dental workers of which he is a member may undertake in accordance with a scheme made by the Council under section 54 of this Act, comply with any conditions specified by the Council under subsection (2) of that section in regard to the performance of such dental work.</P>
      <P>(2) Dental work carried out by an auxiliary dental worker in accordance with a scheme made by the Council under section 54 of this Act shall be carried out under the supervision of a registered dentist and any such dental work shall only be carried out after the registered dentist has examined the patient and has indicated to the auxiliary dental worker the course of treatment to be provided for the patient.</P>
      <P>(3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to the fitting, insertion or fixing of artificial teeth for persons of eighteen years or over, or the giving of advice to, or attendance on, such persons for such purposes by an auxiliary dental worker in accordance with a scheme made by the Council under section 54 of this Act: Provided that such work does not include any work on natural teeth or on living tissue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes deletion of all of the existing section 55 and its replacement by a new section with three subsections.  This amendment would be in substitution for amendments Nos. 26 and 27 proposed by Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris. The deletion of the existing subsection (1) was sought by both the Dental Board and the Irish Dental Association.  The basis for the provision was a recommendation made in 1979 in the report of the joint working party, representative of the Department of Health, the health boards and the IDA, that the dental therapists, who in Britain extract deciduous or first teeth and do very simple fillings, should be introduced on an experimental basis in the health board service in areas where there is likely to be a continuing shortage of dentists in the public service.</P>
      <P>The board and the association maintained that it was unnecessary to provide for this in subsection (1) since the Dental Council would have adequate power under section 54 to determine the type of dental work which any class of auxiliary dental worker may undertake.  They also represented that the subsection was unnecessarily restrictive in the light of developments since 1979 in regard to the work being undertaken by auxiliary dental workers in other countries.  It could, they finally submitted, inhibit developments here.  I considered these arguments carefully and I propose to delete the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new subsection (1) will replace amendment No. 26 to the existing subsection (1) proposed by Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris.  The general intent of their amendment is accepted and I make that point clear.  This is to ensure that auxiliary dental workers comply with any conditions specified by the council under section 54 in regard to the type of dental work they may carry out or the type of patient they may treat.  I have again consulted the parliamentary draftsman and I am satisfied that the new subsection (1) proposed in my amendment deals with the matter in a more desirable manner in that it is more comprehensive and more directly related to the relevant paragraph <Col N="314" /> of section 54.  I am submitting that it should be accepted in lieu of the amendment proposed by the Senators.  That is rather complicated, but that is the best way in which I can sum it up.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) will replace the new subsection (2) proposed in amendment No. 27 by Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris.  Nearly all of the new subsection proposed by the Senators is accepted and I would stress that again.  This differs from subsection (2) in the Bill by providing that all auxiliary dental workers, and not just those in the health board service, will work under the supervision, instead of the direction, of a dentist and that the requirement of a prior examination by the dentist shall apply in all cases and not just where the council deem it advisable. My amendment differs in not providing, I will stress, for certification by a dentist of satisfactory completion of work done by an auxiliary dental worker.  The Irish Dental Association made representations to me to have this provision inserted and the reason given was that it would ensure that accountability rested with a registered dentist and would avoid any clouding of responsibility in a medical or legal situation.  I have considered that argument carefully and I am strongly advised that there would be no question of any clouding of responsibility in a medical or legal situation since it is already very clearly established in law that an employer is generally vicariously liable for the acts of his employees and thus a dentist in private practice employing an auxiliary dental worker would be liable in law for the acts of the latter and the amendment proposed would have just no meaning in the situation.</P>
    <P>It would be equally pointless, I think, in relation to the health board service since both the dentist and auxiliary worker under his supervision would be employees of the health board who would be liable for the acts of both of them.  Apart from the legal aspect, the introduction of post-certification by a registered dentist of the work of an auxiliary dental worker would, in my view, practically negative the benefits of introducing auxiliary dental workers.  The principal argument in favour of introducing <Col N="315" /> auxiliary dental workers is unquestionably economic and the normal division of labour in that regard means that the highly-trained and qualified and relatively well-paid dentists can concentrate on the more sophisticated tasks which their profession normally calls for while the less costly auxiliary dental work can be done at a still very critical and important level but a relatively lower level. They are trained to cope with that particular level of work.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the requirement that each patient referred by a dentist to an auxiliary dental worker would have to go back to the dentist after treatment by the auxiliarydental worker to have that work checked and a certificate issued to the patient that it had been satisfactorily completed would obviously seriously lessen the general economic benefits of using auxiliary dental workers.  Therefore, I would submit that it is also only reasonable to accept that if the auxiliary dental workers are trained to a level considered adequate by the Dental Council to carry out certain work then they are competent to do the work and do it to finality and the need for certification of its satisfactory completion would be rather difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>Equally I think there would be a quite impossible situation in private practice, because the requirement would oblige a patient to pay a further fee to a dentist for what I would regard as unnecessary certification.  In the health board service it would give rise to a considerable wastage of time.</P>
    <P>Finally there is the new subsection (3). A number of issues are being taken simultaneously in this part of our debate on Committee Stage.  Subsection (2) provides that auxiliary dental workers must work under the supervision of a registered dentist.  However, this provision cannot apply to a class of denturist, if such a class is established, in order to comply with the alternative two of the Restrictive Practices Commission's Report on its 1982 inquiry into the restriction on the supply of dentures to registered dentists.  The Commission recommended the introduction of trained <Col N="316" /> denturists who would provide dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age or over, provided work on living tissue was not involved.  No question arose in the Commission's Report of denturists being required to work under the supervision of dentists and the Commission did not accept that there was need for prior examination by a dentist.  In Denmark, the only EEC country in which denturists may legally operate, neither requirement applies.  In order to implement the Government decision in relation to the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission it is necessary, therefore, to exempt the supply of dentures from the provisions of the new subsection (2).  The new subsection (3) proposed in my amendment achieves just this.</P>
    <P>That is all rather complicated but it does clarify the position.  There was a very considerable debate at Government level as to how precisely this matter should be handled and naturally I am implementing that decision.  To provide that denturists would have to work exclusively under the supervision of a dentist would promote quite a reaction from bodies who would claim to represent dental technicians.  There are a number of such bodies.  The important thing is to try to have at long last a framework within which a contentious issue between the dental profession and the denturists, who are inelegantly called dental mechanics, can be resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 55 is one of those sections which were the subject of close examination by everybody who has looked at the problem, who looked at the legislation which the Minister brought forward.  The first thing I want to say is that I am very grateful to the Minister for the degree to which he has met the points brought forward in our amendments Nos. 26 and 27.  As he indicated, he has not <Col N="317" /> accepted 100 per cent of what is in amendments Nos. 26 and 27 but he has certainly gone a very long way towards doing so.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the objective of amendment No. 26 which, in fact, has been taken over by Government amendment No. 25, is to give full effect to subsection (2) and in particular to subsection (2) (b) of section 54 of the Bill. This subsection is concerned with the attachment of conditions to auxiliary dental work in the making of the scheme, which is now a mandatory scheme, by the new dental council.  That was the main objective Senator Ferris and I had in the drafting of amendment No. 26.  I would ask the Minister on this point if he is satisfied that, with the acceptance of Government amendment No. 25, the Dental Council are not restricted in regard to the nature of these conditions.</P>
      <P>If we look at subsection (2) of section 54, in paragraph (b) it says they may determine the nature of the dental work which may be undertaken, and the conditions under which such work may be undertaken.  I would like to ask a specific question here.  Is the Minister satisfied that one of these conditions could be that certain procedures, which could include post-examination, would have to be carried out in the case of patients of a certain type, patients with a certain medical condition which had been revealed in the prior examination by the dentist.  This is one of the reasons why we drafted amendment No. 26 in the way we did. Senators will notice we use the words &ldquo;type of patient&rdquo;.  This does not really refer only to whether we are dealing in the case of denturists with patients over 18 years.  There may be conditions in which the fitting of dentures would cease to be routine even if operation on living tissue was not involved.  This is our concern. This is why deliberately the phrase &ldquo;type of patient&rdquo; is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister specifically whether he is satisfied on this point.  He may not be able to give me an immediate answer, but would he ensure between now and Report Stage that the type of condition in amendment No. 26 in regard to type <Col N="318" /> of patient &mdash; it could be very broad and include a patient with a particular medical condition &mdash; whether in fact such a condition would be legal under section 54 (2) (b)?  If that is so, then the Minister has substantially met amendment No. 26. To the extent it is not so Senator Ferris and I would still have a problem in this regard.</P>
    <P>We move now to amendment No. 27 which is concerned with the examination of the patient and the question of prior examination, and our original amendment No. 27 regarding questions on post examination.  Let me say one thing straight away.  I agree completely with the Minister that there is no case for post examination on the basis of legal responsibility. I agree with him completely on this point.  I agree also with him when he says if, in fact, such post examination was applied to every single case, that would go a large way to offsetting the benefits of this whole operation of establishing auxiliary dental workers.</P>
    <P>Once again, I feel there may be cases &mdash; I do not know how many, and I do not know how broad they might be &mdash; but there might well be cases in which it would be desirable to provide for a post-examination.  I would like to ask the Minister specifically whether the Dental Council under section 54 (2) (b) would be able to attach a condition of post examination to a restricted class of work or again to a particular type of patient. The concern is not that of legal responsibility, but of the medical circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Subject to these two reservations, which in a way are linked, I agree with the Minister that to apply post examination to the whole generality of cases is going too far.  There may well be types of work and types of patients in which there should be a restriction and in which the post examination is in the interest of the patient and in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of denturists not being treated in the same way as other auxiliary workers, there has been all along a conflict between the recommendations of the working party and recommendations of the report in regard to restrictive practices.  The Minister has <Col N="319" /> come down clearly and firmly in taking the point of view that trained denturists are a desirable group to be organised in this country for the fitting of dentures for those over 18 years of age.  I notice that he carefully said trained denturists.  In fact, this is the key word.  This reflects our concern on an earlier section.  It is absolutely vital now that the Minister has treated them differently from other auxiliary workers and has removed them from the supervision of registered dentists, that we must have no defect in regard to their training.  It must be so adequate that this particular exclusion is fully justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by Senator Dooge particularly in relation to trained denturists.  That is certainly my wish.  The House will note that under section 54 and section 56 effectively this will be a joint exercise undertaken by the Dental Council and the Minister for Health of the day, whereby the council shall establish a scheme with the consent of the Minister.  The Minister has a reserved power in section 56 where he deems it necessary to exercise a particular role in achieving a particular type of scheme.  It is of critical importance that there be extensive joint co-operation and consultations between the profession and my Department in these development, particularly the approval of the schemes in question.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Dooge, namely, a particular type of patient or type of work, my strong view is that in determining the nature of the dental work a member of a class would undertake, it would be within the power of the council to specify particular types of patients and particular forms of control. I was slightly taken aback when I was assured that there are some 300 known classes of illness which one might suffer from in that regard.  The council will have a major role in this determination, but equally there will be the obligation to have the consent of the Minister for Health of the day so that there is a mutual interaction in the setting up of schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the House will not <Col N="320" /> press me on the question of post certification. That is a non-runner.  Dr. David Barmes, who was quoted several times during this debate, the chief of oral health of the World Health Organisation, has given the opinion that certification of the work of an auxiliary dental worker by a dentist should not be required.  That is the professional advice I have received within my Department as well.  As far as is practicable, and within the alternatives accepted by the Government arising out of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission, we have set up within the framework of this Bill a reasonable development which should go a long way towards concluding the issue.</P>

I accept that it would not be unreasonable to make my powers under the section subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.  The intention of the Senator's amendment is accepted by me.  Following consultation with the parliamentary draftsman, however, I am satisfied <Col N="321" /> that the amendment is incomplete.  I am proposing my amendment in lieu.  If my powers are to be exercised by order then it is necessary to amend subsection (1) and I propose to provide for this.  I must also be given power to amend or revoke an order which I have made.  I would have to have that residual power.  Subsection (2) of my amendment provides for this.  Subsection (3) is the same as subsection (2) proposed by the Senators.</P>

Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are consequential, including this right of annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas. We debated this question on Second Stage.  It is highly desirable that, in regard to orders of this type, when a Minister is ordering a body, which has been established by statute with a certain degree of authority to do something, it is a good policy.  It should be a good settled policy of parliamentary democracy that such acts should be subject to full debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas and should get priority for debate.  If necessary, the Houses of the Oireachtas should express their disagreement on such a particular point with the Minister or indeed with the Government.  I welcome very much the way in which the Minister has met the points on this particular occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am happy with the amendment.  It only marginally improves the position.  Certainly this would be a better Bill without this section.  Much concern has been expressed about it.  Not alone the dental profession, but other professions are looking at what is happening here today in regard to this section, and they are wondering if a precedent will be set for further legislation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few moments ago the Minister moved on from section 55 to this section. He made the point that it would ensure that the council would prepare a particular type of scheme.  In other words, he seemed to me to be suggesting very clearly that he was waving the big stick <Col N="322" /> over this council.  We discussed the composition of this council for quite a long time on section 9.  All the bodies referred to &mdash; the universities, the Royal College of Surgeons, the dental people themselves and the Medical Council &mdash; are extremely concerned, responsible people who have nominated good people to act on the council.  I am sure the Minister's nominees will be excellent people, as will be the nominee of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>If we do not have faith in that council we have nothing.  This section is certainly undermining the council.  It is a vote of no confidence in the council from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  We would be far better off without it.  If they do not perform well and come up to expectations, the Minister might take other action.  This section is a big flaw in the legislation which we have threshed out at length.  It is clearly bad legislation.  It will be a worrying section for the dental profession and other professions in the future.  I intend to oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 56, as amended, I want to make the general point that originally the Irish Dental Association did seek deletion of the section.  They were unhappy about it. Subsequently it was accepted that I should have power to direct the council to establish a particular class of auxiliary worker, but that the power should be made subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.  My current assumption is that that is acceptable to the profession.  I have no reason to believe otherwise.  I accepted the amendment, as proposed here.  It is considered, and I strongly hold the view, that the Minister of the day should have a residual power in the public interest, so that if absolutely nothing happens and no progress can be made, he can issue a direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That direction enables the Minister to direct the council to establish a particular class of auxiliary dental worker for an experimental period also.  The experimental period is probably still strongly opposed, but I hold that that is a necessary part of a possible direction which might be issued.  It is a useful provision to have and it would be exercised only in <Col N="324" /> the rarest of final disputes with the council.  It is necessary that the Minister of the day should have a residual reserved power over the establishment of particular classes of auxiliary dental workers. Otherwise the whole role and thrust of the Bill could be very easily eliminated if a difficult situation arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I would be dishonest if I did not say that section 56 has caused concern to people who are interested in this Bill.  Yesterday the Minister referred to heavy lobbying on this Bill.  We are very fortunate that all of the lobbying is not self-interested lobbying. I would argue that the Department have failed miserably since 1928 in that only £20 million out of £1 billion goes on dental services.  I appreciate that we have used the parliamentary process to the full here, and I compliment the Minister on accepting some amendments.</P>
      <P>However, it is entirely appropriate that we should debate, discuss and amend any Bill.  This section badly needs amendment to protect the community.  Experimental periods in regard to human beings must be capably monitored by the Minister but they should not be readily provided for, and certainly never without the agreement of the Oireachtas.  I would appreciate a full explanation of why we need this section.  I know the Minister has endeavoured to explain it as fully as possible.</P>
      <P>If the council will not discharge their duties, or are not capable, they can be disbanded and the composition of the council can always be changed.  Why should we have an experimental period, and what classes are to be experimented with and what patients?</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few points concerning sections 54, 55 and 56 of Part VII if I may.  Part VII of this Bill is very important, and the sections contained in it have huge financial and service implications, as I indicated yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to make an explicit policy statement on these and related matters at this stage and, if not, to indicate how soon he proposes to present solutions to our health boards and the State-funded services.  Is the Minister <Col N="325" /> going to give the Southern Health Board more money to employ auxiliaries when they are trained or will they join the dole queue?  Will our young dental graduates be able to find jobs in the health boards? It is a fact that at the moment the Minister will not allow more dental surgeons to be recruited for places like Kerry?  There are only 220 dentists to deal with thousands of pre-school and national school children.</P>

      <P>I was in Laois-Offaly recently and I discovered medical cardholders being charged for dentures under the scheme.  I would like the Minister to do something about that.  Can he do anything to eliminate this charge? Extractions only are being offered.  Why do people in other areas have a different scheme?  I would like to make the point that salaried consultants and specialist orthodontists can get more than £22 per hour on a capitation basis.  Is it not a fact that specialist orthodontists are very highly remunerated and the incomes of even senior consultants pale in comparison? Will the Minister personally establish exactly what the future is for orthodontic care?  I think the contribution I made yesterday was a reasonable one.  I would like to appeal to the Minister to be as pragmatic as possible in this area and to be even more flexible in his approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that at the moment the Minister is in need of about 200 more <Col N="326" /> health board dentists at the maximum, as well as auxiliaries?  If he is not prepared to provide more funds, or to direct the health boards to provide more funds, Part VII of this Bill is more or less irrelevant. Will he not consider dental services a priority?  It is time we had a concrete plan explaining the way forward, to borrow a phrase from Senator Honan's party.  Again, there is a danger here that all the money could be soaked up by specialists.  Creating posts of dental auxiliaries and more health board dentists without funds to employ them is not a very productive exercise in my view. We will have to face reality and this applies specially to the Minister.  I was glad yesterday he made reference at the later stage to the points I made on the cost of dental specialists.  I believe in the long run the Minister would be better off to employ auxiliaries, as provided for under this section, rather than have expensive specialists at £32 per hour net to the State.  I am not talking here about consultants who cost half the price of specialists.</P>

      <P>I should like to underline one point made by Senator Deenihan.  One of the words used in subsection (1) of section 56 is unfortunate: I refer to the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;.  I contemplated putting down an amendment but decided not to but rather to raise the point with the Minister here on <Col N="327" /> Committee Stage.  I agree with Senator Deenihan that the use of the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in subsection (1) is unfortunate.  It connotates some memories of the poor law health system, that in fact a certain type of patient is being experimented with.  This is highly undesirable. I ask the Minister would the purpose of the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in section 56 not be equally met if we were to say &ldquo;a limited period&rdquo;?  In fact, the idea of it being a trial, of a judgment being made at the end of the limiting period, is not lost.  It seems to me there are echoes here in the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; that may not help when the Dental Council and the Minister come to formulate their work here.  Those who wish to criticise the scheme will be able to say that here we have the position that new people who are not professional dentists are now being introduced in order to experiment on a certain class of patient. I think it is undesirable that this false impression should be given.  Even that very danger could be avoided if instead of saying the &ldquo;experimental period&rdquo; in this section we said a &ldquo;limited period.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Regarding the general policy questions raised by Senator Deenihan, I hope that when the new council are established in the relatively near future I will then be in a position at that council meeting to make a general policy statement about the future prospects of the profession itself and of the allocation of State resources to this vital area of the delivery of health care in our community.  I think Senator Deenihan would accept that the appropriate place would be at the inaugural meeting of the new council.  I will certainly bear in mind <Col N="328" /> the points he has made in that regard in my approach to the establishment of the council and in respect of the very limited number of nominations I will have to make to that council.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Dooge, I have been looking at the section itself and particularly the use of the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;.  As originally drafted, and working from memory, that is the word used in the UK and it is also used in the working party report.  It is the only section of the Bill as a whole where the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; appears.  I have some qualms about the use of the word. I think the only other possible alternative would be the use of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; and, subject to the agreement of the House and if the Senator would be prepared to move an amendment to that effect, I would be prepared to accept it at this stage.  I have not considered the matter in terms of the parliamentary draftsman but I have checked the Bill and it is the only section where the word appears.  Subject to it being considered again, I am quite sure the words &ldquo;limited period&rdquo; would fit the Bill appropriately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to refer on section 57 to a point I raised yesterday on another section regarding the procedure of the Fitness to Practise Committee.  I raised the point then about the question of a legal assessor who could advise both sides in regards to rules of procedure.  The points I made then might well be taken care of if, in fact, such a legal assessor could be held as coming under the scope of section 57: in other words, section 57 could be interpreted that &ldquo;assisting the council or its committee&rdquo; included a post of this particular type.  If the Minister is able to confirm before the final passing of this Bill that this is so, my points with regard to that would be fully met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the view that it should be possible under this section for the council to engage on a consultancy basis a legal adviser to assist it in discharging its functions.  Whether it would or should have authority to engage a legal assessor as such is another question, but certainly it would have power to engage legal advice at all levels.  I would imagine that the High Court could have a view about the engagement of a legal assessor as being the exercise of a judicial function by the council and that it might be unconstitutional. I hold the view that under sections 56 and 57 it would have authority to engage a legal assessor. Attention has now been drawn to it by Senator Dooge but that point in many respects meets the particular issue raised by the Senator.</P>

It states that the council is required &ldquo;to print, publish and place on sale copies of any register maintained by it at intervals of not more than five years and, in every other year, the Council shall print,...a supplement...&rdquo; It is really a question of wording here.  It seems the clear intention is that in every fifth year there shall be a report and in every other year in the sense of the first, second, third and fourth year they shall issue a supplement.  But the phrase &ldquo;every other year&rdquo; also has the meaning of &ldquo;every alternative year&rdquo;.

      <P>This is a particular provision which exists in the Medical Practitioners Act and I would have to consult with the parliamentary draftsman on the point raised by Senator Dooge.  In that regard, on Report Stage, I could reconsider it but as of now it is a straight translation of the section in the other Act.</P>

      <P>On observation on the question of assignment of the additional functions, the Minister throughout this Bill and on Committee Stage has met the point that it is desirable in a <Col N="332" /> number of instances that decisions of the Minister in regard to the operation of the Dental Council should be subject to annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Having established that, it seems strange that we have in section 61 a simple assignment of extra functions.  After all, we have in this Bill, with its many sections, laid out the functions, we have debated at considerable length the nature of these functions, and their exact scope, but we seem to find here in section 61 that functions other than those in the Bill can be assigned from time to time in regard to dental education and training or other matters.  Is there any reason why this assignment should not be done by order and if the order under which the assignment was made should not like other orders, be subject to annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This effectively is a classic catch-all section which invariably appears in legislation.  While I appreciate the point made by Senator Dooge in relation to the previous section that one should not argue from mere prior statutory authority, nevertheless we are anxious that this particular section should be inserted, but if it would be of assistance to Senator Dooge and to the House in this regard I could, perhaps, consider a provision subject to consultation with the council which would enable the council to have forewarning and an opportunity of considerable discussion with the Minister of the day.  It would be difficult to have an annulment procedure in it, but certainly there should be prior consultation.  I would be somewhat dubious about another annulment procedure in relation to functions, but I could see great merit in a consultation procedure being written in subject to prior consultation between the Minister and the council.  Then additional functions could be assigned from time to time. It is a useful provision because issues may arise which would not be encompassed within the Bill, both within the profession and within the exigencies of day to day Department of Health operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion the <Col N="333" /> Minister made with regard to consultation with the council is a very distinct improvement but I still would be concerned in regard to the question of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a catch-all, but we think it should not only be a catch-all but a tell-all as well.  If, in fact, the Minister is going to broaden the functions here, the Oireachtas should be told at the earliest possible opportunity.  One way in which the Oireachtas can be told, and the most appropriate way, is that the order under which the assignment is done by order, is laid before both Houses and then may be subject to debate.  There is now provision for an annual report by the Dental Council.  Of course, if there were any such assignment, it quite obviously would appear in the next annual report which could then be debated by way of motion in either House of the Oireachtas. But this would tend to lead to a situation where such a debate, if the House desired to make any point, might not take place for 15 months after the actual assignment, whereas it would be much more appropriate if the debate took place within the first month.</P>
      <P>If the Minister reflects on this point between now and Report Stage, he may well find, and I hope he would find, that it would be more in the tone of this Bill as it will leave this House to make the provision in this particular case as he has elsewhere.  After all, the functions of the Dental Council are central to this Bill. To take the Long Title, it is to establish the Dental Council and then to give it certain functions in regard to the practice of dentistry.  If we expand the range of functions it seems we are, in fact, legislating. It is legislation that functions other than those within the Bill are now being assigned.  I would ask the Minister to consider the point.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise again a point that I raised on Second Stage.  That is the possible relationship between the Dental Council or a similar body and our newly established joint committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This provision here makes it a function of the council to advise the Minister, either at his request or on its own initiative, on all matters relating to the functions of the council.  We now have quite a number of joint committees of the two Houses of the Oireachtas who have been examining many aspects of our life in this country and who seek advice and information from many bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in regard to a body like the Dental Council &mdash; and I <Col N="335" /> bring it up now in a general sense &mdash; it might well be that there should be some link.  It may be sufficient to leave it that these committees of the Oireachtas would seek that advice through the Minister and it may well be that if there was good reason for them to seek that advice, this would be the appropriate channel, but I would like to ask the Minister for his comments on this point.  Does he think that this new departure in regard to the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas calls, perhaps not now, for consideration of whether there should be a special relationship in regard to the advisory functions of bodies like the Dental Council?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be averse to such a function being devolved on the council and indeed it is one which I would sympathetically consider in relation to the further assignment of functions done by order rather than making it an intrinsic part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very fair response from the Minister, and it means that as the Dental Council gets into operation and as these committees get further into operation about 12 months or two years from now action might be appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that creates an offence for the making of a false declaration or misrepresentation for the purpose of obtaining registration.  It seems that the section has been drafted in a way which may have the effect of not allowing the purpose of the section to be effected.  I refer in particular to subsection (2) which allows a prosecution to be instituted by way of summary summons. It seems that that can only be done if the summons is issued within six months of the committing of the offence.  By virtue of the nature of the offence it would <Col N="336" /> appear that the offence as created by section 67 (1) is committed when the false declaration is made.  It is not a continuing offence of being registered at a particular time by virtue of misrepresentation or by virtue of a false declaration.  As such it would appear to me that if somebody is, for instance, registered by virtue of a false declaration on 1 January and if the matter is not detected until 2 July a six month period will have passed and by virtue of subsection (2) which is the subsection which gives the power to prosecute, a prosecution by way of summons cannot be instituted.  For that reason I wonder would the Minister consider on Report Stage introducing an amendment to provide for an additional subsection similar to subsection (4), section 52, which extends the six month period prescribed by the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, to allow the institution of proceedings in a summary manner to be extended for a two-year period?  I think if that were done and particularly by virtue of the nature of the offence which this section creates &mdash; it is an offence that is not easily detectable &mdash;it would be more effective.</P>
      <P>The question of the £800 fine was raised yesterday.  Why is the £800 level maintained?  I accept that there are constitutional reasons why one cannot prosecute summarily and have a fine of an excessive nature.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in the debate in the Dáil on the Copyright Bill agreed to extend the fines for prosecution under section 27 of the 1963 Copyright Act from £800 to £1,000.  I think that amendment was accepted by the Minister in the Dáil only a few weeks ago and I cannot see why the same level of fine could not be provided for with regard to offences created under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Durcan has, appropriately, brought a particular point to light in relation to section 67.  Certainly I did provide in relation to the illegal practice of dentistry in section 52 (4) for the full two year extension period.  On Report Stage I will consider whether in regard to section 67, relating to false declaration or misrepresentation for the purposes <Col N="337" /> of obtaining registration, whether in fact the extended period should be given there as well.  I think the point has been well made.  It may require reference back of the Bill and I will consider the matter on Report Stage.  In relation to the £800 fine, this particular Bill has been gestating for about eight years and is major legislation.  The general advice I received from the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General was in relation to the £800.  I will talk to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism about his £1,000 and I will review the matter on Report Stage. I am assured that the maximum permissible on summary conviction is £800.  I will have that matter checked before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendments 34 and 35 to Article 7 of the First Schedule are concerned with the question of what is an appropriate quorum for a meeting of the council.  This council are being given very important functions.  It seemed to me that in fact the quorum was somewhat low.  The membership of the council is 19.  It seems to me that the sort of general rule of quorum that it should be at least one third of the membership, which applies in many cases, might well be applied in this case.  If you divide 19 by three you get 6? so rather than have six people and a ghost I suggest that we should make the quorum seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 is concerned with the special quorum in the case where the <Col N="338" /> council are acting in the matter of the suspension of a registered dentist from the register.  This is a decision in regard to a person's professional livelihood.  It is a most serious decision.  As we know, it is a decision which the courts watch with very great care to ensure that all the rights of natural justice are allowed for.  If somebody is to be suspended and to be removed from the dental register that should be done by a clear majority of the members of the council.  I think it would be inappropriate if a minority of the members of the council could meet and decide such a matter.  I would suggest that the special quorum should be ten, a simple majority of the membership.</P>

This seems to be relatively short notice for an important body, the items on the agenda at every meeting could be serious matters.  There is a special point here, which was made by the Irish Dental Association, that in the event of a calling of a meeting those practising dentists who are members of the council might find some difficulty in re-arranging their appointments or their professional duties.  On the other hand, we do not want to go too far in the other direction, because there may well be a necessity to summon a meeting in order to deal rapidly with some particular important point.  We have put forward eight days' notice as a compromise between these two conflicting claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to strengthen and expand the protection given under the Copyright Act, 1963 to copyright owners against infringement of their works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copyright protects literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works against unauthorised copying or pirating.  This protection extends to sound recordings, cinematograph films and broadcasting by virtue of sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Act of 1963.  Section 27 of the Act contains <Col N="342" /> provisions about seizure and search for infringing copies of copyright works and creates offences, subject to penal sanctions, in respect of dealing in infringing copies of a work.  It is now accepted that the existing deterrent provisions in the law are not adequate to cope with the proliferation of technological advances which have resulted in an alarming increase in piracy of copyright works.  For this reason, some amendment of the 1963 legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Under section 27 (1) the making for sale or hire, the selling or letting for hire, the offering or exposing for sale or hire by way of trade, the public exhibition or the importation &mdash; except for private and domestic use &mdash; of any articles known to be an infringing copy of a work in which copyright subsists constitute an offence. Because of the possibility under this subsection, as it stands, that an offence might not be committed by a trader who possesses infringing copies with the intention of selling or hiring them, but had them stored in a part of his shop out of the general public view, I propose to have the subsection amended to remove any doubt that possession for sale or hire of an infringing work is a punishable offence. This is catered for in the new substitute subsection (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The substitute subsection (5) covers a number of points.  It strengthens the procedures relating to entry upon and search of premises for infringing works or plates by the substitution of a district justice for the District Court as the source from whom search warrants can now be issued to any member of the Garda Síochána to enter premises and seize infringing articles at any time of the day or night.  The existing legislation restricts the grant of the search warrant to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector and confines the search to the hours 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.  The substituted subsection (5) will also encompass the offence in subsection (8) &mdash; a subsection which itself is being amended to make it more comprehensive &mdash; and it will now be possible for the Garda to enter premises where an infringing performance of a copyright work is taking place in public.</P>
    <P>The substitute subsection (8) in the <Col N="343" /> amending Bill contains a new provision relating to the showing of a cinematograph film in public.  The original subsection only created an offence in regard to causing the performance in public, without approval, of literary, dramatic or musical works.  I have now inserted, as an additional ground of offence, the showing of a cinematograph film in which copyright exists, without the copyright owner's permission.  This is intended, for example, to make the showing of an infringing video film in a public house an offence under the law.</P>
    <P>The penalties provided in subsection (9) of section 27 of the Act for the offences of making, sale, hire, trade exhibition and importation of infringing copies, as well as the offence of distribution of such material, are, on first conviction, a £5 fine for each infringing article and, on subsequent convictions, the same fine or six months imprisonment, subject to a maximum fine of £100 in respect of articles comprised in the same transaction. The substitute subsection (9) in the Bill increases the amount of the fines of £5 and £100 and £100 and £1,000 respectively. The Bill also provides for the imposition, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, of a six months term of imprisonment as an alternative to or in addition to the new fine.  This is an added deterrent as the existing legislation only permits a fine or term of imprisonment.  These new penalties will now also apply to the new offence of possessing for trade purposes an infringing copy of a copyright work.</P>
    <P>In the case of offences relating to the making of, or possessing, a plate for making infringing copies, or the causing of an infringing performance of a work to be given in public, the existing penalties are, on first conviction, a fine of £100 and, on subsequent convictions, the same fine or six months imprisonment.  Under the substituted subsection (10) in the Bill, the £100 fine is being increased to £1,000 and again I am providing for the added deterrent of the six months term of imprisonment as an alternative to or in addition to the increased fine.  The new penalties in subsection (10) will now also apply in the cases of conviction for the offence of <Col N="344" /> the showing in public or an infringing copy of a cinematograph film.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the illegal screening of video films in Ireland in recent times.  The video pirates are able to procure pre-recorded cassettes of prominent films before their general release for public showing in cinemas. This can lead to distribution throughout the State of films on illegal video tapes for showing in such places as public houses and hotels, without any financial reward to the producers of the films or their authorised agents.  Cinema owners, having spent money on advance advertising of forthcoming film showings, have their business and commercial acumen thwarted by the activities of the video pirates.  In rural areas particularly, these pirates take advantage of the local interest engendered by the advertising by arranging for pre-cinema performances to the local community in non-cinema premises.  These illicit practices are resulting in the closure of many cinemas throughout the country at the present time with consequential loss of employment for workers.</P>
    <P>The growth in the production of illegal tapes is also a matter of concern to video dealers who have acquired the right to sell video tapes of cinema films.  The State is also a considerable loser as the trafficking in illegal videos deprives the Exchequer of VAT or corporation tax.  Legitimate business interests see the illegal operators making huge profits on the sale of video tapes, many of which are of a quality inferior to the original works produced with great care and effort, and with a high degree of artistic merit.</P>
    <P>The new provisions which I have outlined will give copyright owners the additional protection they require today in safeguarding their legitimate interests.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to mention for the information of the House that I undertook during the Final Stage of the Bill in the Dáil to have another look at section 27 (4) of the basic Act since it appears that the powers of seizure of infringing copies provided for in that subsection do not extend to infringing copies hired by mobile dealers.  In view of the growth in the trade in hiring of <Col N="345" /> videos, particularly that engaged in by mobile operators, I propose to introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage in this House to put the possibility of seizure of hired infringing copies by mobile operators beyond doubt.  I shall circulate the amendment, together with a few other more minor technical amendments, in advance of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention also that I have recently received representations about a further amendment which might now be made in copyright law.  If, following detailed examination of the proposal, including its legal implications, it is considered appropriate to proceed, I shall also circulate that proposed amendment in advance of Committee Stage in this House.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will deal in an adequate way with the ever-growing problem of piracy.  The operation carried on by the producers of illegal tapes and videos in Ireland has escalated to an alarming extent, and I am sure the Members of this House must realise that to date the authorities have made little impact, with the means at their disposal, on what I consider a major national problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the imposition, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, of a six months term of imprisonment as an alternative to or an addition to the new fine.  This should act as an added deterrent.  While video piracy does not operate to a very large degree in the major reputable stores it can be truly said that a large portion of the stock of the smaller outfits in the country is, in fact, pirate material.  Whether they are aware of it or not I do not know.  I would say this is a correct summary of the trade as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pirating of major feature films, which the Minister mentioned, has certainly added to the problem.  We all know that the cinema trade has gone through a very traumatic period over the last number of years.  It is experiencing very difficult times at the moment.  There is a <Col N="346" /> fall-off in cinema receipts, cinemas are closing down, and I believe the problem there is due, in part if not in whole, to the operation of video piracy.  We have endeavoured over the years, as I am sure, the Minister is well aware, to provide a national film industry with the help of State subvention.  We must all recognise that we did not progress as well as we had hoped in this field.  If video piracy is allowed to continue in its present form we may totally abandon the whole concept of ever having a nation film industry in this country.  I am certainly supporting the Bill with regard to this.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious aspect which is surfacing more prominently day by day with regard to the production, sale and distribution of videos.  We should, in this House, discuss fully the problem of video nasties.  It is an ever growing problem, and I would suggest that we should take it on ourselves, in the moral interest of the people, to see how we can deal with the terrible problem of video nasties.  I know a Private Members' Bill was introduced in the House of Commons regarding video nasties. I am aware of what the outcome of the Bill was.  It got wide coverage, and people who were invited by the particular Member of the House of Commons to look at some of the video nasties he had were appalled that such filth and dirt could be propagated and widely distributed in England.  We must ensure this does not happen in this country.  The producers of video nasties &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think video nasties come under this Bill.  It is more a matter for the Department of Justice.  I do not mind you making a reference to it but I do not want it developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop it, but when we are discussing the sale and distribution of videos I would like the Minister &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that very <Col N="347" /> much.  We should look into this whole area and ask the Minister for Justice what steps he is taking to protect young, innocent people and indeed older people with regard to video nasties.</P>
      <P>I have always been concerned about outside influences dominating the thinking and the attitudes of our people.  Happily we are not affected to a very large degree because we have some control over our television and the media, but if video nasties are allowed to be pirated in the way that ordinary films are being pirated in this country we will have a very serious problem to deal with.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to have a further look at a certain section of the Copyright Bill which I fail to understand. We have still in operation an Act, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, which enables the Performing Rights Society to place enormous demands on a certain section of the community.  Whether for business reasons or not there is a certain section of the community, for example, those who run public houses and hotels, who have played a tremendous part in promoting the tourist industry in this country by providing traditional music in their business premises.  These people are subjected to demands for huge sums of money by the Performing Rights Society. We got an assurance from the Minister, Deputy Moynihan, that he would look into this and come back to this House with it.  If this section of the Act is not amended these people will, and many of them have already done so, cease to promote traditional music and dancing in their premises.  That would have a serious detrimental effect on the tourist industry. I do not understand how, under the Act, levies can be placed on proprietors for copyright of traditional music.  I play traditional music and I know something about it.  There is no way they can trace the author of the tune involved and I think it is ridiculous and I would ask the Minister to have another look at that.</P>
      <P>There are a few sections in this Bill that I am not totally happy about and perhaps we will deal with them on Committee Stage.  One to which I refer is section 1 (8) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> Any person who after the commencement of this section causes a literary, dramatic or musical work to be performed in public, ...shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his brief that it referred to public performances but have we defined &ldquo;public&rdquo;?  How far have we gone in dealing with the real problem or are we infringing on the privacy of people's homes?  These are questions I would like the Minister to clarify on the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the main purpose of the Bill is to increase the penalties and to plug some loopholes in section 27 of the Copyright Act, 1963.  In that sense, of course, the Bill has quite a narrow scope. Nevertheless, I think it is quite appropriate that we should look at a number of aspects of copyright.  There have been major developments over the past 20 years, since the passage of the Principal Act in 1963, which have had quite an extraordinary effect on the problem of the protection of copyright.  The 1963 Act has, by and large, stood the test of time but I think we should take the opportunity of this amending Act to assure ourselves that we are not going to, within the next few years, run into either a continuation of our present difficulties or a serious aggravation of them or else be beset by new difficulties.</P>
      <P>The law of copyright that we enacted in 1963 embodied the principles of copyright law which had not changed very much since Renaissance or Tudor times. In other words, copyright law, as it was known, largely developed after the invention of printing and the widespread dissemination of printed works.  We have had in relation to such processes as xeroxing and the production of videos a technological revolution that is in many ways as remarkable as the invention of printing and certainly has had as serious an effect on the protection of copyright as had the invention of printing.  It certainly behoves us to take a good look at the Act which the Minister seeks to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> I regret that we have not had from the Minister a statement of how he sees the situation today.  He has indicated that it is necessary to increase penalties, it is necessary to close off some of the loopholes. It is not possible for a legislator approaching this Bill to find the information which would tell him what is the present situation.  We do not find it in the report of the Controller of Industrial Property, as far as I know, I had not had a chance to examine it in detail.  If there is a source such as that I would be glad if the Minister could draw our attention to it.</P>
    <P>We are facing a serious problem.  We have, since we were established as a State, a good record in regard to copyright. We adhere to the International Conventions and we are a member of the Berne Union of 1886.  It might be of interest to the House to know that if we go to the international centre for copyright in Geneva we will find an interesting exhibit there in regard to Irish copyright. Geneva, which is the European centre of the United Nations, has a number of striking UN buildings.  One of the most modern and one of the most striking is the building of the organisation known as WIPO.  If Members find it difficult to understand what WIPO is, the French acronym OMPI is probably not much more helpful.  It is the world intellectual property organisation which is concerned with patents, with copyright etc.  I found it of great interest that in the entrance hall to this particular body there is a large exhibit headed &ldquo;Irish Copyright from the Sixth Century&rdquo;.  This international organisation displays there as an indication of the antiquity of copyright, the particular story of the Psalter of St. Finnian which was surreptitiously copied by St. Colmcille.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that the arguments that were used on that occasion, and the Irish manuscript is reproduced there together with the transliteration of the ancient Irish and its translation into modern languages.  The arguments that were used between Finnian and Colmcille in the sixth century are the arguments that <Col N="350" /> are still used today between those who feel, as Senator Lynch has said, that the restrictions of the Performing Rights Society are unduly restrictive and those who say quite simply that breaches of this type are thefts of property.  I ask the House to bear with me when I quote from the account of the paper by Lawlor in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy for 1916 discussing the Cathach of St. Columba.  This is the earliest example of Irish writing we have.  It is a manuscript that rivals in value the Book of Kells.  I will read from part of the story and I now quote:</P>
    <P>When Finnian discovered that his book had been copied without his permission, he went to reprove Colum Cille, and said he has acted wrongly in transcribing his book without permission. &ldquo;I shall appeal to the King of Ireland, viz., Diarmaid mac Cerbuill, for judgement,&rdquo; says Colum Cille.  &ldquo;I shall agree to that,&rdquo; says Finnian.  They then proceeded together to Tara of the Kings where Diarmaid mac Cerbuill resided.  Finnian pleaded his case first to the King as follows: &ldquo;Colum Cille transcribed my book without my knowledge,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I maintain that the transcript belongs to me.&rdquo;&ldquo;I hold,&rdquo; says Colum Cille, &ldquo;that Finnian's book has not decreased in value because of the transcript I have made from it, and that it is not right to extinguish the divine things it contained, or to prevent me or anybody else from copying it, or reading it, or from circulating it throughout the provinces.  I further maintain that if I benefited by its transcription, which I desired to be for the general good, provided no injury accrues to Finnian or his book thereby, it was quite permissible for me to copy it.&rdquo;  Then Diarmaid declared the famous judgment, to wit, &ldquo;to every cow, her offspring&rdquo;&mdash; that is, her calf &ldquo;and to every book its transcript,&rdquo; (le gach leabhar a leabrán).</P>
    <P>This was the judgment in 6th century Tara.  We are now engaged, as it were, on the latest piece of Irish ajudication on these matters in which the argument is still run in very much the same way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> When we look at the proposals the Minister has brought before us here I think we can take them all as being reasonable.  There is undoubtedly a need to increase penalties.  There has been in this country in recent years an absolute epidemic of breach of copyrights.  A very substantial effort is needed in order to maintain to any degree the operation of the law in this respect.  It needs detective work and police work of the highest possible calibre in order to be able to trace down these pirates who are operating.  It is utterly simple to make back-to-back copies of videos, films or tapes.  The 1963 Act talks about the offences of having a plate in your possession.  You do not need now, for the piracy of copyright, to have anything like a photographic plate in your possession, it is so simple.  My worry would be whether in fact the deterrent which is in the amending Bill and whether amendments that are made in order to improve section 27 of the 1963 Act are adequate.  As we go forward from today we will see nothing but improvement in the technology of copying, something which will make piracy easier and easier as the years pass.  We must be sure that we are able to cope with this.</P>
    <P>First, we should distinguish, as Senator Lynch said, between the act of the pirate who is in this illegal business and the situation of certain people who find themselves in difficulty with the Performing Rights Society.  If we use the term &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; to describe what these copiers are doing, I think we can equate that to the old fashioned piracy on the high seas. The comparison of the situation which Senator Lynch was talking about, is not with piracy, it is more like being willing to take a glass of imported brandy on which the excise duty has not been paid. They are offences of quite a different nature.  I am glad to see that in the Bill before us that there is a distinction between the new subsection (9) and the new subsection (10) where there is a recognition that different penalties are called for in regard to, on the one hand, an offence in the form of piracy, in the form of film or video piracy and the more simple appropriation for a short period of somebody's property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> As I said at the beginning, I would have been happier if the Minister had been able to give us a full review of the situation because there are other aspects of the 1963 Act which could well be looked at.  We have had, under this Act, as far as I understand and I would be glad to be corrected, only one set of regulations made.  The only one I have ever seen referred to was Statutory Instrument 180 of 1964.  I would be glad to know if there are others.  It seems that there are a number of areas in regard to unpublished material which give rise to great difficulty in regard to copyright. Great difficulties arise with the passage of unpublished material by inheritance when this material is subsequently published. Our law under the 1963 Act and under the Statutory Instrument of 1964 is better than in some other countries.  I still think there are difficulties which could well be looked at.  There are difficulties in regard to the law on the question of the copyright in letters.  It seems to have become quite a fashion recently for the publication of letters.  I would be very glad to have a detailed assurance in regard to this point.  There are difficulties in regard to the copyright on archives. The Society of Irish Archivists are very concerned on this point.  It may well be that this aspect could be covered in legislation in regard to the national archives, which we understand, is under preparation at the moment.  There are also a number of difficulties in regard to copyright in photographs.  These are all matters of great difficulty in copyright apart from the main problem of piracy using modern technological aids.  It would be helpful if we had either on the occasion of the passing of this Bill or on some other occasion a full statement from the Minister.  With those reservations I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put forward some observations and views on the Bill which is now before the House.  I want to begin by making a few general observations.  In reading and listening to the Minister's speech today and comparing it with the Minister's speech on Second Stage in the <Col N="353" /> other House, it is now very clear that a change has taken place in the approach to the question of this Bill and to the question of the Copyright Act, 1963, because when the matter was discussed in the Dáil &mdash; and it was not a very lengthy discussion &mdash; the focus of that discussion and the focus of the Bill as it then stood was to deal with one specific problem, and that was the question of the copyright piracy of video cassettes and films.  But now reading the Minister's speech this afternoon it is quite evident that there is some change of view in relation to that narrow aspect of it which was presented to the Dáil and there is a willingness which I welcome to look at other aspects of copyright law.  In fact, we have now at least reached the situation when there is a willingness to incorporate at least four amendments, if not more, reflecting certain interests that have been expressed since the presentation of the Bill to the Dáil.  One amendment has already been incorporated, and that was a Ministerial or Government amendment in response to a suggestion by the Opposition spokesman in the Dáil, and it related to the increase in the level of fines.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's speech he has said that he proposes to introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage in this House in relation to the seizure of hired infringed copies from mobile operators. He will circulate that amendment together with more minor technical amendments.  Later, he referred to the fact that he has received representations about a still further amendment and that consideration is being given to the inclusion of that amendment at a further stage. That is a development I welcome, because in the course of my remarks this afternoon I shall be advancing the case as to why the Minister might consider some additional amendments, or at least one &mdash; I sincerely hope he will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before passing from the content of the Minister's speech there is one other aspect of it on which I would like to comment.  In the discussion in the Dáil the focus of the Bill and the focus of the discussion was on one narrow issue, and that was in relation to pirating of copyright <Col N="354" /> material on video cassettes.  In that debate &mdash; I have a copy of it with me and also a copy of the Committee Stage debate &mdash; the pirates were very clearly identified as the nasties or baddies.  Perhaps I am sensitive because I happen to be a publican but today we find that there are now three categories of baddies. There are the pirates and lumped in with them are the hotel proprietors and the publicans.  In the Minister's speech it is said: &ldquo;this can lead to distribution throughout the State of films on illegal video tapes which are shown in such places as public houses and hotels.&rdquo; There is an implication there that some 11,400 public houses in this country are engaged in this practice.  I would reject that idea.  I cannot speak with any great knowledge about what is happening in the hotel scene but I doubt, and indeed I question, if to any degree this practice is widespread there.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for identifying these other two categories of supposed baddies now and lumping them in with the pirates; it was not done in the Dáil and I do not think it should be done here.</P>
    <P>From my experience of this scene I believe that the major market for these particular pirated films, videos, cassettes and so on are private homes, and let us face the reality of that scene.  Having said that, I do welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  Indeed as far as the basic object of the Bill in dealing with pirating is concerned I totally and fully support it.  Particularly the pirating of videos and the pirating of prominent films and the advance showing of these whether in private homes or elsewhere is a practice I unreservedly condemn.  In so far as the penalties and the proposals in this Bill are related to dealing with that particular practice I fully support them.</P>
    <P>There are other implications in regard to the proposed changes here and in regard to the effects of the Bill.  These I propose to deal with later.  I accept that substantial damage is being done to the film industry; substantial damage is being done in the cinema scene and where the proprietors and owners of cinemas are concerned.  Thirdly, the film distribution industry has been severely affected by <Col N="355" /> the sale and availability of the work of the film pirates.  I accept that the copying &mdash; and we must recognise that it is a relatively simple procedure to copy &mdash; is widespread and fortunes are being made from this and it is a thriving backstreet industry.  We must also recognise that with technological advance, the capacity to copy films and the machinery and equipment to copy films are available today in thousands of private homes throughout this country.  Many of the pirates are making fortunes in this industry and they are making fortunes from the talents and the achievements of some of the finest producers, artists and actors of our time.  I welcome the response of the Minister to the call by the film industry to take appropriate steps here, and I feel that the steps being taken here will indeed have the desired effect and that we will have a result that will be satisfactory to all concerned.  There are dangers in certain aspects of what is being proposed here, and these I will try to illustrate later on.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to refer to another aspect of the matter, and I can assure you, a Chathaoirligh, that it will be a brief reference because I am conscious of the fact that Senator Lynch was not permitted to proceed too far.  It would appear from what I have been told that the major demand for a lot of these private films is for the nasty or objectionable ones.  Perhaps it is a reflection on our society, but many of the pirated films which are in most demand from my knowledge of the scene are those that in normal circumstances would be banned. They are trashy films; they are films that elevate violence, sex, murder and they project a lifestyle that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am raising this is that I feel that this type of film constitutes a major proportion of the business we are concerned with here.  I will conclude by saying that I am concerned, as indeed all of us are, at the effect that these particular films are having on the morality and the standards of our young people.</P>
      <P>I welcome with some reservations the Minister's response to the representations that undoubtedly have been made to him.  I welcome his willingness to respond where a need is identified.  I propose to identify as best I can an area of weakness and an area of need that I feel may well arise as a result of the passage of this piece of legislation in its present form.  I am doing this because I want to encourage the Minister to deal with the situation that I am worried about.  I am doing it because I feel that we have an obligation to ensure that whatever legislation emerges from either House of the Oireachtas will not create a disadvantage for any particular section, an unjustified disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has concentrated &mdash; or certainly in the other House it did &mdash; on the need and the necessity of coping with video piracy.  What I am concerned about, especially in relation to subsection (8) where we say that any person who after the commencement of this section causes a literary, dramatic or musical work to be performed in public, or a cinematograph film to be shown, knowing that copyright subsists in the work or in the film and that the performance or showing constitutes an infringment of the copyright, shall be guilty of an offence under the subsection.  While the Minister undoubtedly is setting out to catch the video pirates the net that will be cast from the implementation of that section as it stands will catch a lot of other people and a lot of other premises that I do not think it is the intention of the Minister to catch at this time.  It is for that reason that we have a duty to examine who will be affected by the passage of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister certainly in the Second Stage speech in the Dáil said that &mdash; I <Col N="357" /> take it that I am at liberty to quote from the Dáil speech?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is at column 371 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of 22 February 1984: It is the third paragraph.</P>
      <P>The increased penalties contained in this Bill will strengthen the hand of legitimate interests in protecting their rights and accordingly I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Could I also make the point that the Minister said in his address to the Dáil &mdash; I am not sure if it is in the Minister's speech &mdash; that copyright is protected by both civil and criminal law and that while for the most part the obligation to protect the copyright owners is exercised through civil law, the Minister in the Dail is clearly stating that he is reinforcing that situation by this Bill which more or less deals with the criminal aspect of the situation? Therefore I feel it is necessary for us to examine how the protection of rights of copyright owners has been exercised since the passage of the 1963 Act 21 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a fundamental principle of any law is that reasonable balance has always to be held between competing interests.  You cannot go on strengthening the hand or the position of one particular interest if that involves the erosion of the rights of another interest at the other side of the scale.  The experience of 21 years has meant that while the rights of copyright owners have been reasonably well protected over that period &mdash; and the effect of the 1963 legislation has been to do that &mdash; we will indeed be copper fastening and strengthening it in this legislation, the situation of the other side of the scale, and this was part of the problem with Senator Lynch earlier on, is that right which that Act intended to confer on the users of copyright material has been almost totally eroded by events in that period.  It was certainly not the intention of the 1963 Act that that should happen.  It was not the intention of the Oireachtas at that time, in the debate <Col N="358" /> that took place during the passage of that Act, that that erosion would take place. Indeed provision was made in Part V of the 1963 Act to balance, if you like by Party V, the rights of users as against the rights of the owners of copyright on the other side.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that the provisions of the 1963 Act &mdash; and a lot of it hinges on the amendments that are proposed here &mdash; as far as I know have been so manipulated by organisations representing copyright owners that the protection that was intended to be provided in Part V has in fact been eroded and is now virtually worthless.  That is one of the aspects of this situation that I am going to be asking the Minister to look at.  I welcome his readiness to look at other weaknesses, and therefore I am saying that now is the opportunity of looking at that and if amendments are necessary.  I am of course long enough here to realise that a ministerial amendment or a willingness on the part of the Minister to amend legislation is always far more effective than an attempt on the part of a backbencher to do it.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the light of these remarks and other aspects of the situation that I shall now proceed to discuss the Minister will recognise the validity on the case I am making.  Basically what I am saying is that we now must exercise the greatest care that what we are doing here particularly in subsection (8) does not copper-fasten the imbalance and the injustice that is now, as far as I am concerned and I am sure other Members of the House will bear me out on this, fairly widespread. There is a danger that this subsection as it stands will catch far more than it has been the intention of the Minister and the intention of the House to catch.  Part of the greatest problem in all of this is the question of being performed in public.  The 1963 Act is silent as far as what a public place is and so is this 1984 Bill.  Because the 1963 Act is silent, as I say, in not defining what a public place is, a host of people and places find that they are caught by demands from organisations representing copyright owners for royalties and licence fees in connection with the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> We as the Oireachtas have failed to define what a public place is, but as far as one of these organisations is concerned, the Performing Rights Society, they have found no difficulty.  They state that anywhere outside the family circle is a public place.  I want to give one example.  Again, I am going to quote the publican in this case.  He has equal relevance to a shopkeeper or any other businessman.  If the access door between your place of business and your sitting-room is open and, if a television set is visible, or if a radio can be heard from your sittingroom by the people in the public part of your premises, that is deemed a performance in public and royalties and licence fees are demanded.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 cinemas, clubs, commercial dancehalls, holiday camps, caravan parks, hotel restaurants and cafes had to have individual work licences.  Not very far from where I live there is a craft shop. The owner is the only person working there.  He has a radio.  The shop is deemed a public place and is subject to royalties.  Juke boxes, local authorities, non-commercial halls, popular concerts and variety shows, public houses, shop stores, transport, taxis, minibuses and miscellaneous &mdash; which covers a multitude &mdash; are deemed by the organisations representing the owners of copyright material as public places.  From these public places these organisations have extracted royalties and licence fees on the strength of High Court writs.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister said the increased penalties will strengthen the hand of legitimate interests in protecting their rights.  We will be strengthening the hands of people to collect royalties, money and fees without providing a balance on the other side in regard to the legitimacy of these demands in any given situation.  I regard it as possible and very likely that what is proposed in subsection (8) will apply to a range of activities which are by no means connected with the piracy of films.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider excluding from the increased penalties, but not from all the penalties, anything other than the pirating of films.  We have been told that is the object of the exercise we <Col N="360" /> are engaged in.  The list I read out is not by any means exhaustive because &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; covers a host of other things. It covers local parish events, sports, regattas, carnivals and gymkhanas.  All these in the smallest parishes throughout rural Ireland have been faced with demands for the payment of royalties to organisations representing the owners of copyright music.  They had no opportunity to argue their case or attempt to define whether or not liability existed. Payment was extracted on the basis of High Court writs.</P>
    <P>It is not the Minister's intention and it certainly is not mine to criminalise the organisers of these events or the owners of many of the premises I have mentioned by imposing a fine of £1,000 or six months in jail.  We need to ensure that this Bill does not pass through this House as an open-ended measure.  If we pass this Bill in its present form and, in particular, subsection (8) &mdash; and I say this from past experience &mdash; it will be used by the owners of copyright material to extract from the sources and the outlets I have mentioned royalties, fees, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I want to illustrate one example of the methods which are used to extract these royalties so that the Minister will be quite clear that there is validity in the point I am making in regard to subsection (8) and the use to which it may be put.  The usual approach is that organisers of the event are called upon and told they must pay royalties, or they must get a licence from a particular organisation.  Irrespective of how the request is made they will not be told whether or not the material they are using is copyright or non-copyright, and that is essential.  There is a great deal of non-copyright material.</P>
    <P>I am sure the vast bulk of traditional music heard in Senator Lynch's establishment is non-copyright material.  They are called upon.  They are not told what is copyright and what is non-copyright. There is no discussion or debate.  No justification is given.  It is just a straightforward demand.  If they refuse to pay, a few days later a registered letter comes in the post containing a threat of a High Court action.  Included are selected extracts from High Court judgment in favour of <Col N="361" /> the organisation.  If there is still no response, within days a High Court writ is issued.  I have spoken of selected extracts from High Court judgments.  I have no doubt that if this Bill is passed another insert in the letter will be a copy of subsection (8) and the penalties that attach to it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I appear to hog this debate to some extent.  The Copyright Act, 1963 &mdash; and I make this statement advisedly &mdash; has become a blank cheque for the organisations representing copyright owners.  It enables them to extract substantial sums through the methods I have mentioned.  From one group in 1981, the total amount extracted in royalties and licence fees was £4.5 million and 94 per cent of that money left this island.  The address of the organisation in that particular case is 29-33 Berners Street, London WIP4AA.  The principal organisation representing copyright owners in this country is a British based organisation.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a further point with the Minister.  In the debate on the Copyright Act, 1963, three Deputies concentrated substantially on it.  They were the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Jack Lynch, later Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, later Taoiseach, and Mr. Declan Costello, who is now a High Court judge. One thing which was obvious during the lengthy debate in 1963 was the concern of the people involved in the debate to ensure that there would be a balance and fair play in the legislation that would emerge.  They were seriously concerned that a monopoly position should not develop where the owners of copyright material were concerned.  They were at pains to stress that, if a monopoly situation developed, the Oireachtas would be prepared to take steps to cope with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that a monopoly situation has developed both for licensing and the performance of copyright material.  Organisations representing the owners set their own charges, which are excessive in many cases and indiscriminate.  They are self-appointed bodies.  Their decisions are arbitrary. There is no input on the part of users. They act in a judicial capacity.  There is <Col N="362" /> no right of appeal against their decisions by the affected interests.  In view of the fact that they act in a judicial capacity, that they are a monopoly that there is no right of appeal against their decisions, a major constitutional issue is raised.</P>
    <P>I have no intention whatsoever of adding another piece of equipment to an armoury already used ruthlessly against people who are quite defenceless.  Senator Lynch may have an interest in what I am about to say.  I was asked some time ago to make representations on behalf of a certain person whose name I will not mention.  He is in his middle fifties and he has a strong attachment to everything that is good in our history and traditions. He has a piano on his premises and he plays it just for the love of it.  His preference in music is for Moore's melodies and traditional Irish music, all of which he believes is non-copyright material.  He was approached by one of these organisations. He offered to pay them a reasonable fee just in case he was infringing the copyright of anybody.  He listed the music he plays and sings on his premises and asked them if this music was copyright or non-copyright materials and they refused to say.</P>
    <P>I was asked to make representations on his behalf.  This will lead me to the uselessness of Part V of the 1963 Act. However, in the course of my efforts to ensure that this man got justice, a High Court writ was sent to him.  Being a timid man, he paid up.  He was also informed by the people who visited him that, if he did not pay up, they would get an injunction against him, that the Garda would arrest him and close down his premises. That is blackmail.  It is the kind of blackmail that I am not prepared to see reinforced &mdash; if there is a danger that it would be reinforced &mdash; by the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to talk briefly about the protection that is supposed to exist in Part V of the Copyright Act, 1963.  If this protection was effective, and if the intention of the Oireachtas when debating Part V was realisable, it would not be necessary for me to be making the arguments which I am making.  It does not provide the protection which it was intended to provide. <Col N="363" /> In sections 31, 32, 33 and 34, there was an adequate opportunity to protect the interests of the people I am concerned about.</P>
    <P>As reported in the Official Report of 14 February 1963 at column 1466, Deputy Lynch, Minister for Industry and Commerce, in replying to an argument by Deputy Declan Costello said:</P>
    <P>Where there is a reasonable dispute between the groups representing the copyright owners and the users about the terms of a scheme, common sense requires that the dispute be determined by the Controller on the basis of what he considers reasonable.  There should be no limit to the right to bring such matters before the Controller and in drafting the section, we are following, in effect, the British law.</P>
    <P>There was a proposal by the Government at that time that there should be an appeal body known as the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property.  In Britain the appeal machinery is exercised by a tribunal.  There was an argument as to whether we should also have a tribunal. It was accepted that the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property would fulfil the functions a tribunal was fulfilling in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have had the frustrating experience of contacting this office and being told repeatedly that they do not deal with private cases, that they deal only with representations from an organisation representing the users of copyright material. I requested an organisation of users to contact them and, in the course of a reply, we were told there is provision under section 32 of the Act for reference of a licence scheme to the controller where a dispute arises with respect to a scheme between the licensing body and the organisation claiming to be representative of persons requiring licences under the scheme.  However, if a dispute arises about charges, it would appear that the price control legislation is the vehicle through which a dispute should be pursued. This is another aspect of it.  I was told very clearly that, despite my representations, individual cases were not <Col N="364" /> dealt with by this office.  Section 34, subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>(4) Any person who claims that he requires a licence in a case not covered by a licence scheme, and either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that a licensing body have refused or failed to grant the licence, or to procure the grant thereof, and that in the circumstances it is unreasonable that the licence should not be granted, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that any charges, terms or conditions subject to which a licensing body propose that the licence should be granted are unreasonable,</P>
    <P>may apply to the Controller under this section.</P>
    <P>The section refers to a person.  I am told it can only be an organisation.  Therefore, the protection intended by the Oireachtas in Part V of the Act is not operational.  I do not know whether this is by oversight or by interpretation.  That is what happened in this case.  We were told anything relating to charges was a matter for the National Prices Commission. I was also given this information by the Office of the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property.  I went on a deputation to the National Prices Commission who sent me to the Patents Office.  Nowhere in the 1963 Act is the Patents Office mentioned.  It is the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property.  The point I am making is that protection is non-existent.</P>
    <P>The then Minister said in 1963 that we were following British legislation.  It is interesting to recall how the interests of users are protected in Britain.  They are protected under the Copyright Act, 1956. When the Bill was being debated in the House of Commons on 4 June 1966 the President of the Board of Trade said the function of the tribunal was to protect the general public from the Performing Rights Society.  My experience of dealing with what is supposed to be a similar organisation or a similar office in this country is that their understanding of their position is that their first duty is to protect the Performing Rights Society <Col N="365" /> from the general public, and not the other way around as would appear to be the situation in Britain, and would appear to be the intent of the Oireachtas in 1963.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to clarify the question of the payment of double royalties. I am referring to this in relation to television and radio.  Section 19 of the 1963 Act says there is no breach of copyright unless the audience pays to see the transmission. Section 52 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a sound broadcast or television broadcast is made by Radio Éireann, and a person, by the reception of that broadcast, causes a sound recording, whether made before or after the commencement of this section, to be heard in public or to be transmitted to subscribers to a diffusion service, he does not thereby infringe the copyright (if any) in that recording.</P>
    <P>Yet organisations representing copyright owners insist on collecting almost £500,000 a year &mdash; I gather the figure is £495,000 &mdash; in royalties from Telefís Éireann for export across the channel. They insist on collecting another fee from the receivers, provided the television set or radio is in what is deemed by that organisation to be a public place &mdash; not a public place as defined by the Act, because the Act does not define it.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see section 19 excluded these double payments.  If it did not, section 52 surely has some relevance. These payments are obtained by the use of High Court writs.  I want to contrast that with the position as it applies in Britain.  I am using Britain because Britain is the home of the organisation I am concerned with here.  It is not an Irish organisation although it represents itself as one.  It is simply an offshoot of the organisation whose address I gave a few moments ago.  It does not even have representation on the board of management of that organisation.  An observer delegate goes over there, but that is all. In its home country it is not allowed to do what we allow it to do here.  The Act governing copyright in Britain is the 1956 <Col N="366" /> Act.  A commission which considered the whole question of copyright in later years was chaired by Mr. Justice Whitford. That was followed by a Government Green Paper.  Their position on what I describe as double royalties in relation to television is best expressed by the following quotation from that Green Paper:</P>
    <P>The BBC and the IBA pay copyright owners on the basis of the whole potential audience for their transmission.  It would therefore be inequitable to allow an additional payment of copyright royalties in respect of what is essentially the same communication to the same public.</P>
    <P>RTE pay £495,000 a year to that particular organisation.  It is still not satisfied. It extracts a double payment.  On my reading of the 1963 Act it is acting illegally in doing that but, because Part V of that Act does not operate, the people affected have no protection.  In fairness to Senator Lynch and other people who play traditional music only on their premises, could the Minister clarify the position in relation to the copyright ownership of traditional music, if any?  That is essential.</P>
    <P>During the course of my research on the 1963 Act I came across the quotation used by Senator Dooge from Colmcille: &ldquo;To every cow its calf; to every book its copy&rdquo;.  I have no dispute whatsoever with that.  I am disputing the legitimacy of the rights of those who own the cow.  That is what is in question.  If they can satisfy me and others that they own the cow, they are entitled to the calf.  But they steadfastly refuse even to enter into a discussion on whether they own it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Part V of the 1963 Act is a failure and I look to the Minister for redress.  It does not operate.  The Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property &mdash; and I am referring to the office; I do not know the individual concerned &mdash; does not perform as intended in the Act and in the Oireachtas debates during its passage.  If the Minister cannot succeed in getting that office to operate as it should be, obviously it cannot be denied that the time for change has arrived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I would like the Minister to consider the abuse of monopoly which I have outlined. This was a matter of considerable interest to the Members of the Oireachtas who debated the 1963 Act.  I am concerned that the application of what is proposed in subsection (8) is much wider than was intended by the Minister.  I am satisfied that it can be misused in the directions I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatsoever to the payment of royalties or licence fees where I am satisfied that they are genuinely due.  But the absence of an appeals machinery, monopoly abuse and monopoly power, are matters that need to be rectified.  I invite the Minister to amend subsections (8) and (10) (a) and (b) so that the increased penalties will have application only in relation to video pirates, and stop penalties being used to perpetuate and exploit an unjust situation which has emerged and which clearly was not intended by the Oireachtas in 1963 or by the Oireachtas today.  I want him, secondly, to examine the non-operation of Part V of the 1963 Act and to amend these sections to ensure that users get the protection which was intended under that part of the Act.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want him to examine the monopoly position of organisations representing copyright owners, their methods, their practices and their operations. Fourthly, I should like him to clarify why a double charge on radio and television is permitted &mdash; a double charge on RTE in the first place and on receivers in the second place.  The opposite applies in the United Kingdom, the home base of the organisation that can enjoy advantages and privileges here which it is not permitted by its own Government to enjoy in Britain.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to clarify the position in relation to traditional music: what is copyright and what is non-copyright? The Bill is intended to deal with an objectionable practice of video piracy and I fully support it, but I seek from the Minister an assurance that in taking that step we do not inflict an injustice on people who are already exploited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators who have welcomed the Bill and I want to thank them for their contributions. I will comment briefly on some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch referred to the prevalance of video nasties in the country and the Cathaoirleach rightly pointed out that the question of video nasties <i>per se</i> is a matter for the Minister for Justice and not for my Department except in so far as copyright would have existed in relation to the original video.  That would fall to be dealt with under the Copyright Act but the essential element of what the Senator was saying was that the existence of video nasties falls to be dealt with by the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>This is an amending Bill.  It does not pretend to be a comprehensive Bill and it does not pretend to replace the 1963 Act.  It is a Bill amending that Act and taking into account in this case the technological changes that have taken place in the intervening years which have thrown up anomalies in the intention of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>I should state at the outset that the owners of copyright are entitled to protect their interests and this may be done, of course, by way of licensing.  The Performing Rights Society is a legal and legitimate organisation.  We are trying to ensure the protection of the owners of copyright, and that should not be lost sight of in the course of the debate.  Senator Dooge rightly pointed out the long history of the evolution of copyright law. It is fair to point out that copyright law is perhaps always in need of revision both nationally and internationally.  Progress is slow because of difficulties in defining the rights of copyright holders in relation to the means of dissemination and in finding means of enforcement of these rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of enforcement is difficult. Traditional direct means of enforcement are regarded as largely impracticable against uses which are now on an enormous scale by private individuals whose activities are not easily detectible. It is considered that resort may have to <Col N="369" /> be had mainly to levies on equipment and licensing schemes, these licensing schemes having to be compulsory where private schemes would not take account of the public interest.</P>
    <P>The delay in reform in both national legislation and international agreements resulting from these difficulties is of serious concern to copyright interests.  Not only are they deprived under existing law but delay in reforming the law is allowing illicit practices to become so entrenched that it may not be possible to eradicate them even by new legislation.  Copyright interests, despite advances in technology, require to have defined in broad terms their rights in regard to reproduction, distribution, display and performance and provide that future developments in the use of their works would be comprehended in those terms.  This would involve legislating for copyright rights in such areas as video computer software, photocopying and satellite broadcasting. Developments in these areas are, of course, of concern to national as well as international authorities and we are monitoring the developments.  I should add that apart from videograms, no representations about the situation have been received from Irish copyright interests, and perhaps that would indicate the reason for the present amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I have tried to answer Senator Dooge in relation to the developments nationally and internationally.  This Bill is restrictive.  It merely takes account of one narrow corridor of abuses that have arisen and I freely admit that perhaps in a year's time that there may be further amending legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I am sure the Senator will take into account the question of the rapid developments in computer software and satellite broadcasting. This is a question that will have to be addressed as well.  For instance, I cannot give the House a full report on the position as it is now because it is rapidly changing.  I foresee a situation <Col N="370" /> where in one or two years' time further legislation may be needed to take account of the rapid technological developments.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard in his wide ranging contribution has certain reservations about the operation of the 1963 Act and in particular Part V of that Act.  He also mentioned intimidation.  In fairness, law is enacted by the Oireachtas but is administered by the courts, and if private indindividuals or groups feel that they are being intimidated or that wrong demands are being made of them by any person or body of persons they can have recourse to the law and should use that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The law is there to protect citizens of the State and it should be used.  The inference given by the Senator that bodies &mdash; he mentioned the Performing Rights Society&mdash;are bullying or using intimidating tactics is an allegation that I would be sad to hear.  If the Senator has any particular cases he wishes to bring to my attention I would be glad to have them investigated.  In general I must say the recourse is to the law rather than here in this House.  The question of private showings in houses was raised by the Senator as being a widespread practice and he queried the definition of a private place.  A private place is not defined in the Act.  It will be left to the courts to define what is a private place.  A public place is where the public are invited to enter on payment of a fee or are invited to enter freely for the purpose of paying for a commodity or a service.  I would not like to put a legal definition on it here since it is not in the Act but if there was a case stated before court a definition could be forthcoming if it were queried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree to the Senator's suggestion that we exclude everything other than the pirating of films.  The problem I am treating in the Bill is of a wider dimension than that.  Again, I am going back to my basic philosophy in that this amending Bill is to strengthen the protection of copyright holders and I will not depart from my philosophy that they are entitled <Col N="371" /> to the protection of copyright.  I understand that copyright stands for the life of the author plus 50 years.  In relation to what Senator Lynch and Senator Howard said, if there is any material which is doubtful and which falls to be queried, if a complainant feels that he or she is right, that matter can be very easily resolved in a court of law in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that intimidation is widely practised and if it is I would ask not only Senator Howard but any Senator to bring it to my notice.  The Senator raised a number of other matters such as the question of double royalties.  I would add here that the Phonographic Society is in existence to protect the performers, which I think is a matter that should be understood as well.  I do not quite understand what the Senator means by saying there is a monopoly position.  Yes, there is a monopoly position in so far as we are protecting the calf for the cow.</P>

      <P>Once ownership of the cow is well established ownership of the calf can equally be well established.  The intention here is to protect the owner of the copyright and I make no apologies for that.  It is the intention of the Bill.  I am considering a number of amendments and I will take into account what has been said here today to see if there are good grounds for introducing any further amendments.  I wish to thank the Senators who took part in the debate.</P>

It is the attitude &ldquo;pay up now and we will not be too hard on you; do not pay and we will go to town on you and bring you to court&rdquo;.  The question is why should the ordinary citizens of this country have to seek recourse to the courts for protection when we are passing a Bill in this House that should provide that protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the Copyright Act is to protect the owners of original works.  The case quoted by Senator <Col N="372" /> Dooge shows just how deep-rooted is the question of purloining original material.  I support the protection of original works by way of the Copyright Act. I would not, of course, support intimidation and neither does the law.  The Garda would take a very dim view of intimidation as would the courts.  As I said in my reply, the place to defend oneself is in the courts of law.  They are there to protect private citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>When I referred to double royalties I referred to radio and television, the fact that RTE pay almost £500,000 in royalties and that a second royalty is expected from the receivers of the programme.  I questioned the validity of that situation, especially with regard to sections 19 and 52.  I think the Minister misunderstood me in the sense that he referred to the Phonographic Society as having the royalty on the tapes.  I was actually referring to the fact that RTE pay a royalty to the Performing Rights Society of £195,000 a year yet I, as a receiver, am expected to pay a second royalty.  That was not the intention.  The Minister appears to say that the courts are the place to go.  Am I to accept that Part V of the 1963 Act is now dormant? Am I to accept, in relation to my earlier question, that sections 19 and 52 have not the meaning they were intended to have? If the intention is that parts of the Act, particularly Part V, are to lie dormant, why not scrap them when the opportunity is available now or else have them operate as intended?</P>

In relation to double royalties, <Col N="373" /> if you own a television you have to pay your television licence but if you use it to give a public performance which is covered by copyright you are obliged to pay copyright royalties on a commercial basis.  Double royalty does not arise in that context.  However, I will look at both the points the Senator has raised and if I feel there is need for action I will take it on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Land Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I gave my observations and personal views on a number of aspects connected with farming and with this Bill.  In particular, I tried to make the point that farming, the farmer and the land have a particular place in Irish society.  The Inter-Departmental Committee on Land Structure Reform published their final report in May 1978.  It is a very comprehensive document and I could quote much from it which would be relevant in considering this Bill.  I want to quote a very small <Col N="374" /> paragraph dealing with land functions in a modern economy:</P>
      <P>Three attributes of land, especially in rural areas, mark it as distinct from other economic resources.  It is;</P>
      <P>  (i) Basic to human survival</P>
      <P>(ii) Fixed in location</P>
      <P>(iii) Limited in supply.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the relationships between man and land &mdash; such as land tenure, ownership and use &mdash; are central features of the structure of society. These relationships directly affect society's political philosophy, economic system, culture and social organisation (for example, tradition, laws, etc.)</P>
      <P>That spells out exactly the views I have and which I tried to express then.  I stated in addition that this Bill is a frontal attack on the conacre and 11-month systems of letting.  While I understand the drawbacks of those systems, nevertheless in some areas they worked very well and the land in many instances was well looked after.  There can be no blanket condemnation of the system and it probably will continue to live on even if leasing becomes successful.</P>
      <P>In theory I can see the sense of leasing as opposed to letting but over the years the conacre system proved itself.  I also spoke about the role of auctioneers in society.  If leasing becomes widespread this role must diminish.  Auctioneers have played a very important part: they have helped the farmer in many ways in determining the value of his land and they have provided free advice.  I am not sure how the auctioneers as a body have reacted to this Bill but I see their role decreasing and the role of the lawyers increasing because the leases seem to be very complicated documents.  While I understand that co-ops and groups in the agricultural area will help out, at the end of the day the document is a legal document and will need a lawyer to interpret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the question: how will the farmer who is leasing his land determine the value of the lease or what he is to ask <Col N="375" /> for the land?  Will there be built into it some method whereby with the fall in the value of money there will be corresponding increase and some kind of index linkage?  I see this problem for long-term leases.  I know there was a demand for this legislation for perhaps 25 years.  I think a minimum length of lease should have been specified.  In some areas we are talking of a three-year lease and various organisations have asked for a three-year lease, a five-year lease, a six-year or a 12-year lease.  In the Bill there should be some definition of a minimum lease.  I am totally in sympathy with the farming organisations because the farmer's role is a very difficult one.  For as long as I can remember the farmer's lot was up and down and indeed mostly down.  Many farmers cannot afford holidays. They work long hours and my total sympathy is with them.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Senator Ferris stated that he supported some of the criticism but said his party would not permit the Land Commission to be a scapegoat or a whipping boy.  I thought at that stage Senator Ferris was more or less trailing his coat because up until then there had been no major criticism of the Land Commission. Subsequently, Senator Connor in his contribution asked the Minister the proposals he will be bringing forward to scrap the Land Commission.  He also stated that the Land Commission in the past have been shown to have been dogged by slow procedures, by an overly legalistic approach that at times almost amounted to a judicial approach.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the National Planning Board under the heading of Land Use Policy states:</P>
    <P>The agency at present charged with the implementation of land policy, the Land Commission, and the policy instruments it employs are in the Board's view not capable of achieving this objective at a cost to taxpayers which can be justified.  The Board, therefore, recommend that the Land Commission should be abolished.  The reasons for this are being spelt out in the report of the Inter-departmental <Col N="376" /> Committee and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Section (c) states:</P>
    <P>The cost of the Commission's activities in relation to the acreage of land allotted appears to be high.  In 1981, for instance, the cost per acre allotted was £581 and the cost per average allotment was £8,706.  This cost is not recoverable by the State.  If the Commission's activities are seen as having primarily a social welfare objective this cost appears exorbitant, bearing in mind that the enlargement of a holding does not <i>per se</i> ensure a higher standard of living for the beneficiary.  Even conceding that the Commission's allotment programme may yield a net improvement in productivity, there exist more cost effective policy instruments capable of achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that because of financial restrictions the Commission has not acquired land on any significant scale in recent years.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the report of the Inter-Departmental Commission on Land Structure Reform indicated that the price per acre was around £200.  In this section it is grossly unfair to work out a price per acre at a period when the acreage was decreased out of all proportion, because I believe that in the early years the average would be about 30,000 acres whereas in the last few years it came down to about 7,000 acres.  To work out a unit cost per acre at a time when this work had virtually ceased is unfair and paints a wrong picture.</P>
    <P>I would be critical of the Land Commission, in some areas but I want to make it clear that I would not be in favour of abolishing the Land Commission because from the start their objectives have been achieved and I see no reason why they cannot undertake other areas of work which are essential, such as promoting this leasing programme.  I agree that the Land Commission have been slow in almost all their work but at the same time I am conscious that people who got land from the Land Commission got it with a clear title, and that took time.  There was <Col N="377" /> not sufficient land to be distributed, and on many occasion the Land Commission were waiting for more and the acquisition was a slow process.  In regard to the 11 month system of letting, the Land Commission were the worst offender because some farms were let for as long as ten years or more.  There could not be any justification for this.</P>
    <P>I am critical of Land Commission house design.  I know that it is easy to be wise with hindsight but it is a pity that more work did not go into the planning of the Land Commission houses.  At that time we had the Congested District Board cottages which were, in their time, a considerable leap forward, but the Land Commission designs were largely based on the Irish Land Provision for Sailors and Soldiers Act, 1919, which were built by the British Government. That was a pity.  I always felt that the Land Commission should have considered clustered design which was typical of Irish development where houses would be in groups.  This has much to recommend it, such as infrastructure, water, roads, sewerage and so on.  The Land Commission's roads were narrow, they followed the hedges and the fences and, while in one sense they were very much in sympathy with the environment, there was no looking forward, with the result that many of them are merely lanes now and unsuitable for the traffic which uses them.</P>
    <P>I am also critical of the Land Commission in the area of allocation of farms to women.  I know that single men have got farms from the Land Commission over the years in my own area of County Meath, but I have never known women to get farms and I am wondering is there any reason why they did not.</P>
    <P>In some instances the acquisition of land might be unfair, but the courts are there to deal with this.  I know of one case before the courts at present regarding land which I feel has been unfairly acquired but I think that justice will be done.  It is easy to be critical but the Land Commission did a very good job and for that reason I would not agree with their abolition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> I should like to give a brief synopsis of the Land Commission over the years, to show the work they have done and give the reasons why they are a body that could be charged with making this Bill and land leasing successful.  The Land Commission were established in 1881 under Gladstone's second Land Act. Their purpose was as a rent fixing body to control landlordism and they succeeded in doing so.  That success nurtured the idea of the total abolition of landlordism, and the Land Commission were entrusted with the task to the extent that it became their main function.  Again it was successful, and finally in 1923 what was left of landlordism was wiped out with a single stroke.  With rents reduced to reasonable amounts and landlords being replaced by the Land Commission who allowed farmers to buy out their land by the instalment system, it was found that something more was needed.  Small, scattered and fragmented farms needed to be enlarged and unified and, in the process of achieving this objective, the Land Commission became identified in the popular image with the dispossession of large landholders and redistribution of land as their primary function.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, the background to the Land Commission is that through past centuries, but especially between the years 1555 and 1697, the English had carried out confiscations and plantations. The land was taken from the Irish and divided amongst colonists and planters whose descendants were mainly responsible for the penal laws of the eighteenth century.  By the middle of the nineteenth century the Irish peasant farmer was, in reality, no better than a slave.  He was a tenant at will, holding his land at the whim of the landlord and paying an exorbitant rent.  There was a degrading system of payment backed by all the resources of the law and the Government. Between 1849 and 1882, almost 500,000 families, around 4,000,000 people, were evicted and thrown on the roadside.  The tenant farmer was discouraged by the system from making any improvement while the landlord was simply a leech living mostly abroad in style and comfort on the sweat and blood of <Col N="379" /> his tenants.  The result was a period of evictions, secret societies, such as the Whiteboys and Moonlighters, assassinations and cattle maiming.  The Government simply replied with repressive measures and between 1830 and 1875 as many as 47 Coercion Acts were passed.</P>
    <P>At the darkest hour two great leaders came on the scene, Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell, who was himself a landlord.  In 1879 Davitt founded the Land League and it swept the country. Reform could not be delayed any longer, and the progress of that reform is the story of the Irish land code and especially of the Land Commission.  Progress was slow at first but the Land Act of 1881 granted the &ldquo;Three Fs&rdquo;, fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale which the Tenant League had unsuccessfully campaigned for in 1852.  The Land League of 1879 demanded nothing less than the obtaining of the ownership of the soil by the occupiers.  Gladstone's first Land Act of 1870 had been very little help to the tenant since it left fixing of rents completely in the hands of landlords.  Under this Act, less than 500 tenants were able to avail of the limited state aid to purchase the holdings.  The Land Commission was constituted to administer the 1881 Act and in a few years fair rent had been fixed for 275,000 holdings in the 26 counties. These were 21 per cent lower than previously payable.  Fifteen years later 93,000 of these were reduced by another 18 per cent and 15 years later still, 3,000 of them came down by a further 9 per cent but for most people, the possibility of purchasing their holdings, the final goal of the Land League, was an idle dream.  The intractable landlords would not sell, and very few of the near peasants could find one quarter of the purchase money which was necessary under the 1881 Act.  Then in 1885 under the Ashbourne Land Purchase Act, the Land Commission were empowered to pay landlords the first purchase price on behalf of the tenant and to accept payment in instalments from the tenant over a period of 49 years.  Around 16,000 tenants availed of these terms and the Land Commission paid £7 million to the landlords. The passing of this Act marks the <Col N="380" /> beginning of land purchase, the objective of the Land League.  Cash payments were, however, a heavy strain on the State.  In 1891 a new system of land stock was created and landlords were paid in stock equal in nominal amounts to the purchase money.  Around 42,000 tenants in the 26 counties availed of the Act and the purchase money totalled £11 million. It would have been used more were it not for the fact that the stock stood below par and that the Boer War pushed the stock lower and put an end to the progress.</P>
    <P>The Balfour Land Purchase Act, 1891, also set up the Congested Districts Board to develop poorer districts along the western seaboard.  It was a statutory body designed to promote the interests of small farmers in defined areas of the nine western counties.  The Congested Districts Board had within its care fisheries, rural industry and land purchase and it also had one significant power &mdash; to buy from landlords land which they held for themselves and had not leased to tenant farmers. The Wyndham Act, 1903, made £100 million available for land purchase.  Both this Act and the later Act of 1909 enlarged the powers and income of the board and gave both the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board the power to acquire untenanted land compulsorily.  By 1923 the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission had, between them, distributed some 750,000 acres of untenanted land. In 1923 the Congested Districts Board was merged with the Land Commission. Prior to 1923 there were three main and concurrently exercised functions of the Land Commission, fixing of rent and tenancy control, land purchase and land settlement. Prior to 1923, land purchase depended on mutual agreement between landlord and tenant.  In 1923 the newly-established Irish Government at one stroke abolished the remaining landlords. In effect the Land Commission were by virtue of the Land Act, 1923, appointed landlord for or vested with the landlord's interest in the 110,000 tenants then remaining unpurchased.  The landlords lost the right to control rents and they were reimbursed in land bonds <Col N="381" /> totalling £20 million.  Prices were so scaled that the tenants' annuities worked out at about 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the rent they had previously been paying and the Land Commission could give further reductions if they thought it necessary.</P>
    <P>Since 1923, then, we had many Acts &mdash; the Land Bond Act, 1925, the Land Act, 1926, the Land Act, 1927, the Land Act, 1929, the Land Act, 1931, the Land Act, 1933, the Land Bond Act, 1933, the Land Bond Act, 1934, the Land Act, 1936, the Land Act, 1939, the Land Act, 1946, the Land Act, 1950, the Land Act, 1953, the Land Act, 1954, the Land Bond Act, 1964, and the Land Act, 1965.  All these played a part in shaping the Land Commission as we know it today or at least until recently.  Now with no great land bank available and with such success behind them the Land Commission must be the ideal medium to make the concept of leasing popular as well as the other objectives that the Minister has mentioned, group purchase, commonage division and re-arrangement of holdings. The Land Commission were empowered to acquire land compulsorily but they did not confiscate.  Their activities in this respect were set out in the statutes.</P>
    <P>Some of the current problems which the Land Commission might very well be geared to deal with would be where we have a lack of mobility in the present land tenure system.  As the Minister has pointed out, only 3 per cent changes hands each year and 80 per cent of that is by way of gift or inheritance.  It is hard to see how the figure of 80 per cent can be reduced but the other figure, the 3 per cent, is indeed a very low percentage. Half of our farmers are over 55 years of age and a quarter are 65 and over.  There is a need to reduce the age of succession. I said on the last occasion that older farmers should not be put out to grass indiscriminately.  A proper pension scheme should be devised so that farmers could retire with dignity.  Indeed, the experience of these farmers could be used by those who take over the farms.  Over 50 per cent of sales on the open market go to non full time farmers.  There is still <Col N="382" /> a need for a programme of rearrangement of holding between farms in the same locality and division of commonages. We must concern ourselves with the efficient use of land for agricultural development and the objective must be the optimum use of the land.</P>
    <P>Financial institutions are in sympathy with the principle of land leasing, and in a guide to farm finance produced by Allied Irish Banks last month, there is a section on land leasing which states that the bank will also provide finance on the basis of normal commercial criteria to farmers entering long term leasing arrangements.  The Minister said that what is being proposed in the Bill represents a complete turn around in the basic philosophy of landlord-tenant relations as it has been conveniently accepted here for over a century.  I accept this and I can see whereas previous legislation from 1870 onwards was concerned mainly with the tenant, this Bill will now be concerned with the tenant not obtaining a prescriptive right and it will be more in sympathy with those who lease the land. It does seem somewhat disappointing to me, as a newcomer, when I have gone through the Bills from 1870 onwards and seen big volumes.  However, this small Bill in a sense is the start of something new and I hope something great will come of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also emphasised that whilst the encouragement of leasing is an integral part of a comprehensive land reform programme, it is nevertheless, only a first step in the formulation of such a programme.  This Bill will also bring us into line with continental countries, I fully support it and wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on this Bill.  This Bill has been very ably discussed in this House for the past four to five weeks.  In fact, there is very little that one could add to the sentiments that have been expressed by Senators on both sides of the House.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House as it is very important.  I welcome the Bill as it encourages the leasing of land and, therefore, would make more land available <Col N="383" /> for productive use.  As stated by the Minister, ownership of land is not necessarily an end in itself, but we must address ourselves to the maximum production and usage that would be derived from the vast number of green acres in this country.  If agriculture is to make the maximum contribution to the economy, and it can make a huge contribution, the proper utilisation of land is of prime importance.  I was glad to hear the Minister point out clearly that the 1860 Acts were to be repealed as they would be unworkable in today's conditions.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the statements the Minister made in relation to the Land Commission and the specific guarantees he gave so that there would not be any interference with land that was made available for leasing.  As a result of these commitments, the way is now clear for farmers who would prefer long term leasing to come together with interested parties and work out a suitable arrangement.  I have seen the model leases referred to, and they are very comprehensive and straightforward.  They are basically saying that there will be an agreement between equal partners for their future advantage.  The figure quoted on the availability of land for letting is that there are approximately one million acres, most of them on the 11 month system.  This is the main reason why some of our land is run down and depressed.  It would be in the best interest of somebody letting land to do so for a fixed number of years, whether three, five or seven, with rent reviews to cover inflation.  This is the only way you can be sure that the tenant will take care of the land so that he also knows where he stands.  The tenant would be in a position to spend money on developing this land as he would know he is secure for a fixed number of years. It is very important for tenants to take proper care of the land, to fence, lime and fertilise it because it is one of our greatest resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to developing the land, I am disappointed that the subsidy on lime was removed although I am aware that it was an EEC directive and tied in basically with the super-levy and so on.  I urge the Minister to reintroduce the lime subsidy <Col N="384" /> as one of the most important ingredients for land development is the proper untilisation of lime followed by fertiliser, etc. In years gone by we fell down greatly in the spreading of lime on land.  At this stage of our development it is very important that we would have the maximum usage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are moving away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  We have the largest young population in Western Europe and the introduction of this Bill should enable more land to become available for our young people.  It would enable more young people to get involved in farming.  However, we must sell the idea of land leasing to all interested parties, make local agencies aware of its importance and have discussions and consultations with farming organisations. The co-ops have a big part to play in so far as they are in a position to identify land that is available for leasing and thus find farmers who would be interested in leasing this land.  It would encourage smaller farmers to produce more and, as a result, the co-ops would be the beneficiaries as more of the processing plants would be used for extra production.  The co-ops would also be in a position to deduct the rent for this land from the monthly milk cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there must not be incentives for farmers to give over their land, but where they are willing to transfer the land there should be some from of contributory pension scheme that would entice farmers to retire.  Other EEC countries have contributory pension schemes for farmers and we should look at this area.  If the farm retirement scheme was attractive enough and grants made available to the young farmers, many owners would be prepared to lease their land and, as a result, would ensure its maximum utilisation.  The banks, on the other hand, have a part to play in the development of this Land Bill because they should be encouraged to make money available for young people who might be short of capital.  As was recently stated in the media, we are aware of the <Col N="385" /> vast profits that the banks have been making and I would encourage them to invest in our natural resources and encourage young people to get involved in land leasing.  As I said, our major assets are our young population and our land. With support from the banks and financial institutions we can work both of those assets together for the betterment of the country.</P>
    <P>It has been stated many times during this debate that land is our greatest natural resource and that agriculture is of fundamental importance to the economy. With the introduction of this Bill, I am sure that over a period of time we will maximise on this great natural resource, that the millions of acres of land now not being fully utilised will be brought into a better state of production and give more employment.  This will help in our balance of payments, in the unemployment area and in the provision of raw material for food processing.  I wish the Minister well with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on having the initiative to bring this very important legislation to this House.  I also congratulate the Minister on his courage because it is courage, more than anything else, that is needed for this Bill, in so far as it tackles a problem which has been spoken about for many years but never acted upon. The utmost co-operation should be forthcoming from everybody involved and every encouragement should be given by the various agencies involved or who hope to be involved in this Land Bill in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every aspect of the land problem is sensitive.  Our history shows us that we spent most of our years battling over land.  We have had many wars, including a land war.  It is a very sensitive area and one which is particularly dear to the hearts of every Irish landowner.  Any measure which in any way encroaches on this area will make very slow progress and will be scrutinised very carefully. Anybody who believes that this Bill will revolutionise our whole land problem quickly will be disappointed.  For this <Col N="386" /> reason, patience will have to be paramount in everybody's minds with regard to this land question.</P>
    <P>It is intended that land mobility would be dealt with in the Bill.  There have been many factors contributing to a lack of mobility in the Irish land question over the years.  One which is very obvious to most people, and particularly to the people in the west, is late inheritance. Twenty-five per cent of our land is in the hands of people who are over 65 years of age.  Therein is one of the major problems which have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I should like at this point to welcome the Government's decision to extend for another year at least, the stamp duty exemption which it initiated some years back.  It is welcome legislation and it had the desired effects in so far as it began to show in some small way that land could be made mobile if the proper environment was created for it.  We are happy that it has been extended for another year and hope that where older people are prepared to hand over land to younger people in the family or outside it this provision will continue.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's address to the Seanad he said he was considering the matter of regulating and controlling the sale of land which comes on the open market.  Many comments have been made in the House on this aspect.  That has come in association with the whole concept of land leasing and there is no doubt that there is confusion abroad in relation to the association between these two.  I welcome the Minister's later statement guaranteeing that any land which would become available for leasing would not be acquired at a later date by the Land Commission.  That is a verbal guarantee given by the Minister and I do not doubt his sincerity in this, but I would have to say that in order to satisfy the many people who have land to lease it should be written into the Bill so that there is no possibility that the Land Commission could, at a later date, acquire that land.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly stated that a register of all land being made available for leasing should be drawn up.  I would have a degree of suspicion that that register <Col N="387" /> could be used at a later date if it was felt desirable to do so.  I would not like to see any register being kept of land being made available for leasing.  Certainly if it was in the hands of the Land Commission I would be suspicious of it.  I would never be satisfied with the Land Commission's involvement in the land leasing concept. A degree of suspicion would remain dormant in the minds of the people who would have land to lease.  I would like to see the Land Commission as it is now constituted abolished.  I call for it to be abolished and abolished quickly if this land leasing idea is to take root at all.</P>
    <P>The very idea that set up the Land Act of 1881, referred to by Senator Fitzsimons, was that we would have, among other things, free sale.  If we can guarantee this, we will be going a long way to allaying the fears that have been expressed in recent times as a result of the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by many Senators that the Land Commission have served us well.  This may be so for people who have benefited from land acquisition.  I should like to point out, however, that in spite of the hundreds of thousands of acres that the Land Commission have had at their disposal in the last 20 years, the majority of farmers who benefited only got an addition of four acres.  If the whole idea and concept of the Land Commission was to alleviate congestion and in the past 20 years all they have contributed is four acres per unit, they have failed dismally to make any worthwhile contribution to the aim for which they were originally set up.  It is reliably estimated that the actual cost of dividing an acre of land in 1983 was £400.  That is a luxury we cannot allow to continue.  For that reason I can justifiably call for the abolition of the Land Commission at a time of scarce resources.  Such a wasteful use of scarce financial resources in the area of agriculture or any other area cannot be tolerated and allowed to continue for the future.</P>
    <P>People may criticise me and say: &ldquo;what would you do with the personnel and how would you organise the land that has become available?&rdquo; I believe we have a very important structure already available <Col N="388" /> in ACOT.  These are the people who are involved with farm management and farm improvements and whole schemes and projects by which farmers, large and small, can increase their productivity. The details that they have in their possession are far greater and more important to actual productivity and increased productivity than those available to the personnel of the Land Commission.  They were primarily people who divided land. Many of the allocations that were made were made to people who, with hindsight it can be truly said, have benefited very little by it and have made very bad use of it.  While the Land Commission tried to provide for the wishes of many people, it did not provide for the needs of the people.  That is one of the major faults of the Land Commission that we can see so glaringly today throughout the countryside. They tried to appease people's wishes rather than their actual needs.</P>
    <P>Another fault is that in trying to alleviate congestion they created a far greater problem which the Minister, coming from the west of Ireland, is aware of.  Fragmentation is one of the greatest problems we have in the west of Ireland. When the Land Commission acquired a large estate they apportioned it out in small sections to adjoining farmers within a radius of one to three miles.  Concerning the very problem that the Minister is trying to solve today in relation to land leasing &mdash; trying to get a unified structure of farm holding by asking people to exchange pieces of land in adjoining holdings and to amalgamate the holdings in general &mdash; the Land Commission have over the years set out to do the very opposite in so far as they fragmented holdings.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons a few moments ago mentioned design.  He was talking about houses that were built by the Land Commission in years gone by on these holdings. The whole concept of design was foreign to the Land Commission.  Many of you in your own areas will remember very beautiful estates that were acquired by the Land Commission, held for years and broken up.  Associated with such an estate would have been one of the old country houses, few of which remain in <Col N="389" /> this country today unfortunately.  The Land Commission were responsible for the destruction of many of these old houses.  I can think of one within a few miles of my home. It was in a beautiful setting on the banks of the Shannon.  The Land Commission acquired the estate, kept it for about five years, let it and then proceeded to put barbed wire within six or eight feet of the carriageway to the front door.  They cut it off from the views and destroyed the whole aspect of the house and its environment.  I believe they can be faulted for destroying some of our heritage.  I am afraid that is the view I have of the Land Commission and it would take a lot for me to change that view of them today.  Few people have benefited from acquisition of the land.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Land Commission's failure and disappointment to many was their system of payment for land they acquired.  The land bond system was nothing short of a State rip-off.  The land bonds today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an integral part of it, I believe.  If the Land Commission are to have a part in the land leasing scheme it will be more difficult.  The case I am making is that I believe the Land Commission have been a failure.  I would not like to see them getting involved in another system which has been given thought and encouragement and making it a cause of ridicule at a later date.  That is the context in which I am speaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that when personnel are needed for the implementation of this scheme we would use the ACOT system that is there and if necessary incorporate the personnel within that system for any part they might have to play in mapping the lands apportioned and the lands that might be rented and <Col N="390" /> drawing up the agreements that might be necessary for the leasing concept.</P>
      <P>The whole leasing concept is to be commended and I hope it will increase the farm size and the amount of land that people who are prepared to work it have at their disposal.  The land leasing system that we have at present and have had down through the years, the 11 months system, has failed dismally.  It is a wasteful use of land in so far as it is confined to a system of agriculture such as grazing, particularly in the west of Ireland, for an 11 months period, and perhaps in the more important tillage parts it was for corn or the production of a crop like that. The person who rented the land for the 11 months got what he could out of it for that 11 months and knew that he would be displaced at the end of that 11 months. It was wasteful and could never contribute to increased production in agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is important to say at this stage that, while the Land Commission had and still have vast resources of land in their possession they never saw fit to pilot a scheme for long-term leasing.  I would ask the Minister to see that, if there is a substantial area of land in any particular area, we should use that as a pilot scheme.  The Land Commission should rent it on a long-term basis, and do one pilot project to show their commitment to long-term leasing.  It would encourage people away from the 11 months system also.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons mentioned the many advertisements we see.  I have a copy of one here.  Last April the Land Commission proceeded to offer, on the 11-months system, vast areas of land in County Galway.  That is regrettable when we are trying to promote more long term leasing of land.  They should show the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have said that we should encourage long term leasing by incentive. While not disagreeing with it I would discourage the ideal that we should have to prop up a new system by incentive.  I am glad the Minister has not included any direct incentives in the Bill.  Time will judge the efficiency and the effectiveness of this Bill, and I would hate to see it <Col N="391" /> being propped up artifically by incentives such as remuneration to people to encourage them to lease.  There is another way of doing it which I will come to later.  I would rather see an encouragement by way of incentive to increase production to the people who lease the land rather than an incentive to get the land from the original owners.</P>
    <P>The incentives that have been brought forward by previous Governments have failed.  I speak in particular of the incentive in the farm retirement scheme.  If we are to have a revamped farm retirement scheme I believe it will have to be in association with and in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and not to have one Department offering an encouragement and another Department penalising people who have an income from leasing land on a long term basis. All too often today people deriving an income from farming or renting of land are precluded from getting a basic entitlement like the old age pension.  At the end of their days, when they are not producing from the land, to notionally assess an income from it, over and above the actual rent, is a penalty that cannot be tolerated in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the co-operation that the Minister has been promised from the co-operative movement and I would like to know if they have given a commitment, other than their goodwill in promoting it. It would be unfortunate if the co-operative movement were to become competitors for land under this scheme.  If they were to do the initial leasing and let it out at a subsidised rate to their suppliers or their members that would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>The people who are most capable of increased production at present are the small farmers involved in dairying.  I would like to welcome, indeed, the Government's breakdown in the quota system that has been announced recently. It has direct relevance to the particular people who would benefit by increased production.  The small producers of milk would benefit most, and seeing that the majority of the producers in the country are small producers I welcome the Minister's announcement in the recent past <Col N="392" /> of the breakdown and allocation of the quota system for small producers as it will affect the majority of people who will avail, I hope, through the co-operatives perhaps, of increased land area to come up to the level of production that we would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome also a commitment from the financial institutions to supporting the whole area of land leasing, particularly the support of Allied Irish Banks mentioned by Senator Fitzsimons. If there is so much assistance and encouragement and incentives available through those institutions the probability is that we will be back again to the situation in which we are as regards the 11-months system where many small farmers will be in great competition for leasing. The whole idea of leasing suits the small farmer in so far as there is a very small capital contribution in comparison with what he would have to lay out if he was purchasing the land.  If financial institutions are going to get involved again and make money readily available for land leasing without a very careful scrutiny as to the potential productivity at the end of it many farmers will again be misled by these institutions.  I would have to fault some of these banks for the way in which, having given out money liberally in the past, they now apply very strict rules and have commandeered many holdings in recent times because of their own leniency in the beginning.  Now they are turning the screws and have been penalising people who did not, for one reason or another, come up to the expected level of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success and encouragement with this Bill.  I believe it will take courage and time for it to succeed. The people who will benefit most are the smaller people whom you have set out to help.  All of us will eventually benefit from this Bill in so far as we will have increased national production.  If the work is carried out in the national interest overall I believe it will be a very important piece of legislation that will set <Col N="393" /> the headlines for many further improvements. I believe it is only one of many improvements that are to come.  It is a major step forward and I wish it every success under the Minister's guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say a sincere thank you and pay tribute to the tremendous amount of contributions that were made on this Bill over the last three or four weeks.  If my tally is right we had not too far away from 20 contributions, and that is normal for matters relating to land.  We had a very wide-ranging discussion, most of the matters raised directly related and some not too directly related to the Bill.  We got a great insight into how complex this whole question can really be.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to state at the outset.  From the very beginning from all sides of the House it appears to me that the idea of what I am trying to get at has not actually got across to some Senators yet.  What this Bill proposes to do is to change the legislation by removing certain inhibitions that were contained in various Land Acts back in the late 1800s which will have the effect of my being able to assure, in a categorical way, any farm owner who decides to lease his land to anybody else that in law he will get that land back on the expiry of the lease.  This runs contrary and counter to the normal landlord and tenant legislation in the sense that over the years there has been built into it on behalf of the tenant certain mechanisms by which in certain circumstances a tenant could have certain rights or could develop certain rights.  In that sense this Bill certainly changes course dramatically.  For the last 100 years and particularly in the last 50 years any farmer who would have any idea at all that on the expiry of the lease of his particular land the tenant might have certain rights &mdash; which would mean that he either had an option on it or could not actually be put off it &mdash; would not lease land.  This had the obvious effect that no land was so leased. That is the important part of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> My view of it, and I agree entirely with the Senators who expressed this view, is that there is a certain degree of suspicion all over Ireland about matters relating to this Bill and to other such Bills.  I want to assure the House that what I and the Government are getting at is that I want to create an environment wherein this normal farming practice which has been practised throughout Europe &mdash; this is the only country in which we do not have long-term leasing &mdash; will operate here.  What we want to do is to make sure that we have a better land usage and that in certain circumstances it is not necessary to own land to actually make good use of it and make a proper livelihood for the farmer involved.  That is the top priority of the Bill itself.  I have been at pains to express this opinion in parish halls all over Ireland in the past 18 months, that what I want to do is to create an environment in which we will take all the contract issues that are involved in land and channel them together in such a way that on several fronts we will get movement.  I do not intend to say that it is going to be an easy option.  As far as this Bill is concerned, and I agree with most Senators that it is an important step, without it the concept of long-term land leasing would never get off the ground.</P>
    <P>I would also have to say that there are certain other aspects of land leasing and its connection with other sectors &mdash; I am talking about social welfare and all those other aspects &mdash; that will have to be looked at.  In fact I have had considerable success in impressing on people in the last number of months, which I will outline very shortly to you, the seriousness we attach to this particular problem. While we had the 1978 inter-departmental report which suggested that land leasing should be encouraged and the National Planning Board statement that long-term land leasing was obviously an important facet of Irish agriculture, the problem was that until quite recently we had no concrete action on it.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Fitzsimons who mentioned that the last Land Act that we introduced in either House was in 1965.  That is nearly 20 years ago.  As you are all well aware, times change dramatically. <Col N="395" /> It is only reasonable to assume that it is either time or past time that major changes of emphasis were made in this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> legislation relating to our land tenure system.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things I would like to put on the record of the House. First of all, in so far as this Bill is concerned, the Land Commission or anybody else will not pressurise any farmer to lease his land if he does not want to do it.  That might seem a very elementary statement.  It is something which I am constantly being asked around the country: Will there be any pressure?  This is entirely voluntary.  Indeed I might add that in my view the only way a scheme can ever get off the ground in this country is to make it as attractive as possible so as to attract people into the scheme and not drive them in.  There is no compulsion whatever in this or any other scheme I will be talking about.  It is very important to put this on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>As I said, we will be giving a categorical assurance to every landowner that if he or she leases land whatever agreement will be made with the person who rents the land, the tenant, will stand.  The law when it will be passed by both Houses, will ensure that is the way it will work out in practice, and this should remove any anxiety that any person has in the length and breadth of this country. If I did not do anything else except get that message across this afternoon I would consider it a day's work well done.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of leasing that I will quickly go through this evening. First of all, we are dealing with the legislation here and as I said I have outlined exactly what I am getting at.  There are minor parts of this Bill that on Committee Stage I will go through.  They talk about immunity to this and some Senators have raised certain questions about that. Those are only just administrative problems and I will explain them in detail when we get to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, a number of factors emerged in the year 1983 that in my view have greatly enhanced the future likelihood of leasing becoming a viable farming proposition. The legislation is number one: number two &mdash; and for many years we <Col N="396" /> were very short of this &mdash; we did have what we call a master lease.  It was one of the problems that any farmer or tenant who wanted to become involved in leasing often found it very difficult to get a solicitor anywhere actually to draw up a lease that would cover most eventualities. However, through the good offices of a number of agencies we had two such master leases issued in 1983.  For all leases and all agreements between a farmer and a tenant there now is a master lease and in my view that is a great step forward, and I congratulate the people concerned for making those available.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned an important point, that the Irish Land Commission should give a guarantee to every farm owner in this country that if they leased their land the Land Commission would not acquire it afterwards because it was so leased.  That is an important item.  Despite the fact that I have mentioned this time and time again in the last 12 months, people still keep coming back to me and ask, can we be sure?  We can be so sure that I am prepared in writing on the lease itself between the farmer and the tenant to state clearly that the Land Commission will not intervene or get involved in that particular land because it has been so leased.  I cannot go any further than that.  For all Senators, it is important if they believe in the promotion of long-term leasing, that that assurance no matter who is in Government should be given.  I would agree with Senator Burke that if it got legs, as we say, that that particular point of view might not prevail, we would then have problems.</P>
    <P>The third thing that has happened during the year is that I have made available at the local area offices of the Land Commission around the country at least two people in every area office who have done some in-service training here in Dublin with the intention of becoming wholly involved in the promotion of land leasing in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>I think land leasing is for all of Ireland. It is not enough to say that it might solve the problems of some small farmers. Here is a concept for big and small farmers in the good and bad farming areas.  It <Col N="397" /> is as relevant to County Kilkenny as it is to County Mayo or vice versa.  It is something that many people are finding it hard to grapple with &mdash; if you do not own the land how would you believe this concept could actually get off the ground? As Senator Mullooly mentioned in what I would consider a good contribution on the last occasion, we have to divide the concept of land ownership from management. In so far as that is concerned at a leasing level what one has to look for is a young farmer or indeed any farmer who would believe that by renting land on a medium to long-term lease he or she would be able to make a better profit from the farming enterprise.  That is the bottom line in farming: if you do not make money out of it and if you are not seem to make money out of it then there is no point in being in it.</P>
    <P>I speak entirely from a farming point of view.  If this concept is to get off the ground, and I am absolutely certain at this stage that it will get off the ground, it will be seen in the light that when you compare a situation in which a farmer would have to buy land with leasing land over a lifetime, you find that at the end of the day it would be proven that he would be better off to lease land in most circumstances.  That is when leasing will become a very important concept.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of leasing has developed in the last six months and a number of Senators have referred to it. That is the involvement of the co-operative societies in this country.  I would like to pay a tribute to the ICOS for their interest in the whole idea of land leasing. We were all very much heartened by the response at the land leasing stand of the ICOS at the Spring Show this year.  Many hundreds of people come to that stand to talk about land leasing. They wanted more data on it and, most important of all, they wanted to know whom to contact about it when they went home.  That is why I think there is a role for the Land Commission officials locally together with the co-ops and everybody else that is involved, to promote the idea of leasing.  I would readily agree that it is <Col N="398" /> important that we be able to get across the idea that there is help and information locally available to get this thing off the ground.</P>
    <P>The co-ops are in an ideal position.  It may be said that they do not cover all of the country but they certainly cover a lot of it.  The idea behind the co-op involvement is a good one.  First of all, it has the shareholder system whereby people come together to build a mart or creamery or whatever it might be.  It is in their interest as a group to ensure that they have as high as possible a volume of input of milk or cattle or sheep to ensure that their mart is working efficiently. Obviously, if surrounding one of those co-ops there are large tracts of land that have been under-utilised it is clear that they are not getting the supplies of cattle, sheep and milk they should be getting.  It is reasonable to assume that some of the people who own that land are also shareholders in the co-op.  What I have suggested and what the co-op people themselves have been looking at is the setting up of what might be called a matchmaker system, where the co-op acts as the middle man and is able to get potential lessors and lessees together.  We have reason to believe in the last few months even prior to this legislation that this idea is working.  There are a number of such leases signed in this country pending this legislation going through the House.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There are many other organisations involved in land leasing, or will be, that will have a profound effect on the direction that it will take in the next few years. One of those has been mentioned by a number of Senators.  The involvement of solicitors and auctioneers is of great importance, particularly auctioneers. Many Members of the House may be auctioneers themselves.  It is a time-worn pattern that any person who has land to lease in this country usually makes a bee-line for his local auctioneer.  I have had the pleasure of meeting the Irish Auctioneers' Association.  I got unqualified support on that occasion for this concept. I want to put in on the record that in so far as their involvement is concerned <Col N="399" /> I would be very much behind the idea of auctioneers being involved at every level. From my point of view, I do not mind who is involved in land leasing so long as I see a greater utilisation of our land under way.  Obviously we have to be very practical.  The auctioneers are a very important body of people.  May I refer for a moment to the fact that this particular auctioneers' association saw fit to draw up their own master lease themselves, for which I thank them?  They asked for our views on it and I understand we have been in contact with them.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have a profound affect.  I would like to record my appreciation for the work that they have been doing.  I have met them on numerous occasions in the last 12 months.  Their help and guidance in this matter and their dedication to it through their members down at the parish level where it will all happen is of paramount importance. I am delighted with their progress to date. They, in fact, more than most, will shape the future of land leasing in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the banking institutions.  They were mentioned on a number of occasions in so far as their activities relate to land leasing.  I met the Banks Standing Committee some months ago and I must say that it was a very positive meeting, a meeting which expressed the opinion that the banks and the ACC would be more than willing to be involved at a commercial level in the provision of loans for medium and long-term leasing.  To digress for a moment to clarify what I mean about actual leasing, there was an idea abroad some years ago that anything less than a 12-year lease was really of no use to any farmer. Because of the fact of the concept of 12 years and the length of time that it happens to be, people began to get wary about it.  Twelve years is a long time.  I often give the example that a farmer who is 60 years of age now and who leases land on a 12-year lease will naturally be 72 and quite elderly when he gets his land back.  That had a dampening effect on land leasing.  My view is that we should elect for a shorter term, for example, three, five or seven years.  Many Senators have said to me: why do you not have a <Col N="400" /> statutory limit in your Bill that will indicate the number of years?  That is something you could not do for obvious reasons.  There are certain tillage areas where a three-year cycle suits best.  There are other areas where a six-or seven-year cycle would suit.  The ultimate in length in leasing is 12 or 15 years, and I have no doubt that an occasion will arise when we will have leases of that kind when people get used to the idea.  In the meantime I prefer to talk about short- to medium-term leasing.  We have one-and-a-quarter million acres of land on the 11-months system that many Senators talked very critically about in the last few days and if we could get that shifted and transferred from that system to a medium-term letting, even for three, four or five years, then we would be well on the road to getting the type of result we would like to get in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the banking institutions will, under the normal criteria for lending, back this enterprise.  I will not go into the ins and outs of it this afternoon but I think there is a place there for the institutions and I believe from the meeting I had with them that this will become a fact of life.</P>
    <P>There was talks about incentives. Indeed I agree with the Senator who expressed the opinion that it was necessary to have certain incentives to run with this Bill.  I would have to say first of all that I could not agree with the Senators who said that they welcomed the Bill but because incentives are not included they could not agree with it.  It was never intended that incentives as such would be written into the Bill.  That is a different matter, but I would agree with the Senators who voiced the criticism that without incentives leasing might not become as popular a concept as we would like. Having that in mind, there were a number of things that I have already attended to and it would be no harm to put them on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>We have negotiated successfully with the Department of Social Welfare on a very important, even if minor, issue.  The effect is simply that where a person on reaching old age pension age leased his land on the 11-months system he would <Col N="401" /> heretofore be in a more favourable position to get a higher old age pension than if the same man had his land long-term leased.  I have equalised the position now. In other words, I can give a guarantee to every prospective old-age pensioner in this country that he is at no disadvantage because he is long-term leasing his land now rather than leasing on the 11-months system.  That is an important step forward.</P>
    <P>There is another very important step forward, and it concerns the whole question of stock relief provision.  As the House will be aware, up to the last budget we had a position in this country where the facility of stock relief was extended in taxation to farmers who increased their stock.  There was a certain problem in the budget, but as the House will be aware that facility has now been restored.  This is in the normal farming practice.  But I am now glad to be able to say that in the case of bona fide leases entered into between the lessor and the lessee, and approved by the Land Commission, the tenant will now be entitled to stock relief. That is a very important aspect of the matter and I would go so far as to say that if that provision were not there it would be very difficult to sell long-term leasing. That is an important aspect of the case and it is something we should not overlook.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this whole question of long-term leasing, but suffice it to say in the few minutes I have at my disposal that what we must do is, first of all, through whatever methods possible, to get land into the hands of persons who are able to make a sustainable living out of the land in question. This will be done in my view on about five fronts, one of which is land leasing. The second one, and a very important one, is the question of the group purchase scheme.  This is a scheme that is doing extremely well.  I was delighted with the results of the last three months' figures.  These were substantially up on the previous three months.  The concept here is very simple, that where a particular farmer, big or small for that matter, is unable, because of financial restraints, <Col N="402" /> to buy a particular farm, in conjunction with two or three others or as many others as are needed, they will come together to purchase this particular land. The Land Commission will give every assistance in mapping and the division of the land in proportion to what a man is able to pay and we can look back with great satisfaction on some sales where estates were divided and two months after the sale, the farmers with the land divided amongst them were already engaged in farming that land.  In my view that is a much quicker, more straightforward system than the Land Commission actually acquiring land and paying land bonds for it and dividing it four or five years later.  It is something I am very interested in and I feel there is a great future for it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made a few moments ago to the stamp duty exemption.  This has proven to be a great asset in getting land mobility between family members, from father or mother to daughter or son as the case may be.  What this basically means is that the Government pay the stamp duty on the transfer of the farm, provided that it is tied up with a certain educational standard.  I think nobody will quibble when we demand that standard. It is one of the reasons why the 100-hours EEC courses are filled to capacity at the moment with young people whose parents see that this is the right thing to do. On transfer of the farm the stamp duty is paid.  That is an important fact in inheritance. We need a system whereby we can get quicker inheritance so that the people who are highly trained and who have youth on their side will be given the chance to start in farming before they are too old or before their ambition is gone.</P>
    <P>We had two trials of this in this country as you are well aware.  We had two retirement pension schemes that did not work, and these were sponsored by the EEC. Very recently we got a body blow in this country when the EEC Ministers decided Community-wide that they would not actually sponsor or initiate another retirement pension scheme because they said after all that in seven or eight of the nine countries it did not work.  They have now come up with a suggestion that my <Col N="403" /> Department are currently looking at the question of an establishment or installation grant whereby a young person entering farming would be given certain aids and a monetary return for certain things he would do.  I must say that I like the idea, and a group of senior civil servants with whom I have been meeting in the last 12 or 18 months on matters relating to the land question are looking at the various aspects of this scheme.  It is one in which a lot of land will change hands a lot quicker than under the conventional type of retirement scheme, and that is something we will have to look after.</P>
    <P>There are many other points that have been raised on this Bill.  I thought it was a very good discussion on a very emotive subject and one on which everybody has a view.  But I think it is significant that we in this House have initiated a new direction for a more meaningful land policy for this country.  You might describe it as a small step, but when it is built around with other aspects of policy that I have been speaking about I think at the end of the day we will get the type of policy that will mean that almost every acre of land that was heretofore under-utilised will be in production.  Unless we arrive at that stage we are indulging in luxury we cannot afford.  I thank the House and the <Col N="404" /> Senators for their attention.  There are some important smaller points that I am sure will come up on Committee Stage and I will try to answer them then.</P>
