      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Department of Social Welfare to permit the payment of unemployment assistance to two members of the Irish under 18 football team during their participation in the European Youth Championships in Moscow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>Since motion No. 4 would seem to be related to Senator Brendan Ryan's motion and as it is intended that we spend an hour and half on No. 4 and then half an hour on his motion, I wonder would Senator Ryan agree that we should take two hours on No. 4 and incorporate his motion in that discussion because they are related subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the centrepiece of the Bill in the sense that what is intended is to delete certain aspects of the old legislation relating to leasing in the last century.  We want to give a cast-iron guarantee to the owners of land that irrespective of the length of time they have the land actually set to another person, at the end of the period agreed at the time the deal was made the land reverts to the land holder.  This is a very important part of this legislation and it is important for me to point out that, contrary to what many people would suggest, this gives absolute protection to the owners of land.  Heretofore there was a big question mark in the minds of nearly all Irish farmers as to what would happen if, for one reason or another, they leased their land for more than the 11 month conacre system.  That is why that particular system has become so commonplace and it is a system with which everybody disagrees.  Under this proposed legislation whatever may be the agreement arrived at between the lessor and lessee, <Col N="408" /> that is exactly what will happen at the end of the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire if the Minister has any definite term of years in mind for the leasing?  A period of 12 years has been mentioned as the most popular term for leasing but I would have mixed feelings about that because the 12-year lease might be too long.  I would like to inquire if the Minister has set the term of years that will apply under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In elaborating on that point, in my opinion the length of time that is involved in the lease is irrelevant. It is a question of whether, in fact, the security of ownership of the owner of land let for more than the present 11-month conacre system is protected in this Bill because from what the Minister said initially that is what he wants to do.  The length of time is a matter between the owner of the land and the person who wants to lease it from him, whether it is for a year and a half, or two years, or three, or five, or 12 years.  Obviously the longer the lease the better for the person who is leasing it, but provided the ownership of the land is protected the length of the lease is not important and possibly should not be spelled out in the Bill. Could the Minister clarify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point raised has a certain validity.  It seems to me that despite the enactment of this section the Land Commission still have substantial powers under section 45 of the 1955 Land Act whereby their consent must still be sought and given in relation to any lease which is entered into by any party.  If that consent is not applied for and if that consent is not given then the lease is null and void.  That is my understanding of how the matter lies.  What I am concerned about is what criteria the Land Commission will apply in considering applications to them seeking their permission to lease land.  This is the nub of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well repealing these provisions which inhibit entering into new leases but the problem is the terms which the Land Commission will themselves impose when allowing people to enter into <Col N="409" /> leases.  Ultimately that is a policy decision and ultimately the power there lies with the Government of the day who presumably can allow their policy to be carried out by the Land Commission.  I would like to hear the Minister's general comments on that.  Secondly, I would like the Minister to assure the House and the country that if this section is passed into law the owners of land will receive a very definite assurance that at the end of the lease period there will be no interference by the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It is important that potential landlords, if I can use that phrase in this context, be assured that at the end of the lease period there will be no danger of a Land Commission inspector coming around and a notice of inspection being slapped on that land and the person, in effect, losing guarantee by roundabout methods.  If land leasing is to take off and if the repeals which are specified in this section which remove certain inhibitions are to have their full effect, it is important that those who are likely to lease land be given a guarantee that at the end of the period there is no danger that the Land Commission will move in.  I would like to get the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to query whether this ultimately will be a matter for the lay commissioners or a matter for the Land Commission officials.  I make that point because I am concerned at certain decisions reached by the lay commissioners in determining other matters.  I had experience in my own constituency recently where the lay commissioners have made orders dividing estates between people in a most peculiar and a most haphazard way.  I have had a situation where land has been divided and given on order of the lay commissioners to disabled and infirm elderly people and legitimate farmers excluded.  I would be worried if that kind of policy on the part of the lay commissioners were to operate in relation to the applying of conditions when they give the consent to lease land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, many fundamental questions have arisen in the last few minutes.  With your permission, <Col N="410" /> I will give a certain amount of time to them because there are fundamental importance.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Hussey, there is no such thing as a particular pre-determined length of time as far as any lease is concerned.  That is not what we are trying to get at.  The spirit behind this Bill is simply that we want to try to get a new type of farming package that is far superior to the 11-month conacre system.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey mentioned a 12-year lease.  That terminology was born ten or 12 years ago when we joined the EEC the first time.  What happened on that occasion was that it was glibly said around the country that we were going from an 11-month conacre system to a potential 12-year lease situation.  As we have all found out, it did not work for a variety of reasons.  In my view one of the reasons it did not work was because it was far too long in so far as the mentality of Irish farmers is concerned.  I do not have to explain to the House that a farmer who is 60 years of age when leasing his land for 12 years would be 72 when he got it back.  He might hesitate to let it go for that length of time.</P>
      <P>Senators are well aware that since I got this job I have been trying to promote the idea of a short to medium term lease on the basis that, first of all, half a loaf is better than no bread; secondly, the idea is that once we get people off the 11-month conacre system where this is appropriate, a five, six or seven year lease would be possible.  For that reason, there is nothing written into this Bill about the actual length of the lease at all.  It is now entirely up to the lessee and the lessor to come to an agreement themselves as to what length of time that would be.  This is usually agreed between the two of them.  In so far as that is concerned obviously we are not legislating for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why we could not possibly legislate for the length of time is that if you take the tillage areas of this country, they are in effect using a three-year lease as things stand at the moment. but they are three one-year leases because tillage rotation lends itself to that.  When you take the grassland areas as such obviously it would have to be <Col N="411" /> much longer than three years before it would be worth the tenant's while to build up fertility and get a return on his money.  In the grassland areas it is a personal suggestion of mine that we are talking about five, six, seven years &mdash; that type of thing &mdash; so that the farmer who is the tenant in this case would have some hope of recouping his money.  The bottom line in all this business is that there is a few pounds out of it for him.</P>
    <P>To come to Senator Ferris and Senator Durcan, the most important statement that I could make today is that I am giving an absolute guarantee to every Irish land-holder who will decide to enter into agreement on a medium to long-term lease, a bona fide lease as approved by the Irish Land Commission, when that lease has expired the Land Commission will not start proceedings for that land because it has been so registered.  That is of vital importance.  There are many farmers up and down the country, and particularly elderly farmers, who genuinely believe that once the news goes out that they have actually rented their land on a long-term lease that that is the last they will ever own of it, that by the time the lease is up the Land Commission will serve a section 40 order and will acquire it.  I am prepared to go a step further because I appreciate, as much as most would appreciate, that this could be a great deterrent to getting people interested in medium to long-term leasing.  I would be prepared to have it written specifically on each approval issued by the Land Commission, on the bona fide leases as approved by the Land Commission. I cannot go any further than that.  It is an important message to go from the Seanad today that any land so leased will not attract the attention of the acquisition section of the Land Commission.  If there was the smallest doubt that the Land Commission might acquire then the whole concept of leasing as I am promoting it would obviously fall.  I cannot be more specific than that on that matter.</P>
    <P>The other question I would like to refer to is that the Land Commission themselves at the end of the day will be solely in control of the actual leasing arrangements in the sense that they will have to <Col N="412" /> be approved by the Land Commission. That will give an adequate guarantee to people who ask whether there is any danger that this thing could get out of hand. There is no danger, and the Minister of the day will have the authority to decide what conditions might apply to it at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to know that there is no particular period of time for leasing because a lot of things have been bandied about since this debate started in this House.  Periods of five years, ten years and 12 years have been mentioned.  I am pleased to hear the Minister say that does not apply and that it will be up to the parties themselves to fix whatever term of years they want to fix for the lease.  I think a period of five years might be the most suitable because when it goes beyond that people begin to worry.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he would give a guarantee that the Land Commission would not proceed with the acquisition of any holding involved in this leasing arrangement.  I find it very hard to accept that the Minister can give that guarantee because every case is different and there might be a situation where the Land Commission might at some stage have to acquire a particular farm.  I find it hard to accept that the Minister can write that guarantee into any leasing arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect I would like to raise with the Minister through the Chair is the question of elderly people.  We know from our experience of the EEC farm retirement scheme that one of the biggest concerns there was the fact that they lost their social benefits when they became involved in this scheme.  They lost their old age pension and they lost their medical cards and many of the other benefits that they would normally be entitled to. At the end of the day they found they would really have been as well off if they had stayed with the old scheme and did not get involved in the farm retirement scheme at all.  I would like to ask the Minister if he can give any guarantee to those people now.  This is one aspect that he should be harping on if we are to make a success of this scheme, because these <Col N="413" /> are the people whom we are aiming at, the people who are no longer able to work their land and who should be encouraged by whatever means possible to give up that land to younger people who are able to work it and who will make it more productive.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us that he will be able to overlook the income from the leasing in assessing their means for old age pensions or medical cards?  We have to come down to those basics if we are to make a success of this scheme because if the Minister is not able to do something like that the scheme is not going to be the success that he thinks it will be.  The people we are aiming at are people who are no longer able to work their farms, who may be within a year or two of getting the old age pension or who, in fact, may already be receiving the old age pension.  Are they going to be hounded by the social welfare officers as people who are in receipt of farmers' dole are at present and is their income from this leasing arrangement going to be assessed against them when they apply for old age pensions or when their means are being assessed for old age pensions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to develop this a little bit further.  We got an assurance from the Minister on the Second Reading that the income from land leasing would, of course, be assessed as an income but the actual privilege of the ownership of the land would no longer be taken into account in assessing somebody for social welfare.  Perhaps the Minister would like to confirm that.  I understand that is the fundamental principle underlying that and it is a very important point raised by Senator Hussey.  I am pleased with the Minister's assurances about the fundamental right to ownership and the fact that land which comes into this system will not make it a target in the future. Maybe I am trusting as a Member of the House but if the Minister can give an assurance that it will be written by the Land Commission in each transaction, that should hold as being a proper assurance. I do not think it is possible to have it in legislation.  Could the Minister tell <Col N="414" /> me &mdash; Senator Durcan raised this point but the Minister did not really elaborate on it &mdash; what actual norms are the Land Commission going to use to determine the eligibility of people to qualify for land leasing?  Will they consider young, unemployed, rural people, the sons of small farmers, forestry workers and road workers who do not own land and who have no hope at the moment of employment? I know the Land Commission debar people who do not own land.  They want to make holdings more economical by making them bigger.  Will the Minister in this situation hold that against a young person in a rural area who might like to develop horticulture or some other such enterprise and, if so, is it possible that the enterprise allowance scheme could be applicable to such a person?</P>
      <P>We have the scandal of imported vegetables and we have young people who are unemployed and disillusioned because they have nothing to do.  Here is a chance, with tremendous job satisfaction, of being able to go into a leasing situation with the approval of the Land Commission and be able to use it productively for their own benefit and that of their local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was giving an absolute guarantee that section 40 would not be brought into effect after a leasing period.  I would ask the Minister how can he give an absolute guarantee that the Land Commission will be there in five years time?  There is no way that a Minister can come into this House and give an absolute guarantee.  I was surprised to hear the Leader of the Labour group saying that the privilege of owning land would not be taken into account when assessing income.  We have been told by the Minister for Social Welfare that when assessing&mdash;it was called farmers' dole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>For land leasing only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has stated quite categorically that in all circumstances the ownership of land is to be taken into account when assessing income for social welfare <Col N="415" /> benefits and irrespective of the fact that there might be no stock on that land it will be assessed.  It is categorically stated in the Social Welfare Act that the ownership of land, irrespective of the income from the land, has to be taken into account when assessing income even if there is no income.  Therefore, in the case of a person who is looking for farmers' dole or unemployment assistance related to farm ownership, the ownership of land is taken into account.  I would ask the Minister to say how he can give an absolute guarantee and also to say if there has been a change in Government policy so that the ownership of land is not now being taken into account when assessing income for welfare benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little worried about the Minister's guarantee.  I accept the Minister's bona fides with regard to this matter and I know that the Minister's intention, while he is Minister, is to ensure that the policy he has enunciated is carried out but it seems that the power here lies with the Land Commission. My worry is that in the event of an inspection notice being served and in the event of a matter of this nature arising before a Land Commission court, will they take note of any guarantee contained in a letter authorising a lease?  I will draw an analogy with this.  I am aware of a situation where the Land Commission gave consent to subdivide a holding. To do so, they had full details of the intended purchaser.  Six months later the Land Commission themselves served an inspection notice on those lands and subsequently the court of the Irish Land Commission held that those lands would be acquired by the Land Commission.  I can give the Minister details of a particular case if he wishes.  That was a case where the Land Commission consented to allowing a particular person to acquire land and within a matter of months moved in.  My worry is that in a case where the Land Commission would give consent to leasing for a particular period, at the end of that period, no matter what guarantees are given in this House, the Land Commission would then serve an inspection notice and that the court of <Col N="416" /> the Irish Land Commission would decide to acquire these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Bill as a type of trial spin Bill, the views of the Minister and what he had in mind at the outset much diluted.  It does nothing really.  There is nothing in the Bill to attract people in a very sensitive area. There is no protection and no development structures in the Bill.  I believe it will fall by the wayside in a very short time.  There is a bit of flexibility in it as regards the 11-month leasing system.  But the Minister must remember that he is dealing with hundreds of thousands of acres of derelict land that is in the possession of old people, widowers, disabled and incapacitated people who are unable to do anything productive on their land but have continued to lease it on an 11-month system just to hold possession.</P>
      <P>If anything is dear to a farmer it is his land, especially if it has been handed down from generation to generation and he is not going to give in lightly.  Unless he gets some measure of security in the leasing system there is no way that he will yield under this Bill or indeed any other Bill that has not got some protective measures built into it.  The 12-year period would be ideal in a situation where a reclamation system was brought into being, whereby derelict land could be reclaimed and the lessee would avail of grants and in the long-term would improve the status of the land, on the one hand, and improve his lot, on the other. If he had to hand back the land it would be in a much more viable condition than when he took it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the social welfare side of it, there is no protection.  It is all right for the Minister to give undertakings but Ministers are birds of passage and some of them are very short-lived, as has been shown in the past decade.  They come and go and I am sure the Minister realises that.  Even if you are not defeated at election time you are moved to the side if you try to do anything worthwhile.  I am not disregarding what this Minister is trying to do.  Nobody knows more about land leasing, about the structure of land and where this Bill might apply.  I am <Col N="417" /> disappointed that it will not achieve the necessary acceleration of leasing.  That is my view and I think it will be the view of most people who will examine it.  It has not gone far enough.  It would have been a good thing to have some provision in the Bill for a reclamation programme where the man leasing land would take it over and reclaim it.  On a long-term lease he would have ten or 11 years of production capital recoupment in that type of policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social welfare aspect I can assure the Minister that the people in the west who have very small holdings which they hold dear to their hearts will not go on a leasing spree unless they get guarantees that the pension officer and the social welfare officer will not be on the doorstep and that eventually they will be able to get back their holdings if they lease them.  They like to see them productive; they do not like to see them going derelict.  Nobody likes to see his farm go derelict.  It is no good to the nation and it is no good to the lessee or to anybody.</P>
    <P>My view is that the Bill does not go far enough.  It is a trial operation that will probably die fast because it will not have the necessary attractiveness.  The same happened in the case of many other Bills which were projected as positive Bills.  It is a sensitive area.  I am disappointed that it is not more attractive because it could then give more production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; was mentioned.  That is one of the problems that we hope this Bill will overcome. At present much derelict land is land that has been leased on the 11-month basis.  Making it possible to have a leasing period for longer than the 11 months will overcome the problem of this derelict land.  I would submit that it could be a very important inducement to the owner of the land because if his land is to be leased for a number of years, be it three years, five years, eight years or whatever, he must know that the person leasing it will attend to the land in order <Col N="418" /> to get the maximum out of it.  Utilisation will be maximised and in the process the state of the land and the general standard of fertility and so on will be improved. That is a very important inducement.</P>
      <P>I would also be concerned about the absolute guarantee that would be given and how well it would stand up in the future.  It is a matter to which the Minister might attend before finalisation of this. On the question of attraction, incentive and inducement, I believe that the person owning the land will be attracted to a leasing arrangement, knowing that the land must be better managed if it is taken over a number of years; the person taking the land will be attracted to the process knowing that he or she can do something worthwhile over a number of years.  It is important to mention that.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this section deals with what I have to say now.  It is in connection with a letter which I, and I presume every other Member of the Oireachtas received from the Department.  It came from the Tipperary office in Thurles.  I will quote from one section which states:</P>
      <P>The Land Commission with the co-operation of the local solicitor or auctioneer wishes to encourage selected clients for whom it would be of benefit to enter a lease arrangement for three years, six years, nine years or twelve years.  A bonus of up to £3,000 maximum in addition to the lease rent, plus a pension of £2,268 for a married person and £1,512 for a single person, is available to qualified farmers who lease their land for a minimum of twelve years under the farmers's retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>The crunch there is that applications for this scheme were to be made by 30 June 1984.  It seems from what has been said in this letter that this is a very attractive scheme, but how many know about it and know that the closing date is 30 June? What is going to happen after 30 June? Will there be the same attraction in the new Bill?  If not, people will not be enticed to lease land.  I feel that many people never heard about this at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered whether we were on the section or on Second Stage. There are two points I want to make that are relevant in this discussion.  First of all there is the strength of the guarantee.  I understood the Minister to say that the Land Commission will not attempt to acquire land that is made available for long-term leasing, against the wishes of the owner of that land.  I assume that this guarantee is somehow or other grounded in the various amendments to the Bill before us.  I would expect the Minister to clarify that.</P>
      <P>The other matter is the attractiveness of getting this long-term leasing under way.  I recognise the importance of the social welfare entitlements and the effects that leasing income could have on these.  In reality the Minister is attempting to release the kind of land that is in the possession of elderly people.  Therefore, it is the effect on old age pensioners we are concerned about.  If we are talking about the dole, forestry workers and road workers and so on, if these are people in their prime and they are already employed for a normal week's working hours I would be amazed if they are not putting their land to some productive use. I do not imagine that the volume of land we are concerned about here is tied up in the hands of these people.  I think the Minister is aiming at land that is in the hands of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated in at least facing up to a problem that has been there for a long time and getting this land, which has been described as derelict in many cases, back into productive use.  We should be concerned with the guarantee aspect and with the implications where income assessment and old age pensions are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a definition of the minimum time for a lease, in spite of what the Minister has said.  It would seem that three years would be an appropriate minimum period.  Otherwise it seems that it is possible to lease land for a period of one year and by doing so it would be possible to obtain the benefits from leasing without any advantage accruing.  In other words, <Col N="420" /> the farmer could lease his land for a period of a year, there would be no great difference to the 11-month system and there would be benefits in doing it that way.  The Minister has said that the Land Commission would have to approve of the lease.  Does that mean that the Land Commission could veto the lease and could, for example, refuse to ratify a lease unless the period of time was increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has gone off on a slight tangent in the sense that what we are doing is creating an environment whereby medium to long-term leasing can actually flourish.  Until the introduction of this legislation there were certain fears and anxieties held and expressed by many farm owners that, if they leased other than on the 11-month conacre system, under certain conditions they might not be able to get the tenant out.  This is the fundamental reason this Bill has come before the House.  It has nothing to do with attractions, although I will come to that later.  Our entire goal in so far as this leasing Bill is concerned is to give the cast-iron guarantee in legislation that, save for the agreement that has been reached between the lessor and the lessee in the master lease, nothing else counts.  That is it in layman's language. That is not the way the system has worked up to now.  It is a fundamental change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this is one of the most important smaller pieces of legislation. We will never get the concept of long-term leasing as a profitable farm enterprise unless we change the ground rules and that is exactly what I am changing today.  It appears that many Senators are beginning to think that this legislation will mean that we are only aiming at a very small minority of land holders.  That is not the case at all.  It has often been said to me that this was framed with a view to helping under-utilised land in the west.  I would not agree with that, although I hope it will achieve that result. In the best and most fertile areas of ground I see long-term leasing becoming a concept in Irish agriculture as familiar as ownership.  We have to distinguish at <Col N="421" /> this stage in the progress of agriculture between the ownership of land and the usage of land.  I am giving a cast-iron guarantee in this legislation that any land holder who decides for one reason or another to allow his land to be leased is sure of getting it back.  There is no more or no less to be said in so far as that principle is concerned.</P>
    <P>Many Senators seem to believe that this is aimed specifically at creating the environment in which elderly folk will want to get rid of their land, particularly in the smaller farming areas.  I can see a great use for this even in the Golden Vale, on the basis that there is not a townland in Ireland in which land is not set on the 11-month system or some other system, or held by various types of people who would not be in a position to farm their land, for reasons which have nothing to do with age at all.  I am creating the environment now whereby those people can assist an already up and coming farmer who might want to get an extra 30, 40 or 50 acres to add to his existing holding.  This is something I have been at pains to point out in the last 12 months all over the country.  I want to organise this system on the basis that when this becomes law many medium-sized farmers in the best land in Ireland will use the home farm as the resource centre, in the sense that there is machinery there, and a farmer, with the help of his family locally, will get that self-sparking generation that will ensure an adequate income for himself and his wife.</P>
    <P>We have missed the point in many of the contributions here today.  We are not talking about one specific type of people. We are talking about a whole new area. Most of the people I have spoken to all over Ireland in the past 12 months would agree, because the price of agricultural land is so dear, even at this depressed stage, that based on the current interest rates it is almost impossible for anybody to borrow the money to buy the land, farm it and still make a living.  I would not waste the time of the House in explaining the realities of life in so far as purchased land is concerned.  Long-term leasing has a great attraction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> Senator Ferris spoke about persons who have a particular qualification, an interest in farming and who have been highly trained, landless young people who would never have got a chance to get into agriculture and who would never aspire to be able to have enough to buy a farm.  Through this legislation we are creating the groung rules whereby all those things are possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey and Senator O'Toole and many others spoke about this Bill as a side-kick measure.  There are many things that I have been looking at in the last 12 months that will run with this Bill once it is passed into law and will make it attractive to people to get involved.  It is a two-sided business.  On one side, the farmer who actually owns the land will certainly not get rid of it just because it is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to do, a novel idea.  He will only do so when he believes that it is the best thing in his circumstances.  Principally he will know that he will get his land back in good heart and in a high state of fertility at the end of the lease. As well as that, he will know that he will have a set income for the number of years involved, far removed from the hustling to get a customer every 11 or 12 months. He will have a guaranteed income for the duration of the lease.  Built into all those leases will be escalator clauses and cost of living allowances that will mean that all those leases can be looked at after two, three or five years to ensure that the lessor's income will pace itself with inflation or the cost of living index.</P>
    <P>We have to talk also about the tenant. What is in it for him?  Many Senators have mentioned this point.  There is one very important aspect which has not gone unnoticed but in my view has not got the type of exposure to which it is entitled. For the first time ever I am able to inform this House that stock relief facilities will now apply to land leased to the tenant.  I will not waste the time of the House in explaining in detail all the ins and outs of stock relief but it is important to point out that for the first time ever this facility will be made available to the tenant.</P>
    <P>I now come to the social welfare aspect.  Because of where I come from and the background that I have which is <Col N="423" /> similar to that of most Senators, I am fully aware of the impact that the social welfare system has on the mentality of Irish farmers, particularly small farmers. I am very well aware that if a system is introduced which will ensure that certain type of benefit will not come to a farmer, then it is more than likely we will not have any change.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the farm retirement pension scheme.  One of the reasons that did not work out as well as we would have liked was that many of the farmers found that they were better off holding on to their land and getting the State benefit available to everybody than giving up their land.</P>
    <P>There is one very important facility that I have negotiated with the Social Welfare Department.  Heretofore there were two different types of assessment for old age pension.  When a farmer reached the age of 66 he, being a land holder, was assessed in a particular way if he was the owner of the farm.  For some strange reason within the Act itself his income was calculated on a different basis if he had his land leased.  There was a major difference there and it was far more advantageous to an old age pensioner to own land than have it leased. The Minister for Social Welfare saw fit to equalise that and we can give an assurance to every potential old age pensioner in rural Ireland that he or she is at no disadvantage whether the land is leased or owned.  That is a very important change of policy and I would certainly congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on a change which has been spoken about for many years.  I remember when this was first mooted ten or 12 years ago. It is now a fact of life and a very important one.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, Senators Durcan in particular, spoke at length about the guarantee I am giving in regard to the acquisition of land leased on a long-term basis. All I can do as Minister of the day is give an absolute commitment as I see it that land so leased will not attract the eye of the Land Commission.  A number of Senators mentioned that Governments and Ministers come and go and Senator Lanigan asked what would happen if the <Col N="424" /> Land Commission as we know it went out of business.  Obviously it goes without saying that if the Land Commission were not there they could not be in a position either to change the decision that I am making now or to do anything else.  Even if they were there, we have to acknowledge that this is a very serious national issue outside the mainstream of party politics.  We have a natural resource of abour five or six million acres that are underutilised, while we have 220,000 people out of work.  That is a luxury we cannot afford.  Through this legislation I hope that we will be doing our bit even away from farming in the sense that we will be creating extra jobs as well.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that this will give an opening to the second son on many farms in the best farming areas.</P>
    <P>There were many other aspects mentioned. What I am doing today is something that has been looked for in this country for many years, to change the balance between the landlord and the tenant, between the farmer and the tenant in this case.  We are giving this absolute guarantee to the farmer that on the expiry of the lease he will get his land back.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I missed that point.  The Senator was referring to the farm retirement pension scheme. There was an increase in the pension rates recently.  That is the scheme we were speaking of that had not the attraction we would have liked.  Whether the final date id 30 June, 30 August or 30 December would not make much difference. Because of the various impediments on that retirement pension scheme it never really got off the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression the letter gives is that it is not a retirement scheme.  It mentions lease arrangements. The retirement scheme was where the farmer gave up his farm altogether.  It was never his again but under the leasing system it will be his.  Whether or not it is a mistake, this letter came from branch <Col N="425" /> offices of the Department around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This retirement pension scheme would extend to long-term leasing as well in so far as the farm retirement pension scheme would extend to the 12-year lease system.  The Senator is very well aware that we have quite a long way to go before we actually get 12-year leases as the rule of thumb but one would hope that in the future this scheme would take off.  What we are doing here today is of fundamental importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that this Bill would not apply to any specific type of people and I am satisfied that that is so.  There will be people in the midlands and in the better off regions of the country who will avail of the provisions of this Bill just as they will do in the west.  But statistics have proved that the greatest acreage of land lying derelict at present rests with people who are in receipt of social benefits such as old age pensioners and people who are in receipt of other benefits also.  For that reason it is very important that those people would be reassured that in the event of their participating in this scheme at any stages they will not suffer any loss of benefit.  Unless you can do that it is going to be a major weakness in the Bill. I pointed out before the problems we were confronted with in relation to the EEC farm retirement scheme.  We are going to have the very same problems here under this Bill unless we can get those people who hold the greatest acreage of land at present and who because of age, infirmity, or other reasons, are not able to bring that land into productive use, to take part in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important, particularly for people in the west, that that type of guarantee should be given.  It would be more important than the guarantee that the Minister is talking about, the guarantee that in the event of people participating in this leasing scheme the Land Commission will not proceed with acquisition of the holding at the end of that leasing.  For <Col N="426" /> the present time it would be very important that people who are in receipt of social benefits would be given some assurance before they participate in this scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other things I would like to know and to which the Minister has not referred yet.  At what stage would the Land Commission come into the picture here?  Are they consulted before the lease is drawn up or are they merely brought in to vet the participants after the lease has been signed?  Do they have to verify the farmers who are taking part?  In other words, what criteria are the Land Commission going to use &mdash; I take it that most of the people participating in the scheme will be young people &mdash; to decide the type of young person who is going to participate in this scheme? What type of farmers are going to be allowed to participate?  Will farmers' sons, or people who had no knowledge of farming qualify?  If a shopkeeper's son or a businessman's son is anxious to go into the agricultural business, will he be allowed by the Land Commission to participate in that scheme?  These are just a few points that I would like the Minister to clear up before we leave this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in reply to Senator Hussey on the question of the social welfare benefits, as the Senator is well aware &mdash; he has been in this particular hot seat himself &mdash; over the years this has always become a very vexed question as to the relationship between the owners of property and their entitlement to social welfare benefits.  If one were to take at face value what Senator Hussey appears to be implying, that no matter who leases land a guarantee should be given that he would actually qualify for social welfare benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not so.  It is only those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits already because those are the people &mdash; the majority of whom I take it are not capable of working their land &mdash; we would want to encourage to surrender their land for a period of five or ten years to younger and more progressive farmers. <Col N="427" /> Those are the people I am thinking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I misunderstood the Senator.  There would obviously be a major problem if one were to look at it from the other side.  What my Department and myself are looking at are various other methods by which we would ensure that there would be no deterrent or impediment to farmers leasing land in so far as their social welfare benefits are concerned.  At the moment we are negotiating with the Department of Social Welfare on a number of aspects of this matter.  It is very important &mdash; and I agree with Senator Hussey &mdash; that we would do everything possible to ensure that persons who are in receipt of social welfare benefits would not be worse off at the end of the day just because they lease their land.  I will accept, coming from the area of the country that I come from, that that is a reasonable point and it is something that I am looking at.  I would also say, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that in regard to many of the items that have been mentioned here today this is an entirely new ball game.  For the length of time that I am in the Department sufficient gains have been made to get it across that this particular system is on the right road.  There are other aspects of it that would be mentioned through taxation and so on, combined with social welfare benefits, at which we are looking at this very moment.  It is important at this stage that the package that will develop after this, once the legislation is there, should be attractive in the sense that people will genuinely believe that they are better off having their land leased and that there is no great obstacle in so far as social welfare benefits are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards type of participants and the type of people that are likely to be allowed to lease land, that is another big area.  In my view &mdash; this is something which would almost go without saying &mdash; it is important that people who would actually lease land would, if you like, have a training in agriculture or have an interest in it in such a way as to have shown by their experience that they have <Col N="428" /> attained a certain standard which would allow them to farm the land in a very efficient manner.  What is important in this is the land usage to ensure that persons who are suitably qualified will in fact be allowed to expand.  I think there is a great future for landless trained young people, first and second sons on Irish farms and so on.  It opens up a whole new horizon.  From time to time there will be certain conditions laid down for entry. The Land Commission will be very, very interested in the whole concept of land leasing.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a number of our local inspectors were brought to Dublin and they were assigned special responsibility in all the Land Commission offices in the country to go out and sell the concept of leasing.  That is what they are doing.  Might I put it on the record of the House today that they are available to attend farmers' meetings of any description or indeed deal with anybody who wants to talk to them about leasing, or potential land owners and tenants.  They will be delighted to talk to them.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Hussey, the Land Commission would be officially concerned with the ratification of the actual lease itself when the lessor and the lessee present the lease to the Land Commission. You can take it from my reply that persons interested in making a living from the land will be very much in vogue in as far as land leasing is concerned. Everybody in the House would agree that a better utilisation of our land is the primary objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that as a result of the passing of this Bill the investigation at present taking place into the incomes of over 80,000 farmers in this country under the provisions made in the budget is going to cease?  The factual assessment of all farmers will cease as a result of the passing of this Bill.  The Minister said that the income from leasing will not be taken into consideration in the case of unemployment assessment. I think that is what Senator Hussey is trying to point out: it will be assessed under the factual assessment of 80,000 <Col N="429" /> farmers taking place over a three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. What I said was &mdash; and I am not sure whether Senator O'Toole was in when I was explaining it &mdash; that the change that has been made in so far as land leased is concerned is that heretofore &mdash; and I gave the example of where a particular farmer on reaching old age pension age of 66 was disadvantaged by the fact &mdash; if a farmer had his land leased on a long-term lease he was at a greater disadvantage than if he actually owned the land.  Through negotiations with the Department of Social Welfare that has been equalised: in other words, whether he has long-term leases or actually owns the land he is on the same level.  Heretofore, there was positive discrimination against him if he had his land leased.  That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan was unhappy about my interpretation of this. I am quoting previous social welfare legislation in which there is a specific section, section 9, which excludes the actual advantage of owning the property for social welfare purposes.  But the actual income from the leasing of course is taken into account to determine a person's income, and rightly so.  Senator Lanigan seems to be amazed that I should suggest for a moment that the ownership of land should not be held against somebody. But for the purpose of leasing, the advantage of owning the land will not be held against the person, only the income derived from the leasing itself.  That is a legitimate income that can be documented and proved and that will remove some of the anomalies that are at present used in the system of determining what the income of a smallholder is because there are so many different ways of calculating what a person is supposed to be earning, as he owns the land, that discrepancies have arisen since the new Act has been brought into being providing that everybody would be assessed on means.  Heretofore, it was on a valuation basis.  We discovered through the investigation process that not alone were farmers treated in a different way now, but <Col N="430" /> they were unable to determine on what basis the social welfare investigating officer made his decisions.  That is the fundamental change made recently: they now have to be told on what grounds they are being debarred.  So, in other words, the person investigating them will have to say how the supposed income is arrived at.  In this case of leasing you will know the income because it will be there in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact that they will be told why they are being debarred does not make the medicine any sweeter, I am afraid.  There are still quite a few of them being debarred.  But again, I go back to this point.  It is very important and I would like it if the Minister could have some guarantee written into this Bill under this section to accommodate those people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Unless he does that, again I repeat he is not going to have the success with this Bill that all of us would like him to have.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister in relation to young people in particular leasing land, has he considered the possibility of bringing in the lending institutions such as the ACC or the banks to help those people, because we know that most young people, whether they are farmers' sons or whatever, would not have the necessary capital to go out and purchase stock to put on land and also to pay the annuities on that land?  Would it not be possible to devise some scheme now that this Bill is going through whereby those farmers would be able to get money at reduced interest rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that something like that would be done, particularly for the younger people who are starting off in farming, who may have completed certain courses in agriculture and who are anxious to prove themselves in agriculture. It is very important that the lending institutions be brought in here, but not as they were in 1978 or 1979 or in those years of Irish agriculture when the lending institutions were throwing out money all over the place and farmers are now finding themselves in serious financial trouble as a result of the policies at that <Col N="431" /> time.  It is important to have them in and to give certain guarantees as regards the financing of young farmers, who are willing to participate in this scheme, for the purchase of livestock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken the step of meeting the Banks' Standing Committee.  I met them some months ago when I put the proposal and my views on the way leasing was likely to go in this country.  Let me state here today, that as far as the concepts were concerned they gave me every assurance that they would be prepared from a commercial point of view to be involved in this.  The whole question of leasing, as the Senator would be aware, raises the question of guarantees and security and this kind of thing.  Obviously, in a leasing set-up, the banking institutions would not have access to the title deeds of farms. This is something that I was very anxious to discuss with them.  I must say I was informed by the Banks' Standing Committee on that occasion that where suitable long-term leases were drawn up as such and while obviously there are many other sides to this story where this long-term lease was decided on and given the &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo; by the Land Commission, from a commercial point of view the banks &mdash; and indeed, the ACC &mdash; would be very interested in lending finance to this type of project.  It is something that many young people around the country have actually used since then.  I know what Senator Hussey was speaking about was a reduced level of bank interest.  This is something that I obviously would have to look at in the overall context of where leasing will actually go from now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking power under this section to waive purchase annuities or land reclamation annuities or other payments to the Land Commission of £2 and under.  I would have <Col N="432" /> thought it might have been more easily understood by very many landowners and farmers in the country if the Land Commission collection branch in Castlebar had written to people with those small annuities and offered to dispose of the payments by shortening the term of years.  If the annual repayment is £2, you are talking about deals especially for the land annuities, perhaps in the earlier Land Acts of the last century.  Perhaps it would have been more economically appropriate for the Minister to have offered to have the people shorten the term of years and people might understand it a little better.</P>
      <P>For a number of years there has been a reluctance by the Land Commission to allow farmers to redeem their annuities. I know that I tried unsuccessfully a few years ago to get a clearance on 15 shillings a half-year.  There was only about £18 outstanding at the time.  I cannot understand the policy of a Department that maintains that kind of rigidity.  Yet you have the Minister specifically taking power in this Bill to discontinue the collection because by virtue of the fact of inflation and so on, it has become uneconomic to collect it.  I should imagine &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that what he is talking about is the land purchase annuities going back to the 1883 Act and perhaps earlier Acts in the last century.  We are coming on to the tail end of the repayments.</P>

      <P>I would agree with what Senator McDonald said.  Indeed, I cannot understand why the Land Commission would not be prepared to accept redemption of land annuities from farmers who are in a position to pay them. You would imagine it would be a source of income for the Land Commission.  I do not know whether many farmers would avail of that or not.  I know that in the allocation of new lands at present &mdash; indeed going back over the last two years &mdash; the Land Commission give the option to farmers to buy out whatever land they are allocating.  I think that is a very good thing.  Quite a few of the farmers availed of that scheme and paid for the land and they were finished with it then.  The same <Col N="433" /> should apply here in regard to this money that is outstanding to the Land Commission. If people were reminded that they can redeem their annuities if they pay X number of pounds inside a certain date I do not think this would be any problem. The Land Commission should avail of whatever they get.  Maybe the Minister would be able to tell us what amount of money is involved, how many million, or whatever.  I think there is included in that a land reclamation annuity.  The Department of Agriculture had a scheme some years ago whereby the cost of reclaiming land was put on to the rent and perhaps that makes up part of this outstanding money.  If there is an opportunity of collecting it by voluntary effort I see no reason why the Land Commission should not put it to the farmers and see what they would get out of it.</P>

      <P>I think this is a very fundamental issue and I think the Minister should make a statement on this because terminating this agreement by this Bill would be fatal but if there is built into it an agreement whereby redemption of the annuity is on the cards there would be a number of farmers who would have almost reached the stage of getting the land back as freehold, they would welcome this.  It may be unconstitutional to interrupt or terminate the annuity law that we have in operation, but if we have an assurance that there is going to be provision made for immediate redemption and that the people are aware of this when this Bill is passed, that is all right. Some people may not be able to redeem, short-term people who have a very high land annuity who got into possession of land recently.  There are a number of old holders, such as the one mentioned by Senator McDonald, and others who would redeem their holdings now if they got the opportunity of doing so and the Minister should answer it because it is a vital question and should be answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I note the concern of the Senators involved.  I want to give the background as to why that is there at all.  As the Senator would be very <Col N="434" /> well aware, there are farmers whose annuities payable to the Land Commission are ever so small, shillings in certain cases.  We arrived at the situation a year ago when we found that anything under £2 was costing nearly £3 to collect.  It goes without saying that that is not a very profitable exercise.  What we are actually doing now is that we are enacting legislation that will allow us in the years to come, where that £2 would have become £5 maybe in ten years' time, to write it off as being uneconomic, as not just worth collecting.  This is not adding anything new at all or increasing annuities or anything like that.  To go back to Senator O'Toole's point, it is a good one. Arrangements are being made now in my Department to send a circular to everybody concerned announcing that it is now possible to redeem the annuities.  For many of them there will be very small amounts involved.  I assume many of them will avail of the opportunity as they have done in the past.  I am surprised at Senator McDonald's assertion that on numerous occasions he found there was inflexibility by the Land Commission in allowing this to happen.  I would have thought that the Land Commission would always like to be able to get revenue in. It is something that I am surprised to hear.  That is the basis of the Bill and all it does is give enough flexibility in future 4years to change to a particular figure which would be uneconomic at that stage. I will take up what Senator O'Toole and Senator Hussey said, that if many people knew at this stage that they could redeem they would do so.  This information will be circulated to them very shortly.  I assume that many of them will do that.</P>

      <P>The one thing that I, as a landowner or farmer, would cherish dearly is the fact of being on the register of freeholders.  If the Minister stopped at due payments of £2 or less, what I want to know is does it take from my legal right to be a freeholder.  If someone turns over the book in five or ten years time and sees that there is some outstanding payment there, will the Department say: &ldquo;This file is now closed and the debt has been met in full and you are now a freeholder&rdquo;? <Col N="435" /> Can you get a note from the collection department saying that?</P>

      <P>I would like to query this statement in the explanatory memorandum:</P>
      <P>empowers the Land Commission to determine that a purchase annuity technically set up only on vesting, has been set up at an earlier date.  Allottees holding land from the Land Commission under certain types of temporary agreements are merely paying interest. Under the law as it now stands such allottees do not begin to repay their purchase moneys until the property is invested in them.</P>
      <P>We know that in many cases that takes a long time and this can be caused by many reasons where you have legal problems and where you have problems as regards title and so on.  I understand that the Land Commission can now go back over the years from the time the land was allotted and collect their annuities from that date.  I am just wondering is this going to create difficulty for some people who might be allotted land for which in some cases the annuity was fairly high.  Is it going to create many problems for them now?</P>

The matter is now regularised at this stage. The tenant would have been paying anyway but this provision allows whatever money would be paid to go against the actual amounts owed, so, in so far as that is concerned there is no real change.</P>

      <P>As a matter of curiosity is the Minister able to say how much unregistered land there is in the country? <Col N="437" /> Has he any indication to hand?  I understand there is a procedure under the Registration of Title Act whereby in certain designated counties any dealing affecting land has to be registered compulsorily in the Land Registry.  I should like to know if the Minister would consider, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, extending that provision to ensure that all land in future is registered when any dealing affects it.  I raise the point because the issue arises in my own county, particularly in the north-west Mayo area, in the Erris area, where there are vast tracts of unregistered land.  This can create difficulties when one is dealing with title to those lands.  This in turn is the cause of many disputes and, indeed, agrarian warfare is still occurring in parts of north-west Mayo.</P>

Senator Durcan spoke about a very important aspect which the section relates to. As the House is aware I have initiated a national scheme for the rearrangement of land.  For obvious reasons it will certainly happen &mdash; indeed it has already happened &mdash; that farmers will want to exchange land with each other and some of it will be registered and some not. Before this that could not take place unless we went a very long way about it and having the Land Commission acquire and so on.  When this section is passed we will be in a position to exchange the procedure and have rearrangement in a voluntary way as we are now approaching it. The Land Commission will be able to help farmers who own registered land and unregistered land to exchange.  That is very important.  With regard to what Senator Durcan mentioned, I will talk to the Minister for Justice about that matter. I do not know how far away we are from that but we are certainly on the right road now.</P>

    <Title>Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short technical Bill which has two purposes.  The main purpose is to amend <Col N="440" /> section 56 and 57 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, so as to give the full effect of the original intentions of the sections to transfer certain legal liabilities from the Minister, the Minister for Finance and the State to the newly established statutory companies. That amendment is required to have effect from 1 January 1984.</P>
      <P>Sections 56 and 57 of the 1983 Act were intended to transfer to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, as appropriate, all liabilities attaching to the national postal and telecommunications services in respect of claims and court proceedings arising from events that occurred before 1 January 1984 but which had not been settled before that date.  As Senators will be aware, the two companies took over the operation of those services on 1 January 1984.  Similarly, the benefits of claims being made or actions being taken on behalf of the services and which had not been settled by 1 January 1984 were intended to pass to the companies.  The purpose was to provide for continuity of these claims and proceedings, and as from that date all the necessary staff and records were transferred to the companies to deal with those cases as well as with all cases arising after 1 January 1984 from their own operation of the services. That was accepted by the interim boards, An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom.  It is a perfectly routine and logical section in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am advised that as worded, sections 56 and 57 transferred liability to the bodies only in cases in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was a party.  The effect of this was that, contrary to the intention of the legislation, the sections did not transfer liability in cases which arose before 1 January 1984, in which the State itself, or the Minister for Finance, was a party.  Two principal classes of claims are involved.  The main example of the first is where negligence had been attributed to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to road works arising from cabling operations. The second class relates mainly to cases in which negligence arising out of the driving of departmentally-owned motor vehicles had been attributed to <Col N="441" /> employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 correct the defect in the 1983 Act by transferring liability &mdash; and benefit, where it arises &mdash; in all such cases to the appropriate company with effect from 1 January 1984.  Section 2 also makes provision for the cost of any settlements made in such cases since 1 January 1984 to be borne by the appropriate company.  Cases are in progress in regard to that period.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that some £1.3 million could be involved in these cases, of which about £1 million would be in respect of the telecommunications service, the balance affecting the postal service.  In the nature of things, many claims are not made or cases do not come to attention until quite some time after the event and this obviously makes it very difficult to forecast the costs involved.  The general estimate is that it is of the nature of £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>Because of the defect in sections 56 and 57, the Chief State Solicitor and his staff have had to deal with cases since 1 January 1984 in which the State, or the Minister for Finance, was a party.  They will continue to do so until this Bill is enacted.  It is, therefore, necessary to recover the expense involved in those cases from An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, as appropriate, and section 4 of the Bill provides accordingly.  Again, straightforward compensation for the Chief State Solicitor and his staff for work on these cases since 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for the Minister for Finance meeting certain claims covered by this Act in the highly unlikely event of either company failing to pay up on foot of a judgment against it.  That is a routine precaution.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is simply to empower the Minister for Communications, as successor to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to repair any errors and omissions in the list of staff designated by him in December 1983 under section 45 (1) of the same Act, for employment by An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann as from 1 January 1984. Section 5 deals with that and amends <Col N="442" /> section 45 (1) to enable the Minister to make any necessary corrections.  In an exercise involving some 30,000 staff, spread over very many locations around the State, it was perhaps inevitable that errors and omissions would arise.  Thus, section 5 is simply a technical provision. In other words, under the existing legislation it was found that we could not amend the list.  In many cases there were just typing errors of one sort or another involved.  In smaller post offices people were not certain whether they were employed by An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann.  I can assure the House &mdash; this assurance I want to give very strongly because it is something that was involved very much as this was going through the Dáil &mdash; that all the safeguards and guarantees provided for the transfer of staff in the 1983 Act are not interfered with in the slightest.  They are all existing.  I understand that the boards have been in contact with the trade unions with this explanation.  The point was raised in the Lower House but no difficulties arise in that respect.  I can assure the House absolutely on that.  It is merely enabling corrections to be made in a list of staff, involving about 30,000.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from what I have said, the Bill is a technical one which is required to make to the 1983 Act certain modifications which have been found to be necessary.  Naturally there is a certain amount of urgency about the Bill to get the whole thing on a proper basis and I am most desirable to have it enacted at an early date.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

I was glad to hear the Minister reiterate that all the safeguards that were discussed at some length in 1983 in both Houses will not be tampered with in any way. The Bill gives the House an opportunity to have another look at the posts and telecommunications services since the legislation was enacted in 1983.  Fianna Fáil take great pride in the fact that they <Col N="443" /> initiated the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill in 1982, which was the first step in setting up these two bodies. I must, however, point out the great need for improvements in the services.  With regard to Telecom Éireann, I should like to know what progress has been made in reducing the long waiting period between the submission of application forms for services and the actual installation of apparatus and commencement of services.</P>

It shows that in spite of all the effort we put into considering the original legislation we still miss little words which are so important.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has given assurances in connection with section 5 which deals with staff.  Senator Cassidy claimed responsibility and credit for initiating the Bill but I should like to say that my party claim all the credit for ensuring that the Bill was properly amended so that the staff in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann are looked after properly.  I accept the Minister's assurance that this technical amendment does not in any way interfere with the safeguards and guarantees we rightly put into the legislation.  I am more than pleased we did that and I am glad we had the co-operation of the Opposition in doing so.  It is very important when people who are involved in the public sector suddenly have their terms of employment changed and find themselves in semi-State organisation that every benefit they enjoyed continues after they are transferred. Otherwise we would have had an industrial revolution.

    <P>Since it looks as if the Bill has been brought in by two parties already, I should like to put it on the record of the <Col N="445" /> House that it seems to have been a political Bill that was taken up by two or three different Governments in a short space of time and handled very well by a Fine Gael Minister in the Government. We should be very broadminded and give credit to everybody.  I should like to compliment the Minister on coming in with the amendments when they were needed and not waiting until everybody had problems.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to strike an unusual note.  There is a total welcome for this measure which the Minister said will give effect to the original intentions of the sections of the earlier Act.  I am concerned at this stage because of a particular problem that has come to my intention and I believe that the Minister should pause at this stage to be absolutely sure of what will develop or may take place once this transaction is fully in order according to law.  We must ensure it will not inflict injustice on anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should pause at this point and consider the possibility that as a result of the completion of this an injustice will not be inflicted on an individual or individuals.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will satisfy me that such a risk does not exist.  With the permission of the Chair I will give one example that will cover the ground I am concerned about.  It relates to a prosecution initiated by the Minister's Department before this hand-over took place. In an effort to get a telecommunication service into a new industry a newly appointed manager, not a director, signed the required documentation.  Subsequently, that company went into liquidation and that person lost his job.  He was served with proceedings by the Minister's Department but the matter had been almost resolved before the change <Col N="446" /> took place.  After the change the attitude of Bord Telecom could best be described as being on a par with the reception that was accorded to some of our colleagues on a recent visit to their headquarters.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that I am not prepared to see a man who has lost his job and who may well be deprived of his home because of a sincere interest on his part to see that an industry he was the manager of get off the ground being thrown to the sharks.  When I made representations to the Minister's Department I got a good response but that response has gone out the window.  I am not prepared to allow this man be thrown to the sharks.  That may well be the outcome of this.  I am saying to the Minister that unless we have some assurance that that type of approach and ruthlessness which this man endured ceases &mdash; it may be inflicted on a wider scale unless a brake is put on it &mdash; I am happy to sanction the powers to the board to pursue the course they pursue with that person.</P>

      <P>While it has been necessary to come back pretty early in the life of a new Act with amendments I do not think they should be allowed to take away from the original work which was a monumental task and an excellent piece of work.  As Senator Cassidy said it was inaugurated by one Government and carried through by another Government.  It still remains a monumental task and these slight flaws should not take away from the overall impact and the work that went into it by an enormous amount of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their helpful and co-operative manner and I have a feeling that I know the lines along which Senator Cassidy, and Senators Ferris and Browne might have gone had the Leas-Chathaoirleach not confined the debate strictly to the Bill.  I will reciprocate by saying that a number of points were brought up in the Dáil when this Bill was going through and arising out of what I said I would get replies to the Deputies who raised various questions.  If I duplicate that by sending the same replies to the Senators who <Col N="447" /> spoke here, that may cover the area to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
    <P>Senators Howard's point is one that concerns us all.  This is an area where big rolling machines can produce results that none of us likes.  Bord Telecom and An Post are now semi-State bodies and we do not like to be looking over their shoulders. I do not think it would be very good if we did that.  This issue has already been brought to the attention of the Minister. I will examine it and again bring it to the attention of the Minister with the very strong warning that the Senator has issued here.  I will be in contact with the Senator on that.  I again thank the Seanad for their very good reception given to the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes which was signed by us in June 1978.  The convention has already been ratified by all other member states of the European Community with the exception of Italy and Greece.  The convention was approved on behalf of the Community in 1978 although the Community has not yet become a party to it.</P>
      <P>The convention contains 18 articles of which Articles 1 to 7 deal with the general principles, and Articles 8 to 13 with detailed implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general principles of the convention, which cover housing, feeding, watering and care, set out the requirements necessary to safeguard the welfare of animals kept for farming purposes, in particular those kept in modern intensive stock farming systems.  Article 1 defines <Col N="448" />&ldquo;animals&rdquo; as animals bred or kept for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes and &ldquo;modern intensive stock-farming systems&rdquo; as systems which predominantly employ technical installations operated principally by means of automatic processes.  Article 7 contains the convention's main specific provision, that is that animals and technical equipment used in modern intensive stock farming systems should be thoroughly inspected at least once a day.  That is only good husbandry anyway.</P>
    <P>The remaining articles of the convention deal with the detailed implementing provisions, including the establishment of a standing committee which is responsible for the elaboration and adoption of recommendations to the contracting parties to the convention.</P>
    <P>By our signature of the convention we gave consent to the principles enshrined in it.  Since then there has been an increasing realisation of the importance of animal welfare and, indeed, I think that this is a very worthwhile development.  We in Ireland must not lag behind in our concept of the necessity for animal welfare and this Bill will enable us to keep step with our partners in Europe.  Even from an economic point of view, animal welfare is very desirable.  I hardly have to say that animals which are well cared for thrive and give better production returns.</P>
    <P>Existing national law relating to the protection of animals is contained in a number of enactments including the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960 and the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  None of this law enables the Minister for Agriculture to legislate by order for the promotion of animal welfare or in particular for the requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to enable the Minister to do that.  It will also make it possible to make regulations in relation to the care and welfare of the animals to which it applies, particularly as regards providing a proper supply of food and water, adequate space and the construction and layout of housing to ensure that there are proper facilities <Col N="449" /> by way of lighting, ventilation, drainage etc.  Certain buildings or other structures may also be declared to be intensive units for the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill, accordingly, will make it compulsory for those who own or operate intensive units to inspect or cause to be inspected the animals and the equipment in these units not less than once per day. This is in order to ensure that the animals are not suffering unnecessarily and that the equipment is at all times free from defects.  In the case of animals not kept in intensive units, their inspection will be necessary at intervals sufficient to avoid their being caused unnecessary suffering. The Act will require simple records of these inspections to be kept and I must emphasise that the records envisaged are of the most simple, straightforward type; there is nothing elaborate whatsoever required.</P>
    <P>A person will also be prohibited from feeding to an animal or causing to be fed to an animal to which the Act applies, any food or liquid in a manner or of a kind which may cause it injury or suffering.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be able to appoint veterinary surgeons to be inspectors for the purpose of this Act and they will have powers to enter premises or land, to inspect, examine or test animals, food or liquid and equipment, as well as to take samples for animals, food or liquid and examine, test or analyse any sample so taken.  They will also have power to inspect records.  Officers of my Department who are not veterinary surgeons may also be given such of the inspectors' powers as may be specified while a member of the Garda Síochána shall have all the powers of an inspector other than the power to examine, test or take samples for animals.  I would like to stress that the powers given to the Garda are intended as a &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; service only, that is that the Garda would only be called in where an inspector or authorised officer met with difficulties caused by, for instance, obstruction in the course of their duties.  This Bill, therefore, is a relatively simple one but it does mark a stride forward on the road to improve <Col N="450" /> farm animal welfare, an area which, I fear, has probably been neglected in the past but which I feel certain will become more prominent in the future.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Seanad and I am confident that it will secure the approval of all Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill is so important now I cannot understand why it has taken our Government six years to ratify the Council of Europe convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes.  From the Minister's speech it would appear that we are the last member of the European Community to ratify this convention and that indeed is rather strange for a country that depends so much on the production and export of cattle and sheep in order to sustain our national income.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers housing, feeding, watering and care and sets out the requirements necessary to safeguard the welfare of animals kept for farming purposes, in particular those kept in modern intensive stock farming systems.  I believe that any farmer operating this kind of system does not need a convention of this type to tell him how to safeguard the welfare of his animals.  He would have the expertise himself and would certainly ensure that the animals were provided with food and water suitable to their needs.  Indeed his intention would be to get them on to the market as quickly as possible and hope to increase his profit margin by doing so and he certainly could not do this by neglecting to provide adequate water and food for the animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there are always exceptions to the rule and perhaps there are instances where animals could be neglected and ill-treated but I think in such cases the law we have at present could deal with those isolated cases.  Perhaps the Minister could tell the House how many prosecutions have taken place in countries where the convention has been ratified.  The main purpose of the convention and, indeed, of this Bill is to look after the welfare of animals in intensive units.  This indeed is understandable because such animals are being raised in <Col N="451" /> an environment which is unnatural to them.  There is bound to be a certain amount of tension and nervousness until an animal gets used to its new environment. Almost all animals prefer the wide open spaces.  Such animals also come in for scrutiny under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the case of animals not kept in intensive units their inspection will be carried out at intervals sufficient to avoid their being caused unnecessary suffering.  I understand the Bill will require a simple record of those inspections to be kept.  I would like to inquire from the Minister what kind of records are we talking about here?  Does the farmer have to enter in a book the date and times he inspected his stock or does he have to do a report on the physical condition of each animal?  If this is necessary, farmers will not be too happy because it will be adding to the burdens they already have with farm accounts, taxation and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be able to appoint veterinary surgeons to be inspectors for the purpose of this Act and they will have the power to enter premises or land to inspect, examine or test animals, food, liquid or equipment as well as to take samples from animals, food or liquids and examine, test or analyse any sample to taken.  Officers of the Department of Agriculture who are not veterinary surgeons may also be given such powers as the Minister specifies.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any idea of how many of those veterinary surgeons or Department officers will be required or who will pay their fees?  Recently the veterinary fee for inspection at factories was increased substantially.  Is the appointment of those officers a further imposition on hard-pressed farmers?  As regards the Garda Síochána making those inspections, I am quite sure that will not arise because the Garda at present have more than enough to do in the area of crime.  Anyway they would not be qualified to carry out those inspections.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems facing our farmers is the exposure of our livestock on the land during the winter months. Farmers should be encouraged by every means possible to take their cattle off the land in October or November.  If proper <Col N="452" /> incentives were provided for the erection of suitable buildings to house cattle during the winter months I am sure that many farmers would avail of it.  That is why I considered it a very retrograde step by the Government to suspend the farm modernisation scheme last year.  Their action brought to a complete standstill the efforts made over the years to improve and modernise farm buildings and to provide better facilities for our livestock.  It is in this area that I see the greatest hardship for our cattle and the biggest losses for our farmers.  Cattle being fed in the open during the winter, trudging through muck and slurry, cannot be expected to thrive.  The opposite is the case.  Very often those animals lose weight which they had gained during the summer and autumn.  It takes the land they are using quite some time to recover.</P>
    <P>Would it not be much better for everybody if the Department could provide adequate grants to enable farmers to provide housing accommodation for their animals during the winter months?  This, of course, would not have to be elaborate accommodation.  A simple structure would do and it would be money well spent.  The farmers then would be able to market their cattle much earlier than they do at present.  I am not at all satisfied that the Government have any commitment to improving the situation in this area because their allocation of approximately £23 million for the farm modernisation scheme this year is a paltry figure when one considers that a few years ago we were spending £46 million in that area alone.  We all know how costs have escalated in those three years so £23 million will not relieve much hardship for our farm animals.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is nothing in this Bill to protect animals being transported to and from marts.  How often have we seen animals packed into trailers and transported to marts, very often having to remain in those trailers for five or six hours and then stand for a further ten to 12 hours in a pen at the mart without food or water.  This Bill should take those hardships caused to animals into consideration.  Every effort should be made to encourage farmers and people <Col N="453" /> dealing with farm animals to treat them properly at all times.  Indeed, if this Bill goes any way towards achieving this, then I would wholeheartedly support it.  We are merely complying here with the convention as laid down and stepping into line with other European countries.  I certainly support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I positively support this Bill.  It is definitely a step forward and, as has been indicated, it essentially puts us in the position where we ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Animals which was signed by us in 1978 and by all the other countries with the exception of Greece and Italy.</P>
      <P>One might say there is no need for this sort of Bill, that people who have livestock to manage know enough about them and care enough for them and so on.  While that is the case with 99.9 per cent of cases a very small percentage of cases may exist where animals are not treated in the way in which they ought to be treated.  I believe that the appropriate legislation is, in fact, a very desirable thing.</P>
      <P>We are, of course, looking here at the basics as far as management of animals is concerned.  We are talking about the very simple and basic things like housing, feeding, watering, movement of stock and general management.  In fact there is nobody, with very few exceptions, in the business of livestock management who will intentionally or purposely set out to cause any hardship on animals.  Not alone would they not do it intentionally, I do not think they would do it at all because livestock owners in 1984 are very conscious of the importance of having their animals in a comfortable state at all times, in a very placid and calm state, because whether it is for milk production, beef production, pork production, bacon or whatever, unless the animals are content and relaxed they will not, and this is a proven fact, give of their maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that at present margins in farming are indeed pretty tight it is essential for all those engaged in farming to ensure in so far as they can that they maximise on the whole area of <Col N="454" /> farming.  The livestock farmer, to whom this Bill relates, must ensure, apart from this Bill at all, and apart from his love of animals, that he treats his animals correctly. That is a basic fundamental fact that does exist.  One's knowledge of the scene would lead one to believe that. Apart from that, I believe the mentality of the Irish livestock owner, the Irish livestock keeper, is that he will not illtreat animals.</P>
    <P>We are talking about legislation that will not have relevance for a lot of people. It might apply in rare, eccentric cases but they would be very few in number. It is important that the Minister and his Department should view it in that light, because there is no point in having inspections carried out so freely that we set up a whole team of people costing a great deal of money, which would be quite unnecessary.  I would totally agree with the principle and the need for the existence of that legislation, but it should not lead to a situation where inspections are the order of the day.  They should be the exception rather than the rule.  That is important, otherwise we could have a whole bureaucracy dealing with a matter that does not need attention.</P>
    <P>Competence on the part of those inspecting animals is of paramount importance.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister and the Government ensure that those who carry out inspections of animals are competent to assess in a very practical, common sense manner whether or not there has been or is illtreatment of animals for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>I heard recently of a situation where an animal died over a weekend and the farmer did not have the opportunity of removing that animal until two days later. He was reported and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals people came to his house and he was brought to court and had a lot of explaining to do.  Here there was a lack of practical understanding. There could be no cruelty to a dead animal.  The animal had died of natural causes, but it was not removed for two days due to a weekend intervention.  That is the kind of situation where a person <Col N="455" /> without a knowledge of and an understanding of the business could easily cause more annoyance and interference than would be desirable.  I would ask the Minister to make certain that those persons carrying out inspections should be totally competent and capable of doing the job in an intelligent and simple way. I would submit that the inspections should be on a sporadic basis.  They should not be on a very frequent, across-the-board level.  Very important also in the same connection is the matter of communication with the stock-owner. The person going out there to investigate a complaint or to carry out a spot inspection must be able to communicate with the individual concerned.  That is important. It must not be the typical kind of non-personal approach that one sometimes does encounter in these situations. I would attach a lot of importance to the type of person going out.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we rely very heavily on our livestock exports as an earner of foreign currency.  For that reason I do not think we can leave any stone unturned to make sure that our animals are treated well at all times, because it is a basic economic necessity, apart altogether from the caring feeling for animals which I believe exists in all persons, with the odd exception to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions records, penalties and a number of items which are more appropriate for further stages of discussions on this Bill.  They are all very important in their own way.  Reference is made to modern systems of farming, intensive livestock units, be they for beef, pigs or whatever.  This Bill might have the most relevance in the case of overcrowding of cattle on an intensive slatted floor system for beef production purposes or pig keeping. The same sort of criteria must apply, and common sense will prevail.  Nobody must be sent out, no matter how well he is authorised, if he has not got the knowledge and the understanding of animal requirements.</P>
    <P>Too many people tend to relate the requirement of the animal to the requirement of a human.  Perhaps this is a human trait.  It needs stating that they are totally <Col N="456" /> and utterly different.  An animal is capable and happier in conditions in which human beings would not survive.  I am thinking particularly of the out-wintered animals which, given proper basic sheltering conditions, can be extremely satisfied and content and can do well. That is not to say that from a progressive farming point of view we should not strive to have a far greater proportion of our animals put indoors during the winter time.  I say that not alone from the point of view of caring for animals but from a completely practical point of view in the context of our getting more return from our animals and the animals having added comfort.  I would say that the animals that are left outside are not ill treated, and this would apply to the west in particular where a very high proportion of animals are out-wintered.  I do not believe that there is ill treatment of those animals, but a big loss is suffered by the owners of those animals.  The animals very often are left outside for periods when they could be moving forward to the finishing stages if they were indoors and on the appropriate diet of meals or silage, or a combination of the two.</P>
    <P>For that reason one would certainly support the concept of better housing and more housing for animals all round, because an extremely high percentage of our animals are still out-wintered, particularly in the western part of our country. It is the farm owners who are the heavy losers here.  The animals could be a bit better cared for indoors, but I would say that there is no ill treatment of animals. That might be an exaggeration but it is minimal, if there is any at all.</P>
    <P>There is also reference in the Bill to the feeding to animals of foodstuffs which may be damaging to their digestive systerms. I do not believe that anybody does that intentionally.  Anybody doing it has lack of guidance, lack of information.  It is incumbent on us all to make certain that all stock-owners are better educated as to what to feed animals and what proportion to feed them, as well as the whole area of preventive medicine.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of things that we should address ourselves to.  I am quite satisfied that we can go along that road <Col N="457" /> of educating our people and ensuring that they give the animals what is required, whether it is in the feeding stuff area or in the whole medicinal area.  There are a lot of matters that farmers these days attend to on their own, and more guidance would help them to do things in a more correct fashion.  We are at a fairly advanced stage in the whole area of animal production in 1984, which includes the use of hormones for beef production and various feed additives.  These are essential to ensure that the farmer gets the most from his enterprise, and I do not think we should in any way thwart that kind of development.</P>
    <P>I would wholeheartedly support the Bill.  I will have some remarks to make at a later stage in regard to some of the detailed aspects.  I would like to think that the inspections carried out would be sporadic and casual and would not become part of a whole process of inspection which would not be warranted.  I want to lend my full support to this Bill and would make those few points to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, as the Minister pointed out, will enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes which was signed by us in June 1978.  It seems to me that most Bills passing through the House are motivated by some kind of necessity for improvement, and I cannot see that there is a need in this regard or that there is cruelty of any kind.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may by regulations make such provision as regards the care and welfare of animals to which this Act applies as he thinks fit, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing regulations under this section may in particular include&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) provisions for ensuring the provision for such animals of a proper supply of food and water;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> (b) for the purpose of ensuring that, having regard to their physiological and ethological needs, there is as regards such animals adequate space for their free movement or other needs, provisions specifying the housing space to be provided in relation to them;</P>
    <P>(c) provisions with respect to the dimensions and layout of housing for such animals, the materials to be used in constructing any such housing and the facilities by way of lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, regulating the level of humidity, air circulation, drainage, water supply or otherwise to be provided in connection with any such housing.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that, as far as I know, there are no regulations existing which provide all these things for human beings.  There are people I know living in very inferior conditions, very poor housing. There are some people who are unable to obtain housing.  I am aware that in general animals in this State are better looked after than some humans. When we look back to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 which was debated here some short time ago and seems to have been put on the long finger, it seems that our priorities are wrong.  I am all for improving the welfare of animals.  I do not believe that cruelty exists, except in so far as many people claim that intensive breeding and farming are cruel.  They are facts of life and we have to accept them.  By and large Ireland has a very good record with regard to the welfare of animals.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to point out that in different parts of this country, the north, north-west, the south-west and the west we had the byre house in some places into this century.  This was a thatched single storey building which housed the family and up to four cows in the one room.  This was not as a result of poverty; it was more a cultural thing which was established in other parts of Europe also. It puts in some kind of perspective the relationship between people and animals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> There is no doubt that farmers treat animals well, and it is in their interest to do so.  I cannot see that this Bill will do anything to improve that situation.  I realise that it is necessary to pass it.  Some aspects can be looked into on Committee Stage.  There is provision for the inspection of animals once daily.  My experience, coming from a rural area, is that there are very few farmers who would carry out inspections only once every day.  There are many people who believe that there is some form of cruelty in intensive units.  The keeping of records may be an onerous task for farmers.  The powers of entry and inspection seem to be an intrusion on privacy and the fine for offences is high.  I am in total agreement with anything that would help to improve the welfare of animals and I totally support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the comparison drawn by Senator Fitzsimons. I do not believe that the State cannot and does not take action when there is any human being in a situation of cruelty.  It is fairly active in that area.  The Bill dealing with the housing of the homeless is at a certain stage and has not been delayed.  The mover has been in discussion with the Department.  I would agree with everything Senator Fitzsimons said about this Bill.  It seems amazing that we must enact legislation that will be seen by our colleagues in Europe to be complying with a Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes. One would immediately assume that this is happening already.  Could the Minister state in his reply whether he has any evidence that would indicate a level of mismanagement of farm animals?  As Senator Hourigan has said, basically people are kind to animals and possibly are often kinder to animals than they are to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill confers on the Garda certain powers, but I believe they will be unable to exercise these powers because of the manpower problems.  They already have powers to investigate the failure to cut weeds like ragwort in farms but they are never exercised.  In regard to the ingestion of ragwort by cattle, the ravages of <Col N="460" /> this poisoning in the following year are so traumatic that it can be said to be cruelty to animals to allow ragwort to grow widespread in fields.  It is an offence.  If we have legislation which we cannot implement it is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>I would question the deployment of veterinary surgeons to carry out these inspections because we seem to have a lack of veterinary staff available in the two current disease eradication schemes. I would like to see every veterinary surgeon available to the Government being used specifically in the eradication of disease, ensuring that factories and lorries are disinfected and all the precautions that are part of disease prevention are taken.  I am worried about the availability of staff.  I hope that when they are looking at intensive units they will consult with the ACOT people who are specialists in the area of ventilation and proper housing for intensive units.  Under the new scheme for farm modernisation grants we are trying to designate as many grants as possible to the housing of animals.  Anybody who has buildings or is about to construct buildings should contact the experts in this area.  There has been the most intensive housing of pigs and this involves the strict control of cooling, ventilation and humidity.</P>
    <P>Are we just complying with a European Convention and enacting legislation which we may not be able to implement? If it is implemented, are we going to examine silage yards where animals are standing up to their hocks in slurry at the silage pit?  Is this considered to be unfair on animals?  There is widespread evidence of this throughout the country. Regarding the out-wintering of animals, do we warn farmers who have sheep on the mountains &mdash; like the Galtees where we lost 1,000 in a snowfall &mdash; that it is possible cruelty?  If so, are we going to assist them by way of additional grants to ensure that animals like this which are at risk in exposed conditions every year could be housed adequately?  The suffocation of sheep must be of concern to anybody who cares about animals.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could assure me that he could carry out some of the measures of control in this legislation, that would be <Col N="461" /> fine, but I have grave doubts.  I hope the Minister can reassure me.  We have levels of infection in intensive units that create widespread suffering to animals because of the transmissibility of some of the diseases; some of the diseases are mentioned in the 1966 Act, but this Act needs to be examined as to the way it is written and the type of animals it applies to.  In the case of several diseases we ask people to slaughter animals and the Department are not in a position to compensate them. I am speaking particularly of outbreaks of transmissible diseases in pigs.  These diseases are well known to the Minister and have been the subject of concern at the Animal Health Council for some time.</P>
    <P>There are other areas like particular kinds of feeds available to animals and allowing beet pulp to remain accessible to horses.  If horses eat beet pulp, the suffering and death which follows is traumatic to look at.  Do we make it an offence in order to ensure that people do not take risks with food such as this, which normally is edible and nourishing food for other animals, but for equines in particular is highly dangerous?  I should like to know how this will be operated on the ground.  I hope that we have the necessary manpower and that we will not infringe on the normal good management that goes on in the vast majority of our farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, to enable us to fulfil our commitments in relation to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals.  I welcome the Bill in general terms, as indeed I welcome any measure dealing with the general health and welfare of animals.  We are at one here in saying that we support any measures which are designed to prevent and avoid suffering and hardship of any kind where farm animals and animals in general are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the main purpose of this Bill was to enable the Minister for Agriculture to legislate by order for the promotion of animal welfare and in particular for the requirements of the Convention. <Col N="462" /> I should like to concentrate on the need to exercise caution in the preparation of these guidelines and legislation by order.  I should hope that great care would be taken in regard to the preparation of these guidelines.  We have been told that inspections will be carried out by people such as veterinary officers, by certain officers of the Minister's Department and in some cases by the gardaá.  I should like to emphasise to the Minister &mdash; knowing him as I do to be a practical farmer himself &mdash; the desirability of ensuring that, whoever the inspectors are, they have a practical knowledge of conditions in farming.  They will be required to inspect housing, feeding, water for animals, the care of animals, lighting, ventilation, drainage, and so on. I should like to know if there will be general guidelines to help them to interpret their duties or will the matter of interpretation of these guidelines depend on the beliefs of each individual inspector?</P>
    <P>I have been taken by the point Senator Ferris made in relation to, for example, sheep on the Galtees.  I would hope that the Minister would clarify this point.  In my part of the country the Burren is substantially used for the out-wintering of cattle.  It is generally accepted that cattle winter there, emerge from it healthy and thrive particularly well in the following year.  I am sure there are people who would regard the out-wintering of cattle in the Burren as cruelty to some degree.  Were some of these people to be amongst the inspectorate which would emerge from the Department, I could see complications in relation to farm practices that have survived over the centuries in this area.</P>
    <P>I should also like to question the safeguards where intensive housing of farm animals is concerned in the event of a power failure or a strike which would affect the ventilation systems and perhaps the means of feeding animals, which is mainly done now by mechanical means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with satisfaction the Government's recent financial commitment to sport and calls on the Government to continue with this supportive policy.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for allowing this motion to be presented here this evening. Sport and recreation have assumed a new relevance in our country over the past decade.  It has attracted the interest not only of the masses of the people but of various Government Departments, the professions and commercial interests.  It has become the subject of research and experiment and the era from the mid-seventies to the present time could well be described as &ldquo;the sporting revolution in Ireland&rdquo;.  Thousands of our population of all ages and sexes have been influenced by this new quest for fitness and health and have taken to the roads, beaches and gyms in response.</P>
      <P>People are now realising that we have a very suitable natural environment for exercising, such as long stretches of unused beaches, clean unpolluted air and quiet country roads.  People realise that sport is not the privilege of certain somatotypes but rather &ldquo;for all to experience and enjoy&rdquo;.  This attitude hindered and inhibited people from getting involved previous to this.  The present Government and the previous Governments responded very positively to this new revolution, as I described it, in sport.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Creed, to the House.  He has proved to be a very good Minister for sport and he has gained a great deal of respect from various sporting organisations. As I said, the present Government have responded in a very positive way to the necessity for the increased funding of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 March 1984, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Creed, announced, on the recommendations of Cospóir, the allocation of £502,720 in direct grants to <Col N="464" /> national sports organisations.  These grants, in addition to the allocation of £300,000 announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, represent an increase of 62 per cent over the 1983 allocation and according to the Minister, Deputy Creed, &ldquo;is evidence of the Government's commitment to the development of sport in Ireland.&rdquo;  Credit must be given to the Government for this enormous increase in funding.</P>
    <P>A number of organisations received substantially increased funding for 1984. The Minister indicated that he was particcularly pleased to be able to give a grant of £100,000 to the Olympic Council of Ireland and that this grant, together with the special grant of £140,000 included in the budget allocation, was further evidence of the Government's concern that our Olympic team would be the best prepared team to leave our shores.  I would like to point out that I made reference to this previously in the Seanad when I asked the Government to increase the funding of the Olympics.  I am glad there was a very positive response to my request.</P>
    <P>To mark the celebration of the centenary year of the GAA a special grant of £100,000 was awarded in the budget in recognition of the contribution which the GAA have made to Irish society not only in sport but in a wide range of related activities of a social and cultural nature. This grant together with the annual grant from Cospóir, which amounts to £44,500 in 1984 will no doubt be most welcomed by GAA headquarters.  As a former GAA player I am very grateful to the Government for their allocation because I think they have made an enormous contribution to our people and our country over the years.</P>
    <P>As I am on the point of the funding of the GAA I would like to point out to the Minister two recent issues of contention, the VAT on hurleys and the rates on GAA pitches.  I would seriously request that he examine both of these with a view to softening the impact of VAT on hurleys and rates on GAA clubs.  I will be looking forward to a positive response to this request.</P>
    <P>The budget also made provision for <Col N="465" /> £10,000 for the Irish Wheelchair Association to assist towards the cost of preparing and sending a team to the Olympics for the Disabled.  Again, the Government showed their awareness of the great work the Irish Wheelchair Association are doing for the disabled.  I would like to call on the Government to look further at the whole funding of sports for the handicapped.  It is an area in which I have a special interest.  I work with disabled people and I think they deserve better treatment from all of us.</P>
    <P>Some organisations will be hosting major international sporting events in Ireland in 1984, and these have received special recognition from the Government with additional funding being provided above their normal grants.  I would just like to point out the organisations in question.  These are: Irish Squash Association, who are allocated in addition to a grant of £9,000, a special grant of £5,000 for hosting the European Squash Championships; the Irish Canoe Association which is allocated an additional grant of £5,000 for the World Marathon Canoe Championships; Comhairle Liathróid Láimhe na hÉireann received £5,000 towards the cost of staging the World Handball Championships.  Again, the Minister should be complimented on recognising the fact that when we bring in athletes from other countries every effort should be put into facilitating them properly.  Personally I think that athletes from Ireland are probably treated better abroad than athletes from foreign countries particularly in events in our country.  The budget provision also provides for additional grant aid to the Community Games of £10,000.  This must be welcomed.  The National Finance Committee for Amateur Football grant has been increased by £10,000; the Irish Boxing Association, £5,000; Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann, £5,000; the National Athletic and Cycling Association, £5,000.  All of these must be noted and welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that five organisations have been recognised for grant aid this year for the first time.  This indicates that the Government are aware of what <Col N="466" /> is happening in sport in our country.  The organisations are the Irish Ladies Gaelic Football Association which is making great strides; The Irish Ladies Golf Union, the Irish Women's Cricket Union, the Irish Trampoline Association and Sand-Yatching, Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to direct grants for the national sporting organisations, financial assistance to enable sport organisations to develop sport exchanges with their counterpart organisations in France has been increased.  It is the Minister's intention to award up to five further scholarships in 1984.  This will increase to 22 the present number who are availing of these scholarships.  These young sport persons can pursue their career in sport while studying for the academic qualifications of their choice.  This idea is very plausible and one which could well be extended in future.  We could even forge further links with other European countries and Eastern European countries where there is a very high emphasis on sport.</P>
    <P>In the current year also the youth and sport fund to the VEC's has been increased from £700,000 to £770,000. This fund is allocated to the VECs to enable them to respond to the needs of youth and sport bodies and organisations at local level.  This is a very important aspect of funding for sport.  It is open to the clubs affiliated to national sporting bodies to seek assistance from this fund from their local VECs.  From experience I can confirm that this funding has played a very important role in many clubs in my own county and the grants have been wisely used.</P>
    <P>On 14 May 1984 the Minister of State, Deputy Creed, announced the further allocation of £345,600 to 37 VECs to promote youth and sport activity in their area of administration.  In addition, a grant of £68,000 was made available to the City of Dublin VEC for the promotion of sport activities in Dublin.  It is worth nothing that the Dublin city manager gave a very good account of what they are doing at the moment in the Dublin VEC in relation to sport in the recent conference organised by Cospóir in Mayo.  Much is being achieved in trying to eliminate a lot of evils in society <Col N="467" /> around Dublin by their funding of many projects.  In view of this they can justify their case for further future allocations and increased allocations.  It is intended that an amount of not less than 25 per cent of this total grant will be expended on the promotion of sport for all by the local sports advisory bodies attached to the VECs.  The remainder of the grants will be divided between youth and sport activities which may include grants to clubs in respect of administrative costs, training and coaching courses and the purchase of equipment and organisation by the VEC and other courses for training and coaching.  I welcome the reference here to coaching.  We are lagging behind in respect of proper coaching and administration. There are very wide gaps between coaching standards in the south of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We can learn much from the administration of coaching schemes in Northern Ireland. We hope we can remedy the position over the years and bring our coaching standards up to European and United Kingdom standards.  Overall, the total budget and total expenditure in grant aid to sport was £1,492,000.  This represented a sizeable increase on past allocations.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to make reference to AnCO's contribution.  Over 10 per cent of the projects undertaken this year are directly related to sport facilities. Over the years, Senators must admit that AnCO have made a very fine contribution to the provision of facilities around the country, in reconstructing old halls, building dressing rooms and gymnasia.  This work must be encouraged to continue.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the overall Government policy and philosophy on sport as was indicated in the recent four year plan for education.  I would like to quote here from Chapter 2, section 31, page 19 of the four year plan:</P>
    <P>Involvement in sport is important for the personal and social development of all young people and particularly for those young people who might other-wide be drifting towards or involved in vandalism, crime or drug abuse.  Sport can be particularly supportive in disadvantaged <Col N="468" /> areas and for the young unemployed.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very important section in the chapter and one we should look at carefully.  There is no doubt that sport can be a perfect antidote against vandalism, crime and drug abuse.  The more young people involved in sport the less vandalism and drug abuse will prevail in our communities.  It is worth noting in Chapter 2, section 33 of the Programme for Action in Education and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Department will encourage the development of sport for all activities in both primary and post-primary schools aimed at increasing children's awareness of the value of sport thus encouraging active participation.</P>
    <P>Again here it is important that we give special attention and allocate an appropriate amount of time to physical education in the schools.  Up to now, unfortunately, unless a PE teacher was available in a school, physical education was neglected.  I would like to refer especially to the primary schools where primary teachers, through lack of training, are reluctant or feel inadequate to take PE classes.  This has resulted in a falling skill level in our national games such as hurling and Gaelic football.  The fact that there are very few male teachers now in the schools and that female teachers predominate in the national school teaching profession could contribute to this.  It is important that we push physical education as much as possible within the primary and secondary sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government have adopted the principle that sport should be an integral part of each child's educative process and that physical fitness should be encouraged through our schools to the greatest possible extent.  I hope this attitude and principle will be developed to the fullest.</P>
    <P>Going back to the teaching of PE in the primary schools I am encouraged by reference made in the action programme in Chapter 2, section 34.  I quote from that chapter:</P>
    <P>In reviewing the primary teaching training programme, the development <Col N="469" /> of the curriculum in PE will be given attention.  In-service courses for existing teachers will be provided.</P>
    <P>There are many teachers &mdash; and I have found this out from experience &mdash; who are willing to take PE classes if they are given direction and leadership.  Through the lack of in-service courses and a lack of adequate training they are not allowed to get this opportunity.  There is a great case here for in-service courses and for continuing education even after teachers are qualified.  Again, I consider this aspect very important, and I know from my own experience that many primary teachers consider themselves totally inadequate to attempt any form of physical education in the schools in case of injuries or misbehaviour and so forth. This attitude and lack of confidence will have to be changed and reversed, because if we hope to promote sport from the beginning we will have to start in the national schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer here to the employment of physical education teachers both in primary and secondary schools.  The Minister should be urged to consider employing one teacher for a number of primary schools and they could circulate in an area, and in the post-primary sector where some schools have no PE teachers.  This would be very beneficial to the children and would afford very good employment opportunities to unemployed PE personnel.</P>
    <P>While on this topic I would like to refer to our health bill and to point out that expenditure on medical services continues to increase at an alarming rate, apparently without any real gains in community health status.  I feel that continued concentration on curative medical care with its enormous costs would make little improvement in the nation's health.  I conclude that improvement will be achieved only by preventive measures and principally by motivating individuals to take a responsible attitude to their own health care, particularly in regard to diet and physical activity.  This habit formation will have to be got under way and inculcated in the children at the primary <Col N="470" /> and post-primary stages.  The Minister for Health made the point recently that there will have to be more emphasis placed on preventive medicine rather than curative medicine.  I am sure you would all agree with me on this.  The pursuit of a health lifestyle and the transmission of positive attitudes should be encouraged at an early age and developed through a formal educational experience.  We must continue to strive towards this ideal.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that in 1983 in the primary sector over 52 schools were completed and all these have provision for PE facilities.  Unfortunately, in many cases the teachers feel inadequate to have PE in the schools but if we go along the line of having in-service courses this problem could be overcome.  So far this year 19 schools have been completed and they have been equipped with PE facilities. In the post-primary section, 16 schools were completed from March 1983 to 1984.  Seven of these are equipped with full PE halls, and this must be welcomed. But I would again recommend that in future any school that is being constructed should include PE facilities if possible.</P>
    <P>Having been deeply involved both in the participation and administrative ends of sport over the past ten years, I must admit that enormous progress has been made in coaching, provision of facilities, administration etc.  I remember when I commenced PE studies we were very much underdeveloped in sport compared with other European countries. That was back in 1971, and I must say that in my opinion we have made enormous strides since then in the raising of standards and the provision of facilities. I would like to make the following recommendations to the Minister with a view to accelerating progress.  I have given this a lot of thought and I think that the recommendations have some relevance and deserve consideration.  I would urge the Minister to inject substantial funds into rapidly upgrading the opportunities for participation in physical activities and capitalising on the heightened awareness that sport for all has initiated. We are not cashing in enough as politicians and administrators on this.  At the <Col N="471" /> moment health and fitness have aroused great national interest.  I feel that we as politicians and the Department of Sport are not giving this sufficient leadership and direction.  I would suggest that money would be diverted from the accelerating curative medical budget to preventive medical areas thereby providing more funds for physical activity progress and facilities.</P>
    <P>I recommend as a high priority that a national sports assembly be formed to co-ordinate the development of sport in Ireland.  Cospóir could be incorporated into this.  The new sports assembly could act as an adviser to the Minister.  The assembly could be composed of members recommended by the sporting bodies and associations.  It could also have representatives from the medical sector, preferably somebody involved in sports medicine. Representatives should also be nominated from the health education bureaux, the Irish Olympic Council, the Community Games Association, the Council for the Disabled and the Department of Education.  I am not suggesting that Cospóir has been a failure but in its capacity it has not been as successful as it could have been, and such an assembly would prevent this overlapping of facilities at the moment.  I find that there is very little integration between the various sporting bodies and even sometimes between the Gaelic games of hurling and football.</P>
    <P>If there was a sporting council with members from all sports it would create a healthier attitude to other sports and give people a broader vision of what sport is all about.  Such an assembly could actively encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of single sports clubs into multi-sport clubs, especially in urban centres.  In urban centres there are small clubs, Gaelic football and hurling and soccer scattered around the place but, because there is such a demand for land and space all those clubs could be amalgamated into a multi-sport club sharing the same facilities.  This could also encourage the maximum use of facilities and prevent overlapping.  I also recommend as a high priority a sports assembly <Col N="472" /> hall, or sports house, to be developed to house the proposed sports assembly and to act as a centre for administration and information.  This assembly could also co-ordinate training courses for coaches, officials and administrators, and appoint directors of coaching development in administration positions.  It could disseminate audio-visual material and manuals prepared on areas of common need via a resource centre if it had such a centre.  It could do research into training methods and fitness, injuries, skill testing and first aid.</P>
    <P>I also recommend that the large clubs and associations seek additional funds through sponsorship and social activities and use those funds to hire full time professional coaching staff, if possible. Local sporting organisations should seek to develop and improve liaison with the increasing number of physical education teachers who have graduated from Limerick but, in a lot of cases, are not very effective in their community because the sporting clubs lack liaison with them. That should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I would urge more partnership between Government and the commercial sector.  For example, local councils often have access to prime land surrounded by a large population base and by constructing a facility and leasing it to commercial managers the community can benefit by using an efficiently managed facility at a reasonable cost.  Where private enterprise finances a project the cost of the land and high interest rates could render the viability of the facility prohibitive. This is working in some cases like Templeogue swimming pool, for example. I also urge the Minister to consider the future development of outdoor pursuit centres.  These could attract people from outside Ireland and be an employment creator.  At a recent conference by Cospóir special emphasis was given to outdoor recreation with a view to exploiting our unspoiled natural environment and from the tourist, employment and recreational aspect this area should be seriously looked at.</P>
    <P>I also request the Minister to consider, in consultation with other Departments <Col N="473" /> the setting up of skilled training facilities and recreational centres to facilitate people who are unemployed and who could spend their time profitably at such centres and embark on some form of course.  Finally, I should like to say that progress requires enthusiasm, optimism, leadership, good management and financial resources.  All these elements other than a substantial increase in finance are available.  Therefore, I recommend as a high priority that efforts be made to secure additional financial resources from the Government and the commercial sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion and in doing so I should like to congratulate Senator Deenihan on presenting of his case and the way in which he has enumerated a long list of ways in which the Government, and previous Governments, have been coming into the field of developing participation in sports.  His case was very well made from that point of view.  I should also like to congratulate him on his suggested innovations.  One of the main areas of responsibility for Minister of State Creed is sport.  There is, as we are all well aware, and as Senator Deenihan has pointed out, a growing awareness of the importance of sport.  We have, for example, events of national importance that were not dreamt of a few years ago.  For example, the Dublin City Marathon attracts a huge number of participants and, relative to our population, it must be the best marathon in the world from the participation point of view.  It attracts widespread interest all over the country if one is to judge by the number of people who are glued to their television sets for hours on the day of that marathon.  We have a series of mini-marathons in different centres and cycle races to raise funds for various charitable organisations.  There is growing participation in sport.  That cannot be denied.  There is a growing awareness that participation in sport can promote physical fitness.  The Romans had a saying <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i> and we have become more aware of the relevance of that.  Not only does it promote and develop physical fitness, it develops <Col N="474" /> teamwork, leadership and an awareness of the need to prepare for big events and give special attention to them.  It promotes discipline, self discipline and group discipline.  It inculcates a certain pride in the locality and a desire to do something notable for the honour of the little village, as Matt the Thresher did.</P>
      <P>Development of sport is at present mainly the responsibility of three groups, Cospóir, the national governing bodies of the different sporting organisations and the Olympic Council of Ireland.  For years different organisations worked to promote sport without any State aid.  It is still true to say that sporting organisations in the main are run by voluntary effort.  It is good that that is so and the day will not ever come when the State could afford to dish out as much money as would keep all our sporting activities going.  However, it is an incentive to people who are engaged in promoting sporting activities to know that some aid is forthcoming from the State and that if they run into difficult times they can count on State support.  That is the proper way to look at the matter, that it is a judicious combination of the maximum use of voluntary effort plus State aid in exceptional circumstances to develop lines of sport that may not attract a big paying public but are necessary if the maximum number of our people are to participate in some sporting activities.  In that regard we are going on the right lines.  Nobody would say that all the sporting organisations or all the organisations interested in developing sport are getting the amount of money they would like to get.  That cannot be denied but there is a certain satisfaction that in difficult times out of limited resources the Government are prepared to give assistance. They are prepared to assist because they realise that sport plays an important part in the development of our young people and, indeed, of different age groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that people are trained to make the best possible use of their leisure time.  From high figures of unemployment that prevail not just here but all over the Western world, it is probably likely that as time progresses the working week will be shorter and there <Col N="475" /> will be more hours of leisure time.  It is important that people are trained to make good use of leisure time.  There is the need to ensure that people are given the opportunity to develop interests that will keep them away from vandalism, drugs and alcohol.  That is the big question before the people and in that way assistance given by the Minister, and the Government, to develop sporting activities is very welcome and will bring beneficial results.</P>
    <P>I do not agree altogether with Senator Deenihan's estimation of the work done by Cospóir.  Since it was established in 1980 Cospóir has done a vast amount of good work.  A plan is being prepared for future development of the activities of Cospóir based mainly on the vocational educational structure.  VECs, and their advisory bodies, are doing a great deal of useful work over the length and breath of the country.  I have attended a number of the annual seminars run by Cospóir and I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of those who attended and the plans they have for the future.  Indeed, I was very favourably impressed with the amount of work that can be done in some areas where there are few facilities.</P>
    <P>About a year ago I attended one of those seminars by Cospóir and we were given an example of an event run at a cross roads in County Cork with practically no amenities.  The number of people who participated and the huge range of sporting events that were run through was a clear indication of what can be done if people have the determination to succeed.  I should like to pay a compliment to the Minister of State for his attendance at these meetings, local and national, for his obvious commitment to the objectives of Cospóir, his appreciation of the difficulties people have to contend with, his readiness to listen to suggestions from those who are involved and his capacity to generate enthusiasm amongst interested people.</P>
    <P>If we take a long look at the development of sport here we must conclude that steady progress has been made.  Nobody can dispute the fact that physical education halls have been built for a number of years at schools all over the country. <Col N="476" /> It is not many years ago since a physical education hall at big secondary schools was unheard of.  The idea of a physical education hall at a primary school would have been regarded as day-dreaming or utterly fantastic.  Progress has been made in that field.  I remember, and I am sure other Senators do, the time when a vocational committee anxious to appoint a teacher with qualifications in physical education had no choice but to appoint people who got that training in England. That is no longer the case.  We have a regular output annually of people with qualifications to teach physical education. Taking that in conjunction with the other points I have made, we can be satisfied that we are making progress.  It may be that the progress does not meet the wishes and expectations of people who are very keenly interested, but any fair-minded objective examination of the work that is being done, and that has been done in the last decade or so, will show we are on the right lines.</P>
    <P>The aim of Cospóir, one of the three organisations I am most familiar with, is to develop participation rather than competition. It was a fault in the games structure here in the years gone by that the young boy at secondary school who could not earn his place on the college hurling or football team in some way felt inferior, he just did not have the capacity to become an inter-college star footballer or hurler and in some way regarded himself, perhaps, as a bit of a second class citizen. If he did not others might remind him of it.  The fact is that everybody does not have the qualities to be an athletic star or the qualities that will make an all-Ireland winner in Croke Park.  However, there is great satisfaction to be arrived from participation in some sport.  The person who participates in a sport even if it is only at a mediocre standard is the better for having done that.  He will grow up a better citizen apart from being a fitter man or girl as the case might be.  They will be more satisfied with life and will feel they have played a useful role and are part of a group of people who are doing something. That is one of the greatest aims of Cospóir.  They will do a great amount of good by persevering on that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Senator Deenihan has put down this motion. I realise he put it down with the best of motive.  I understand and have absolutely no hassle with Minister of State for Sport, Deputy Creed, who is in the House today or with his advisers but as a person who has been involved in sport for a long time I believe that our commitment to sport is not adequate.  Our commitment has never been adequate.  I was looking recently at advertisements that were placed by the Department of Health and Social Welfare, the Health Education Bureau advertisements, advising people to clean their teeth, advising people not to do this and that.  If there was the same commitment by Deputy Creed as there is in regard to the Health Education Bureau advertisements we would not have as many hospitals.  There is no way that the health services would be over-burdened as they are.  People should be encouraged to get involved in sport at every level, at administrative and playing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points need to be emphasised. Mention was made of what sport has done in the past for people in schools. Senator O'Brien mentioned that in schools in the early days if one played for the school one was the hero.  Unfortunately, things have changed in schools. The only heroes in school now are those who can pass their exams and get jobs. We have to emphasise that if one goes to school one goes for a broad education or for a narrow educational emphasis that will give the results needed but it will not produce great hurlers, rugby players or athletes.  I can recall the time when I was growing up that it was the athletes who got the special glass of milk at night.  The lad who was going to get seven honours in his Leaving Certificate did not get any glass of milk.  Why?  It was because the lad who got the seven honours in his Leaving Certificate got them because he got them but if the school won a match it was the school's name that was in the paper the next morning.  Nowadays we have a change: boarding schools, because of the costs, are disappearing &mdash; that is unfortunate &mdash; and the five day system in the boarding schools that are left has militated against the sporting <Col N="478" /> achievements of those schools.</P>
    <P>Our commitment as politicians to sport has been diabolical.  There is a mention that for the first time ever we are giving £1 million to sport from Government funds.  Every week of the year one million pounds goes from industry into sport in sponsorship whether it is from the major sponsors, the people who are breaking the law in a sense, or others.  Those people are not allowed to advertise cigarettes on television but can have a four day Carrolls golf tournament.  RTE do not turn down the advertising.  The Carrolls golf tournament takes place over four days, and fair dues to the Fine Gael man who runs the advertising campaign for Carrolls, he gets plenty of notice for that tournament.  I am glad to see that his co-worker with that organisation is now working with Fine Gael also.  I do not know if Carrolls has been taken over by Fine Gael or whether the PR department of RTE has been taken over by Fine Gael.  However, it is a fact that Carrolls get more publicity for golf sponsorship in an area in which it is illegal to advertise. That is unbelievable.  We have the situation here that sport is under capitalised. Small businesses all over the country are sponsoring every day and when the Government say they are giving £1 million satisfaction is expressed by Senator Deenihan.  It is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>What is sport?  Is it for the satisfaction of the person involved in it?  Is it for the satisfaction of sponsors or is it for the satisfaction of Government?  Sport is a necessary part of our national expression but it is no better a part of our national expression than anything else.  It does something for us.  Anybody who is involved in sport should be healthier than the person who does not get involved. We spent a hundred times more on trying to prevent people getting bad teeth than we do on sport.  In this year of the Olympics 1984, and the centenary year for the GAA, a special grant was given to the GAA.  The GAA were delighted to get it but it was a meagre amount for a national organisation that has provided in each and every county sport facilities which the State would not have provided.</P>
    <P>I refer to Senator Deenihan's own county <Col N="479" /> and the Austin Stack Park.  Were it not for the people of Kerry that park would not be there.  In my own county, Kilkenny, Nowlan Park was provided totally by the people of that county without State subvention of any description. There is a pitch in Ballyragget that has all the facilities that are necessary but the State did not subvent that, but it is an educational, cultural and sporting facility that was provided by the people without help from the Government.  On athletics £5,000 is being given to BLE, £5,000 to the NACA and £140,000 to the Olympics in the Olympic year.  That is a total of £150,000 from the State in an Olympic year.  The cost of travelling from here for one athlete to Los Angeles is £500 return. That athlete has to get accommodation in Los Angeles and has to train before he goes there.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to be congratulating the Government.  I have no great faith in the Irish Olympic Council because they are a self perpetuating body who are a little bit removed from sporting people in Ireland.  Without mentioning names they have very few people who are involved in athletics, the main event of the Olympics. They have a boxing personality but there is absolutely no way that anybody can become President of the Irish Olympic Council, or the International Olympic Council by being a member of a sporting body in Ireland unless he has a lot of money and a title.  I have no respect for the Irish Olympic Council because I do not think it is a democratic organisation.</P>
    <P>The Olympic ideal has been totally lost.  The Olympic ideal was one of competing and amateurism.  We have a situation now where there is not one single amateur athlete going to compete in the Olympics in Los Angeles.  Whatever we think of the countries from Eastern Europe at least we can say that they are members of the army of Poland or of Russia.  At least they do not claim to be amateurs in the way that we pretend our athletes are amateurs.  There is not one solitary member of the Irish amateur athletic team going to the Olympics who is not a full-time professional.  If they are full-time professionals we must admit <Col N="480" /> it and allow that they are professionals and forget about this amateur status that is accorded to them by the International Olympic Council.</P>
    <P>The Government give grants for sport but in Kilkenny two young people who are brilliant basketball players cannot take up a scholarship in the United States because they cannot get the money for the air fares.  They cannot get social welfare benefits, whereas if they went on leave of absence from the Government service they would be allowed social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Matt the Thresher was mentioned by Senator Andy O'Brien.  In the days of Matt the Thresher the honour of the parish was maintained.  It is being maintained all over the country at present, not because of Government subvention but rather in spite of Government intervention. The minor sports bodies in this country are not being supported by the Government.  Minor sports play as big a part in the overall sporting scene in this country as do the major sporting bodies. The Irish Rugby Football Union, the GAA, the Golfing Union of Ireland, the FAI are the ones that come to mind as being the major sporting organisations. But there are a number of organisations apart from these that deserve support and are not getting the support.</P>
    <P>When one looks through the grants-in-aids that we have, there is not one major sporting organisation in this country that I can think of that would be able to pay their executive costs out of any grant that they get from the Government. Every penny they get goes into trying to keep offices open and trying to keep the executive part of their function going. There is not enough money going into the actual playing of games, the actual sporting activity.  I am talking about the prevention of disease, the prevention of injury, the keeping of people fit.  We spend more money putting people into hospital for tests every week in Dublin city than we do on our total budget for sport in Ireland.  That is something with which I am not satisfied.</P>
    <P>I will accept that the Minister is doing the best he can.  I do not think he is getting enough money from the Government <Col N="481" /> and I am sorry to see that this motion is down because it will give, if this motion is passed, the impression that there is an adequacy of supply of money for sporting facilities in Ireland.  There is no doubt that the contribution of the Government to sport is totally inadequate and would have to be raised before I could support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We discuss this motion at a time of high leisure activity.  Interest in athletics, jogging and sport generally has increased.  We look at it also at a time when our crime figures have increased out of all proportion as we read in the crime report for 1983.  We are talking about this particular motion in 1984, the year of the Los Angeles Olympics.  I have participated in sport.  Indeed I had the pleasure of being a founder member of the famous basketball club and the athletic club in Athlone and I have competed successfully in all Ireland and Connacht colleges championships in athletics, like my colleague beside me, and indeed I was a county footballer for four years at minor level and an international selector for the Irish amateur basketball senior side.  So I have a knowledge, going back over many years, of having a lifetime interest in sport, both on the playing side and on the administration side.  Certainly I can say that things have changed drastically since I participated in sport.  There are more facilities, I have to admit that. There are more gymnasia, there are more recognised pitches where people can train, not as I used to do across rugged ground and anywhere I could see a green space.  But I feel that in this day and age, with the life we are now leading, more and more money should be channelled into sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to be political.  I would say the same no matter who was in government.  A sum of £1 million for sport or leisure out of the total national budget is very small indeed.  The Government could probably look at this area of sport in many ways.  Looking as a member of the EEC the youth and sports grant, for example, to my own county this year of £6,500 seems to me to be <Col N="482" /> extremely paltry indeed when you consider that maybe 30 or 40 organisations will apply and clubs may only receive a figure as low as £50 or £60.  The sport advisory sub-committee of the VECs is very important.  But again the finances of that depend totally on the goodwill of the committee itself.  In Westmeath for last year a figure of £10,000 was provided. This can be very important because it provides money for education, for seminars, for coaching, for clubs right across the county.  Certainly, if an equal amount were to come from the Government it would be a big help indeed.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the Government should, when they speak of money for sport, go into the area of coaching and generally of working in this particular area.  That is why I would say that a youth and sport officer for every committee would be very important.  At the moment unfortunately all of this essential work is being pushed on to the existing staff of the various committees and no extra staff has been employed as a result of the embargo.  Cospóir has been mentioned. They have limited resources.  Their policy of sport for all, because of their limited resources, is probably the only thing they can do.  That would appear to me to be their terms of reference, and participation rather than actual competition is what they have to engage themselves in. By and large, with their limited terms of reference, they are doing a good enough job.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the bigger sports which attract huge crowds.  Certainly one would have to say that those organisations can help to fund their own organisations as distinct from, say, a swimming club.  It is regrettable that while there is a great interest in swimming in this country, we have no 50 metre pool. This could not be taken on by any swimming club in Ireland.  The Government should decide to build a 50 metre pool, probably here in Dublin, because it is a fact that our people who are competing in the Olympic trials had to go out of this country to do their qualifying times.  Perhaps this is something the Government would look at.  The same goes for rowing &mdash; a sport that has been in Athlone for <Col N="483" /> many generations.  I know many young men and women who train from 1 January right through the season, and put in dedicated work, but it costs so much to keep a club like that running.  Outriggers are enormously dear at the moment. They do not make money on regatta day because of the scattered nature of the events.  It is not a type of club that can attract spectators and collect at the gate in the same way as you would at a football match or a hurling match.  Other areas like that, canoeing and so on, are all finding themselves in the same boat of paying big prices for their equipment.</P>
    <P>The most practical way of all for the Government to help in sport would be to remove VAT from sporting equipment, from hurleys, football boots and equipment generally.  The removal of VAT would surely be an indication to everybody that our Government are concerned about sport.  This is the most practical way to help.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that no reference has been made to the great organisation of recent years, the Community Games and the fantastic work these people are doing right across the country.  They would arguably be the second largest association in the country, after the GAA.  They would have almost half a million children competing annually and this is something that has to be recognised by our Government. I know, and I would not take away for one moment from the huge community involvement at community level. They can get their prizes for raffles or whatever but at national level it is a different scene.  The Government employ and pay for the development officer of the community games but I think they could do a lot more.</P>
    <P>May I come back to the area of VAT? For example, the sum this year from the Government to the Community Games is £35,000 and yet £23,000 of that will be paid back to the Government by way of VAT.  The reason for that is that the Community Games people will have to pay for services rendered.  Over 4,000 children will attend the two weekends in Mosney, and that is the figure that they will have to pay back to the Government, £23,000 out of a total grant of £35,000.  I <Col N="484" /> am arguing strongly that that be looked at &mdash; the whole area of VAT, VAT on hurleys, VAT on football boots, VAT on stockings, VAT on rowing boats and outriggers and the whole area of sport.  Even a reduction would be a tremendous boost for the many sports, in particular the small sports that do not attract the huge crowds that the GAA or rugby or golf can do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the minor sports in this country, the less attractive sports from the spectator point of view, there is a lesson to be learned from the approach of the Irish Basketball Association.  In the last few years their approach has been for sponsorship to America.  It has been tremendously successful, and we have now Team Britvic and all the other teams and we have American players playing on Irish teams and at the moment there are 4,000 and 5,000 people going to ordinary tournament basketball games. This is a vast increase on the numbers that used to attend in the past.  There is a lesson to be learned from the Basketball Association and they should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>I do not think I will let this occasion pass without referring to the Olympic Games, which clearly are the greatest amateur sporting event in the world. When Baron de Coubertin reformed the Olympics in 1894 in Athens his theme, as it should be now, was that it is not the winning but the taking part that counts. The question is whether that still prevails today.  I have doubts.  How important and how real is amateurism in this country when you find young cyclists being given £50 and £60 a weekend just to cycle in a race?  It seems that there is something wrong, and certainly the old approach of running and cycling for the love of it is no longer there.</P>
    <P>The sad events of a number of countries not taking part in the Olympics is something we should all be saddened about.  There should be no politics in sport.  That is my own personal opinion and I feel strongly about it.  We all know the expense of staging the games is enormous. For example in Montreal in 1976 we had 88 nations taking part.  It cost the Canadian taxpayers $200 billion.  I am <Col N="485" /> saddened that politics has interfered in sport and I am saddened that it should be allowed to continue.  I would say that this year, as indeed in every year, there will be a hero or a heroine.  For example, in Montreal in 1976 we had Nadia Comancei, the world figure.  We had in Munich a Mark Spitz, in Mexico the famous long jumber Bob Beaman.  In Helsinki we had for me the greatest athlete of all time, Emil Zatopek, winning the 5,000 and the 10,000 metres and running his first marathon and winning that also.  What worries and saddens me is that some person, capable of being such a hero will not become known because he or she will not be taking part because of politics.  That is a very sad thing.  My hope is that this year will be the last time that this will happen. We are a neutral country, we are a nation held well in the esteem of the nations of the world, and somebody should make an effort once and for all to correct this position.  Our Taoiseach and our leaders at world conferences should say: &ldquo;Let us get together.  Hands off the Olympics.  Let us keep politics out of the Olympic Games.  Let us preserve the Olympic Games&rdquo;.  If it means going back to a permanent base in Athens let us do it.  It is costing millions and millions of pounds at present.  We have a duty as a small sporting, neutral nation.  We can start the ball rolling in this area.</P>

The Baron de Coubertin ideal of harmony and of friendship is definitely being destroyed.  The future of the games, in my opinion, looks extremely bleak.  Politics should never introduce on this great event.  It would be my hope that the games would become worthy of their glorious history, the high ideals which inspired their founder Baron de Coubertin and his associates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Coming back again to the local scene there is an area in which I think the Government can help out.  The Minister can help out and have words with his colleague the Minister for the Environment in the area of planning.  I believe that where you have an estate of 60, 70 or 80 houses you should have a four acre field where boys and girls can kick a football, put up pitches, play Gaelic, soccer, rugby or whatever they like.  It should be basic in every estate of that size.  If we have a pitch near every national school or if we can have a pitch and a gymnasium near every secondary school or vocational school, as Senator Deenihan said, so much the better.  The planning laws might be looked at and we might have the pitch first before we have the houses.  I am not taking from the efforts of the Minister in any way and I would say the same no matter who was there, £1 million seems a small amount of money in comparison with the overall national budget.  Nonetheless I support every effort to continue to finance sport from the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That time will be more than sufficient for me.  First of all, we should be grateful to Senators Deenihan and O'Brien for putting this motion before us.  I know from discussions I have had with both of them that they do so not in a party spirit but hoping to put on record the concern of Senators on all sides of the House in relation to the importance of sport and the importance of the Government's commitment to it and as an encouragement to this Government and any future Government to the development by them of an even greater involvement in sport.  Therefore, I should like to discuss the motion not against the background of merely congratulating the Government but also hoping and putting on record our expectations that the Government will continue to respond like this and that this policy will have cross-party support so that over a number of years, with the changes of Government that take place from time to time, the <Col N="487" /> process of development of sporting facilities would not be hindered by any such change of Government.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Members here, it strikes me that the definition of what we mean by sporting activities is very important. What I mean by sporting activities might be totally different from what other people mean by it.  I mean the development of physical activities of all kinds of a sporting nature for young people, middle aged and elderly people at all levels of skill.  This is the important thing.  We must develop a policy which caters for people at different levels of skill.  To channel all moneys into facilities and training for the specialist few will lead to a specialisation and an excellence by a small number of people and failure to develop in a proper way the lives of young people in particular who may not be gifted by God with a great deal of coordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment towards ensuring that Ireland's participation in the Olympic Games on this occasion will be well funded is welcome. While we should like to place on record that commitment and our support for it, we hope that underneath that there is going to be a big level of activity in sports. I am speaking now for the sports that will be represented in the Olympic Games starting at a parish level, at a club level and indeed at a street by street level.  I hope this will be encouraged by a Government programme which, as Senator Deenihan quite rightly states, must be based on the schools.  There is no other possible starting point for bringing young people together in a co-ordinated fashion. Young people living in cities and in country areas, widely separated from each other either by distance in the rural areas or by people of different age structures in urban situations, do not have the cohesiveness which is necessary to develop into units which will enable team efforts and team games to be practiced. Therefore, team games need some coordinating spirit or group, and the difficulty with getting young people together at a young age and the short time that is available when you take into account their other various activities, means that <Col N="488" /> the only time that is available for young people is at school.  In proposing this motion, Senator Deenihan quite rightly emphasised the importance of the education process in this, of using the time available for education &mdash; the portion of time which is available for physical activity &mdash; using it in the best possible way. This is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>This Government have, and indeed previous Governments had been developing the policy whereby schools will be encouraged not only to use the expertise of the teachers but also to bring in expertise from outside the schools.  Senator Deenihan again emphasised something which is very important: there is a change taking place in the relationship between male and female teachers in national schools and that will have a very serious consequence in years to come for skills of a type which are normally practiced by men.  The employment by the schools, with the encouragement of the Government, of outside helpers to make up for this potential deficiency is very important if the team games of which we are so proud are to survive and prosper.  This is absolutely vital.  In this regard I know that the Minister will speak &mdash; when he speaks in this debate &mdash; of developments that have taken place in this regard.  My son at present &mdash; as part of his school curriculum &mdash; is being tutored in hurling and in Gaelic football.  This is being done by young people who previous to being employed in this area were unemployed. It is being done under the supervision of their teachers and it is tremendously successful. This is one example of what the Government can do to aid schools and help young people to overcome the difficulties caused by the changes that have taken place and will continue to take place in national schools in years to come. In ten or 20 years' time national teaching is going to be a totally female-dominated profession.</P>

      <P>The Government have further duties in helping the more structured organisations like the Gaelic Athletic <Col N="489" /> Association.  It is also very important to help organisations like the Community Games.  While the Community Games have a competitive element, the number of people who participate at parish level is enormous.  The frequency of their participation is the only thing which is unsatisfactory because the number of times in which they participate in a year is quite small at Community Games level.  Leaving that matter aside, they do more good, not in their national finals at Butlins but at community and parish levels, than a lot of the more structured and permanent and traditional organisations. The Government have helped the Community Games in this regard and they should continue to help them.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to say that the sporting facilities being provided now by the Government either directly or indirectly in schools, through community councils, through the development of physical structures on pitches owned by the various sporting associations and the help being received from the Government for this, through the aegis of AnCO and the various other agencies of this nature, are all to be welcomed.  The Government should be encouraged not only to continue those projects but to develop them so that with the increasing amount of leisure time which is available to young people they can be encouraged to use it when they are young so that in later years when the number of hours work available to them or the number of hours which they will be expected to do, will be less than was done by their forefathers, they will have got into the habit of using their leisure time in a constructive and manly fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter, which is to do with the decision of the Department of Social Welfare not to pay unemployment assistance to two members of the Irish under-18 international soccer team during their participation in the European championships in Moscow recently. There is a certain obvious irony in my talking about this in the light of the last hour and a half's discussion.  I am sorry I could not be here for it but I had to prepare something for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a major international success scored by an Irish team in recent weeks and the Irish media did not notice it very much either, so it is just not politicians who can be complained about.  An Irish under-18 soccer team competed in the Soviet Union in the European championships and were outstandingly successful. They beat teams like Scotland and Portugal and eventually qualified for the semi-final where they were very honourably defeated by the Soviet Union, the host country, by two goals to one.  By any standards, for any country that would be a creditable performance.  For a country as small as this country where association football is a minority sport, it was an extremely impressive performance, a performance which one would have thought would have merited them not just the congratulations but the gratitude of this country.  It would have merited congratulations, not just for the impressive way they carried the name of Ireland <Col N="491" /> but for the achievement of the young people in itself and by themselves.</P>
    <P>There was a problem associated with that team because of the way we still persist in dealing with this issue.  The problem was that five members of that team had the misfortune to be unemployed, that is, we their elders and their betters had failed to organise a society which would guarantee them, the young, the less able and the more vulnerable jobs which would give them a decent living and a decent income.  They qualified for unemployment assistance.  They were unemployed; they are not professional footballers.  The welcome they got when they came home, instead of the congratulations of all of us, was to be told that because they were out of the country for two weeks and therefore not available for work, the congratulations they got was the withholding of unemployment assistance for two weeks, which amounts to £28.90 per young person per week, or £57.80 for two weeks.</P>
    <P>We have a quarter of a million people unemployed in this country.  Why were these young people refused unemployment assistance?  Because, they were told, they were not available for work.  It is very easy for those of us who have £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 a year to elaborate definitions of availability for work.  The truth, of course, is that there are a quarter of a million people available for work in this country but that work is not available.  Of that quarter of a million people, a large proportion &mdash; the numbers can be argued, probably 60,000 or 70,000 &mdash; are young people.  Of those young people about a quarter receive no State assistance.  Our two young successful people, keeping themselves busy, finding something useful to do with what otherwise would be a wasted life, were told that because they were not available for work in those weeks they were away in Moscow being a success, achieving something, they could not qualify for unemployment assistance.  The implication, which I hope is not intended, is &ldquo;How dare you be successful if you are unemployed?&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you are so successful, why have you not got a job?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The narrow and extraordinary definition <Col N="492" /> of availability for work implied in this decision is not just a question or a suggestion of controlling people who might be refusing to work but is operated in such a way that a necessary process of subjugation is required in order for people to qualify for unemployment assistance.  It took an enormous compaign to get voluntary social work exempted from those rules.  Unemployed nurses who wanted to help old people recently were told that if they did so they would be refused unemployment assistance. They were going to do it for nothing, I emphasise.  They would be refused unemployment assistance because if they were doing this voluntary service they would not be available for work.</P>
    <P>These young people with their enormous achievements are being told precisely the same.  Because they were not here and managed to escape from the ghetto of unemployment through their own successes, our response is to tell them that they are not eligible for unemployment assistance.  The vast sum of money &mdash; £28.90 a week &mdash; is best put in perspective by comparing it with something like the eating out guide in <i>The Irish Times</i> which happily suggests that £28 or £30 would be good value for a meal for two in any restaurant in Dublin.  That is what we give these youngsters to live on for the week.  Then we tell them that they cannot have it because they were doing something useful and were not available for work.</P>
    <P>I do not know what motivates us to take decisions like this.  I do not know what motivates us deep down to support that sort of practice.  There is no legislative reason why it has to be like that because availability for work is a matter of practice, a matter of regulation and not a matter of law.  In the days when unemployment was less people had to sign on two days a week and some people, when they were suspected of not being available for work or perhaps of having a job on the side, were required to sign on for five days a week.  When unemployment developed into massive proportion it suddenly became necessary to sign on only one day a week and in Northern Ireland it is necessary to sign <Col N="493" /> on only once a fortnight.  There is obviously room for expansion, contraction and room for manoeuvre.  One has to ask why do we have these definitions. The tragedy would be, of course, that this definition was convenient in keeping a large number of people from qualifying for benefit.  I do not know whether it is true or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare recently addressed a conference on poverty and unemployment and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of last Tuesday reported as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What do we hear from some of our ultra conservative politicians and commentators who go to bed at night with a full stomach and worrying only about when to trade in the year old car or the high rate of VAT on golf balls?&rdquo;, he asked.</P>
    <P>The Minister criticised the widespread hostility among an influential powerful minority in Irish society to any welfare system which sought to provide any sort of decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The junior Minister in that Department is with us and in this specific case he cannot blame the other Government party or the trade unions or industry. This is a matter of administration and administrative practice.  There are no other scapegoats to be identified.  What we have in this country is a sort of fear of our young people which has been translated into a capacity to blame them for being unemployed and to blame them for even existing.  We have an obsessiveness with fear, fiddle and fraud which runs through the entire welfare system and undermines the objectives of that system, which are to help and support and to sustain.</P>
    <P>These two young people came from what must have been a lower income group background.  For a youngster living at home to qualify for unemployment assistance in the first place the family income has to be relatively low.  Therefore it is easy to conjecture that the deprivation of the admittedly miserly £30 <Col N="494" /> could have resulted in as large a reduction in that family's income as 25 per cent. Two already marginally impoverished families were expected and required by our society to sustain a further 25 per cent reduction in that minimal lifestyle so that two of the children could be successful on their own behalf or on our behalf in an international sporting competition.</P>
    <P>What the Minister, the Government and we as a society need to do is to restate in a fundamental fashion what we mean by availability for work.  There is no point in saying, and I hope the Minister will not do it, that there are regulations to be observed or it is a complex or a difficult issue.  The trouble is that it would be very simple to identify people who were not available for work if there were plenty of jobs available because one could identify the people who were actually offered work and did not take it.  Then there would be no problem.  The problem is when there is no work to offer people how do you determine whether they are available for work or not?  The truth is, of course, that if work is not available it is particularly humiliating to tell people that they must be judged as being available for something which does not exist. Therefore the whole concept of availability for work must be abolished or restated. I would suggest simply that anybody in receipt of unemployment assistance who is offered a job which could be reasonably adjudicated as being relevant to their skills and qualifications and declines that offer would then be deemed to be not available for work.  To do otherwise is to suggest to the unemployed that he is not allowed to do anything, to be anywhere, or to be anybody. He is a sub person whom we adjudicate on, whom we decide for and whom we keep in a proper place.  It is a well established practice in this country in many areas of the public service that people who want leave of absence, in many cases with pay, for sporting achievements of one kind or another will be granted such leave of absence.  Apparently similar provisions are not either available or acceptable for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The way young people are dealt with in issues like this indicates why somebody <Col N="495" /> as eminent as Justin Keating of the Minister's own party could talk about the fury of the young.  What they know is that what is said about them, the platitudes that are generated about them, and the realities of their own experiences conflict head on.  For these two youngsters ever to be told that society recognises their worth or their contribution will seem to them to be nothing more than a fundamentally dishonest statement.  They know that in the one specific area where society contributes something to them society's response to their achievements was to say: &ldquo;No, you cannot have anything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a certain irony in talking about these young people and in talking about what we as a society and as politicans attempt to do on their behalf.  They arrived home at Dublin Airport a few hours after a certain eminent visitor left and, in the words of the gardaí, democracy was restored in this country.  That extraordinary spectacle of politicans jostling each other to get into the queue to say goodbye to one man was replaced by the absence of any political figure to welcome home a team which, by any standards had been extremely successful. Once the youngsters got back to the unemployment exchange they knew that there was not really any welcome for them anyway.</P>
    <P>It seems that these young people, along with the large mass of unemployed people, now know fairly clearly something many of us have suspected, that deep down the establishment reaction to young people is that they are frightened of them and wish they would all emigrate. The establishment reaction is that if we cannot give them jobs we must at least keep them under control.  One way to control them is to keep them in subjection in the way we deal with them regarding unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary contrast between the silence about the humiliation of the urban unemployed, of which this is an extreme example, and the extraordinary and quite justifiable clamour that the major Government parties raised about the treatment of people being assessed for what is called &ldquo;farmers' <Col N="496" /> dole&rdquo;.  They were quite right to raise that clamour, but there is an extraordinary contrast in the silence on this issue. Is that because our young people have failed to make their political clout known?</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister.  Please do not give me a script prepared by the same civil service that is responsible for these rules.  Please do not give me an explanation about why not.  Please do not tell me that there are administrative problems.  I know and this House knows that there is no such thing as an impossible administrative problem.  I know and this House knows that there is no such thing as a problem that cannot be overcome. The solution is not to explain away the problem.  The solution is to dispose of the problem, not just in the case of two young people who either for their good or ill fortune had enough prominence at least to have their case identified, but for the large number of people, and particularly for women, who are regular victims of this non-availability for work escape clause.</P>
    <P>What I ask of the Minister is a response to the problem and not an explanation for the <i>status quo.</i> What I ask of the Minister is a procedure for the future which will enable our young people to get at least the pittance that we adjudicated as their entitlement without constant humiliation, a system of administering our utterly inadequate unemployment assistance scheme which will at least not further the humiliation of those whom we, their elders and their alleged betters, humiliate by our inadequacies and our inability to provide full employment.  I would say in conclusion that to reorganise this small aspect of unemployment assistance would be a worthy objective of anybody who stands under the name of socialism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with one point made by Senator Ryan.  It would be very nice if we could pay benefit to everyone in every set of circumstances but unfortunately or fortunately, as one may look at it, all schemes and all methods of payment are <Col N="497" /> governed by legislation and it is the duty of the Minister and the Department to apply the legislation as it is.  No Department could be run on the basis of <i>ad hoc</i> regulations and changing of legislation to suit particular circumstances.  If the administration in any Department, particularly Social Welfare, is to be of benefit to anyone, especially the recipients, it must work on the basis of as clearly defined legislation as one can have.  There is no point in trying to make the case that legislation and regulations should be ignored from day to day depending on circumstances and that somebody should decide on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis that regulations should be changed from day to day to suit situations.</P>
      <P>The two men to whom the motion refers have been in receipt of unemployment payments for some months.  Both of them recently visited the Soviet Union for a few weeks as members of the Irish Youth football team who were competing in the finals of the European Youth soccer championships.  Prior to their departure they inquired at the employment exchange whether they would receive unemployment payments for the period of their absence.  They were told that no payment could be made in respect of any day on which they were absent from the State.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the decision to refuse unemployment payments for the period in question was in accordance with the legislation on the matter.  It is provided in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 that a person shall be disqualified for unemployment assistance for any day on which he or she is outside the State.  My Department had no choice but to apply this provision to the two claimants concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general principle in the social welfare legislation that payments are not made for periods of absence from the State.  There are certain exceptions to this general rule.  These apply mainly to contributory benefits where entitlement is established on the basis of contributions. For example, there is no restriction in relation to contributory pensioners who generally speaking may receive their pensions <Col N="498" /> when they are living abroad.  Payment in the case of pensions does not present difficulty because once entitlement is established the payment can continue indefinitely.  In the case of shortterm benefits, however, there is the obvious difficulty in relation to payment while abroad that entitlement under these schemes must be continually verified, through, in the case of disability benefit, frequent medical certification and, in the case of unemployment benefit, regular attendance at the local office. Generally speaking, therefore, shortterm benefits are not payable during absence from the State.  There is an exception in the case of disability benefit that a person may be paid in respect of a period when he is absent abroad temporarily for the purpose of receiving treatment.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment payments the situation is more difficult.  It is a basic condition of entitlement to unemployment benefit that the person be available for work and for this purpose he must be attached to the labour market in this country.  We are not exceptional in having this condition as part of our scheme. It is also a feature of social security schemes elsewhere.  The only significant modification to the general provision that a person is not entitled to unemployment benefit while absent from the State is the special provision made under the EEC regulations concerning social security benefits for migrant workers.  Even there, however, the circumstances in which unemployment benefit can be payable to persons who go to another country to seek employment are fairly restrictive, and special arrangements are made for the person concerned to prove his availability for work while he is abroad.</P>
    <P>The condition that the person be available for work is fundamental to the unemployment payment schemes.  It would be impossible effectively to apply this condition when people are absent from the State in circumstances referred to in the motion.  The situation in which the two young men concerned found themselves cannot, therefore, be catered for under the unemployment benefit scheme.  It is not for me to suggest that <Col N="499" /> other arrangements should be made for young people who get an opportunity of this kind, but the fact that unemployment payments cannot be made in this sort of situation should obviously be a factor to be taken into account when arrangements for visits abroad of this kind are being drawn up.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Senator Ryan in extending my congratulations to the team and to the individuals.  I agree that their participation in these games representing their country merits greater gratitude, but I would respectfully suggest that it is not for the Department of Social Welfare to provide that gratitude. It is shameful in one way in that the only thing that can be sought for these people who have brought such honour to this country is unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  That is a shameful situation and it highlights an obvious weakness somewhere along the line, but to expect the Department of Social Welfare to amend legislation or to ignore legislation to cater for a missing link somewhere else is stretching the point too much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Within the limitations of the legislation governing the unemployment payment schemes, the arrangements for providing availability for work are applied as flexibly as possible.  I might mention that new arrangements were introduced earlier this year in my Department which enable unemployed claimants to take a holiday and be paid benefit or assistance for the period of their holiday.  These arrangements only apply, however, to holidays within the State because of the fact that the legislation precludes payment of benefit or assistance for any period spent abroad.  In the circumstances of the case referred to here, there was no possibility within the existing legislation governing the schemes whereby payments could have been made to the young men concerned during their absence from the State.</P>
