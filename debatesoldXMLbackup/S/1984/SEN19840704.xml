      <P>I have had no indication of any amendment on the Landlord and Tenant Bill.  If there are amendments we could have discussions then as to whether it would be better to take them later today or next week.  In regard to the Irish Steel Bill, again there has been no indication of amendments.  The principle of the Bill seems very clear.  The sections are not complex.  My hope is that all Stages of these two Bills could be taken.  Of course, I had hopes yesterday that were not realised.</P>

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The special ground rents purchase scheme provided in Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 was given a life of five years and that life was extended for a period of 12 months, that is to 31 July next, by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1983, subject to an increase in the fees payable under the scheme.  The main purpose of this Bill is to extend the purchase scheme for a further period of three years, subject to a further increase in the fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1967 ground rent tenants have had the right to purchase their ground rents under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  The 1978 No. 2 Act introduced a special simplified scheme of purchase under which the Land Registry do the legal work at less cost to the applicant than would be involved in buying out under the 1967 Act.  The scheme applies to dwellinghouses. In all, 44,465 dwellinghouse owners had applied under the scheme up to the end of May.  Of these over 20,000, or 45 per cent had lodged their applications <Col N="867" /> since 1 January 1983.  The arrears on hands on 31 May 1984 amounted to 16,968.  These comprised 13,083 applications made with the consent of the landlords and 3,885 applications for arbitration.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may recall that one reason for last year's extension of the scheme by one year was the large number of applications that were received by the Land Registry as the original five-year period drew to a close and the fact that, were the scheme not to be extended, many intending purchasers might have been unable to lodge completed applications in time.  Moreover, the rate at which applications were being made was creating a situation where the Land Registry staff concerned would in any event have to continue their work under the scheme until well after the original termination date.  The experience since is that the Land Registry have continued to receive fresh applications at a rate of about 400 per month.  The Land Registry staff must therefore continue to be employed for some time &mdash; a time stretching to years rather than to months only &mdash; in processing the applications in hand, details of which I have given.  Moreover, it is clear that there are still numbers of ground rent tenants who are anxious to avail themselves of the scheme and in all the circumstances the Government have decided to propose a further extension of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scheme raises the question of the cost of its operation.  The fees that were originally payable by applicants under the scheme were little more than nominal, and were fixed so as to encourage the abolition by purchase of ground rents on dwellinghouses.  However, those fees were substantially increased last year on the basis that, if the life of the scheme were to be extended beyond the original five-year period, the scheme must begin to pay its way.  The 1983 Act sets out the fees that are at present payable by a purchaser who is in occupation of the relevant dwellinghouse. In the case of a dwelling where the person entitled to acquire the ground rent is not in occupation, the fees to be taken by the Land Registry are fixed by <Col N="868" /> regulations made under the 1978 No. 2 Act.  Although last years' extension of the scheme was, as I have said, accompanied by an increase in the fees payable, public funds have continued to bear a significant part of the cost of the scheme mainly because of the large number of applications that were made at the old fees and that are still being processed.  It is difficult to estimate what level of fees would actually cover costs if arrears did not come into the reckoning, but the best estimate that can be made is that an increase of 75 per cent in the level of fees is the minimum that is needed to cover costs in respect of new applications.  Provision for an increase of that order is made in section 3 of the Bill so far as concerns applications from purchasers who are in occupation of their dwellinghouses. Corresponding increases in the remaining fees will be promulgated by way of a fees order, following enactment into law of this Bill.  Since costs could change in the course of the proposed three-year extension of the scheme and since the increase of 75 per cent is very much a minimum estimate, it is necessary to make provision for further changes in the level of the fees so as to keep them in line with costs, and that is what is proposed in subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill.  It provides that the existing power to change fees by order will in future extend to all fees &mdash; up to the present some fees have been fixed by the statute and could not be changed by order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes certain changes in relation to the fee payable under the section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act.  Section 26 of that Act gives ground rent tenants of housing authorities the right to buy out the fee simple, subject to certain conditions. The fee simple is vested in the purchasing lessee by way of a transfer order under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, and section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act fixes a fee of £5 for the issue of that transfer order.  This fee has so far remained unchanged, despite last year's increase in the fees payable under the Land Registry scheme.  It may perhaps be accepted that the considerations that apply in the case of the section 26 fee are not those that apply in the case of the <Col N="869" /> Land Registry fees.  Nevertheless the lowest fee payable under the Land Registry scheme was also £5 in 1978, was increased to £15 last year and is now to become £26.  In the circumstances it is only reasonable that the section 26 fee should now be increased to £20, and that it should be open to variation in the future by way of a fees order in the same way as fees generally may be so varied. Section 4 provides for these changes.  Any fees order under section 26 of the 1978 No. 2 Act will, it is proposed, be made by the Minister for the Environment, since the section 26 fee is payable to a housing authority.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill, or certainly welcome the part of it which extends the time for making these applications.  I am very glad, indeed, to hear from the Minister that so many people have made application over the years and that, in fact, far from the applications diminishing they are still quite considerable in number, and there is still a steady flow.  I hope this will continue.  If it is necessary to extend this Bill again sometime in the future, I have no doubt that this House would be agreeable to do so.</P>
      <P>This Bill and the original Bill in 1978 are the proper way to deal with the problem of ground rents.  I have never been convinced of the merits of the ground rents abolition campaign quite apart from constitutional difficulty, which is an insurmountable difficulty unless a fundamental change is made in the Constitution. The campaigners said that there are unusual cases, hardship cases, and so on, and, of course, there are unusual cases.  It is very easy to arouse a certain amount of emotion by talking about absentee landlords and that kind of thing, but they are exceptional and, as time goes on, they are more and more exceptional. The campaign is not relevant to the vast majority of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the proper and sensible way to deal with this problem.  The Bill which was introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1978 was intended to meet this problem.  There <Col N="870" /> was a great deal of agitation and discussion about ground rents and all parties at the time undertook to make some effort to deal with the problem.  What was introduced in the 1978 Act did not satisfy everybody but nevertheless it was a very good effort to meet this problem.</P>
    <P>The important parts of the 1978 Act were, first of all, to make the procedure simple and, secondly, to make it as cheap as possible and, by so doing, to defuse the agitation for the abolition of ground rents.  The fees were small in 1978 and there was very little complaint at that time in relation to the fees.  It is fair to say that some increase in the fee might be justified at this stage, but the position is gone beyond that.  It is no longer a nominal fee.  A nominal fee was one of the essential ingredients of the Act.  Now the fees are rather formidable and are such that people will think twice about adopting this approach to the ground rents problem and, instead of doing so, will be liable to join the ground rents abolition campaign, which would be most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Bill not only introduces specific increases in the fees but also gives the Minister unlimited power to increase fees in the future.  Having regard to the fact that the ground rents campaign is still going on, that there is still a certain amount of agitation, and that this rather futile campaign is still being promoted, it is unfortunate that the fees were increased to the extent provided for in the Bill and that power is given to increase them further.  There are many Bills on which the Minister or the Government would be entitled to say the State is providing certain services and the fees for these services should have some relation to what they actually cost, and to the effect of inflation, but this is a different Bill.  This is a Bill to deal with a very difficult situation, many people feel it is a rather fundamental situation, and the Government should go out of their way to try to deal with that problem, to defuse that agitation and to ensure that the fees paid are purely nominal ones.</P>
    <P>If my suggestion is adopted it will cost the Government more than the actual <Col N="871" /> fees paid.  Nevertheless, to deal with this most unusual problem it would be well worth while for the Government to continue to charge what could be regarded as nominal fees, and to encourage people to adopt this means of dealing with their ground rent problem rather than the other means &mdash; agitation and campaigns to try to abolish the whole system.  Whereas I welcome the extension of the time for applying under this Act, it is regrettable that the fees have been increased to the extent to which they have been increased under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the time for applicants under the old scheme and, indeed, new applications arising from this extension.  I do not necessarily agree with Senator Eoin Ryan that the campaign is futile.  I ask the Minister to continue his efforts to overcome legal or constitutional loopholes in the area of ground rents.  It is a highly emotive subject particularly in Dublin city where large numbers of householders have refused to pay their ground rents as a matter of principle.</P>
      <P>There has been a well documented and well orchestrated campaign against the principle of ground rents.  Many of us share the view that they are an old and outdated means of taxation on people and on property which they legally own apart from the actual ground on which the house is built.  There is something intrinsically and fundamentally wrong with a system which allows old landlords and, indeed, absentee landlords throughout the world who will probably never come back to this country again, technically and legally to have access to land on which Houses have been standing for well nigh 100 years.  I hope the Minister, who is progressive in many areas of legislation, will continue to use his ingenuity to overcome whatever legal problems exist. The Government should have the courage to deal with whatever constitutional problems there may be in this area.  Pending that, the extension of time must be welcomed.  I am not sure about the actual date on which these increases will apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I presume also that applicants who have already instructed the agents of landlords and submitted money to them, although they may not necessarily have applied yet to the Land Registry, will be dealt with under the old scheme of fees.  It is a matter for the agents of landlords to process the application through the Land Registry Office. I know some people who have been forced into this situation and who have surrendered some money to the agents of landlords.  I am particularly thinking of the Smith-Barry estate in Tipperary who were extensive landlords in that area, going back to the historical building of the new town of Tipperary.  People's leases are running out and they are being asked for extraordinarily high figures. They are trying to negotiate with the agents of the landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other section of the Bill which concerns me a little is the one dealing with the amendment of section 26 of the Act which refers to tenancies which have been purchased by housing authority tenants. These were vesting and house purchase schemes and all of us had asked tenants to avail of them.  It is everybody's aspiration if at all possible to own their own house.  I notice in quite a lot of the vesting orders that there is a small fee of 5p per year written in which maintains some control over the actual legality to the title.  It is in that area I presume that the Minister under section 90 of the Housing Act is allowing the tenant to purchase out that fee simple over a number of years.  He is suggesting that a fee of £20 would be charged for this type of application to the Land Registry.  We are now dealing with people who are certainly not the owners of very exclusive houses but who made an effort to acquire their houses under a purchase scheme with the Department of the Environment. I would like that every facility be given them to acquire complete and full ownership of their houses, to the title and to the land on which their houses were built at as nominal a figure as possible. While I do not think that £20 is an exhorbitant <Col N="873" /> figure, I do not think it is in keeping with the type of house that we have been dealing with and I ask the Minister to leave such applicants alone.  They are the lowest in the bracket of people wanting to acquire their own houses.</P>
    <P>Other than that I welcome the Bill which will deal with a rather large number of applicants, something like 17,000 people, who are in arrears.  I have no doubt there will be more applicants until such time as this Government come to grips with the constitutional problem of ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the provisions that were made initially to enable people to buy out their ground rents are being extended and continued but I would throw in a little caveat.  People like us refer to sums of £20 and £30 as nominal sums and they are for us.  However, there are many people who perhaps would find £20 to be far from a nominal sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Ferris said in his concluding remarks.  Ground rents are a relic of feudalism.  The idea that somebody can retain some claim to a piece of property <i>ad infinitum</i>, and the idea that we as a community cannot legislate that out of existence because of the state of our Constitution should cause us great concern.  We have a great need to have a Constitution which protects the rights of individuals, including may I say, the right of an individual to security in the ownership of his or her property.  I have no ideological problem with people having security of ownership of their property. That right to own property is enshrined in many constitutions including, offhand, the constitution of the People's Republic of Cuba but to suggest that that can be extended so that absentee landlords and all sorts of extraordinary individuals can claim a constitutional right either to ground rent or to compensation for it is pushing what is a necessary and proper provision to the point of extreme ludicrousness.  I simply say again that if we are to have a proper balance in our social legislation and a proper balance in our general attempts to regulate the inter-relationship between property ownership <Col N="874" /> and the community, then the whole question of this extraordinary narrow and conservative constitutional protection of ownership of property and the right to own property which preserves rights such as this with almost absolute certainty and without qualification will have to be tackled sooner or later.</P>
    <P>Unlike my namesake, therefore, I am very pleased that there is a ground rents campaign going on.  I hope it will be successful and I hope at the end of the day that its final objective will be achieved, which is the constitutional amendment to ensure that what is an extraordinary relic of feudalism will be once and for all abolished. The idea that some sort of lasting title exists because of historical circumstances shall be abolished once and for all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am not going to get into too much of an argument about the fees.  For most property owners they are not unreasonable.  However, as society has developed, as middle-aged people lose their jobs and as redundancies extend, the sort of fees that are mentioned could become quite a severe penalty for somebody who has a very limited income.  It might be well to have a look at a provision for people of limited income to be able to get around this. There is something extraordinary in somebody with a very limited income having the option either of paying £50, £60 or £70 or more to buy out their ground rents or else having to pay ground rent indefinitely to somebody who is vastly more wealthy and more secure than they are themselves.  That is why I suggest that there should be review of the position of people on low incomes in this context.  While it is not a large sum to us, there are many people to whom £40 or £50 is probably as big as their total weekly income.  We should look at things like that in their perspective and not in ours.</P>
    <P>In principle, the Bill is welcome and I hope it will achieve its desired objective which is to end at least for householders this most extraordinary hangover from what I would regard as feudal times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted it will extend for a further period of three <Col N="875" /> years the operation of the special ground rents purchase scheme introduced by the 1978 Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act.  It will also increase the fees payable in respect of such applications to the Land Registry.  It is interesting to note that the operation of the 1978 Act was extended for one year in 1983 and that a mere 12 months later we are faced with another amending statute which extends for a further period of three years the operation of the provisions of that Act.  The reason for that probably has to do with the lack of staff in the Land Registry.  Rather than be faced with a situation where we will be extending this legislation again in three years time, the Minister should ensure that additional staff are made available within the ground rents section of the Land Registry to allow outstanding applications to be disposed of at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here to the ground rents abolition campaign and the publicity which that campaign has achieved in the past.  It is a pity that State bodies like the Land Registry do not resort to a little publicity at times when they are trying to promote particular schemes such as the scheme operating under this legislation.  By examining the way that State-sponsored bodies like Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post have publicised schemes operating within their confines a lesson could be learned.  It is a pity the Land Registry do not take steps to ensure that the operations of this scheme is made available to everybody who would be interested.  I make that point despite the fact that the Land Registry appears to be over-burdened with applications of this nature.  The existence of the scheme should be publicised to try to get the problem cleared up to the maximum possible extent within the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that the mapping section of the Land Registry so far as applications for the purchase of ground rents in rural areas are concerned should prepare scheme maps.  I say this from experience of the towns of Castlebar and Westport where ground rent interests vest in the estates of the missing Earl of Lucan and the current Marquis of Sligo respectively. <Col N="876" /> These interests are by and large registered in the Land Registry on freehold folios owned by the holders of these estates, but when a person wishes to apply to purchase the ground rent interest he has to take steps to employ his own engineer to map that interest on the ground in accordance with Land Registry regulations.  The cost of doing that in practical terms could amount to about £50 in each particular case.  It would be of benefit for everybody in situations of that nature if master scheme maps were made available for towns where particular ground landlords hold substantial interests.  That would certainly cut out an amount of cost in the case of the older ground rent interests.</P>
    <P>The increase in fees in respect of this legislation is understandable.  Some people speak here as though the State should subsidise every aspect of man's activity including the purchase of a property interest.  I am amazed that people occasionally come into this House and attack the rights of property and at other times make suggestions that the State should subsidise people to acquire a right in property.  The purchase of a ground rent interest is the purchase of a right in property.  The ground rents section of the Land Registry should operate, as far as possible, on the basis of the minimum cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The whole question of ground rents is an emotive one.  In recent years it has become a political issue and certain political groups have peddled the issue for the purpose of achieving maximum political advantage.  As Senator Eoin Ryan said, there are constitutional difficulties with regard to the abolition of any property interest and this applies here even at local level.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country this issue is being peddled for political advantage. People have been suggesting that it is not possible to purchase ground rent interests in the Earl of Lucan's estate, but that is not the case.  Reference has also been made here today to the fact that these are interests by and large held by absentee landlords and Senator Brendan Ryan used the phrase &ldquo;a relic of feudalism&rdquo;. <Col N="877" /> The impression created in people's minds is that all these interests are owned by people who have no commitment to this State and who are not Irish.  If one were to carry out a survey on extant ground rent interests one would find that the great majority of them, particularly in the cities, are owned by Irish people and have been created in recent years.  It is quite amazing how the wrong impression can be conveyed regarding the ownership of these interests.</P>
    <P>I fully support this Bill and I hope that the Minister will take account of the points I made regarding expediting applications of this nature within the Land Registry, making additional staff available to deal with them and publicising the operation of this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Like other Members of the House I am totally opposed to the principle of ground rents.  It is unfortunate that there has to be such an increase in the fees chargeable as the changing and increasing of fees by order might cause disquiet.  If the fees were deliberately nominal it would be an encouragement to people to purchase their ground rents and it is a pity that this incentive, to some extent, will be lost.</P>
      <P>The extension of the scheme for one year was, as the Minister said, very necessary. Many people at that time felt one was not sufficient and I would like to ask the Minister if he feels that this three-year extension is long enough.  Everyone agrees that the flow of applications has been satisfactory and I hope that, through this Bill, it will continue to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hypocritical to say that I welcome the Bill because when you do not believe in the concept of ground rents, there is no point in saying that you welcome a system that encourages people to purchase ground rents which they should have acquired when they purchased the property.  I do not agree with ground rents and I know the problem that faces people in this regard. I have to live with it, it is a fact of life and a way if dealing with an awkward situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Quite a few people are in agreement that ground rents should be abolished and that there should not be any future problems in this regard.  On the other hand, people want an extension of the option to purchase.  That is a contradiction.  You are either in favour of this or you are in favour of going all out as hard as possible to get the Constitution changed.  The Labour Party believe that there should not be any ground rents.  But we have not been able to get any legal support for having the Constitution changed.  I do not propose to argue the question of whether you charge a fee, since I think they should be abolished.  The Minister mentioned increasing the fees.  If we are going to have further extensions the whole idea of buying out the ground rents will go.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of idealism on my part.  I never denied anybody the right to own property but I believe when you buy a house you should own the ground it stands on.  I will vote for the Bill but I will support the campaign for the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions and their general support of the measures undertaken. The cost of purchasing grounds rents is based on a sum of money which one would invest in the most recent national loan which would throw up an interest equivalent to the ground rent. When the Bill was introduced in 1978 the multiplier was around 13 times the ground rent.  For example, if the ground rent was £15, which is the most normal one in suburbia, you multiply that by something over 13.  As interest rates go up, naturally the multiplier comes down. At present the multiplier is about 7.2.  So you are talking about seven times £15 which is £105 and a fee which was £15 and is now going to £26.  So even though the percentage increase in the fee is quite large you are talking about an increase of £11 on what is by far the most common case where there is purchase by consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the theory but as any of us who are familiar with the situation know, what happens on the ground is different.  Many <Col N="879" /> ground landlords find it increasingly difficult to collect ground rents.  They are very happy when a residents' association approaches them with a proposition to purchase.  They will make an arrangement for far less than the multiplier of seven.  I have heard of cases where they will sell down as low as three times the ground rent.  It is quite common to make an arrangement with a multiplier of four or five.  We are talking about four times £15 &mdash; if we take £15 as the most common ground rent or indeed £20 &mdash; making £60 plus £26, that is a total of £86.  If we move away from the percentages and look at the global figures that is what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have said that they disagree with the principle of ground rent and that we should make changes to abolish ground rent completely.  The difficulty is, as Senator Brendan Ryan pointed out, that people have a constitutional right to private property.  Like all constitutional or fundamental rights the right is indivisible.  We cannot pick and choose to whom the rights of the Constitution apply.  The entitlement to ground rent is a form of private property. We may not like that, we may not like the idea that people can collect ground rent; we may not agree with the principle that people can collect ground rent.  But the Constitution guarantees the right to private property.  I do not think we should go down the road where we would suggest making changes in the Constitution to protect the rights of some just because we agree that they should have such rights but would not protect the rights of others because we did not like the nature of their activity.  That would be a very dangerous position.</P>

Take the right to life.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am making the point here that because of that difficulty &mdash; and I would be surprised if a majority of the Seanad advocated that we would change to allow the right to private property to some and not to others &mdash; the position then is that the only way we can abolish ground rent is to abolish it by compensation.  I do not know what the compensatory figures would be, but I have been given figures which range between £30 million and £60 million.  I am quite sure also that, if it came to compensation, we would not be talking about a residents' association agreeing to a multiplier of four with the landlord; we would be talking about the landlord holding out for the last decimal point of the multiplier under the purchase scheme of the 1978 Act.  No new ground rents on dwelling houses have been created since 1978; they cannot be.  We are talking about houses built prior to 1978.  For the purposes of the argument and for the purposes of the Bill, we are talking about private houses.  We are talking about people who own an asset ranging from somewhere between £30,000 and whatever ceiling you like to put on the type of house, £80,000, £90,000, £100,000. Those who advocate abolition by compensating <Col N="881" /> landlords for the loss of their interest are really saying that there should be a transfer from the taxpayer to relieve the burden on people who already own their own houses.  In the other House I have heard people putting forward that argument from an ideological position which I thought would have differed from their most advertised ideological position. I cannot see how anybody can sustain an argument which says that every time a PAYE worker, an old age pensioner or the poor, buy anything on which there is VAT, or every time that they pay income tax that money should be transferred so that people who already own their own houses should be compensated to the extent of giving them an extra benefit which ranges between £80 and £120 in general terms.</P>
      <P>Senators argued about the increase in the fees, and I argue along the same lines. Why should the general taxpayer subsidise the administrative costs of ground rent purchase in the Land Registry?  Why should the general run of the taxpayers be put in a situation where some of their money is transferred into the Land Registry so that administration can be carried out not at real cost but at a nominal fee to enable people to acquire that total interest in their houses, in their own assets?  I do not think that stands up to any serious argument either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme introduced in 1978 was in response to a particular situation and the attempt was to abolish ground rents by purchase.  A five year period to give people the opportunity to buy out their houses was mentioned and the charge of a nominal fee was justified.  Now we have come into the areas of extensions I think there should be a fee which compensates the Land Registry and the taxpayer for the administrative costs.  We are not talking about huge fees; we are talking about an increase from £15 to £26 in the most common cases where there is purchase by consent.  Remember, we are talking about people who own their own houses and who want the fee simple.  On the local authority side the fee was £5 and it is now £20.  Again, we are talking about people who are purchasing their houses <Col N="882" /> under one scheme or another.  They are becoming property owners.  They want the exclusive right to that property by getting the fee simple as well.  This has an administrative cost and it is more appropriate that the administrative cost should be borne by the purchaser rather than by the taxpayer.  That is the particular issue in the increase in fees.</P>
    <P>Some people seemed to think that it was a one year extension, but it is a three year extension.  Senator Fitzsimons asked would this be long enough?  There are certain difficulties emerging in the purchase scheme on the vesting certificate side.  Some lending agencies have questioned the vesting certificate.  I will probably be back again at some stage with more extensive proposals amending the 1978 Act because there are some flaws emerging in that Act.  The extension period will allow the purchase scheme to continue and will provide adequate time for my Department to study the situation which is now emerging and to see if they can come up with appropriate amendments to the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked when the current one year scheme will run out.  That will be from 1 August.  Anybody who applies in the meantime will have it at the old fees, and I hope that there will be applications. The powers to vary the fee by the Minister on regulation is not a power solely to increase; it is a power to very. I know I would be greeted with horselaughs if I suggested the Minister might vary down as well as varying up the fees, but I would be prepared to do that if, for example, it emerged that over the next 12 months very few people were availing of the purchase scheme.  If the level of fee being charged seemed to be the inhibiting factor, then I would be prepared to vary the fee downward.  I would be anxious that the maximum possible number of people would avail of the purchase scheme, and would continue to avail of it, so that ground rents, and the annoyance of ground rents for those whom they annoy, would be removed as an irritant by purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Scheme could be left in operation indefinitely but it was originally intended that ground rents would be purchased over a limited period.  The idea of limiting it to five years was to provide an incentive for purchase. Open-ended schemes may not be availed of on a certain time scale.  Of all the ground rent applications for purchase Senators will notice that half of them came in in the first four years and then the other 50 per cent from 1 January 1983, when it was clear that the scheme would not last for long more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original idea of the five-year period proved to be an incentive.  Last year there was a flood of applications when it was indicated that the fees would go up on 1 August.  I assume that there will be extra applications now.  There is <Col N="884" /> a backlog because the Land Registry is affected by staff embargos and therefore the number of staff dealing with applications is limited.  At the moment there is a backlog of 16,000 applications.  Consequently, the fees we are charging if somebody applies now or before August when the new fees are in operation mean their applications would not be dealt with for two years, so in the last 12 months of the duration of this scheme people will be encouraged to purchase and we may have another flood of applications in about two years from now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's speech I have to disagree with this section, with the increases in costs and expenses.  The costs were increased threefold a year ago in the 1983 Act.  It seems extraordinary that a year later the fees are being increased again, almost doubled, and that there is an open-ended power given to the Minister.  If there was galloping inflation one might be inclined to listen to a case for a galloping increase in costs, but that is not the case.  Regularly, the Government have been taking credit for bringing down inflation.  Of course inflation is coming down and the Taoiseach promised or held out great hope that in the coming year inflation would be down to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances it seems extraordinary that fees that were increased last year should be increased again and that the Minister should be given the power to increase them further. Therefore, I cannot accept the terms of section 3.  Apart from looking at it purely from the point of view of compensating the State for services, there is the wider argument, which I mentioned on Second Stage, that I regard the ground rents campaign as a futile one and that those who are promoting it in a very vigorous way have put forward largely misguided arguments. Nevertheless, the campaign <Col N="885" /> exists.  The vast majority of ground rents were created in comparatively recent times and if they had not been created the probability is that the houses would be £100 dearer to compensate the owners of the land.  Ground rents were just another way to get value for the land. The people concerned would have paid the extra £100 or something more.  To that extent, ground rents are just a variation of the amounts the owners of ground get for their land.</P>
    <P>I will not go into these arguments now. I merely say that the campaign is in existence, whether misguided or not, that it is the source of a considerable amount of agitation, it is a problem that will continue to give trouble in one way or another and consequently every effort should be made to provide a means to deal with the problem as simply and cheaply as possible.  The Government in the circumstances, even though they can make a case for charging more to compensate for the service they provide, should lean over backwards to keep the cost of proceeding in this way as low as possible.  For those reasons I feel the section should be opposed and that the costs that existed one year ago, increased threefold then, should be quite sufficient for the next three years.  The Minister has said he will review this and introduce some reforms.  He said that if costs got out of hand he would have an opportunity to review them within the three years.  I think that the existing costs are quite sufficient and I will oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on something the Minister said on the Second Stage.  To assume that everyone who owns a house is quite well off is a sweeping assumption.  Even the Department of Social Welfare, not known for their generosity, realise that people who own houses are eligible for non-contributory old age pensions because owning a property, no matter what its value, may not mean that an income will be generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as I said on Second Stage, what for many of us might look a reasonable sum becomes quite an enormous <Col N="886" /> sum for others.  For instance, there are large numbers of old age pensioners who own their own houses.  There are people made redundent in middle age who lose the entirety of their incomes.  We only hear of the people who get extremely generous redundancy payments, but increasingly large numbers of people do not qualify for anything, yet people who own houses are to be grouped with those who can afford to pay for things like this. Although acknowledging that an old person who lives alone cannot afford to pay a television licence and we pay it for him and at the same time to assume that an old person living alone can either afford to go on paying ground rent or can afford to buy it out seems contradictory.  To go further and to increase the fees pushes the point even further.  It is easy to say that the taxpayer should not subsidise everybody but if we have to live with the provisions of this Bill we should live with it in a way which shows appreciation of the fact that, whatever about the history of ground rents, generally those who benefit from them are much better off than those who have to pay them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The increase in fees is not intended to compensate for inflation.  It is aimed at covering administrative costs so that the scheme will not be subsidised by the general taxpayer for the benefit of the people who will avail of it.  No new ground rents on dwelling houses have been created since 1978.</P>
      <P>Consequently, persons who come within the terms of this scheme could have availed of the scheme any time from 1978 onwards.  If they had availed of it in the first five years of the scheme there was a fee of £5 to cover the administrative costs.  It is not as if people had not been given an adequate opportunity to avail of the facility at a low fee or as if we are introducing a scheme for a new group of people.  It is the same group of people who could have availed of it in the first five years at £5, who could have availed of it last year for £15 and can avail of it now for £26, which is to cover general administrative costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on Second Stage about the fee for owners of local authority housing being increased to £20 from the nominal fee which applied heretofore. The Minister said that they were also becoming householders.  Usually people who acquire local authority houses by way of a vesting scheme or a purchase scheme do so over a long period of time, possibly on a 30-year loan initiated by the Department of the Environment. In an age of widespread unemployment, when people are trying to meet their repayments to local authorities for houses, this fee might be a further penalty on them if they want to redeem their ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he might confer on the Minister for the Environment under this section the power to include the fee for the transfer of the title in the actual cost of the <Col N="889" /> house and have it spread over the 30 years.  In that way a buyer would become the complete owner of the house and the land over an extended period of time. This would make it easier on them.  The Minister might consider this a fair measure, conceding that the purchasers of local authority houses, although in theory and practice they own their own property, are certainly not in the wealthy bracket and purchase their houses over an extended period.</P>

The Minister for the Environment will have the power to vary the fee.  The fee is still nominal, being only a £20 charge.  I do not see any difficulty.  I do not think there is any need for a statutory provision to govern the method of payment.  If local authorities, with the agreement of the Minister for the Environment, decide that they will take it by a series of very small instalments or by a series of rather larger instalments, I do not think that needs statutory power.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The object of this Bill, which I am proposing to refer to the Joint Committee on Legislation, is to consolidate with amendments the law relating to bankruptcy and to modernise it.  The substantive law is contained primarily in statutes passed in 1857, 1872 and 1889 and supplemented by the Rules of the Superior Courts.  In addition, provisions relating to bankruptcy matters are to be found in a variety of later statutes.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is based in the main on the recommendations in the 1972 report of the Bankruptcy Law Committee, extensive revision of the draft Bill appended to that report had to be undertaken. The main reasons for this were, first, the negotiations on the draft EEC Bankruptcy Convention, which we had to undertake on our accession to the EEC in 1973.  These negotiations had the effect of postponing at least for a time the introduction of new insolvency legislation. There were also the changes made in company law, in particular in the field of preferential payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first Bankruptcy Bill to be put before the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State and is necessarily a complex measure.  This is clear from the <Col N="891" /> explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the Bill's provisions in any detail at this stage.  I should like, however, to mention some of its features which Senators may consider of particular interest and importance.</P>
    <P>The conditions necessary to initiate bankruptcy proceedings have remained relatively unaltered since 1857.  For example, one condition is that the debtor shall have committed an act of bankruptcy, that is, one of a number of acts or defaults which are evidence of insolvency or of unwillingness to pay debts. These acts of bankruptcy have been reduced in number, and updated, in section 7.</P>
    <P>At present, bankruptcy proceedings can be commenced on the basis of a debt of £40.  This situation, which the committee rightly criticised, is being rectified, so that in future the debt owned must not be less than £500.</P>
    <P>The procedure entitling a bankrupt to show cause against the validity of the adjudication &mdash; a feature of Irish bankruptcy law since 1857 &mdash; is being retained in the Bill but its operation is being brought into line with actual practice. Over the last two decades a practice has evolved of making successive adjournments of these &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; applications, frequently for quite long periods, even when the validity of adjudications is not disputed.  These adjournments are granted by the court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction.  While they are sometimes warranted in so far as they allow the bankrupt time to enter into a composition with creditors, the fact that the adjudication is not advertised could prejudice persons who continue to give credit in ignorance of the bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Section 16 therefore provides that where the court grants an adjournment in a &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; application it will be under a specific duty to have regard to the interests of the bankrupt, his creditors and any person who might advance further credit, and section 17 gives the court power to dispense with advertisement of the adjudication on security <Col N="892" /> being given by the bankrupt or on such conditions as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The committee were particularly anxious to expedite proceedings and to streamline bankruptcy procedure.  Their recommendations in this regard are being implemented.  The number of statutory sittings of the court is being reduced from two to one not only in the case of bankruptcy proper, but also in compositions after bankruptcy and in arrangements under the control of the court.  Bankruptcy administration, hitherto divided between the examiner and the official assignee and to a lesser extent a creditors' assignee, if appointed, is being centralised in the hands of the official assignee. The functions of the examiner are being abolished, while the role of the creditors' assignee &mdash; at present minimal &mdash; is being further reduced.</P>
    <P>In addition, a major change is being made in the law relating to the assignment of the bankrupt's property on adjudication. Under section 44, where a person is adjudicated all property belonging to him will vest in the official assignee alone and not as hitherto in the official assignee and creditors' assignee jointly.</P>
    <P>The enhanced role of the official assignee is further illustrated in section 61, which lists his powers and functions in relation to the administration of bankruptcies. He will have complete freedom in this regard subject only to the overriding control of the court.</P>
    <P>Section 76 and the First Schedule provide an entirely new, simplified procedure for the proof and admission of debts under the supervision of the official assignee.  In future, the normal method by which creditors will prove their debts will be by sending the required evidence by post to the official assignee and by attending at his office where necessary.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that all preferential payments in bankruptcy should be abolished.  Under this system certain debts such as unpaid taxes, wages and social welfare contributions are paid in priority to the debts of ordinary creditors. A cardinal principle of bankruptcy law, namely, equal distribution among creditors, was thus being infringed.  The <Col N="893" /> committee could see no reason for allowing this to continue.</P>
    <P>While their view has undoubted merit, it is a counsel of perfection which is impossible to achieve in the present social and economic climate.  Preferences are a distinctive characteristic of modern bankruptcy legislation.  They are part and parcel of company law in this country and elsewhere.  If preferences were abolished in bankruptcy, their retention in company law could hardly be justified.</P>
    <P>In reality, taxes, wages, social welfare and other contributions account for a major part of the debts due when an individual becomes a bankrupt or a company goes into liquidation.  For these reasons, the present system of preferential payments is being retained, subject however to their being brought into line with those in the Companies Acts.  That is the effect of section 81.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to two further features of the Bill, which should make for more efficient administration. These are sections 82 and 85, which provide a simpler method of distributing a bankrupt's property and for early discharge or annulment of bankruptcies.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part V carries out the committee's recommendation that the estates of persons who die insolvent should be capable of being wound up in bankruptcy. Part VI, which replaces the antiquated provisions of the Debtors Act, 1872, contains a list of bankruptcy offences, some of which are new and all of which carry stiff penalties.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the Bill was a consolidating and modernising measure.  However, it re-enacts only those elements in the existing law which are relevant to present day requirements. Accordingly, the trustee clauses of the 1872 Act, which allow a bankrupt's property to be administered by a trustee and a committee of inspection rather than by assignees, are not being re-enacted. Nor is the Local Bankruptcy (Ireland) Act, 1888, which conferred bankruptcy jurisdiction on the Cork Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>When the Bill came before the Dáil on Second Stage there was general agreement that, because of its very complex <Col N="894" /> nature, it should be referred to a special committee.  Since then the Joint Committee on Legislation has been established and paragraph 1 (e) of its Orders of Reference empowers it &ldquo;to consider any Bill referred to it by either House with the concurrence of the other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last week the Dáil decided that the Bill should be referred to the Joint Committee and passed the appropriate resolution. I hope that this House will also agree that it is an appropriate Bill to refer to that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a Bill which should be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  On a number of occasions in this House we have received Bills far too late and proper discussion of them has not taken place. For this reason a number of Bills passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas have been found later not to be suitable or adequate for their purposes, as had been anticipated in the beginning.  The work of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be enhanced if this committee system is extended to all Bills.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, it is not before time that we are consolidating Acts of 1857, 1872 and 1889 because practices in the commercial field have changed enormously in those 120 odd years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally agree with the part of the Bill that takes away the rights of preferential creditors which have obtained to date.  I have never understood how a Government, in terms of their tax, should be treated more preferentially than a person who has given credit in the normal way. For example, why should unpaid taxes be any more preferential than moneys that are due for goods supplied or services rendered?  The Minister mentioned a cardinal principle of bankruptcy law, namely, equal distribution among creditors and which was being infringed to date.  The Bankruptcy Law Committee could see no reason for allowing this practice continue and I concur totally with that.  I have seen many companies throughout this country give credit to companies or individuals who subsequently became insolvent and found that they had no rights to collect what <Col N="895" /> was rightfully theirs because the State had been regarded as the preferential creditor.  If the State was equally as good at collecting their debts as are people in normal business there would be no need for them to have preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that taxes, wages, social welfare and other contributions account for a major part of the debts due when an individual becomes bankrupt or a company goes into liquidation.  That suggestion would not be borne out by what we see in the commercial world. Normally debts are owed on taxes, wages and social welfare contributions but, apart from those, there will be a number of other debts which may become due by virtue of services rendered or of materials supplied to an individual or company. For this reason I am glad that at long last there is a bit of commercial realism.  I sincerely hope that when the committee sit, they will abolish this preferential treatment which has been given to the Government because of their lack of enterprise or lack of interest in collecting the debts due to them by a company or individual.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill will be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation because it is a matter which needs more than just a run though both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I should like to support the motion that Seanad Éireann concurs with Dáil Éireann in its Resolution that it is expedient that the Bankruptcy Bill, 1982, be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation pursuant to paragraph 1 (e) of the committee's orders of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we deal in a general way with the provisions of the Bill and indicate the areas which we find acceptable in this legislation, a number of points should be made.  First of all, this is totally non-controversial and apolitical legislation and, in addition, is the most technical legislation which has come before the Seanad during the two periods that I have had the privilege of being a Member. Consideration of technical legislation such as this is quite inappropriate on the <Col N="896" /> floor of either House of the Oireachtas and I am sure that a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Legislation are the proper body to pursue the detailed points necessary in consideration of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proper that I refer to the Minister's speech where he seeks to explain the extraordinary delay in putting this legislation before the House.  The explanation which the Minister gives is tied up in some way with our accession to the EEC in 1973.  I have too much regard for the Minister's ability to think that he really expects us to believe that that is the reason.  It is inexplicable that this admittedly complicated legislation should have taken 12 years to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; ten years if one takes into account when it was introduced &mdash; from the time in which the report on which it is based was delivered to the then Minister.</P>
    <P>The report of the Bankruptcy Law Committee was delivered in 1972 and included in that report was a draft Bill. That draft Bill to a large extent contains most of the provisions contained in this legislation, although there are differences. It is totally unacceptable that a Department presented with draft legislation, with which obviously they did not disagree fundamentally, should take ten years before putting the Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The responsibility rested with the Ministers from time to time during that period and there were successive and different Ministers and administrations then.  I do not know whether the Ministers in examining how the delay took place would come to the conclusion that it was on the part of the political people in the Department or of somebody else, but it is inexplicable that it should take ten years to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  After all, it is non-controversial and just a few decisions in principle had to be made prior to the adoption of the legislation which is included in draft at the end of that excellent report.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the law in Ireland concerning bankruptcy is contained in a number of pieces of legislation, the Irish Bankrupt and Insolvent <Col N="897" /> Act, 1857, the Bankruptcy (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1872, the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1872, the Deeds of Arrangements Acts, 1887 and 1890 and the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy (Ireland) Act, 1889.  These form the core of the body of law which deals with bankruptcy. Reading the 1972 report to which I have already referred, it appears to me that the practice of the law of bankruptcy has developed beyond what is contained in the statutes.  In the exercise of the inherent equitable jurisdiction which the courts have in these matters various practices have arisen which change significantly the way in which the various Acts of Parliament which I have outlined are administered by the courts.  In that regard the updating of this legislation and the patching up, so to speak, of the practice in ordinary day-to-day commercial activities and the commercial way in which these things are now administered is to be welcomed, and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has identified, the core of this legislation is Part III which represents the central portion of the Bill and everything else revolves around Part III. Part III deals with the administration of property.  Any Member would be well advised in consideration of this legislation to have before him or her, in addition to the Bankruptcy Bill itself, the excellent explanatory memorandum produced by the Minister and circulated with the Bill. I will refer to the circulation of the Bill shortly.</P>
    <P>It is vital that each member of the Joint Committee on Legislation or at least each member of their relevant sub-committee would be supplied with a copy of the 1972 report.  I asked that a copy of the 1972 report would be made available by the office here, but unfortunately they were unable to do so.  Of course, I was able to get a copy from the Oireachtas Library, but that means that one's capacity to note and to make comments on the side is limited by this fact because obviously the Library copy must be preserved intact. However, it is important that the proper raw material for the examination of legislation would be made available.  In <Col N="898" /> addition, I would like the Minister to examine the practice which appears to exist when a Bill is circulated prior to the Oireachtas in which the matter is being discussed.  For example, this Bill was circulated in July 1982, in an interim when I was not a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas during the period 1981 and 1983 when I was a Member.  The Bankruptcy Bill was not circulated to the Members who came in in the interim period.  That is not the only Bill concerning which that has happened and it is by no means restricted to the Minister's portfolio.  It has happened in the Houses of the Oireachtas previously that Bills were not circulated to Members who came in in an intervening period.  That is not right, and quite a number of Members of this House have found themselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding Part III of the Bill, I would like to bring a number of points to the Minister's attention to indicate to him the reason for our support of the very significant reform which he has before the House.  The Minister himself is to be commended on grasping this nettle after such a long time.  By no means do I intend to examine the Bill section by section, but section 45 indicates the change of atmosphere and the updating which the committee propose and the Minister is continuing. At present a person who is bankrupt or going through the process of bankruptcy is entitled to retain certain household goods, tools of his trade and so on for the purpose of maintaining a certain standard of dignity and the capacity to earn money.  At the moment it is set at the now ridiculous sum of £20 &mdash; in other words, goods to the value of £20 can be retained by the individual for the purpose of clothing himself and earning a living if he is a tradesman.  The committee suggested an increase to £100 and the Minister is suggesting an increase to £1,000 in the Bill.  That is the kind of development we like to see continuing and it shows that whoever examined the legislation did so in a critical fashion not just automatically accepting what was coming from the committee, excellent as that was.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to section <Col N="899" /> 49 and the effects of the proposal to abolish the operation of any covenant on a lease where the lease would be forfeit in the event of a bankruptcy.  That is far-reaching law.  I do not really object to it as long as it is clearly understood &mdash; this is something the committee might consider in due course &mdash; that there remains on the official assignee or any person who is acting in respect of the lease which is being retained the obligation to pay rent and that in the event of the assignee not being in a position to pay rent for the State there would be no question of the lease continuing indefinitely pending the conclusion of the bankruptcy.  It would be very unfortunate if a property was held in abeyance for a period of time, until the bankruptcy was concluded.  As you will hear from what I have to say later, that could be a very lengthy time indeed.  While the proposal in section 49 conforms with the proposal in chapter 30 of the report of the Bankruptcy Law Committee, there are problems associated with its implementation which must be considered.</P>
    <P>Of very great significance also are the suggested rules with regard to the conclusion of a bankruptcy and the discharge of a bankrupt.  The proposal is that there should be a change in the system whereby the process of annulment and discharge, two ways of terminating the bankruptcy, should be changed.  That is a principle to which we should subscribe.  Basically, annulment seems to convey the idea that somebody is saying that the court in exercise of its jurisdiction decided that in all the circumstances this did not or should not have happened.  That seems to be extended in one regard, in that it is proposed in the Bill, and this is also proposed in the appropriate and corresponding section of the law committee report, that any person who is bankrupt for a period of approximately 20 years prior to the passage of the Bill should automatically have his bankruptcy annulled.  It was set at 1950 and because of the intervening ten years it is now suggested that it should be 1960, which is reasonable enough.</P>
    <P>What is being suggested is that any bankruptcy which had not been concluded <Col N="900" /> prior to 1960 and which had started prior to 1960 should be cancelled. That is a good idea and it should be done without there being an onus on any person to make an application to the court. The bankrupt would not be under an obligation to show cause to the courts as to why this should be done; it should just happen automatically.  In that way we are establishing a new principle, after 20 years, irrespective of fault or anything like that, the bankruptcy should be cancelled. That is something with which I agree but in the Bill it refers only to bankruptcies prior to 1960.  There is no suggestion that, as the years go by, 1960 should be progressively brought forward so that all bankruptcies starting 20 years before the date at which one would be considered in the future would in fact be annulled.  That is something the committee might consider.</P>
    <P>The discharge of a bankrupt is different from an annulment in that he is discharged because he paid his debts fully. The suggestion that the provision whereby a bankrupt is discharged by reason of the fact that he has paid a sum of 50p in the £ should be re-enacted and improved upon is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill &mdash; this is a continuing provision so it will go forward from year to year &mdash; that any bankrupt after a period of 12 years will be in a position to make an application to the court to have himself discharged from bankruptcy, but the onus will be on the bankrupt to make that application.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear what Senator Lanigan said about preferential payments because I have no doubt that he arrived at that conclusion having diligently examined the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Committee rather than the recommendations in the Bill because that is one very significant difference between the law committee's report and the Bill.  The law committee basically suggested, and their recommendation was simple in the extreme &mdash; it is in page 355 of the report &mdash; that preferential payments of all kinds should be abolished.  The Minister in his statement has correctly pointed out that the Bill seeks to continue the system of <Col N="901" /> preferential payments.  In that regard Senator Lanigan was a little in error in depending on the law committee's reports for his information rather than on the draft of the Bill.  The law committee had obviously a very sustainable argument. I see from the way the Minister has spoken in the introduction that he might at least be in some way sympathetic to what the committee have suggested.  This is an area of difference between the committee's recommendations and the Bill as drafted.  I mention section 80 in relation to which the legislation committee should give particular attention to what is the proper way to move forward.  There are, as the Minister quite rightly points out, certain longer-term consequences or certain collateral consequences of doing away with the system of preferential payments. It could be seen to be the thin end of the wedge to applying it to limited liability companies and various other things like that.  That would be a substantial advance in the law even in that area. We are really talking here about a difference in principle.  We are talking about a difference between those on the one hand who say preferential payments, which now means largely the State, should be maintained and those on the other hand who say they should be abolished.  That is something the committee should examine.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek the advice of his colleagues in Government in this regard because are as he said, this has implications far beyond the bankruptcy area. Obviously it has implications in the area of company law, but merely because it has these implications does not mean that we should not examine it when the time comes.  I should like the Minister to maintain an open mind in this regard because it is important that we should examine it constructively and logically in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which are also important.  There is a new system of arrangements about fraudulent and involuntary conveyances which we need not examine here but they will need further examination by the committee.  It <Col N="902" /> is important that it should be noted here that that examination is expected of the committee.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill which deals with the arrangements under the control of the court is another very important section. It deals with the actual happenings on the ground and what happens on the ground is that private arrangements under the control of the court are, in fact, very normal arrangements.  It is something which is continuing all the time and which I think we should examine before confirming the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the procedure entitling a bankrupt to show cause against the validity of adjudication is being retained.  He said that over the last two decades the practice has evolved of making successive adjournments of &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; applications, frequently for quite long periods even where the validity of adjudications is not disputed.  The committee's report is very long and I was not able to find some information in it.  It is possible that it is in the report and I just have not seen it.  There are 589 pages in it.  I should like those who will be advising the Minister at the committee to indicate to us the frequency with which this system is being used.</P>
    <P>I have never practised in this area as a lawyer and, therefore, I am no more skilled in this area than any private individual. It appears that bankrupts are people who are considered bankrupt in the eyes of the public.  In other words, they may be people who are the subject of these successive &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; applications. They appear to be in a state of limbo over a period of years.  Successive adjournments of the show cause applications last not in terms of months but in terms of years.  I should like to know how many people are in that state of limbo.  If it is a significant number of people, as I suspect it might be, then a more careful examination of the procedure might be required, the jurisdiction of the court in this regard might have to be tightened up and statute law might have to come into play.  More background information as to the number of people who are in this intermediary stage is vital.  What is also required is considerably more information <Col N="903" /> concerning the number of applications which are being made now.  Who is making the applications?  A lot of that background information would be very helpful to the committee when they consider the matter.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the question of the arrangements under the control of the courts, which are similar arrangements, but they are really private arrangements under the control of the courts.  They allow a trader to continue trading.  Paragraph 87 of the memorandum states:</P>
    <P>These arrangements allow a trader to continue trading, to maintain his place in the commercial world and to be helped by his friends.  Moreover, he is assisted by the Court and its officers and the minority creditors are protected by the Court's power to refuse to sanction a proposal.</P>
    <P>It would be important to know the number of people who are under the control of the court so that we could see if it is important in the scheme of bankruptcy and the application of bankruptcy law.</P>
    <P>I note that in Part V of the Bill the Minister proposes to deal in a different fashion with the estates of people who die insolvent.  That is very wise indeed. There are considerable changes in that area.  There is a degree of court supervision which requires excessive numbers of applications to court to be made which I do not think should be necessary.  It makes the administration of these estates quite difficult.  The possibility of entering into an arrangement with creditors in the event of a person dying insolvent should be considered and extended.  Part V of the Bill has to be examined against that background.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the question of offences and the amount of fines and terms of imprisonment.  They are all routine matters which can be considered during the course of the Committee Stage examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The way in which it differs from the proposals contained in the Bankruptcy Law Committee's report of 1972 must be highlighted.  I suggest, for the assistance of those people who <Col N="904" /> will be examining this in committee, that, in addition to the excellent memorandum which outlines in each and every case the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Committee's report where they have been adopted, a similar table should be produced which would show where the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Committee had not been adopted. That would be excellent.  I do not mean in terms of substituting £100 for £200 because I do not think that is a significant change.  I am talking about where a decision was taken not to accept a recommendation of the committee.  The recommendations of the committee are vast and they are in an order which is not necessarily the same as the order in the memorandum to the Bill.  The provision of a list which would show in a concise way the recommendations of the committee which were not adopted would be very helpful in regard to assisting the Committee on Legislation to balance the various interests which need to be balanced for a proper examination of a technical Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, and with these provisos, the general principle of the Bill should be welcomed by the House. Therefore, we should concur with Dáil Éireann in its decision to refer this Bill to the Joint Committee on Legislation for a proper Committee Stage examination while retaining the right to amend the Bill when it comes back to us on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We all support what is involved here.  By virtue of the fact that we have not implemented certain directives or enacted or amended the law in connection with company law, will this Bill curb in any way the activities of fly-by-night operators who, having become bankrupt, re-establish themselves in another guise?  Is there anything in this Bill which will, in the absence of changing company law, do anything to limit these activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the three Senators who contributed.  I am pleased that the House has co-operated with me in <Col N="905" /> referring this to the Committee on Legislation.  It is a very complex Bill which needs to be teased out.  It is a very important one.  Many Senators do not have a great knowledge of this area or a great interest in it, so it is an ideal Bill for a specialist committee where proceedings can move forward in a less formal manner than they would on Committee Stage in either the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan supported the Bill in general and talked about the idea of preferential payment.  As Senator O'Leary rightly pointed out, the Bankruptcy Law Committee report recommends against preferential payment but it was decided to maintain preferential payment in the provisions of the Bill.  In my introductory remarks I said that in reality taxes, wages, social welfare and other contributions account for a major part of the debts due when an individual becomes bankrupt or a company goes into liquidation.  For these reasons the present system of preferential payments is being retained, subject however to their being brought into line with those in the Companies Acts which is the effect of section 81. Obviously, people may have different views about this.  It is a matter of principle and something that can be dealt with at greater length in the Committee on Legislation.</P>
      <P>The crux of the matter is that bankruptcy law cannot differ in this respect from company law.  One of the main objects of the Bill is to align as far as possible these branches of the law and, in particular, these preferential payments. The preferential status granted to wages and salaries and revenue debts and social welfare contributions is a fact of modern life.  The draft EEC bankruptcy convention recognises it and its relevant provisions are framed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary brought up a number of points, first of all, the reason for the long delay and the explanation which I gave of it.  When we acceded to the EEC we were obliged to participate in negotiating a draft EEC bankruptcy convention. The draft Bill appended to the committee's report was not proceeded with at that time because of the possibility that <Col N="906" /> national bankruptcy laws would be affected by the negotiations on the draft EEC bankruptcy convenction.  As these negotiations progressed, it became clear that the Bankruptcy Bill could not be proceeded with.  The draft Bill appended to the committee's report was examined in detail, as Senator O'Leary acknowledged. A number of revisions had to be undertaken to keep it in line with changes in other areas, particularly company law.</P>
    <P>Again, this Bill by its nature needs a political push to get it through both Houses and on to the Statute Book.  Politicians respond to political pressure and there is very little political pressure to change the bankruptcy laws, even though the changes are very necessary.  The original committee began their deliberations in 1962.  They reported ten years later in 1972.  Then a Bill was published in 1982 and two years later we are now talking about going into Committee Stage on the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill as circulated here was published on 6 July 1982.  Again you can see the kind of delay that has taken place. First of all, proceeding from that point, I got Second Stage taken in the Dáil at the start of 1983 and we have been trying to arrange an appropriate forum for the consideration of Committee Stage.  Now it is agreed by the Dáil and we are in the process of agreeing in the Seanad that Committee Stage will be taken by the Legislation Committee.</P>
    <P>I would hope that I shall have the co-operation of the Deputies and Senators and am quite sure that I shall, in processing this very important legislation.  It is a large, enormously complex Bill as Deputies and Senators will realise.  I hope that the explanatory memorandum will be of help to everybody considering this legislation.</P>
    <P>Most of Senator O'Leary's contribution, at least a major proportion of it, dealt with the desirability of providing committee members with the maximum possible information for the consideration of this Bill.  Certainly, the explanatory memorandum is of benefit.  The Senator requested that we supply to the committee, or at least to a possible sub-committee deliberating on the matter, <Col N="907" /> copies of the sub-committee report on the Bankruptcy Law Committee's report. I shall consider if that is possible.  I am not sure whether there are physical problems about their availability of it or not, but certainly I shall check that out.  It seems to be a rather good idea.  I had not realised that there was any difficulty in acquiring copies of the Bill or copies of the explanatory memorandum.  The point the Senator made was that it was circulated in 1982 and the administrations changed subsequently and that there are new Members both in the Dáil and Seanad and by the circulation method used for this and indeed for other Bills, current Deputies and Senators were not on the original circulation list.  That is a point worth making and worth taking up, certainly.  The Senator referred to particular sections of the Bill.  I do not intend to talk about those sections here.  That can very well be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator O'Leary was looking for particular pieces of information &mdash; for example, the numbers involved in bankruptcy show cause applications.  I shall try to have that information available for the committee.  He also requested that, as well as the information supplied in the explanatory memorandum indicating what recommendations of the committee were accepted, similar information would be supplied for those recommendations of the committee which were rejected.  Again, I shall try to have that information available on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not intend dealing with the particular sections and, indeed, apart from Senator O'Leary, other Senators did not refer to them.  Senator Smith raised a point there at the end.  The Bill is dealing with individual insolvency and not corporate insolvencies.  It would not be appropriate to include in it matters which belong primarily to company law. The Bill includes a number of bankruptcy offences which are designed to deal with fraudulent debtors and bankrupts.  I hope that answers the point made by Senator Smith.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the House for its co-operation in this matter.  I hope that <Col N="908" /> we can proceed reasonably expeditiously to deal with Committee Stage.  The complexity of this particular legislation tends to intimidate even Ministers dealing with it.  I hope I have the co-operation of all Senators and Deputies in getting this through the Legislation Committee and back to both Houses on Report Stage as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited from £50,000,000 to £120,000,000 and to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of shares which the Minister for Finance may take up.  This will enable much of the debts owed by Irish Steel and guaranteed by the State to be converted into equity.  We are not putting in new money, really, but providing for the redemption of debts already owed.  That is a matter that is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> A lot of the controversy about the Irish Steel decision in recent times has been on the assumption that we were putting in new money.  The fact of the matter is that we are not putting in new money.  As to the vast majority of this money, it is simply going to redeem debts that are already owed by the taxpayer, guaranteed by the taxpayer, and have to be paid by the taxpayer anyway.  It is simply a question of whether it is better to close the thing down and pay them all off now, or keep it going and see if by keeping it going the profits that it might make, keeping going, would at least in some small way reduce at the end of the day the amount of overall debt that has to be met by the taxpayer.  I stress again that this money which is going in is going in to cover debts that are already owed and guaranteed.  I shall perhaps illustrate that in the remainder of my contribution here.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is, as I say, a wholly-owned State company with share capital of £50 million held by the Minister for Finance. It also received a grant of £25 million in 1981-82.  The company's accumulated losses at 30 June 1983 were of the order of £43 million and it is expected that the loss for the year to 30 June 1984 will be in the region of £21 million.  It has borrowings of £99 million.  All of these borrowings, as I say, are guaranteed by the State under guarantees extended over the years by various Ministers.</P>
    <P>These borrowings accumulated over the past six years as follows: 1979, £13.5 million; 1980, £28.6 million; 1981, £52.2 million; 1982, £62.1 million; 1983, £77.2 million and 1984, £99 million, which is now owing.  It will be seen, therefore, that the vast bulk of the money now due relates to debts incurred in 1982 or before that.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the level of borrowings and consequential interest is far too high and that a significant amount of it must be eliminated if the company is to have any chance of becoming viable.  Otherwise the drain of interest payments will simply be too much and will smother the company.  In converting some of the £99 million guaranteed debt into equity, we are not increasing the capital liability of <Col N="910" /> the taxpayer.  We are simply relieving the State-owned company of the need to meet the interest payments out of trading profits and transferring the liability for these interest payments to the Exchequer. If this equity were not provided, Irish Steel would close straight away. Then the entire debt would fall to be met by the State anyway.</P>
    <P>The decision the House is being asked to take in approving this Bill is whether Irish Steel should be closed without being given a last chance to prove itself.  That is the essential decision the House is being asked to take on this occasion: whether, if the company keeps going, it can make some profits which will contribute to eliminating the accumulated losses, or whether it will close straight away which will happen if we do not pass this Bill.  If it did, all the money would have to be paid anyway.  In assessing this question the Government availed of the advice of the consultancy firm SOFRESID of Paris.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that under the &ldquo;Aids Code&rdquo; no financial aid may be provided by a member state to a steel undertaking without the prior approval of the European Commission and aid for the continued operation of a steel undertaking may not be paid after 1984.  The aid proposed for Irish Steel is classified by the Commission as aid for continued operation.  Therefore, we must get their consent.  A notification of the maximum level of aid which the Government might provide to Irish Steel was sent to the Commission as far back as September 1982 to meet the deadline set by them for the receipt of such notifications.  The maximum aid envisaged in that notification was the guaranteeing of further borrowings of £25 million and the provision of share capital of £89 million.</P>
    <P>While it is expected that the loss for the year ending June 1984 will be £21 million, this will be made up of £12 million in interest on previous debt, £4.1 million in depreciation and £4.9 million in operating losses.  This equity injection will enable much of the debt on which the interest arises to be repaid, thereby eliminating most of the £12 million.  The depreciation of £4.1 million is relevant <Col N="911" /> only in so far as the eventual replacement of the mill at the end of its useful life is envisaged.  The operating results therefore are the most immediately relevant factor in deciding on the continuance, or otherwise, of the mill.  The projected losses on operation in 1983-84 of £4.9 million represent a significant improvement on past performance.  The operating losses in 1980-81 were £8.2 million, in 1981-82, £6.4 million and in 1982-83, £5.7 million.  We are down to a significantly lower figure of £4.9 million.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether this downward movement in operating losses would continue, and whether the company would get into a profit situation, has been the subject of deep study both at national and at EEC level.  Obviously, if the company was able to get into a permanently profitable situation, it would be able to make some contribution towards the redemption of the debts incurred in the past.  If it was closed straight away, all of the debts would fall due and no contribution would be made.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the consultants, SOFRESID, were jointly appointed by the Government and the Commission in July 1982 to carry out a major assessment of Irish Steel's viability prospects.  They concluded in September 1982 that the company's costs were not competitive.  Nevertheless, on the basis of certain assumptions in relation to prices, reductions in production costs, including a reduction in the cost of electricity, growth in sales and revenue and the provision of additional State funds of up to £89 million, the company could, in the consultants' opinion, be viable in the long term and should be allowed to continue in operation.  The consultants warned, nevertheless, that if it were decided to keep the company in operation and to provide the additional funds, there remained the risk of failure due to the extreme difficulty of breaking into the export markets.</P>
    <P>On 29 June 1983 the Commission gave its decision on the application of the Government for approval to invest up to £89 million in Irish Steel in 1984.  The main provision of the Commission decision was that the proposed aid was not <Col N="912" /> compatible with the orderly functioning of the Common Market and might not be paid to the company unless the Commission was satisfied, on the basis of information supplied to it by 31 January 1984, that the company could be financially viable by the end of 1985 without any further financial aid.</P>
    <P>The Commission decision of 29 June 1983 also stated that the aid necessary for the continued operation of Irish Steel up to 31 January 1984 could be paid as long as the company was not in breach of the rules of the European Coal and Steel Community, particularly those relating to quotas and pricing.  This is effectively interim aid.  The Commission subsequently approved the giving of Government guarantees in respect of an additional £14 million which was necessary for the continued operation of the company on an interim basis and recently approved the giving of Government guarantees of a further £3.5 million.  This was an interim decision.</P>
    <P>In September 1983 the Government again engaged the consultants to reassess Irish Steel's viability prospects in the light of the company's performance since their previous report in September 1982.  The consultants in their report of December 1983, the second report, commented very favourably on the results achieved by Irish Steel since their earlier report and indicated that the company had set up a distribution network, diversified its product range, kept to its rolling production programmes and placed its customer relationship on a sound basis. The consultants expressed the belief that, from a marketing point of view, Irish Steel had overcome the most difficult hurdle, namely, a significant breakthrough into the European market.</P>
    <P>Information to enable the Commission to decide whether in its opinion Irish Steel would be financially viable after the end of 1985 without further State aid, given a conversion as of that time of £89 million of debt to equity, was forwarded to the Commission in January 1984.  Arising from that information discussions took place with the appropriate Commissioners and with Commission officials.  Resulting from those discussions <Col N="913" /> the Government and the Commission decided in May 1984 jointly to reengage for the third time the consultants to undertake a further investigation in order to reconcile the varying views and to indicate whether Irish Steel could meet the Commission's requirements for financial viability after 1985.</P>
    <P>The indications in the consultants' third and most recent report are that Irish Steel can meet the Commission's requirements for financial viability after the end of 1985 provided the company is given a production quota upon which the report is based.  On the basis of that report the Commission took an interim decision on 27 June 1984 which allows £36 million to be provided to Irish Steel pending a decision on the quota question.  I will be dealing with the quota question later, the crucial outstanding factor in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the market in which Irish Steel must sell its products. The Company has made considerable strides in the past year but the situation in the overall market remains depressed. However, the Commission's forecast for 1984 does envisage a slight improvement in the market.  Community production of crude steel in recent months has shown an increase over corresponding months in 1983.  Overall the state of the Community steel industry is better in 1984 than it was in 1983 but recovery remains fragile.  If I may interrupt to say that steel consumption in the European market over the next four or five years which is crucial to Irish Steel depends very much on the general European recovery.  If that recovery does not occur the prospects for the steel market are very dim.  The predictions are that it is occurring and even though there may be a slight recession in the United States in the later end of 1985 and most of 1986, it is not expected that that will unduly affect the European recovery.  If that does not happen for one reason or another, if the European economic recovery is detailed, then the prospects not just for Irish Steel but for all steel producers must be very dim.</P>
    <P>Apart from the problems as far as the economic recovery is concerned, there have been a number of technical changes <Col N="914" /> in the steel consumption pattern which has affected all steel producers to their detriment.  That has been mainly the advances in technology which have enabled, for instance, motor cars to be constructed now with much less metal in them than in the past and much lighter bodies have been devised partly in response to the energy crisis.  This, of course, has had an effect on the demand for steel.  The effect on the steel market of the recession has been compounded by technical advances which have enabled users of all sorts of products involving steel to achieve their end results with a lower steel input.</P>
    <P>Because of the major over-capacity which has existed in the Community steel industry for some years, there has been a tendency for supply to exceed demand. This excess of supply over demand caused prices to drop below the break-even point of many producers and seriously eroded the financial viability of the European steel industry.  The Commission is trying to remove this excess capacity through the implementation of the &ldquo;Aids Code&rdquo; which provides that aid to a steel undertaking must be linked to a restructuring programme including where appropriate a reduction in capacity. Present indications are that capacity reductions are likely to go beyond the target set by the Commission and could be of the order of 30 million metric tonnes by 1986.  That is against a background in which we are increasing our capacity.</P>
    <P>Among other measures currently being operated by the Commission are a system of production and delivery quotas, minimum prices for certain steel products and more stringent measures to prevent infringement of the quota and price rules.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Commission has since 1980 operated a system of production and delivery quotas.  The present system is due to terminate at the end of 1985.  The main objective of the system is to control the supply of steel products coming on the market so as to prevent prices from collapsing and thereby allow the steel industry to restructure within a stable context.  The quotas for each company are based on its historical production, with some adjustment <Col N="915" /> for companies which have brought new capacity on stream.  Senators will appreciate that Irish Steel's historical production was extremely low.  For some of the base period upon which the quotas are calculated Irish Steel was not in production at all because the old mill was being replaced by the new one.  Hence a quota based on that base period puts us completely at a disadvantage, hence the crucial need for us to get effective renegotiation of the application of the quotas in our particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>To date the quota system has not created major problems for Irish Steel.  This is because so far, it has been operating well below its technical capacity because, relatively speaking, the mill is only recently commissioned.  From now on, however, it will need a higher capacity utilisation rate and a higher output than is possible under the present system.  At present the plant is only producing at a little over 40 per cent of its capacity but to be economic it must be producing very nearly 100 per cent.  If it does that it will obviously break through the quota barriers that are in existence at present. Unless those are lifted they cannot reach profitability.</P>
    <P>Indeed the basis on which SOFRESID has expressed confidence that Irish Steel can reach profitability is that it has so far been working well below capacity.  If it could operate at a more realistic level and sell its output at reasonable prices, it has excellent prospects of making operating profits.  However, unless Irish Steel is granted appropriate increased quota it will not be able to become viable and will have to close very quickly.  I raised this problem at the Steel Council meeting on 26 January 1984.  The Commission declared its readiness to submit a proposal to the Council for alleviating these problems.  This was on condition that the, restructuring programme had enabled it to acknowledge the viability of the undertaking after 1985.  While it is not certain that the Council of Ministers would agree to such a proposal, I would hope, in view of the relative insignificance of the capacity of Irish Steel's plant even at full production in Community terms the Council would agree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> Notwithstanding the quota system, the price of certain steel products deteriorated considerably in the second half of 1983.  The Commission, therefore, felt it necessary to strengthen the market organisation measures by introducing in addition to quotas minimum prices for these products with effect from 1 January 1984.  The Commission also introduced tougher measures to prevent infringement of the quota and price rules.  Under these measures each steel producer of the products covered by minimum prices is obliged to lodge with the Commission a security deposit, based on his quarterly quota for delivery on the Community market, which will be refunded the following quarter provided the producer has not been found to have infringed the quota or price rules.  If, however, the Commission finds that a producer has infringed the rules, it may require heavy fines to be deducted from the security deposit.</P>
    <P>A favourable decision by the Commission on the viability question, a suitable adjustment of quotas and the investment of £89 million by the State will not of themselves ensure the future of Irish Steel.  The company must continue to increase the volume of its sales, reduce production costs and obtain realistic prices for its products at a time when the international steel market is still very depressed.</P>
    <P>As far as production costs are concerned, I must state that one of the disadvantages facing Irish Steel is the high price it pays for its electricity supply compared with the prices prevailing in other member states.  The consultants stated that the ESB tariffs represented a disadvantage to Irish Steel of £15 per metric tonne of steel produced compared with a reference plant in France.  This was a feature of their 1982 and 1983 reports and they recommended in their first report that if this disadvantage could not be eliminated by a reduction in electricity tariffs or other cuts in costs, Irish Steel should be closed.  In their 1983 report they regarded the total cost disadvantage as having been reduced to £12 per tonne but the electricity component of that remained at £15 per tonne.  This is a feature <Col N="917" /> of the way that our tariffs are structured in this country and overall electricity costs.</P>
    <P>A comparison of domestic and industrial electricity tariffs, exclusive of tax, in Ireland with those in seven other member states of the Community indicates that the tariff structure in Ireland is substantially less favourable to industry than is the case in all of the other seven member states.  An indication of this advantage is that, at given levels of consumption Irish industry pays over 93 per cent of the domestic rate per kilowatt hour compared with an average of less than 72 per cent for the other seven.  The consultants concluded that electricity tariffs in Ireland, unlike those in the other countries, provided no incentive to industrial development.  Because of the importance of electricity charges to heavy industrial consumers, such as Irish Steel, the Government have decided that the Minister for Energy should bring before them within a month, an assessment on energy pricing policy.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to the House from what I have said that the difficulties facing Irish Steel are considerable.  The company must achieve an increasing level of sales at a time when the steel market continues to be depressed and when many producers in the Community are being compelled to reduce their production capacity under the European Commission's &ldquo;Aids Code&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has a modern, flexible plant which can adjust to changing patterns of demand and which, according to the consultants, is one of the most technically advanced plants in Europe.  As far as sales are concerned, the company has made considerable progress in the past year in that the volume of sales for the year to 30 June 1984 is expected to be some 40 per cent higher than that achieved in the year to 30 June 1983 which was more than double that achieved in the previous year.  While this performance is encouraging, much more remains to be accomplished in relation to costs, prices and sales if the company is to have a secure and viable future.  The difficulties facing Irish Steel are considerable <Col N="918" /> and a dramatic improvement in the steel market simply cannot be counted upon.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the company has State-guaranteed borrowings amounting to £99 million and this Bill allows for the redemption of debt.  It is our hope that after this conversion of debt into equity the company will become viable.  If it does it will be able to service and repay all the remaining Government-guaranteed loans and make a return to the State on its investment. There is, of course, the risk that the company might fail to make the necessary progress towards viability.  The additional risk to the Government between the cost of closing Irish Steel now and its closing at a later date if not viable is in the region of £5 million.  If I may respectfully suggest to the Seanad, that is the figure we are really talking about because the rest of the money provided in this Bill is money that is already owed.  This limit arises from the fact that if the trading position deteriorated to that extent the company would have to close because the Commission would not permit the State after the end of 1984 to assist the company any further by way of investment, grant or guarantee.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the additional risk capital represented in the decision, to introduce this Bill and allow Irish Steel a last chance, is £5 million in current money terms.  From the end of this year the company will have to finance its operations in a normal commercial manner without any recourse to the Government.</P>
    <P>I repeat that much remains to be done before the company's future is secure.  It is clear that Irish Steel's future depends on the whole-hearted co-operation and dedication of all those who work in the organisation and on the way in which the markets for its products develop.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I hope that, in spite of the many difficulties facing Irish Steel, the essential performance required to safeguard the future of the company will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recomment the Bill for its approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The performance of the semi-State sector is obviously a very critical factor in the management of our economy.  There have been a number of occasions in recent years when Bills have been introduced in this House and the other House to bail out a semi-State organisation in financial difficulty.  Perhaps because of the economic stringency in which we live, these Bills tend to provoke a fair amount of public comment and it is essential for all of us to examine, to analyse and to make sure that whenever the State is involved, the commercial ethos and the commercial criteria we apply to the economic life in private systems would apply to the greatest degree possible in the management of semi-State organisations.  That is why we support this Bill.</P>
      <P>I was a little disappointed with one or two of the Minister's statements.  He is obviously trying to counter some unfavourable publicity, and perhaps some misleading publicity in the context of this whole development.  He said that if this equity were not provided Irish Steel would close straight away and the entire debt would fall to be met by the State anyway.  One of the problems which has beset the semi-State sector over a very long time has been the notion that no matter what happened, at the end of the day the State would pick up the Bill.  This has done very little to persuade them of the need to modernise and to operate without State support, or with minimum support in order to survive in a recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister might want to counter some of that unfavourable publicity I think that in the introduction of Bills like this it would be far better if we had a more positive approach for the future.  Commentators have named certain <Col N="920" /> public State or semi-State organisations as lame ducks, legless ducks and even dead ducks.  I believe that we have to have a fairly substantial State involvement in Irish Steel and in a number of other areas.  Cork has a particularly bad unemployment problem: I understand the figure is in the region of 22.5 per cent. There have been a number of closures in that area.  Before any further closures take place, it behoves us to use all the means available to us to ensure that there would be no further redundancies. Although Irish Steel have been able to make significant progress in recent times, the Minister outlined the sliding scale of losses in the year-to-year management of the factory and these losses have been dropping at the rate of around 50 per cent per annum.  This augurs fairly well for the future if we can ease the interest payments which flowed from the massive development in the new mills and furnaces: a totally new plant has evolved there in recent times.  Because of overheads and interest payments the viability of the whole enterprise has been badly shaken and it will be necessary to remove those obstacles for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate what share of our quota we are filling.  I understand that production this year is 136,000 tonnes and it is estimated that that will grow to 200,000 tonnes next year and in the following year to about 250,000.  The task force on Irish Steel indicated that the annual production for viability would have to be in the region of 300,000 tonnes.  What kind of quota would be needed to meet that production level?  The question of price has to come into it; meeting the production target is only half the problem.  If the price for the product is not an economic one, then obviously the matter will have to be looked at again in the light of that situation.</P>
    <P>Very often decisions taken by one Minister do not seem to relate to those taken by another, but in the context of Irish Steel, I wonder how wise it was to scale down farm development, farm buildings and grants &mdash; particularly when a significant proportion of the funds are already coming from the EEC &mdash; because such <Col N="921" /> development must make up a significant part of the sales of Irish Steel.  It would seem inappropriate to be creating further difficulties at a time when we out-winter almost 50 per cent of our animals, which is far from what the position should be if we were developing property on those lines.</P>
    <P>I was interested also to hear the Minister say that some new policy will be developed in relation to ESB costs for Irish Steel.  This point has been made for a number of years and electricity prices seem to place Irish Steel at a distinct disadvantage with their competitors.  In the Minister's statement he indicated that it probably could be of the order of 15 per cent.  In the climate in which Irish Steel are operating, in this recession and the difficulties they are trying to overcome, these electricity charges appear to be an additional burden and some way will have to be found to deal with them. It is probably impossible to deal with that problem in isolation.  There are other industries that have high energy requirements, and perhaps it is an area on which more discussion could take place to try to come forward with a scheme which would reduce energy costs.</P>
    <P>It is important to relate those policies to the maximum job content possible. Some of our grants and some of the concessions provided by the Government from time to time in a country with a growing population and with such an employment problem.  We should try to gear those policies towards labour-intensive industries and place them at some advantage against companies where there are huge capital investments, but very little real employment opportunities flowing from them.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill.  With the developments that have taken place in recent years we hope Irish Steel will be able to become viable.  I hope this will be one of the last Bills to come before this House where such a huge sum of money has to be found to ensure that a semi-State organisation becomes viable.  The time has come for every organisation in the country to apply the strictest possible systems for the future and to realise that the <Col N="922" /> taxpayer and the country as a whole cannot continue to support companies which are not in a position to find resources, year in year out, from their own operations in order to maintain viability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which indicates a vote of confidence in Irish Steel.  It is only right that we should recognise the plant for what it is.  To say that £89 million or £90 million has been put into it so far would not be the truth. That amount is owed, dead money, and we should not be giving the impression that Irish Steel need £90 million now. Irish Steel need money to keep going up to the end of 1984 and that is what the Bill is providing.  Many serious questions have to be asked about the cost of producing steel here and in other countries.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Senator Smith questioned the cost of energy to Irish Steel.  Energy charges by the ESB are seriously affecting many heavy industries throughout the country.  They are high by comparison with other countries.  Indeed, we are paying 30 per cent higher for energy than other countries who produce steel.  Therefore, I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Department of Energy have asked for a report within a month.</P>
      <P>Serious questions should be asked of the ESB because they now have overproduction of power which is not being used.  In such circumstances should the ESB not be prepared to give energy to such enterprises as Irish Steel at lower prices?  I read in a report recently that ESB charges are all related to world oil prices.  They get quite a proportion of their fuel from Bord na Móna but Bord na Móna these days are charging oil-related prices for their solid fuel.  There is no reason why milled peat and turf should not be priced at the same levels as other solid fuels &mdash; for instance, coal.  If the ESB were able to get their fuel at solid fuel prices from Bord na Móna they could save at least £20 million which could be shared out among heavy industries which would mean that such industries would be competitive.  I hope this will be considered by the Department of Energy when compiling their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> These things have a considerable effect on Irish Steel whose management and workers jointly have said that all things being equal they can produce an excellent product by comparison with their EEC competitors.  They were losing large sums of money but they have diversified and consultants have said that their product is excellent by comparison with other such mills throughout Europe.  If they are given a fair chance they will become profitable.  It would be impossible to ask Irish Steel to pay £50,000 weekly in interest charges and hope they would make a profit.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister devote so much of his speech to the EEC steel quotas.  Our population is only 1.82 per cent of the EEC's total population of 270 million, yet our total quota of steel production is only 0.2 per cent.  I know the Minister is capable of arguing at EEC level that this quota should be improved. If we could get it improved by 100 per cent to 0.4 per cent it would mean an enormous benefit to Irish Steel who could possibly employ more people.  We have heard the argument that the Government have been putting money into white elephants. The IFA said that Irish Steel is a white elephant and that we should not be pumping money into it.  I would appreciate it if those people got their priorities right and got their own house in order. Take the amount of money spent on brucellosis. Since 1964 this scheme has cost £80 million and the situation has not been improved in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate if their leaders would stick to their jobs.  Production in Irish Steel has improved enormously. I was appalled to read a statement in the Dáil last week that there have been complaints of absenteeism in Irish Steel, that it had increased by 7 or 8 per cent.  I understand that the work force there are quite happy.  The marketing team in Irish Steel have improved enormously and if they get half a chance in the European market they can regain profitability by the end of 1985.</P>
      <P>In the region of £100 million has been spent by the Government in the area where Irish Steel is located in recent years to try to improve the position.  That investment was in such projects as new water schemes, the provision of a supply of natural gas and, as a result of the report of the task force, a deep-water berth.  Those projects represent a big improvement in the area and I hope that, if there is an upturn in the sale of steel in coming years, transport costs to Irish Steel will be cheaper because it will be possible to ship heavier loads to the new deep-water berth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in the Cork area last year many old industries closed down.  While the Government recognise the need for investment in Irish Steel to the tune of £90 million, it is unfortunate that in another part of the city other people are prepared to spend £25 million in the elimination of jobs.  I do not think we can boast about the fact that other industries are prepared to eliminate jobs at any price.  I accept that the Government in the case of Dunlops last year and Fords this year made every effort to keep the respective plants open, but should we not be asking serious questions as to why such plants are closing down?  Should we not be asking why international comparelate <Col N="925" /> nies are prepared to spend so much money on the elimination of 800 jobs? We should consider what would happen if £25 million was invested in those plants. Are we saying that our costs compared with other countries are not right?  Is this an indication that our energy charges are not right?  I am glad that the Government recognise the urgent need to put our house in order and to ask such concerns to put their houses in order.  Irish Steel are prepared to make the effort to put their house in order and I hope they succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think the EEC Commission have any right to say that they will only allow the present position to prevail until the end of 1984 by which time the company must have their house in order.  In imposing that condition the Commission admit that the quota of steel they are allowing into the EEC from us is a drop in the ocean in comparison with the amount allowed in from other countries. If the quota is increased a guarantee can be given by the company that they will get their house in order.  The EEC does not have any right to say that money should not be given to Irish Steel and at the same time tell the company they are not permitted to increase their sales in the Community.  The Cork plant, when compared to other plants in Europe is very good.  I appreciate that some of the plants in other countries have been in existence since the early forties.  It is only right that the Commission should recognise the problem of the Irish concern and increase the quota.  Our new MEPs, and others, should be made aware of this.  We are not asking very much when we seek an increase in the quota of 0.2 per cent. We are only allowed 10 per cent of what we should be when one compares our population with the population of other member states.  We should press that case in Europe and I am certain Irish Steel will answer for themselves.</P>

      <P>In my brief contribution I want to support the Bill and compliment Minister Bruton on the success of his negotiations in regard to this difficult matter in recent months.  I should <Col N="926" /> like to compliment his officials also for turning what appeared to be a hopeless case some weeks ago right around.  I hope management and workers in Irish Steel will respond in such a fashion as to ensure the future viability of the concern.  The Bill represents a great act of faith in the management and workers of Irish Steel. I am convinced that the time has come when all concerned in this industry and in other loss-making semi-State concerns must realise that a trojan effort is required to ensure the continuation of such important industries.</P>
      <P>After almost 30 years of fairly successful operations the IDA should take greater chances in their efforts to attract new types of industry.  We do not have a great spread of heavy industry.  When I was President of the Regional Fund Commission in Europe I travelled extensively in the steel belt of France and Germany and I am aware, following those visits, that it is difficult for us to compete with the giant steel mills that exist on the Continent.  Nevertheless, we are entitled to have some heavy industries here.  I hope there is a good response to this act of faith in the industry by the Minister. When one considers the plight of our taxpayers we cannot say that we will be of the same frame of mind in a few years' time if the Minister comes to us with a similar request.  He will need to show that the people concerned responded well to this opportunity.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I wrote to the Minister on behalf of a farmer in County Offaly who erected a shed in 1978.  I visited that farm some weeks ago and noticed that 11 sheets of galvanised iron were covered with holes.  While Irish Steel accepted that the galvanised iron was their product and that it was faulty, they refused to pay compensation because the farmer did not buy the material directly from them.  I have not heard of a farmer who can go to a mill and purchase steel.  Perhaps it happens in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> On my farm we have a shed erected by Powers of Kilkenny in 1910 which is still serviceable.  In my case the shed has lasted about 70 years but in the case of the Offaly farmer after a few years the shed is falling apart.  We should be talking about something that lasts for 70, 80 or 100 years, but here is a clear case where a structure is absolutely falling apart. One can see the daylight through it, yet this firm are getting £120 million.  If they cannot stand over their products then we are throwing good money after bad.  I have not had a very satisfactory reply to the representations I have made to date, but I suppose it will come.</P>
    <P>Before the House would approve this kind of money for any company, that company would want to believe in what they produce.  I ask for a guarantee that they are prepared to stand over their products.  If Irish Steel Holdings cannot stand over their products, then it is unfair to ask the taxpayer to put that kind of support behind them.  However, I have never heard of another such case.  It is the only time I have ever heard of galvanised iron being faulty or substandard, and for that reason I was absolutely shocked that a respected company like Irish Steel Holdings should not stand over their own products.  I would ask the Minister to take up the case and give the House an assurance that the policy of the company cannot be so bad that they do not recognise or stand over their own products.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable in some ways that when the Government make a very positive commitment to an industry Senator McDonald should shoot the whole thing down in flames because of a defective shed somewhere.  It is probably not the best way to begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Senators I welcome the Bill and the Government's commitment to Irish Steel.  In the recent case of Irish Dunlop the decision to close was taken outside the State.  We did not have the full picture.  We were not aware that Dunlop intended to sell their European tyre making operations and any amount of money the Government were prepared <Col N="928" /> to offer and any flexibility that the trade union movement was prepared to offer were, as we know, of no avail.  The Ford plant in Cork is due to close this month. The Minister will be well aware of this because he had to travel to Detroit to discuss with the Ford Motor Company any possibility of saving that plant in any form, however reduced.  To date that attempt has proved unsuccessful, through no fault of the Government. Again that decision was made in Detroit. It is gratifying at the very least that the decision on Irish Steel can be made by natives rather than taken by foreigners who have no regard for either the economy or for the people of this country. Dunlop and Fords demonstrated that.  It was not a question of assisting them or any flexibility; it was simply a case that they wanted out and they got out.</P>
    <P>One of the things which must give hope to the Minister and the Government is the very positive attitude of the work-force in Irish Steel, the extremely positive attitude of the transport union and the engineering unions involved in Irish Steel.  The Minister referred in his speech to the re-equipment.  Very serious disruption was caused to the production runs and to the staffing levels.  Quite a number of people were laid off for a period of time by Irish Steel during this re-equipment programme before the new mill came on stream and was commissioned. During that time, if my memory serves me correctly, there was little, if any, industrial action.  The unions accepted the fact that this mill had to be re-equipped and that the obvious consequence would be that people would be dislocated for a substantial period of time.  All that was accepted.  We now have an extremely modern plant which is capable of meeting what will hopefully be the improved quota which I am sure the Government and the Minister will extract from the Commission in the next few months.</P>
    <P>It would be less than generous not to say that the Minister deserves our congratulations on his negotiations with the Commission.  A lot of us felt he was on a dicey docket and we hoped for the best <Col N="929" /> possible response.  We were also aware that there was a third party assessing in a very objective and professional way the capacity of Irish Steel to remain in business, and we were hoping that they would come down on the side of Irish Steel. Obviously they did.  The success so far leads me to believe that the quota problem will be overcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred to an amount of steel which the company would be allowed to produce without having a significant effect on overall European steel production.  It would have been most unfair and beyond understanding if the Commission had stuck on a quota based on a very old outmoded plant and simply said that the quota would be based on the historical production.  That would be totally unreal.  It would be rather idiotic to say: &ldquo;here is the money to re-equip, go away and do the job and when you get everything in position we will not allow you produce it&rdquo;.  That would be totally illogical and would not be acceptable. The fact that moneys and commitments have been forthcoming leads me to believe that we will be successful in getting an improved quota.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things which disturb me in the Minister's speech, and perhaps he might address himself to these when replying.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Therefore, the additional risk capital represented in the decision to introduce this Bill and allow Irish Steel a last chance is £5 million in current money terms.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what Senator Cregan said.  This is not an injection of new cash. This is a financial restructuring job with an extra £5 million being put on the table. From the end of this year the company will have to finance its operations in a normal commercial manner without any recourse to the Government.  Is this a Government decision?  Has the decision been made in effect that Irish Steel cannot have any recourse to the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are EEC rules. All Governments in the Community are <Col N="930" /> bound by these rules and, indeed, in the long term they are in our interest too, because we have less capacity to go on propping up our steel industry than other competitive countries have.  It is not a Government decision, it is a Community decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that if the operating losses came down to £0.5 million or £1 million and if they have no recourse, that they actually close up the shop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They may get a line of credit if their prospects are good.  If their prospects are bad they will not get a line of credit.  It will be the same as any other firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>We would want to be careful.  I am just taking what the Minister said in his speech and it seems that if they had an operating loss of £0.5 million, he would simply shut up shop and throw 700 people out of work, plus all of the spinoff and downstream jobs.  We are talking about maybe 1,500 jobs for an operating loss of £0.5 million.  I do not know what the State would be caught for in redundancy payments, probably many millions of pounds.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether we are saying that irrespective of the size of the operating loss, even if it is extremely small, they would have no recourse at all to Government, no Government assistance of any sort.  I want to know if that is what is being said.</P>
      <P>Energy costs with which the Minister dealt quite extensively in his remarks, are a significant factor.  I do not think anyone would deny that.  I understand there is an inquiry in progress at present into the cost of energy, electricity in particular, and that report has yet to be produced. I am sure, when it is produced, it might solve a few mysteries for us all as to why the costs of electricity are so high in this country and so uncompetitive when compared with those of our neighbours in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it is not possible to isolate Irish Steel and say &ldquo;We will give them electricity, or energy, at a cheaper rate <Col N="931" /> and ignore all our other industries&rdquo;. Obviously Irish Steel would be a very heavy user of electricity.  But then so would Tara Mines.  Are we suggesting that we should give subsidised electricity to Tara Mines?  Is it being said that the cost to the domestic consumer is too low? I do not believe that any consumer would believe that, their bills show otherwise. I do not think the domestic consumer at present could bear increased charges in terms of extra payments on electricity. Most people's perception of the present situation is that they pay for too much already.  If the proposition is being put that, in some way, the balance should be redressed in favour of industry by upping it on the domestic consumer level that would not be morally acceptable or politically viable.  I do not think that is on.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one must await the results of the inquiry into the cost of energy. Also the Minister indicates that there is a paper coming before Government in relation to energy pricing, pricing structures for energy and industry and so on. We will also have to await that paper. But I would say that it is an act of faith by the Government which I think is well placed.  I have a lot of contacts in Irish Steel, amongst the unions in particular. I cannot speak for the management because I do not know any management people down there.  I would hope that they are competent; they appear to be committed.  Much depends on management in this whole area because management and not the workers control the marketing expertise side of the operation. A worker can increase his production, be as flexible as Molly Bawn &mdash; as they used to say &mdash; but it would mean nothing if the skills and the expertise on the marketing side are not up to standard. I sincerely hope, and I think the Minister has grounds for believing, that they have got that marketing side of it right.  Many of the problems we encounter in Irish industry are marketing problems.  We can make good products but we cannot sell them because we do not know how to present them.  We are very bad at the selling business.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the work force I believe they have a very positive attitude <Col N="932" /> to their industry.  They want it to survive.  Unfortunately that is not common in all industries.  But, in the case of Irish Steel, there is a very positive commitment by the work force.  They want this plant to survive; they want their industry to survive.  They are not anxious &mdash; which is not a sign of the times but a very hopeful indication for the future &mdash; simply to take whatever redundancy money is available and leave.  They have this tremendous commitment, not alone in staying in their jobs but in protecting those jobs for future generations.</P>
    <P>All that being said, I hope the Minister will indicate to me, in terms of closing the door or the last chance, what are we talking about?  For example, are we talking about an operating loss of £500,000 and that thereafter there will be no doors open?  I should like him to reply to that. I congratulate him, his Department and the Government on their act of faith.  It is particularly welcomed in Cork.  We always think we are special and we know we are not.  The Minister has been in Cork recently as part of the Government task force and he will have first-hand knowledge of the very serious unemployment situation obtaining there.  Therefore, in many ways, this act of faith by the Government will be welcomed by the people of Cork, by the workers of Irish Steel and by the trade unions involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a blow-in to Cork I probably have a particular obligation to welcome a Bill like this, lest I be accused of forgetting where I got the first and only job, apart from politics, I have ever had. Obviously this decision by the Government is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quoted as saying, in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that the Government on their own cannot create a single job, an argument I might take up on another occasion.  I do not necessarily accept that that is true.  There is a certain ideology behind that statement which is almost as rigid in some ways as the ideology that those of us on the left are often accused of displaying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel have to be looked at in slightly more than purely commercial terms.  Unlike many people on the left in <Col N="933" /> Irish politics who have a rather soft conception of how one runs semi-State companies, often there is quite a substantial level of political opportunism in the response in attitude to semi-State companies, particularly in the commercial sector &mdash; which is that if you are in Opposition every time there is an indication that a semi-State corporation is not going to be commercial you find some other noble reason for sustaining it.  Funnily enough I do not subscribe to the view that semi-State corporations are somehow sacrosanct, that on every occasion they need to be preserved and sustained because of their unique position.  What I do believe is that they must have the same scope for enterprise and initiative of their counterparts in the private sector.</P>
    <P>In the NESC Report on Enterprise in the Public Sector, published some years ago, if I recall correctly, some members of the council were somewhat at pains to distance themselves from some of the conclusions.  Though they published their report some members indicated that they did not necessarily subscribe to everything in it.  The general perception of the report was that many people in commercial areas in the public sector felt inhibited about being involved in enterprise by what they regarded as unnatural restrictions and a heavy bureaucratic hand on top of them.  I am not for one second suggesting that that was the problem in Irish Steel.  Incidentally, I am very glad to notice that, for once at least, the work force have not been blamed for the inadequacies of one of our corporations.  It has become almost a <i>sine qua non</i> of criticism of inadequate operation of companies, both in the private and public sectors in this country, to attribute an extraordinary amount of the blame to some inadequacy on the part of the work force.  It is quite extraordinary that half our work force in the export area can be virtually more productive than anybody else in the world.  The other half, apparently, are the most inefficient in the world, if we are to believe the things that are said about them.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel must have a particular strategic value in this country which cannot <Col N="934" /> be quantified by whatever sophisticated accounting methods are employed.  The significance of Irish Steel as part of an industrial infrastructure needs always to be considered when decisions about its future and its viability are being taken.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the Minister's remarks.  I apologise to him that I could not be here when he spoke.  There was nothing in the consultants' report, which he read into the record here to which one could take too much exception.  I am afraid I am too much of an engineer to ignore the realities of costs, efficiency and so on.  In spite of my ideological convictions, I am, funnily enough, quite pragmatic about the way enterprise operates.</P>
    <P>I hope that the identification yet again of electricity costs as a major factor in Irish Steel's problems is not going to result in a confused attack on a moderately to extremely successful semi-State company, the Electricity Supply Board, whose efficiency and expertise in many areas are recognised internationally and who are blamed for the problems they have which are often the direct consequence of unjustified political interference in their operations in the past.  There are people in the ESB who still tell you that whenever there is an election or a by-election they wonder if there will be a decision announced about building a power station.  People I know in the ESB have profound reservations about this manner of announcing decisions about new power stations.  I am not saying that this is being done in the time of the present Minister.  Whatever else I would accuse him of, I would not accuse him of taking such decisions about major State investments on the basis of political expediency.  He does not operate in that way, and for that I give him credit.</P>
    <P>However, there is no doubt that in the past the ESB have been asked, for instance, to take a mixture of social and commercial decisions without any attempt to separate or even quantify the two contributions.  Then the finger was pointed at them as an organisation and it was said that they and they alone were responsible for the high cost of energy and electricity.  That is very unfair to <Col N="935" /> them.  If there is a problem about the electricity charges to Irish Steel, then the source of the problem should be identified in broader terms than simply blaming the alleged inefficiencies of the ESB.  The ESB, unlike some semi-State companies, do not need me to defend them.  They are better than most at defending themselves, and that is to their credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish that other semi-State companies had the same gumption and compunction to defend themselves vigorously in public.  Mr. Moriarty is as fine a defender of the public sector as I know and I wish other semi-State companies had as good a capacity to defend themselves.</P>
      <P>I hope that the decision about Irish Steel Limited will be followed by a series of other decisions to recognise the level of disaster that has befallen my adopted city in recent times.  Only recently while walking through Patrick Street I realised the number of premises and the number of units in new shopping centres that have closed and remained closed.  Domestic consumption and retail sales are probably the best indicator of the level of disposable income that people have.  The change in that environment in Cork in the last 12 months is probably the best indicator of how bad things have become. Unfortunately, matters have not reached their lowest point yet.  People are still to some extent living on the accumulated redundancy money etc. and I fear for the position in 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another indicator of the state of Cork's finances is that anybody involved in any voluntary or charitable work in Cork will tell you how their income has dried up in the last six to 12 months. People simply have not got any more money.  It is a unusual position for Cork, because we rode out the last major recession in reasonably comfortable style. Therefore, on this occasion decisions about how major infrastructural investments will be made and about the future of not just Irish Steel Limited but NET also must be taken in the light of existing circumstances and the role that such <Col N="936" /> corporations play, not simply assessing them on their own commercial criteria although that should be done.  No semi-State corporation should be absolved from meeting normal commercial criteria at least in terms of assessing their performance. To disgrace myself on the left, let me say that there are few better measures of efficiency in a commercial concern than their capacity to create wealth in their operation.  That is not to say that that should be the sole criterion on which the future of any major State corporation should be decided, but it is a useful measure of their ability to do their job properly, particularly in areas such as steel making and chemicals where adequate international comparisons are available.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that Irish Steel Limited are being given the opportunity to prove that they can do what they have claimed they can do.  I hope that the conditions they have to meet will be assessed continuously in the light of the circumstances as they exist and not by some single bottom-line calculation.  They are a unique company with unique opportunities and unique difficulties, and it will be very difficult to make an objective comparison based on any established criteria. Their role in Irish society and in the region in which they operate and their strategic value to this country will all need to be assessed.  In the short term I think that the decision was wise and prudent and, speaking as somebody living in Cork, I am very glad of that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome the Minister's proposals.  His speech outlines exactly the situation in Irish Steel.  We must look at the figures.  Irish Steel's borrowings from 1979 to 1984 were £99 million and their losses from 1981 to 1983-84 were £25.2 million.  Their loss in this year 1983-84 was £4.9 million and there is no reason to believe that their loss in 1984-85 will not be in that region also. The case that the Minister had put up is that this company are to get £5 million now, that is the end of their financial problem and they have become a viable company.  The Minister has already stated that under EEC policy the <Col N="937" /> Government are not allowed after this to finance the company.  If that is so, then we will have a serious problem in Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I would like to develop further the situation of the debts of Irish Steel, their liabilities to the bank, VAT and PAYE. If this company are to get an injection of £5 million now, they will be commercially viable and they can operate next year very well.  The Minister stated that the company made considerable strides in the past year or so but that the situation in the overall market remains depressed. If the market dictates what is to happen, then we are talking about a force outside the company.  We are talking about the market.  He talked about the overall state of the EEC steel industry and said that it was better in 1984 than in 1983 but that recovery remains fragile.  That means that the future will be difficult indeed.  I agree with him that technology has had a major effect in this industry, that we are moving away from steel for various machinery, parts etc. into other products and that is having a major effect on steel. Perhaps the quotas are to blame.  If you get your quota and are at production capacity of 40 per cent and push that up to 100 per cent, can you sell your products? Is the market there?  If the market is depressed, how can it be available to you?  Irish Steel are an extremely good company as far as their production facilities, production runs and marketing are concerned.  Senator Magner has referred to their realist work force operating in an extremely modern plant producing at 40 per cent.  If that production goes up to 100 per cent can the market accept that 100 per cent irrespective of the quotas?</P>
      <P>The other matter to be looked at in the company is the reduction of production costs but can they reduce their production costs if in effect they are operating a highly modern and efficient plant?  If the cost to the company of electricity is reduced, is it reduced at the expense of the consumer or is it a direct grant into the company to reduce the cost of electricity?</P>

      <P>There seems to be a feeling in semi-State bodies that there is a well that can be tapped and retapped and that accountability in the end is a matter for the taxpayer.  We in the semi-State bodies committee have considered particular semi-State companies.  One of these, CIE hotels, had losses of up to £10 million.  We met their managing director. As Senator Ryan says, Mr. Moriarty of the ESB is able to talk for himself but I heard another gentleman, Mr. St. John Devlin, say he had dealt with seven Ministers in the past five years and that there was a total disregard for Government, with the impression being given that money for leasing would not have to go through the Dáil but that one would have to go through the channels of Government in order to get money for capital.  If only half of what the gentleman says is true we will have a major problem when dealing with Udarás na Gaeltachta in respect of GT Carpets.  If what the Minister says is right &mdash; and this is the major question for this company &mdash; if £5 million puts the company into a viable position, if they have an extremely modern plant and very good industrial relations and if they can increase capacity and get the correct price on the market, they will prove viable.  However, if we are to take past evidence of borrowings of £99 million and consistent losses from 1980 to 1984 of £25 million, this company are in <Col N="939" /> serious trouble.  They cannot come to us seeking more money.  They will be on their own.  If, as the evidence seems to indicate, there are major problems in the market the company have a problem. What I would like to ask is if the £5 million goes and the company cannot survive, what is the cost of actually closing the company?  Is there any question of the company going?  The Minister seemed to be about to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic question is if this company are to become viable as a result of this injection of money.  If they become viable and wipe out all the interest charges and so on and push production to 100 per cent capacity, will they be able to sell their product on the market? If so, how much money will the company make in 1984-85 and for how long will the success continue?  Will they be able to sell at the right price?  Is the major problem the level of production costs, which is high because of electricity charges?  If these charges are too high how can they be lowered?  Who actually pays the bill?  How can electricity charges and costs be actually lowered?  If this is the last chance for the company perhaps it is important to give them more than £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the questions raised by Senators Conway and Magner, who asked how one could reduce electricity prices to a large industrial user like Irish Steel.  First, as I have indicated in my reply, the Tánaiste will be bringing within about a month his views on this matter to the Government.  Anything that I would say would be in a sense prejudging the conclusions he might reach.  I would also say that we expect to have in the hands of the Tánaiste sometime this month the report of the Committee of Inquiry which <Col N="940" /> I established last year to inquire into electricity prices and which will deal with how one can reduce electricity prices generally. I presume it will deal also in particular with the problem of very large users of electricity such as Irish Steel and a few other companies who according to this international consultant face a tariff structure that is less favourable to the large user in industry in Ireland than is the equivalent in other countries with whom Irish Steel must compete.  A difference in the price of major input which might appear very small in the overall cost of production can be just the very factor that can lose one the vital order. One should not minimise it just because electricity costs might only be 20 per cent of total Irish Steel costs.  If they are out of line by even 5 per cent that could be enough to lose the company very important orders.  They are competing with the producers in other European countries.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I should go into any greater detail of what the possibilities are, but clearly there are areas such as the internal costing in the ESB, the cost of generation of electricity and the cost of some of the inputs brought by the ESB that are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred in particular to mill peat price which is an area which would be looked at, and then there is the tariff structure itself.  The aim should not be primarily to redistribute the burden between industry and the consumer.  It should be to reduce the overall burden of electricity costs by improved internal efficiency in the ESB and efficiencies in regard to the prices they pay for various inputs.  It would be wrong of me to go further than simply to sketch out the possible areas which might be covered in these studies that are concluding now. Beyond identifying the problem which I have to do so far as Irish Steel are concerned, it would not be proper for me to go into details as to how the problems are to be solved.  That is something for which we are awaiting the report of an expert group and upon which the responsible Minister, the Tánaiste, will be making a presentation to the Government in the very near future.  I hope the Senators will <Col N="941" /> understand that that is as far as I can go on that subject.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway asked how we could reduce the costs of steel production to ensure that they are able to compete.  The most obvious way is by increasing production. If they could do that their overheads would be spread more widely and that would reduce costs.  They are only at 40 per cent of their capacity at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith referred to quotas.  They produce 130,000 tons of steel each year, which is just about covered by their quotas. The aim is to produce 250,000 tons. The technical capacity is 330,000 tons, but in the present depressed market they are not over-optimistic about reaching that figure.  If they could produce 250,000 tons they would be able to make a profit. They would be able to pay back some of the accumulated debts.  If all goes according to plan, the consultants expect that Irish Steel should make an operating profit this year.  By this year I mean the year beginning two days ago and running for the next 12 months.  Their year runs from July to end June.  I indicated that last year they made a loss but it was considerably less than it was the previous year, which in turn was less than the previous year.  The trend is downward and we hope that during this year they will cross the profit barrier and make an operating profit.</P>
    <P>That is not just brave optimism which Ministers are wont to engage in when asking the Oireachtas to agree to the redemption of substantial amounts of debt or when people are likely to say that if they did so badly in the past as to incur these debts, what basis is there for being optimistic that things will improve almost immediately as if by some magic process? This prediction has been given by independent consultants who studied Irish Steel on three separate occasions in the last three years.  They have indicated that if all goes well and if we get the quotas, the company will be in a position to make an operating profit.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable them to remove the largest single component in their losses in the last accounting year, which was interest on past debt.  That has been <Col N="942" /> converted into equity.  The company will not have to meet that interest bill, but the taxpayer will have to meet it.  In the end as the taxpayer guarantees the company it amounts to the same thing, because if the debts were left to the company it would close and the debts due, including interest, would have to be met by the taxpayer as long as the guarantees continued.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner asked what would happen next year.  If instead of making that operating profit, as I hope they will, say they made a loss of £½ million they would be in the same position as any other commercial company which made such a loss.  If their bankers left it was a temporary phenomeon and that next year they had all the ingredients necessary to turn that loss into a profit, then they would get credit and be able to continue in business.  If, on the other hand, their bankers felt the loss indicated an underlying problem which they were not capable of eradicating, they would not get credit and they would close.  It is the same as what would happen with any other enterprise operating on its own in business today.  That is the position Irish Steel will be in next year if things turn out that way.</P>
    <P>We have done all we can to put the company on a solid foundation so that their bankers can have confidence in them and so that the company can continue to produce and reach their high level of capacity.  This is a new mill and, comparatively speaking, is among the most technically efficient in Europe. Apart from the cost of energy and the cost associated with producing at less than overall capacity, their costs are low by comparison with some of their competitors. Technically it is a more cost effective mill if it were not for outside costs and interest costs.  So there is a basis for being hopeful.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith and others were concerned that by giving this money to Irish Steel we were saying that if they got into trouble again they could come back and we would give them more.  That is not the case, because when this Bill has been passed no further assistance can be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> That is not solely an assurance from the Irish Government but we will be bound to that by EEC law.</P>
    <P>I will look into Senator McDonald's problem about the person who got a defective product.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="944" /> position is that from an early date there will be worker representation on the board of the company.  It would be possible for the company to make proposals to allow what the Senator has in mind to be done.  If the company made such proposals to me I would be very anxious to facilitate them.  As the Senator may be aware, I have been promoting the idea of worker shareholding in industry.  It is one way of getting rid of the ethos of there being two sides in industry.  If people work longer hours or accept lower wages in order to make an enterprise succeed the benefits of that should not be enjoyed solely by the shareholders and employers. The employees should also enjoy the benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a long time since the last time we had this debate and it is not easy to pick up the threads.  It is particularly difficult to avoid repetition. Senator Lanigan has been consistently asking for a debate on this very important topic and the subject threatened to surface from time to time, but was pushed out by other important business.  It is a very important subject, and one or two days should be set aside specially for a debate on the subject at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point before that the media over a considerable time portrayed Ireland as Caitlín Ní hUallacháin with the <Col N="945" /> begging bowl &mdash; indeed, a bottomless begging bowl.  There were other references to a &ldquo;Gimme&rdquo; situation which I feel were unfair.  The UK and Greece have renegotiated their entry terms and the UK have gone through a very stiff negotiation on their budget contribution and I could see no criticism of these.  In a book published since our last debate <i>Inside the EEC</i> by Ruth Barrington and John Cooney, there is a caricature of the Taoiseach with his cap in hand, in a begging posture.  While it may be an ingenious illustration, it is unfortunate and unfair.  That is not to say that I condone the béal bocht attitude in any circumstances. In a recent paper by Joseph Lee termed &ldquo;Reflections on Ireland in the E.E.C&rdquo;, which was one of a series commissioned by a study group drawn from members of the Irish Council of the European Movement, the matter is treated in a fairer method, and I quote a small paragraph on page 40:</P>
    <P>The strategy of any Irish Government concerned with improving the quality of our performance through the creation of a viable civic culture must aim at curbing the tendency towards escapist self-pity so prominent in the national psyche.  The origins of that tendency may be attributed, if we so wish, to the colonial experience.  But we are now sixty years into self-government. It is ironic to see the manner in which &lsquo;post-colonialism&rsquo; has become increasingly fashionable as an explanation of defects as we move ever further from political occupation.  If we didn't need the &lsquo;post-colonial&rsquo; explanation in the &lsquo;60s&rsquo;, then a later generation should have the self-respect to confine it within its proper limits.</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with that.  Ireland is not looking for something for nothing. We have much to contribute to the Community. I would like to quote another short paragraph from that paper on page 43 which is under the heading &ldquo;Prospects&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys a uniquely low standard of living among the thirteen capitalist <Col N="946" /> states of northern and central Europe.  While it would be churlish to deny that nobody has done more to deserve it, how the Irish have sustained that position poses one of the more challenging questions in comparitive economic history.  It seems reasonable to surmise that none of the other economies operate so far below their potential ceiling as the Irish.  I would hazard that the single most important reason has been the relative lack of incentive for performance, and equally importantly, the relative lack of disincentive for non-performance.</P>
    <P>The author goes on to quote from James Neenan:</P>
    <P>public resources have been freely spent to encourage production.  There has been comparatively little insistence on efficiency: the resources have been placed impartially at the disposal of the efficient and the inefficient, particularly in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure if I would agree with the reference to agriculture, in particular, but the author has put his finger on a very important point there.  Inefficiency seems to run through Irish life, whether it be in business, the office, in every sphere and even in the sphere of huge unemployment which can be regarded as a waste and an unfortunate situation about which it seem nothing is being done.  With regard to the employment situation, as I said before, the State could very well provide total employment and use up the work force productively.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a very full report on the last occasion, but there were some topics that he did not mention.  In the remainder of my contribution, I would like to confine myself to these.  At its constituent meeting of 15 October 1982, the Committee of Inquiry into the Situation of Women in Europe drew up a list of 18 themes of inquiry, including the application of the first two directives on equal pay and equal treatment and the proposals designed to supplement them. The Committee of Inquiry considered the draft report at their meetings of 17 and 18 October 1983, and this report was <Col N="947" /> adopted unanimously at the meetings of 3 and 4 November 1983.</P>
    <P>This report &mdash;&ldquo;Working Documents 1983-1984&rdquo;&mdash; is a very large tome of 552 pages.  I would like to take out some parts of it and develop them somewhat, but this would take too long.  It would give some idea of what the documents are concerned with if I refer to the different topics and give the number of pages devoted to each.</P>
    <P>The application of the first two directives, directive on equal pay and directive on equal treatment, and proposals designed to supplement them, 49 pages. The implementation to date of the third directive, social security, target date 1984, 23 pages.  Situation of women in Greece, 58 pages.  Reduction and reorganisation of working time, 21 pages. Vocational training for women in Europe, 27 pages.  Introduction of new technologies and their effect on employment for women, 19 pages.  Position of women with respect to the review of the European Social Fund, 26 pages.  Women and health, eight pages.  Migrant women and wives of immigrants, 31 pages.  Problems encountered by self-employed women, particularly in agriculture, trade and crafts, 18 pages.  Situation of women in the European Community institutions, 26 pages.  Women in the Third World and European aid, 32 pages.  Information policy and women, 32 pages.  Maternity, parental leave and pre-schools facilities, 19 pages.  Taxation, special problems encountered by women, 29 pages.  Problems of women in less-favoured regions, 28 pages.  Education of girls in the European community, 33 pages.  Place of women in the decision-making centres, 60 pages.</P>
    <P>That resolution was adopted by the European Parliament on 17 January 1984.  The result of the vote was: members voting 197, votes for 125, votes against 17, abstentions 55.  At the meetings on 27 and 28 April 1982 it was decided to add the 18th topic: place of women in universities, cultural infrastructures and the media, radio, television, newspapers. The title of the report was changed to &ldquo;The position of women in decision-making centres.&rdquo;  It is obvious from the number <Col N="948" /> of pages devoted to each theme that the most important one was the place of women in the decision-making centres. That is one aspect with which I totally agree.  The ultimate objective must be equal representation for women on all bodies, an equal number of men and women in the Dáil, an equal number of men and women in the Seanad, in the county councils and on all bodies and in important situations, for example, as principals in schools.  On examination boards there should be an equal number of men and women.</P>
    <P>Another area which is important is religion, which is not referred to in the report, understandably enough perhaps. Religion is supposed to be based on moral principles but in the Catholic Church women are related to a secondary role.  The point has been made by many people that in every sphere women should have the same opportunities as men.  I cannot understand why women are not ordained and why women are not bishops.  Ultimately I am sure a woman will be Pope.  There may be historical reasons why women are not ordained, but they could not be defended in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to paragraphs which were inserted into the final motion for resolution.  The European Parliament notes that &ldquo;an analysis of the figures indicating the percentage of women in top jobs in the ten Members States &mdash; in government institutions, parliaments, trade unions, universities, management positions in the mass media, the judiciary, diplomatic services and major cultural organisations &mdash; indicates overall progress compared with the past.  This progress is, however, insufficient and varies widely according to the sectors analysed and the countries examined. Women in particular continue to remain in a minority in decision-making centres, to the point where in some instances there is a total absence of women.  Discrimination between men and women increases the higher one rises in the hierarchy of government, parliamentary, cultural and university institutions, in the diplomatic services and in the information and mass media sector so that <Col N="949" /> women ultimately fall back on traditionally feminine sectors.</P>
    <P>It proposes &ldquo;that the Commission, the Council and the Member States examine with the closest possible attention this discrimination against women, undertake detailed inquiries into this problem, take initiatives to promote awareness in political circles, in public opinion and among women themselves and adopt constructive measures to enable equality of opportunity to become a reality at the level of decision-making centres.  Calls on the Commission to create scholarships for advance studies to help women reach the highest levels of political, social, scientific, intellectual and artistic activity; suggests that the Commission sponsor a European Conference as part of the action programme on equality of opportunity, with the aim of identifying the measures and initiatives which need to be taken to achieve a fairer representation of women in leading positions in the political, cultural and social life of the ten Member States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The resolution was adopted on 17 January 1984.  There is no need to include the resolution because it is outside the terms of the motion.  That document was taken into consideration in relation to the resolution.  Before leaving that subject, in case somebody might think that I am patronising or overplaying this role of the place of women in society, I want to say that, if women were taking their rightful share, or perhaps all of their share, the position generally today might not be any better, but it could not be any worse.</P>
    <P>With regard to the developments in the European Communities, in the 23rd report, January 1984, under &ldquo;Education Policy&rdquo; it is stated that the Education Committee also considered the teaching of Community languages, the problem of employment for teachers and the Community programme of short study visits for local and regional administrators in the education systems.</P>
    <P>This is an area where we are falling behind.  I saw this borne out in a recent report.  I do not feel there is any excuse for it.  I am sure grants are available for this specific purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> With regard to energy policy in the 23rd report, this is an important area.  On 4 November 1983 the Council finalised a report on the development of new Community policies for presentation to the Athens European Council.  On 12 July the Council discussed the Commission communications on a balanced solid fuels policy, especially on investment aid for production of coal, peat and lignite and aid for reducing pithead coal stocks.  The Council endorsed the need for a balanced overall policy to take account of the interests of all member states, and advised any member state submitting a specific request to the Commission to do so as early as possible.  Ireland submitted a comprehensive memorandum to the Commission setting out particular problems.</P>
    <P>We have reason to be very concerned with this particular area.  I am not sure if we are making as much use of Community funds as we might.  An Foras Forbartha are very concerned in this area.  I note from the report on Community aid for solid fuel production in relation to research, development and demonstration on forest fields, that the Commission proposals should not exclude the domestic sector as research development and demonstration is also necessary at the domestic level for automation of fuel and ash handling, combustion efficiency, use of energy storage and control systems for small-scale solid fuel fired systems.  This is important as a high proportion of solid fuel consumption in this country is in the domestic sector.  For example, some 74 per cent of coal and 89 per cent of peat was directly consumed in 1982.  The inclusion of peat production in the Commission's proposals for a solid fuel policy is welcomed by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>In the European file issue of 1 January 1983 which deals with Community demonstration programmes in energy saving and alternative energy sources there is very little reference to Ireland with the exception of two maps showing energy projects.  However, it states that in Counties Offaly and Mayo 600 hectares of woodland are being cropped intensively to feed a power station converted for wood burning.  Perhaps we could have <Col N="951" /> more programmes using biomass as in this situation.</P>
    <P>The European Community is also involved in demonstration programmes for solar dryers for agricultural byproducts. Ireland could very well avail of some of those projects.  The European Community also published in January 1983 a catalogue entitled &ldquo;The European Community and the Energy Problem&rdquo; which is worth reading.  Ireland's work in this area is controlled by the National Board for Science and Technology.  The work is funded by two different sections of the EEC funds &mdash; DG. 17 looks after energy and DG. 12 deals with research and education.  Research and development are funded by DG. 12 while demonstration projects are funded by DG. 17. The EEC is very strict in its definitions.</P>
    <P>It is also generally agreed that we are doing very well out of demonstration projects because they are put forward by industry, but we are doing very badly out of DG. 12.  The kind of people who get finances are the research institutes, the energy board, the ESB, Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna and some of the universities, and 50 per cent of the money has to be put forward by these bodies.  This could be a serious situation.  More could be provided by the EEC, as generally the smaller countries lose out in these fundings. State funding is abysmally poor, for example, the Department of Energy's funding for research and development is non-existent.  The National Board for Science and Technology are supposed to provide funds mainly in third level education but they have no budget.  In demonstration projects the picture is much better.  The quality of applications has been very good, and last year we received £2½ million through Irish companies. Over the last five or six years the amount paid to Irish companies was around £8 million.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the open fire always has had a very special significance.  As everybody knows, the open fire is particularly wasteful of heat.  There was a special design competition about two years ago for an enclosed stove which could use native fuels, because many of the stoves available use only smokeless fuels.  The winning <Col N="952" /> designs are undergoing tests with IIRS.  Much remains to be done in this area.  Even here the EEC could help out more.  There are some people who are particularly annoyed at the removal of grants for installation of solid fuel heating systems.  They are concerned about whether we will soon or eventually have smokeless zones, because we have smog problems in Dublin.  I suppose with natural gas coming into use this problem will end.</P>
    <P>Another document I will refer to is the Haagerup Report.  It has been praised and criticised and it has been given fairly wide publicity.  The date on the report is 20 December 1983.  It is a start in that the partition of our country has been taken up and considered by the EEC.  We hope that better things will come from it, particularly when the EEC discuss the Forum Report.  On page seven of the Haagerup Report it asks the Commission and the Council of Ministers of the European Community to undertake a major review of all current and planned projects in Northern Ireland and in the Border areas of the Republic to present an integrated plan for a major contribution to the development of Northern Ireland in conformity with the overall objectives of the European Community and to report to the European Parliament on the progress achieved as part of this plan.  We have also at the same time got the Irish Border Areas Information Report from the Economic and Social Committee of the European Community.  This is an EEC-backed development package costing IR£125 million and it is proposed for the Irish Border areas.  The area &mdash; five counties in the Republic and seven district councils in Northern Ireland &mdash; is identified as one of the most under-developed in Europe.  Unemployment here is almost double that of the rest of the island.</P>
    <P>The report endorses plans for the upgrading of the Newry-Dundalk road at a cost of IR£14 million and calls for an agreement between the authorities North and South on routing and cost-sharing aspects.  The press release stated that the natural gas pipeline between Dublin and Northern Ireland should follow an overland <Col N="953" /> route.  This would make it possible to supply Drogheda, Dundalk, Portadown, Lurgan and Newry.  It goes on to say that spurs could be extended to different places.  In view of all this, it is rather disappointing that we have problems with the arrangement between the UK and Ireland regarding the gas and I hope this will be resolved fairly soon.</P>
    <P>The country is divided into seven planning regions, Donegal north west, Donegal west, north east, midlands, east, mid-west, south east and south west and I believe they have prepared development strategy plans up to the year 2004. I have examined the one in relation to the Galway-Mayo region which contains four volumes including the report and implementation manual which was completed in September 1983.  Similar plans have been prepared by all the other planning regions.  They cover tourism, linkage in industry, agricultural policy and aquaculture and fishing.  The development strategy for the next 20 years is intended to provide a framework within which executive agencies such as the IDA, Bord Fáilte, local government, county councils and ACOT would work out their detailed plans and programmes and, because they are within the framework, integration and harmonisation of effort will follow. The strategy sets out how available resources and the regions' potential may best be utilised in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Development strategy for all the regions was completed and published last year and perhaps the Minister would give us some information about this.  I would be particularly interested in the eastern region which included my own county of Meath.  Indeed in the future I would welcome a full debate on these development strategy studies.  They give a special and human aspect to social policies, but they should not be considered inviolable or sacrosanct and the Government might profitably encourage flexibility to meet special and evolving needs as these arise. I would like to get information on future EEC policy regarding investment in the development area and the change in emphasis from single projects to programmes. For example, are we ready to <Col N="954" /> adopt the forward planning system to meet the requirements of the EEC?</P>
    <P>I referred already to European Community environmental protection and apparently this is confined solely to the natural environment.  This should also be extended to deal with buildings in our cities and towns.  In the European file catalogue of November 1983 which is No. 18/83, there is reference to the European Regional Development Fund.  This states that the fund breaks down into two sections termed &ldquo;quota&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-quota&rdquo;. The quota section refers to 95 per cent of available resources.  It states that three-quarters of the money in this section is reserved for Greece, Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I notice that Greece gets 13 per cent, Ireland 5.94 per cent, Italy 35.49 per cent and the United Kingdom 23.80 per cent which seems to be an area where perhaps our negotiators could do better because all this brings us back to the criticism of Ireland always looking for more.  What do the media want?  Would they be satisfied, for example, if our negotiators at the table said &ldquo;thanks very much, but you are giving too much&rdquo; instead of looking for more?  Our negotiators do a very good and important job and I would be supportive of every endeavour to do the best we can to raise our standard of living to that of other countries.</P>
    <P>Another document published last year in respect of member states, regions and administrative units, shows the population trend for the year 2000.  Belgium will be +1.5 per cent, Germany -6.1 per cent, Denmark -0.4 per cent, France +7.9 per cent, the United Kingdom +4.1 per cent, Greece +11.1 per cent, Italy +3.4 per cent, Luxembourg +0.8 per cent, Netherlands +8.6 per cent and Ireland heading the list at +19.9 per cent. As our population is predicted to increase by 19 per cent by the year 2000 it gives us great concern with regard to crime and drugs, employment, housing and education. It is something towards which we should be devoting our energies from now on.  I mentioned on the last occasion the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme, its reintroduction and the fact that some farmers were not satisfied with <Col N="955" /> the situation and I will not elaborate on it today except to point out again that farming is the backbone of the community. The farm modernisation scheme should be looked at again and improved if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to a document which was published on 7 July 1983 and which is termed European Parliament Working Documents, 1983-1984 &mdash; Towards European Economic Recovery in the 1980s.  On 14 December 1983 the enlarged bureau of the European Parliament under the chairmanship of Mr. Dankert authorised a group for recovery of the European economy consisting of the chairman of the six parliamentary committees to appoint economists to draw up a report on the economic crisis affecting the European Community and on the ways and means of bringing about a recovery of growth.  This was presented to the European Parliament and prepared by Mr. M. Albert and Professor R. J. Ball.  It would be impossible to give a précis of it, but overall it is not a very optimistic document.  I quote a few sections from the conclusion:</P>
    <P>What set the seal on the foundations of European unity at the beginning was the economic growth of the member countries.  Nowadays it is a new factor which is giving impetus to European unity.  A new factor which is gaining ground rapidly.  This common factor is decadence.  This is an abstract, vague sort of term whose real scope is difficult for us to grasp since our generation continues to harp back implicitly to its experience of rebirth and growth.  But the facts are there.</P>
    <P>Further on it refers to certain countries and it states:</P>
    <P>The game they are playing is the zero-sum game, the game of zero growth which they have experienced for three years and from which they will not escape if they continue, each man for himself, to cultivate their private gardens separated by their mutual differences.  Without realising that they are walling themselves in, and that all are prisoners.  Instead of looking for a <Col N="956" /> driving force which can pull them along together, they are wasting their energies in quarrels which serve only to slow each other down.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, easier to embark on the building of Europe while sharing out the spoils of rapid growth than it is to continue when the growth in wealth stops.  But one needs only to look at the débacle Europe has suffered in information technology to understand that there are only a few years left to indulge this petty self-destructive game of every man for himself.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow, when the Community is nothing more than a poor old cripple, it will be too late to learn that &ldquo;soft&rdquo; growth builds a robust society, and that slow growth leads to run-down societies. Europe will have entered a new middle ages, the era of its own &ldquo;balkanisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A final paragraph:</P>
    <P>This recovery is possible.  In Europe there is a mine of growth and social progress which has hardly been explored and is totally unexploited. This mine consists of the &ldquo;multipliers of Community efficiency&rdquo; which are described in this report.</P>
    <P>How can they be put to work?  At Community level strong impetus must be given, strong enough to create a psychological shock but prudent enough to prevent financial upheaval and particularly intelligent enough to command the broad support of all those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible because I understand there are three other speakers after me.  I will confine my remarks mainly to the second half of 1983 which is the report of Developments in the European Communities &mdash; Twenty-Third Report.  In noting the contents of the report, and going through the general programme as outlined at the outset, one is particularly struck straightaway at the scarcity of the number of pages allocated, in particular, to education. When one examines paragraph 15 which deals with education one finds <Col N="957" /> therein very, little by way of positive progress.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 15.1 mentions that the Council formally adopted a resolution concerning vocational training policy in the European Communities.  That was adopted on 11 July 1983, almost a year ago.  Yet very little by way of real tangible effect has percolated through into the Irish educational system, and particularly into the Irish vocational education system, which is the body statutorily set up to monitor and to promote vocational education in the country.  It is one of the characteristics of this area that it is generously sprinkled with verbs that are less than dynamic and could be described as inactive.  Measures are examined, schemes are evaluated, changes are considered, committees are briefed, progress is noted, but as I said there is little by way of tangible or positive action.  It is very hard to see how there could be positive action in the area of education.  When one considers that EEC Ministers for Education get together only once every year one gets the impression that these annual get togethers are <i>téte-a-téte,</i> little more than talk-ins, rather than decision-making sessions.</P>
      <P>The need to integrate new information technology, however, is obviously an area which has been getting some considerable emphasis and attention.  One greets with satisfaction the increasing co-operation between the universities and industry and one hopes that the thrust of this development is now carried into second level education and into second level schools.  This chapter on education touches briefly also on the problems of nations which have immigrant education problems.  While there are various pilot projects on-going in those countries which have this problem &mdash; we are not one of them &mdash; there is a general air of pessimism and one does not anticipate great results from the schemes currently being monitored.  One could say that we have a very parallel situation.  We have our own migrants of a particular kind, in other words, our itinerant problem, which we have been less than considerably effective or successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> There is particular significance in the solemn declaration on the European Union, which was signed by the Heads of Government at Stuttgart on 19 June 1983, in particular the points dealing with Community co-operation and education. Surely here lies a considerable portion to the key to the achievement of what must be the great European aspiration of us all, that is, total European integration. Surely it is in the achievement of a common education policy, an area which must be developed at all costs if we are to produce the young European citizen who is determined, unified, who has a progressive outlook towards Europe, where we and our children will have a common European philosophy.</P>
    <P>Alas, however, one must record, as I hinted at earlier, that the EEC education policy is little more than at the embryonic stage.  We are still, for example, talking about such fundamentals as the desirability of having a practical knowledge of at least two languages, apart from the mother tongue altogther.  One must record that in European countries they are as far away from achieving this ideal as we are and that is some considerable distance.  We must stand indicted for our dismal record and level of achievement in the area of linguistics.  We still do not seem to be going anywhere.  We still seem to persist with methods which are absolutely and total proven failures.  We have failed to harness or to adapt to new technology for language teaching.  Our schools in many cases openly discourage school tours abroad.  In schools where the education authority relent and finally concede, they seem to adopt the attitude that they should sit on the fence rather than actively encourage such development. When these tours take place, they are too short a duration to be of any real significant benefit, and one comes back with little more than a cursory or superficial knowledge of how the other people live.</P>
    <P>One must also express disappointment that this ripe area has not really taken off, that the potential which is so enormous here has not been tapped.  It is obvious that the Department of Education after a very tentative, brief flirtation <Col N="959" /> with the idea of teacher exchanges, has for some reason or other, financial o: otherwise, backed away from the idea again.  There is a marked reluctance to recognise for official purposes time spent abroad by both teachers and pupils.  I said earlier, far from encouraging people to participate in foreign travel within the EEC, there is a general dissuasion on the part of many school authorities.  Yet, when communities and towns and villages throughout rural Ireland in particular, decide on their own initiative to liaise with their European counterparts in the EEC, this is not alone not recognised but receives in some cases a certain amount of denigratory comment.</P>
    <P>I refer to a very valuable movement which has taken off in a big way particularly in the west, and this is the twinning operations which have now taken place over the past two to three years between small villages, communities and towns in rural Ireland with their counterparts in France, in particular.  This is known as the Jumelage programme.  If there is one area that holds out great promise and potential and hope for development of linguistic talents to assist people to achieve fluency in foreign languages, this is the one that should be encouraged.  Yet there has not been EEC recognition, let alone financial stimulus to allow this worth-while development known as Jumelage to develop.</P>
    <P>Moving away from education, the greatest challenge in this report is contained in paragraph 1, chapter 2, with the daunting statistic of 12.5 million people unemployed in the EEC at the end of December last.  It would be foolhardy to make any rash presumption, but the report suggests that there is a slowing down of the increase in unemployment and this in itself must be welcomed.  It is also encouraging to note the improvement in the general economic components such as inflation, balances of payments and so on throughout the EEC. This has been evident in the past few months here and should contribute to a deceleration in the rate of increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>However, we should be more aware that things are not happening quickly <Col N="960" /> enough.  We should appreciate that we are sitting on a massive time bomb the social implications of which are evident already in society and which could ignite and go off at any moment with disastrous chaotic consequences for society.  Therefore, one notes with a certain amount of gratitude the Community report which states that this is well comprehended in the EEC, because paragraph 11.7 sets down the need for further impetus so that the European economy will regain the desired course of significant growth.  This is particularly required here because of our unique demographic structure, with such a high proportion in the sub 25 years age group out of work.</P>
    <P>The report touches briefly on the direct measures and new initiatives being undertaken with EEC assistance to alleviate our unemployment problem and to help to train and retrain people who are unemployed.  We should record our appreciation and satisfaction at five initiatives in particular as a result of Community promptings.  There are the innovatory job creation projects currently being supported by the Youth Employment Scheme which have continuing programmes in Carrigtwohill in Cork, Glasnevin in Dublin and in the Mid-West region, in Ennis, Limerick and Shannon. These projects are specifically for young people and receive very intensive assistance towards business training, training in skills, project evaluation, guidance and administrative, technical and financial support.</P>
    <P>We have the community and youth enterprise programmes, established in 1983 with the assistance of the Youth Employment Agency, with the task of alleviating the problem of unemployment, in particular among young people, to establish their own businesses by invoking the support and involvement of local communities.  The idea is that local community youth organisations using local expertise should identify together to develop specific projects, business ideas, which can be put before young people and got under way independently or as co-operatives.  The whole thrust of this project is the development of local enterprise and the provision of assistance <Col N="961" /> and the creation of a suitable climate to enable this type of enterprise to blossom. One notes that there are 25 such projects being monitored and we await with keen anticipation the results of the projects.</P>
    <P>Under the youth self-employment programme, young people with viable business ideas are given guaranteed loans of up to £3,000 per person.  This scheme is jointly organised by the Youth Employment Agency and the Bank of Ireland. There is also the start-your-own-business course organised by AnCO, another valuable project.</P>
    <P>The one I see the greatest hope in is the Youth Employment Agency one, the enterprise allowance scheme.  The Youth Employment Agency have been showing the necessary flexibility, ingenuity and imagination by introducing a certain amount of flexibility of rules to allow people to start their own businesses. They allow people to move into service industries and services.  In other words, it is realised that jobs created in the economy are jobs, and the people are not being tied down to industrial or manufacturing employment.  In this scheme, a young person drawing unemployment benefit or assistance for a period of 13 weeks can retain the benefit or assistance at the weekly rate of £30 in the case of a single person and £50 in the case of a married person for a period of one year. If those people wish to get the lump sum, the entire amount, at the beginning in order to have the capital to launch a project, the necessary flexibility is built into the scheme to allow this to occur. Initially, as far as I can recall, there were 500 places, they were grabbed up straight away and there are still 1,500 applications before the Youth Employment Agency. The National Manpower Service are doing very valuable work in organising these projects.  I am trying to stay clear of the areas which undoubtedly will be covered by Senator O'Leary in his usual mindsweeping comprehensive operation. I have tried to keep within the matters touched on by Senator Fitzsimons, matters related to unemployment with minor reference to education.  Finally, I will <Col N="962" /> record my dissatisfaction with one development.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we were extremely lucky in the west to be given a total grant of £9.7 million towards the western drainage scheme.  This scheme has now been exhausted and it is a tragedy that with so many acres of unexploited wasteland in the west, with great potential for development, the scheme has been suspended. I look forward to those in authority to do all in their power and to use strong advocacy to have the scheme re-established. The aim to introduce equality throughout the EEC by bringing the level of land production in the west of Ireland up to that of other EEC countries has not been nearly realised.  We have gone a long way but as long as thousands of acres of undrained land, a reservoir with rich potential, are left in the west we will never reach the stage of equilibrium with the rest of the EEC which we deserve.</P>
    <P>A number of other developments have taken place, such as the withdrawal of the lime subsidy and part withdrawal of the AI subsidy.  This, again, seems to militate against the west.  When we entered the EEC we were led to believe that the Regional Fund would supply endless benefits for us and bring us to the level of better off areas in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer thankfully to the trenchant stand taken by the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach in negotiations. As Senator Fitzsimons said, we do not want to be labelled as the beggarmen of Europe but this was one matter on which, without apology to our EEC partners, we trenchantly stuck to our guns in a matter of vital national interest. The Minister for Agriculture has not received the necessary credit for the degree of success achieved here.  We succeeded in getting a 4.6 per cent derogation when our co-partners within the EEC were being cut back to the 1981 level.  It was a significant achievement, and I only hope that the worst fears expressed by the Minister recently that we will not reach the target are not realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we refer to the European Commission as the European <Col N="963" /> Economic Commission, but in fact the initial motivation was political.  The idea was that never again would we have to endure the tribal barbaric wars in Europe.  But, obviously, the visionary Frenchmen and others in Europe saw the necessity for some kind of cohesion, co-ordination, harmonisation of economics and monetary schemes and harmonisation of social policies.  They did that.  This must be regarded as a success story notwithstanding the various failures from time to time that were met.  The biggest problem at the moment &mdash; it should not be regarded as a failure taken in the context of world recession &mdash; is the massive unemployment problem, one of 11 per cent.  During the years 1973-1983 the United States created 15 million jobs and our united states of Europe lost three million.  That is a contradiction immediately.</P>
      <P>The most alarming problem inside the unemployment problem is the one of under 25 years of age.  The average unemployment figure is 11 per cent and the average under 25 is 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is a consciousness in Europe at the moment in that out of the social fund they allow for vocational training.  That is a good thing, but one must ask, is the training speculative or is it done in such a way that the lads can be placed after they are trained.  I believe in speculative training, but one must come to a situation where we look for machinery to develop comprehensive work places.  That means investment and everything that is associated with creating work.  Another remarkable thing I discovered &mdash; the motion asks us to note the developments in Europe &mdash; is that the Commission sent to the standing committee only two items for discussion on unemployment. The remarkable thing is that the first was the reorganisation of working time.  They must have thought that this would make a contribution to the unemployment problem.  Some of us in this Chamber thought the same thing at one time.  The second item was young people in the labour market and it was said that this was not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employer and worker representation expressed extreme dissatisfaction <Col N="964" /> with the lack of a broader look at the whole economic situation and, at a later stage, the workers' representatives withdrew. On the workers theme, fears have been expressed inside the British TUC but they have not been expressed inside the ICTU about the effect on the closed shop arising from what is called, freedom of association.  The question asked is, does freedom of association mean freedom not to associate?  The same problem arises on the basis of freedom for education. The parents inside Europe have the right to educate their children in the school of their choice.  If this means a public school what would happen to the public school inside a left dominated country?  Those questions must be asked eventually but they have not raised their heads yet.</P>
    <P>There is evidence, of course, of a rather slow economic recovery in early 1983.  Inflation fell to under 9 per cent.  It continues to fall and it is expected that the figure eventually will be 6.5 per cent. That is good.</P>
    <P>I have talked about co-ordination of economies, the bringing together of all investment procedures, the question of productivity and the extension of markets but I have not read in the three reports any real machinery for doing this.  I have read calls for co-operation between the nation states but I do not see machinery. I get the impression that the nation states, each one of the Ten, must be left with the responsibility if the EEC provides the finance.  They must have the responsibility. If that is true then Ireland has that responsibility to go on with its programmes if it can with assistance from the EEC.  They seek comprehensive strategy for economic recovery, encouraging productivity and the expansion of markets. There is a successful agricultural policy although it produces an over-abundance. The idea was a single market and common prices.  They have come to an agreement after six years negotiations on a common fishing policy and that is very good.</P>
    <P>The question of the relationship of Europe with Third World countries arises on the over-abundance of production. Why cannot the over-abundance of food <Col N="965" /> be given to those Third World countries? The other relationship is that eventually the north part of the world and the south part of the world where the under-developed countries are will have to do something about the inequality as between north and south.  I will give a stark figure to explain the inequality.  If the world population was reduced to 1,000, 60 of the 1,000 would have half the income, six per cent while 700 of the 1,000 would be illiterate.  Illiteracy means that a person's full character cannot be developed as long as it continues.  Hunger, poverty and disease must be tackled by the nations with the assistance of the nations who have not.  Technical and technological aid as well as over-abundance of food must be provided.</P>
    <P>I have given a promise not to speak too long, because other Senators want to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to make a few comments on the developments in the EEC during 1983.  I do not intend to delay the House very long.  My comments will be on the areas of interest to myself.  Other members of my party have covered the other areas of activity.  I am sorry to disappoint Senator Higgins but I do not intend to be comprehensive at all in what I have to say.  I will be dealing with the areas I feel are important at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The periods of time covered by the two reports are from the beginning of January 1984 and from the end of January 1984 ending in July 1983.  I should like to mention a few of the items referred to and give my opinion on them.  I should like to refer in the first place to the common agricultural policy, which Senator McGonagle has already referred to.  I should like, secondly, to refer to the agricultural position in the light of the recently concluded agreement in the area of the milk super-levy and other similar developments.  I should like to make some reference to the relationship between the industrialised countries, the United States of America and the European Economic Community in particular. Lastly I should like to make some <Col N="966" /> reference to the policy of the Community in respect of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty.  They are the four areas that I should like to discuss briefly.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously that the success of the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations, reported in the Twenty-Third Report represents a considerable achievement by those who negotiated on our behalf.  The negotiators showed considerable negotiating skills in achieving for us quite a reasonable fisheries deal within the context of what was available. However, the basic ground rules by which our negotiators were operating were unfair.  I believe the Common Fisheries Policy to have been a fraud by the original six EEC members on those who joined later.  The adoption by them of proposals which led ultimately to a common fisheries policy, and in particular the adoption by them of certain Treaty changes prior to our accession in 1973, had the effect of reducing the possibility of both Britain and Ireland benefiting to a proper extent in respect of the area immediately around their coasts. Between Britain and Ireland the percentage of the waters of the Community which one would assume to be under the national control of Britain and Ireland is very high indeed, something in the order of 40 per cent.  We must bear in mind that other EEC countries, such as France and the Benelux countries, had overfished their own traditional areas and prior to our accession to the Community had entered into a policy which deliberately sought to minimise in national terms the claim we had to the areas 50 miles around our own coast.</P>
    <P>Fish is a national resource.  What national resource of the other member states is shared in the same way as fish? Would one seriously suggest that the national resource of oil or minerals such as coal or the resource of water should be voluntarily given by one member of the EEC to another?  Why then should there be any exception in the case of fish?</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy was agreed at the final meeting of the Council in 1983 and it is reported on page 39 of the Twenty-Third Report.  While it represents a good deal for Ireland within the <Col N="967" /> context of our membership of the EEC and the rules which apply within that organisation, the rules are stacked against this country and continue to represent a fraud by the original members of the European Community on this and other countries.  I believe that to be very serious.  This represents our continuous payment to the Community.  I do not believe that our Ministers in successive Governments have been sufficiently vigorous in pointing out that this is an entrance fee which we paid in the past and which we are continuing to pay for our membership of the EEC.  We have never exploited the wrong that was done to us to our advantage in other negotiations. I understand that these things have to be done in a diplomatic and appropriate fashion, but we should state our dissatisfaction at a time of quiet so that when the pressure is on at a later stage we can point, back to the Common Fisheries Policy through which we have made a substantial contribution to the economic well-being of other members of the Community.</P>
    <P>I now refer to agriculture.  One cannot but be impressed by the growth in stocks both within Ireland and within the Community at large, particularly in the milk area.  Page 30 of the Twenty-Third Report outlines the growth, and it is set in contrast not so much with the opening figures in that report but with the opening figures in the Twenty-Second Report. One sees the change over a 12-month period.  For example, in the Community at large there was an increase in skimmed milk powder from 574,000 tonnes to 989,000 tonnes, almost doubling the amount of skimmed milk powder in intervention. Similarly during that period there was an increase from 110,000 tonnes of butter to 691,000 tonnes, this representing a 6.5 times increase in the amount in intervention.  That is a very serious matter for this country, and our national figures for both skimmed milk and butter reflect precisely the same trend.  In the case of skimmed milk our stock went from 65,000 tonnes to 126,000 tonnes and, in the case of butter, from 11,400 to 51,200 tonnes.  That is a very significant change and one which <Col N="968" /> obviously signals the dangers of not agreeing to some restriction on agricultural production, particularly dairy production.</P>
    <P>For that reason the super-levy negotiators represented a triumph for the country and for the Government.  The most significant factor in these negotiations is not that our farmers achieved an increase of 4.6 per cent over the 1983 figures.  The most significant fact is that the other countries have to reduce.  If we can even maintain a modest growth in our production in these areas at a time when financial penalties are being imposed on the rest of the Community, then in due course we will become the natural and economic producers of these products, as we should be.  Our markets will be secure and our prices will be right.  The Community will be saved the expense of financing the common agricultural policy to the extent it has in the past and we will be assured of a good and profitable market in the years to come.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>During the super-levy negotiations certain changes took place in the monetary compensatory amounts which operate in respect of various countries in the Community. I do not know of anybody who understands monetary compensatory amounts &mdash; I suspect nobody understands them at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>And they lose it again. This was a very significant change for Ireland.  Not only has there been a beneficial change in the milk production and in the pricing structure of milk but there has also been significant benefit in the beef area.  Once again our negotiators are to be congratulated.  The success of the super-levy negotiations means that in due course we will reduce our dependence on grants from the EEC and the market price will stabilise to such an extent that we will be receiving from the market place what we are receiving at present by way of subvention from the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not allow the occasion to pass without mentioning the relationships <Col N="969" /> between the industrialised countries in general, the USA in particular, and the EEC.  It is true to say that the USA are at present pursuing, and have been in the last few years, a policy which was not well disposed towards the European Economic Community.  The Twenty-Second Report, at paragraph 4.7, outlines the problems that arose with regard to the sale of some wheat which was in breach of agreements between Ireland and the USA, Ireland being one of the participating countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Similarly, in the last few reports there have been reported a considerable number of difficulties the Community has been experiencing with the USA in the matter of steel.  The tariffs and quotas which have been established in the area of steel are breaking the existing rules governing these matters.  I would recommend that the USA change their attitude and come to recognise that a healthy European Economic Community is the best bulwark they have against communism or the growth of any other kind of alien ideology in Western Europe.  There is no doubt that the only thing which will dragdown Western Europe is unemployment, referred to already by Senator Higgins. I think he is right; it is the big danger confronting us.  We have a young population who are under-employed.  It is in the interests of the USA to ensure that they are properly employed.  It is important that the concern of this House be expressed to the USA in these matters.</P>
    <P>The Twenty-Third Report, at page 20, paragraph 4.13 deals with the problem of the limitation of imports of speciality steel.  As far as I know speciality steel is not produced by Irish Steel Limited in Cork.  Of course the limitation on export of speciality steel increases the pressure on the steel market in Europe in general and, as such, has a indirect effect on the Irish steel industry, indeed that throughout the Community.  It is said in that report, at paragraph 4.14 that, in accordance with its rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the Community sought compulsory tariff concessions in other areas in the course <Col N="970" /> of consultations.  Again, in accordance with the GATT rights the Council, on 29 November 1983, decided that if the USA failed to agree satisfactory compensation by 15 January 1984 the Community would proceed to impose retaliatory restrictions against certain imports from the USA.  That is not the spirit in which trade between the USA and Europe should develop.  For that reason the concern of this country, as one of the participators in the EEC, should be expressed.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I should like to refer is one that is somewhat more esoteric than the others to which we have referred.  It is the way in which Articles 85 and 86 of the European Economic Treaty are being administered.  By and large Articles 85 and 86 deal with the abuse of a dominant position by a supplier in the Community.  The people who are called to task in this are the multi-nationals. Very often there are companies such as IBM, Ford and others called to task.  It is a matter of considerable importance for the Community at large and one of particular importance to Ireland that there be an international body capable of taking on these multi-nationals in so far as such is necessary.  I was surprised, indeed amazed, that there was criticism expressed in last Friday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> of one such report, on the decision of the EEC to intervene, under Articles 85 and 86, in the case of International Business Machines, an alleged abuse by them of their dominant market position.  It was suggested in that newspaper that in some way this was not a proper matter for the EEC and that they should do better with their time. It is very proper that multi-nationals should be confronted by states on a multi-national basis, something which has my complete support.</P>
    <P>To explain the relevance of this to the House it would be well to look at page 70 of the Twenty-Third Report, a decision there reported, No. 83/560, which deals with the Ford Motor Company.  It is a dispute between the Commission and the Ford Motor Company which has considerable implications not only in the sense of the Ford Motor Company <Col N="971" /> obviously being the subject of an investigation which might give rise to their being fined eventually but it has, or will in the next six months, have specific reference to this country.  That decision related to the distribution system operated by the Ford Motor Company in Cologne in the Federal Republic of Germany where they adopted a restriction on competition by refusing to allow dealers in West Germany to supply right hand drive motor vehicles for exportation to Britain with a consequent saving of money. There was a potential substantial saving through people buying their motor cars in Germany, exporting them to Britain and paying the appropriate duties at the points of importation.  The reason that that would have involved a substantial saving of money is that there is a very high selling price for motor vehicles in Britain, a basic selling price, leaving aside the question of taxation.  Believe it or not, the basic selling price of motor vehicles in Ireland is not quite as high as that in Britain but it is high by continental standards.  After 31 December 1984 &mdash; which is just six months away &mdash; it should be possible for us to take advantage of the decision reported here, when it will be possible for people to insist on the importation of motor vehicles and, of course, pay the proper duties at the points of importation.  It may well be that, in respect of some models, there will be a substantial saving of cost.  In that way the decision of the Community, which appears very remote, will have a considerable impact on our lifestyle within the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>I commend the Commission for their diligent pursuit of the responsibilities given them under Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, and it is very important that we express our support in that regard.  I have not sought to express a general view on the Community's performance or on our place within that Community but rather limit myself to an expression of individual concerns which I felt more appropriate arising on the motion put down on the Twenty-First, Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Reports on Developments in the European <Col N="972" /> Communities.</P>

      <P>I think we have had this afternoon, and on the two previous occasions on which we discussed this motion, an interesting debate.  I would express some disappointment that more Senators have not offered to speak in the debate.  It may well be that the gaps between our previous occasions of debate have been unduly long and this led them to lose interest.  However, nine Senators as well as the Minister have spoken in the debate and Senator Ferris and I, who put down this motion as a Government motion to allow the widest possible debate, are grateful to them.  However, I want to comment that of those nine Senators four come from my own party of Fine Gael, three from the Fianna Fáil Party and two from the Labour Party.  It is a matter perhaps of surprise that Independent Senators of this House tend from time to time to lecture those who seek political progress through membership of political parties on their shortcomings as Senators and as public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically all of those who spoke made reference to the unfortunate fact that there was a distinct delay in placing before the Houses of the Oireachtas the reports on developments in the EEC that we are discussing this evening.  The position was that the Twenty-First Report, which dealt with the second half of 1982, was only placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas six months after the close of that period.  The Twenty-Second Report, which dealt with the first half of 1983, was only placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas nine months after the period ended, although there was some improvement with regard to the Twenty-Third Report which dealt with the second half of 1983 and which was laid before the Houses five months after the end of the period.  I think the message has gone quite clearly from Seanad Éireann, and I have endeavoured as Leader of the House to reinforce this message, that this is just not good enough, and that if there is to be a thorough debate of developments in the EEC these reports must be available at an earlier date.  I have been informed, and it <Col N="973" /> was confirmed to me today, that the hope is that the Twenty-Fourth Report, which is for the six months ended 30 June, will, hopefully, be laid before this House and before Dáil Éireann in September, which would involve a lapse of only three months.  I think we all hope sincerely that that is an aspiration that can be met.</P>
    <P>The debate has covered a large number of areas, which is only natural because the Community, whether it is developing or stagnating, affects so many aspects of our Irish life.  Senator Lanigan, opening the debate after the Minister's statement, placed in the forefront of his contribution the problem of unemployment.  This was adverted to by a number of other speakers, notably Senator Harte, Senator Higgins, Senator McGonagle and Senator O'Leary.  In dealing with this particular point I would like to stress that the Government, in their preparation for the Presidency of the Council which they have just entered, have looked at a number of ways in which the Community can use its potentially immense collective strength to combat the appalling unemployment situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in his recitation of the work programme for the Irish Presidency of the Commission has put this issue among his priorities and will press for badlyneeded action.  Further along this line, I would draw the attention of the House to a particular part of the statement made by the Taoiseach on Friday last reporting on the European Summit in Fontainebleau. Since that record has not yet been circulated I would like to quote what the Taoiseach said on that occasion.  I am quoting from his statement made to Dáil Éireann on Friday 29 June:</P>
    <P>In a contribution to the work of the Council, on the first day, I drew attention to the menacing economic problems facing the Community.  In the United States, total employment has increased in the ten years between 1973 and 1983 by more than 15 million.  In the Community with a rough equivalence of population, employment fell in the same period by two million.  I indicated our acceptance of the fact <Col N="974" /> that, as had been suggested, there is need to improve flexibility in the labour market in Europe and to control excessive Government spending, especially where this imposes severe problems on taxpayers.  But I added that we could not be happy with the failure to use the collective strength of the Communities and with their lack of joint action to improve economic growth. There is, in particular, the need for the Community to be ready to face the consequences of a possible halving of US growth rates next year, which, if we take no corrective European action, would eventually, if not in 1985, then in 1986, reduce the much lower growth rates so far achieved in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>This must be a major theme in our Presidency.  What is clear is that market forces, left to themselves, will not resolve the unemployment crisis. Additional measures may be needed, both to provide an economic stimulus and to alleviate unemployment, for example, as I suggested at the Council, by applying the Social Fund to the task of substituting work for unemployment, rather than just training people for work which in some cases may not be available.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from what the Taoiseach said on that occasion on the eve of entering into the Presidency of the EEC that the question of unemployment which has loomed large in this debate will be a major preoccupation of the Community under our Presidency.  This was reinforced by a statement made yesterday by the Minister for Labour, who again spoke on similar lines about this being a major task, a major preoccupation, and a measured by which our Presidency may well be judged.</P>
    <P>A Leas Chathaoirligh, it is now 5 o'clock.  I am uncertain how much longer I will be dealing with the debate and I would be happy to resume on the next day.  I do not know what the wish of the House is.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour not to go beyond half an hour.  The next point that I would like to take up is the question of the European union, the idea of Europe as a union.  It was noted by, I think, Senator McDonald that there has been a very distinct lack of progress in many areas.  Indeed, it can be said that there has been a very distinct lack of debate in regard to this in this country compared to the level of debate that there was in 1983 in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>As Senator McGonagle has pointed out, the basis of the original formation was the avoidance of war but the instrument that was chosen was that of economic co-operation, first in the strategic industries of iron, coal and steel but later throughout the whole of economic activity. We face now in the Community, in attempting to bring to realisation the Stuttgart Declaration which Senator Higgins mentioned, a problem in regard to what the instruments should be.  The attitude of successive Irish Governments has been, I think properly, that it would be a mistake to think that everything could be done through political instruments and through political co-operation. While political co-operation and economic co-operation should both progress towards an ultimate union, we in particular would tend to suffer if political co-operation were to outrun economic co-operation to a considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons mentioned, in regard to our attitudes to Europe as it has been developed, the recent publication by Professor Joe Lee which was published by the Institute of Public Administration.  This is a study of our <Col N="976" /> basic attitudes in this country to the Community that well deserves study.  It may well be that perhaps we should have a debate to note Professor Lee's monographs which attempt to get to the roots of our fundamental attitudes to Europe rather than noting a series of reports that are full of statistics.  The reality of where Ireland is going to go in the Community is more relevantly discussed in a monograph like Professor Lee's than in a compendium of what has happened over a period of six months.</P>
    <P>A number of other points which touch on the idea of European union, touch on the idea of unemployment which was discussed. Senator Fitzsimons discussed the question of energy which is fundamental to the question of industrial production, and it came up earlier this afternoon in the debate on Irish Steel.  He called attention to one point which I think is a difficulty in regard to the operation of the Community.  In relation to the question of energy he mentioned that there was a very sharp line drawn between the operations of Directive General 12 which deals with research and development and Directive General 17 which deals with demonstration projects in energy.  This is a problem that runs right throughout the whole of the Community's operation. The various directive generals in the Community tend to work in water-tight compartments.</P>
    <P>There was in the course of the debate quite a good deal of discussion on the question of agriculture.  In the earlier part of the debate which took place before the settlement in regard to the Common Agriculture Policy there was a debate on the position of our dairy industry, on our particular problems and there was a note of anxiety in regard to the future.  However, today after the event we have the success following what Senator Higgins described as the sanctions stand by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  The position has changed in that sense.  The overall position that led to that crisis has not changed.  Senator O'Leary drew attention in his contribution to the growth during 1983 of agricultural produce. Our difficulties, and they were very <Col N="977" /> real, were compounded by the fact that we failed during ten years of favourable conditions under the Common Agricultural Policy to achieve the structural reform which would allow us to get through a crisis such as occurred.  If we neglect as we go forward structural reform in agriculture we will have recurring crises in regard to this.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the matter of fisheries.  In that connection, Senator O'Leary quite properly drew attention to the fact that we were prejudiced from the beginning in fisheries negotiations by the actual terms of entry, by the actions of the original Six, immediately before the accession of Britain, Denmark and ourselves.  Given that disadvantage, Senator McGonagle and Senator Fitzsimons welcomed the agreement, and I think we must all welcome the agreement made in regard to fisheries.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators talked about the Regional and Social Funds.  In the past few years this has been one of the areas of disappointment in regard to the development of the Community.  In a sense it was impossible to look for any real development, any real change, so long as the budgetary problem remained unresolved. We would hope now that the budgetary problem has been resolved that we would see an era of real development in regard to the Regional and Social Funds.  Nevertheless, as Senator Hillery in particular pointed out, there was a good start in regard to the Social Fund in 1983.  Senator Fitzsimons in his contribution seemed to think that our share &mdash; at the moment it is just under 6 per cent &mdash; was not what we would be due under the Regional Fund.  I think he undervalues what has been achieved in this regard.  The negotiations in regard to change on the basis of the Regional Fund were particularly difficult negotiations for us.  We came out with our position undamaged from those negotiations. There may seem to be huge amounts going to other countries, but while we have our problems in this country we do not have anything to match the poverty of rural Greece.  We do not have anything <Col N="978" /> to match the destitution of southern Italy.  While we may think it remarkable that parts of the United Kingdom benefit under the Regional Fund we should not think of the United Kingdom in terms of south-east England.  That is what tends to come across on our television sets.  It seems to be what we see when we think of the United Kingdom.  There are areas of the United Kingdom, in the peripheral areas in Scotland and in Wales, where a living is hard to come by.  That does not mean we should not look for more.  Senator Higgins mentioned the problems of the west, of what can be done by drainage in the west.  There is a very good case here and we hope that case will be pressed.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned development aid and asked that the figures in regard to development aid be published. I felt, sitting through this debate, that this problem did not receive either in the reports or in the debate the attention it would deserve.  However, since this debate started the Department of Foreign Affairs have published a report on last year's work in development aid with a look back over the last ten years at our programme of development aid.  It would be my intention to give Government time in the autumn for a discussion of that report so that we could discuss both our Government aid which is channelled through the EEC and Government aid generally.</P>
    <P>The question of the over-abundance of food and the possibility of making this available to the Third World was raised during the debate.  One of the major tasks of the Irish Presidency will be the final negotiations of the third Lomé agreement.  In this connection, we must recognise that we have a good record.  The Taoiseach when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs carried on extremely successful negotiations in regard to an earlier Lomé agreement, and we hope our Ministers and officials will find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I was glad Senator Fitzsimons raised the question of women in Europe.  This is something we should always discuss when we are dealing with problems of this kind.  There is a good deal to give us <Col N="979" /> thought in the Report of the European Parliament which he mentioned.  There is a good deal to give us thought as to whether we have not just last year but over the period of ten years moved as quickly as we might either under the compulsion of directives or voluntarily.  We will have other opportunities to discuss this.  There is hope that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights will report in this autumn on the first topic which it has taken up, and that is education in all its aspects.  Many of the points Senator Fitzsimons made can be discussed in greater detail when that report comes before us.</P>
    <P>In regard to education and training, Senators Fitzsimons and Higgins dealt with this point.  Senator McGonagle also dealt with it.  It is very useful, as Senator Higgins pointed out, that the Ministers are meeting only once a year.  The points he made about what might be done and having a key to union by exchange in comparison with the present situation, which is hardly mutual recognition of the contacts that are being made and in regard to youth employment, are all points that must be central during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from economic to political matters, during his contribution the last day Senator Fitzsimons asked for certain information.  Firstly he asked for information in regard to grants which had been made under the fisheries programme and grants which had been made under education and exchange programmes. The Department of Foreign Affairs have given me the following information which I am happy to put on record.  In regard to grants towards fishing and aquaculture projects in Ireland, in the period 1974 to date there has been a total of over £20 million in grants.  Of that by far the largest amount was £16,444,391 for the construction of vessels. There was a further grant of £382,847 for the modernisation of vessels. In regard to aquaculture, the total amount of grants was £3,394,375 of which over £3,300,000 was for mariculture and just over £90,000 for fish farming.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the grant for educational and exchange programmes under the EEC and in regard to <Col N="980" /> the preparation of young people for working life there are three pilot projects in Shannon, Dublin and Galway.  In 1983 the grants for these were £189,000.</P>
    <P>Under a second heading of joint study programmes for third level, a number of colleges benefit from this but no figure is readily available.  Under another third programme Irish educational administrators received grants for study visits.  In 1983 these amounted to £6.413 million.</P>
    <P>Under a fourth heading, AnCO during 1983 received for these purposes £45 million, a very substantial amount, and the Youth Employment Agency in 1983 received grants of £370,000.</P>
    <P>Under a sixth heading, CERT received in 1983 approximately £1.4 million.  Separate from all these the Department of Education received £11.7 million, a good deal of which was used for capital works on school buildings.  The National Manpower Programme received grants of £3 million.</P>
    <P>Under a ninth heading, the Exchange of Young Workers Programme, 157 young workers went to member states in 1983.  The figure in 1979 was 33.  Between 1979 and 1983 a total of 437 people went from Ireland under such exchanges.  This amounts to over 11 per cent of the exchanges between all member states.  In this regard we are receiving our share.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn from economic matters which are properly the subject of the Community itself to economic political co-operation which is a voluntary matter and is dealt with separately in the three reports.  Senator Lanigan in his speech said the Minister had made no reference in his statement to neutrality. All I can say is what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, said last week in introducing the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs, that it should not be necessary for an Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs on each occasion on which he speaks about foreign policy to reiterate the Government's commitment to Ireland's neutrality.  That commitment is set out in the Programme for Government adopted in December 1982 and it has been repeated on numerous occasions by the Minister and other members of the Government.  If Ministers were to <Col N="981" /> repeat too often the position in regard to neutrality people might well believe we were in the position of the lady who did protest too much.  The situation is clear beyond any doubt.  The Minister on 15 February this year when the occasion called for it set out our neutral position to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also spoke of the question of disarmament and the nuclear weapons in Europe.  The Government have made it quite clear that they have availed of every appropriate opportunity to make the parties involved aware of the Irish Government's concern that the major arms control negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union, that is INF and SDART, which are currently suspended should resume and should do so with a genuine and manifest aim of succeeding. During the recent visit of President Reagan, this concern was conveyed personally to him.  Since Ireland is outside military alliances and neither directly nor indirectly involved in INF and SDART talks, the Government have not endorsed the successive negotiating positions of either side, but instead have based their approach on urging the pressing need for both parties not to use these weapons.  It would, indeed, be inappropriate for us to comment, or more to support, the negotiating position of the other side.  The Government will continue to urge a resumption and a successful conclusion of these talks.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also referred to the contribution of Irish troops to UN peace-keeping in south Lebanon.  I would like to join with him, and I am sure all Senators join in paying tribute to the courage, determination and effectiveness of our troops who have carried out the UN mandate in very difficult and often dangerous circumstances in Lebanon. From the outset, the conditions in which UNIFIL were obliged to operate have been unsatisfactory.  This situation was made a good deal worse by the second Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and by the presence of Israel in southern Lebanon following that invasion.  Nonetheless, the Government believe that UNIFIL continue to perform useful and <Col N="982" /> important functions in their area of operations. The Ten have consistently supported UNIFIL in their difficult task overseeing the restoration of peace and stability in southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been privileged to participate in almost all UN peace-keeping operations since we joined the UN in 1955.  I think all parties agree that UN peace-keeping has a number of inherent strengths and advantages, and it is notable that in a world fraught with confrontation and violence there is some measure of peace and stability wherever there is a UN peace-keeping presence.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a number of current problems that are matters of concern to the members of the Ten and discussed by them as part of European political co-operation.  One of these is the Middle East.  I agree with Senator Lanigan concerning the ominous implications of the possible escalation of the war between Iran and Iraq.  This is a conflict to which the Foreign Ministers meeting under Europeal political co-operation have devoted a good deal of time.</P>
    <P>Confirmation that chemical weapons have been used in the battlefield were received from the UN.  In March the Foreign Ministers issued a statement in which they recall their unreserved condemnation of the use of such weapons. Subsequently, Ireland and the other members of the Ten introduced export controls on chemicals bound for both Iran and Iraq.  We now have the escalation of that war into the so-called tanker war, which is creating considerable difficulties. Ireland continues to adhere to a policy of strict neutrality between the belligerents in this war.  We have been pleased to react positively to a request from the US Secretary-General for two Irish Army officers to act as observers for the monitoring of the recent agreement between Iran and Iraq on not attacking purely civilian targets.</P>
    <P>But, in all candour, one must say the prospects for an end to this most unfortunate war do not appear to be good. Nevertheless, the Irish Government intend to continue to stress, in their contacts with the Iranian and Iraqi authorities, the need to solve the disputes by <Col N="983" /> negotiation and the benefits to both countries that would flow from an early ceasefire.</P>
    <P>These are the main points, both in regard to economic policy under the Treaties and European political co-operation under voluntary co-operation to which I thought I should reply after a most useful debate, again one in which one would have hoped more Senators would have joined.</P>
