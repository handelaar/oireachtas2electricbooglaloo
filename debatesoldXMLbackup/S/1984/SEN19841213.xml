      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  It is also proposed to take Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.  I want to remind the House that these are being debated together because they are interlinked. I propose that we try to finish those if possible by 5 o'clock and that, one way or the other, they will be taken by 5 p.m. to help clear the Order Paper. We have had three different debating days on this motion.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to complete No. 12 which we discussed yesterday, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill?  We have had about four and a half hours' discussion in 12 months on it.  I do not want to appear unreasonable but, on the other hand, I do not think I should have to say thank you for four and a half hours discussion in 12 months.  I would like some indication as to whether it is proposed to take it fairly early in the New Year and, hopefully, to complete the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Brendan Ryan in connection with No. 12, Senator Ryan knows we have quite a full programme before Christmas.  This is one of the reasons Private Members' time last night was devoted to his Bill, to assist the passage of as many Stages of it as possible before Christmas.  I do not think it would be fair to ask the people who are entitled to a motion to forfeit their Private Members' time after Christmas.  It depends totally on the amount of business coming to us from the Government and what our sitting days will be.  There is certainly no intention on this side of the House not to proceed as quickly as possible.  We feel it is important either to proceed with it or get a substitute Bill.  We have to proceed in the House as quickly as possible.  I have no doubt that we will try to do that. I could not give a commitment before Christmas.</P>
      <P>This brings me to Senator Hussey's question about what programme will be before Christmas.  It is proposed to sit next week on Tuesday for a full day, starting at 10.30 a.m., and we will continue on from there to finish whatever business we have.  If that takes all day Tuesday, Tuesday night, all day Wednesday, Wednesday night or whatever is necessary we will finish the legislation we have.  There is a Social Welfare Bill coming to us next week.  It is important to have it completed because it brings certain regulations into law after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no indication yet of whether in fact the matter raised by Senator O'Leary <Col N="821" /> will be taken before Christmas.  That would be a matter for next week's discussion. It is on our Order Paper but I have not moved it because it has not been agreed yet when to take it.  I take his point that it is a very important Bill and will need full discussion.  It is intended to adjourn for lunch from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>As a member of the committee I would like to support Senator Ferris.  This is a very hardworking committee.  We have met 49 times since it was set up in March 1983.  All the members have worked very hard under the chairmanship of Deputy Molloy and the vice-chairmanship of Senator Ferris. We are very fortunate to have Mr. Jennings from An Foras Forbartha as a technical consultant, and a very industrious secretary.  This is a very important committee. The work we are doing is a once off item.  It is not an ongoing thing like the Women's Rights.  It is very important and it will be a landmark in this area.  It will, perhaps, be more important than the <Col N="822" /> Kenny report.  I support Senator Ferris in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House for agreeing to this deferment.  We would have preferred if we had completed our work because, as Senator Fitzsimons says, it is a major committee and the subject matter is a major one.  There have been many excellent contributions at it. Senator Brendan Ryan has made a major contribution to it.  It is sincerely hoped that the work will be completed in time or even before the reporting back date that we are now asking the House to extend to.  I will not say anything further on it.  We are at the moment examining a first draft of the final report.  We are that close to completing the work.  Our terms of reference run out at 31 December and it would be unfair to be expected to be finished before then.  I want to thank the Senators for their assistance.  I assure them that we will have a report back as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Registration of Potato Growers and Potato Packers Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the discussion yesterday I had almost finished my contribution to this Bill which we all agree is very necessary.  I had drawn attention to the position obtaining in the market, the need for proper presentation of our products and to make sure that our potatoes were packed and presented in a proper manner to comply with the wishes of the housewife who is the final judge and arbitrator in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated also that it was perhaps a bit late to bring in this legislation but nevertheless, better late than never, because we can see from our mistakes in the past that this is very necessary.  All of us have <Col N="823" /> had experiences of rotting potatoes presented in the market, soil and stones and such things also included, and we realise that that is not good enough in this day and age.  It is necessary to have our ware presented in a proper manner.  If this legislation assists in that area then it is very welcome.  There is no reason why we could not produce as good potatoes as they can in any other part of the world, because our climatic conditions are suitable.</P>
    <P>We consume a large amount of potatoes each year.  In fact we have the highest <i>per capita</i> consumption in Europe, and for that reason, even in the home market, there is a lot of ground that can be made up.  There is no reason why we should have to import £27 million worth of potatoes every year.  That is the situation we are faced with and that is why we have to encourage our people to buy Irish and certainly to buy potatoes.  We need more than that.  We cannot depend on people's patriotism, because they also have to get value for money.</P>
    <P>I believe the legislation the Minister is introducing will help in some small way to correct the anomalies.  There are a few things that can be done, I suppose, as this legislation is put through and we can monitor the problems and corrections can be made.  It is very important that grading standards be applied at all times by the Department.  Those standards were introduced some years ago but they were never really applied rigidly.  Maybe if they were it would be better, but there were various reasons for that.</P>
    <P>It is very important that those standards are applied.  We should make sure that anybody who is breaking the law as regards the presentation and packing of potatoes is brought to justice, because people who break the law and present bad products are giving a bad name to the producers and to everybody else.  We all know that in every industry there are cowboys who are prepared to make a few fast bucks and get out.  The man who sticks at it year after year and who has the confidence to invest in storage and machinery has to be encouraged.  By and <Col N="824" /> large they are good, sound, honest farmers who are there to make a living out of it and who do not want to see any infringements of the regulations.  I hope the Bill will help in some small way to improve the quality of potatoes presented. If we can get rid of this £27 million that we are paying out this year for the import of potatoes we will be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to say that I welcome this Bill proposing the registration of potato growers and potato packers.  I feel it is appropriate to compliment the Minister of State for the untiring work he has put into the compilation of this Bill.  It is not today or yesterday he has addressed himself to what was a very obvious need but yet one that did not get attention until recently.  I know the Minister of State has been concerned about this for some years, and since his appointment he has been very active in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said yesterday, essentially the objective of this Bill is to co-ordinate the efforts in the whole area of potato production, processing and marketing.  There is need to include in that whole co-ordination process the position of individual producers, those who assemble potatoes, merchants and any others concerned directly or indirectly with the industry.  This is essentially the core of the Bill, and it is something that is to be lauded very much as we set about to co-ordinate the effort in the levels of production, processing, marketing and also to co-ordinate very clearly and very precisely the functions and the involvements of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point that needs to be stated and was referred to yesterday by a speaker is the standards of our potatoes.  It is only fair to place on the record that the standards of our potatoes are extremely high in many instances but they are not identifiable. They are not on record, and lack of registration is one of the reasons that leads us to believe that standards are not as good as they actually are.  At present there is an obvious need to do something, as the Bill proposes, in the area of <Col N="825" /> storing, packing and grading of potatoes. There is little point in having a good product if that particular product is not packaged well and stored well.  One finishes up with a very deteriorated product if the area of packing and storage is not attended to very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that surveys had revealed that 50 per cent of potatoes have not adequate storage facilities, that is at least on a long term basis, and it is the long term basis that counts.  This obviously leads to very serious wastage.  Unfortunately we have in the potato industry, as we have in many facets of agriculture, a major fluctuation of production.  This causes problems and demands that we have a positive and very definite programme to combat that fluctuation.  In one year we can have massive supplies and massive returns of potatoes which will sell in the market at very poor prices while other years we will have short supply situations and very high prices obtaining.  That happens from year to year but unfortunately a similar situation can happen within a season.  It is a positive argument why we need the degree of organisation that is inherent in this Bill, which I hope will get the full support of this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to the importation of potatoes.  I subscribe to the idea that we must cease to be importers of potatoes and strive to be exporters of that crop which we can so ably produce.  In 1982 we imported £25 million, in 1983, it was £17 million and in 1984 the estimate is £27 million to £28 million.  These figures are excessive, unwarranted, and they are figures we should not have for potato imports.  It is a crop we can produce well having regard to the suitability of our soil and climate.  There is no reason why those figures should apply.</P>
    <P>EC membership brings with it free trade in the area of potato sales.  We must be geared for those situations and must be conscious of that factor.  Until 1980 we were protected from open competition. We must recognise that.  This is best done by producing the right article, packaging it and presenting it well.  Poor quality potatoes militate against doing something <Col N="826" /> positive.  We must take a hard look at varieties of potatoes and examine the varieties that package well, store well and can be presented well.  We have plenty of knowledge not alone in the area of potatoes but in other products too that an article that looks well will appeal to the customer and will sell well.</P>
    <P>We have not addressed ourselves in any serious fashion to have meaningful research done into consumer taste.  This applies to consumers of all goods.  It applies very definitely to potato consumers. We do not have to set up grandiose new organisations for this purpose.  We have the agencies in the institute, ACOT, the Department of Agriculture and other agencies.  Their resources should be harnessed and they should be given a direction to go out to the market place and find out what type of potatoes the consumer wants.  The same would apply with other products.  In the case of potatoes, which we are concerned with this morning, this needs to be done.</P>
    <P>We should strive to produce what the market wants rather than what we have been doing so far, trying to market what we produce.  I emphasise &ldquo;trying to market&rdquo;.  We have set about marketing whatever was there.  The day has come when we must make certain that what we are marketing is something that is produced in the knowledge that there is a demand for the product.  That could not be over-emphasised.  We must never attempt to take any aspect of potato production in isolation.  We must consider the entire scenario from the producing side to the time the actual potato or in its processed form reaches the consumer. Any reorganisation, recognising that we can produce the potatoes, must be done on a commercial basis.  There is no point in doing this on any other basis because it will not have any results.</P>
    <P>There are a few areas that need to be emphasised.  Grading is very high on the list.  If we do not have proper grading of potatoes we will not get anywhere.  One should emphasise strongly the question of presentation.  We are not good at this. We must present the article well.  Producing the article and packaging it well is <Col N="827" /> very important, but if we fail to present it well a lot will have been lost.  I have already referred to varieties.  There is an amount of work to be done to make certain that we have the varieties that meet the requirements of the people.</P>
    <P>We have the co-operative society which was formed in conjunction with the Irish Farmers Association and the ICOS.  There are 12 co-operative societies within that framework.  It is a very positive, progressive move where not alone have we proposals before us but there is something positive on the ground.  It will bring about very radical changes.  There are FEOGA grants to assist in the development of this.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that those who grow ware potatoes and package them must be registered.  There would then be available a clear and true record of potato producers. Eighty-five per cent of potato packers are also potato producers.  The overall framework of the new development must be kept right.  There is no room for weak links in the chain.  I am confident that under the direction of the Minister, Deputy Hegarty and his Department this plan can and will succeed but the overall framework must be kept right.  Over the last number of years the level of production of potatoes has changed dramatically. Over the last 45 years or so the area of production reduced from roughly 140,000 hectares to approximately 45,000 hectares.  That is a dramatic reduction, in a comparatively short time.  At a time when we need very positively to develop the agricultural industry, that decline must not be allowed to proceed any further.</P>
    <P>As I have said, not alone must we eliminate imports of potatoes but we must set about becoming significant exporters of this crop and, in the process, relieve significantly the balance of payments deficit which at present is of serious consequence.</P>
    <P>Potatoes are part of the total food import bill of £800 million which has been so often referred to in this House and in other places.  A sizeable proportion of this can <Col N="828" /> be replaced by home produced products. The figure £300 million, has been freely used.  That amount of total replacement can be obtained right across the board in human and animal foodstuffs.  This would be a major alleviation of our balance of payments problems and would provide enormous additional employment.  I am convinced that that area, which has been referred to in recent times by the Minister must be explored.  We must not leave any stone unturned.</P>
    <P>In the potato area very obviously improvements can be made but horticulture and production of animal feed and the entire food industry can be revamped to the degree where we produce at home what we are at present in fact, importing. It is economically very unhealthy that we have this huge food bill, that we continue to talk about it but unfortunately so far we as a nation have not found it possible to do anything positive about replacing substantially the massive imports of about £300 million per year.</P>
    <P>There is the question of added value. We must ensure that production is nationally beneficial.  I appreciate that there are occasions where the economic benefit of the country and of the individual may conflict.  Diversification must be examined very closely in regard to potatoes. The same, indeed, would apply to all other food that we produce here.  It would apply to beef, our dairying products and so on.  Added value must be a central part of any sort of future plan.</P>
    <P>In a free and open market competition we are importing potatoes from Holland, Cyprus and other countries.  We must make sure that the standard of the imported product is right.  There is no point in our insisting and correctly so, on standards for the home product if we allow inferior goods to be dumped on the Irish home market.  We must demand the highest standards possible for imports.  I am confident that if we do our job right we will not have imports.  In the eventuality that we have imports standards should be applied to them.  <i>Vis-à-vis</i> potato production, we have a suitable climate and outstandingly good seed, good research <Col N="829" /> facilities and very good advice are available to growers.  A combination of all these factors will give results.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister yesterday to the fact that the demand for this type of reorganisation of the potato industry came from the ground.  That is essentially true.  The Minister was being a bit modest in making that comment, because I believe that a lot of the initiative was taken by himself.  I do not think that it happened spontaneously from the ground.  Things do not happen the way they are thought to happen.  It is true to say that it will make the operation of this registration programme more workable and more possible that there was positive initiative from the ground which the Minister picked up, took on board and brought to finality.</P>
    <P>We must be sure that the product at all times looks well &mdash; and I underline &ldquo;at all times&rdquo;.  There is no point in having a sporadic show of appearance; it must look well at all times.  The taste must be correct.  If it is not correct on a limited number of occasions it is a serious matter. Above all else the keeping quality of the potato, the storing ability, must be good. I have mentioned the entire food industry and I do not want to elaborate further because we are dealing specifically with the registration of potato growers and related factors.</P>
    <P>This Bill will do a great deal for the Irish agricultural scene and particularly for the Irish potato grower and indeed, also for the Irish potato consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from an area that is noted for its crops, including potatoes, and having spent many of my earlier years as an agricultural worker, including many wet and frosty days on the potato field, I would like to make a very brief contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the other Members of the House I welcome the Bill, which is important as far as it goes.  It covers growers and packers. this is an important aspect in the whole area of potato marketing.  But I also feel that merchants should be directly covered in the Bill because potatoes <Col N="830" /> are very perishable.  For example, if they are not stored properly they can deteriorate.  If they are left without proper protection on a frosty night or frosty morning they can be seriously damaged.  This is not covered specifically in the Bill.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>It would also be important if we could determine the exact acreage of potatoes each year, because this would bring about a situation where the market would become stabilised whereas up to now we have had some years of shortage and other years of surplus, where potatoes were either very dear or very cheap. There should have been included in the Bill a method to determine the acreage. The Bill does not go far enough in other directions, some of which have been covered.  For example, horticulture could have been included.  Some years ago a local man in our town started to sell vegetables.  He had a small area of land and he found it easier and cheaper to go up to the Dublin market and buy his vegetables rather than to work his piece of land.  There is something wrong in this area.  I realise that in later years a number of people seem to have made a successful career of market gardening, but financial adjustments of some kind in the way of grants would be well worthwhile and could be well justified from the point of view of savings to the country. This is an area which could be taken in under adult education, because there are many small gardens and many plots of land throughout the country left idle.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine a couple of years ago grew potatoes and cabbage on his small farm.  He took two loads of the cabbage to the Dublin market and he could not sell it.  He had to bring it back and dump it.  It was a tragic situation that because of imports this man was unable to sell his first-class vegetables.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to imports of potatoes &mdash; £25 million worth of potato products in 1982; in 1983, £17 million and £27 million this year.  In a country where the potato over a long time has meant so much and where it is so easily grown, this is an indefensible situation.</P>
    <P>The growing of potatoes must at all <Col N="831" /> times be commercially attractive.  People allegedly became wealthy through growing potatoes.  We do not hear of the many people who lost quite large amounts over the years.  Potato growing should be done on a scientific basis.  There could have been included in the Bill, provisions in respect of the proper crops to suit our climate and the proper crops for the various areas of the country.  I could list a whole range of potatoes which I have known over the years.  Harvesting and storage are most important and could have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to improve the quality of the domestic supplies of potatoes reaching the market. Like the other Members, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer will probably benefit more than anybody else from this Bill.  Up to now the consumer has been suffering as a result of inferior products, both domestic and imported.  The housewife particularly will welcome the fact that there is some order being put into the area of producing and packaging potatoes in Ireland.  Although the merchants, as Senator Fitzsimons said, are not included as such, the process of registration and control of the grower and the packager will be a protection in respect of the merchant.  Certainly the consumer will be the final tie up in the final situation.  It is totally unaceptable for an agricultural country that we have an imports bill of £27 million for potatoes. This is a national disgrace.  The potato can be effectively produced in this country and there is a market for it.  The total figure of about £800 million of food imports probably includes many things that we could not possibly produce ourselves. The facts will be known shortly because ACOT have undertaken the production of statistics of what can be produced in this country.  I commend ACOT for their efforts in doing that.  The sooner that is done by ACOT the better the industry will be able to face the problem that they have of ensuring that our land is used to maximum benefit for potato <Col N="832" /> production.  There is a market there for it.  I commend the Minister for at least putting some order into the situation. At the moment potato production is so haphazard that it is a disgrace and allowed of major imports.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill.  When it is in operation we may see some defects and anomalies. I am sure the Minister will keep his mind open in this regard.  The Bill is a major breakthrough and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their worthwhile contributions.  They were all of a positive nature.  One point I would like to make is that maybe people were expecting more of the Bill but we are really registering growers because under the 1977 Food Standards Act which my predecessor, Mr. Gibbons, introduced in 1977, we have gone well into detail with regard to the actual standards required that the potato should be whole, clean, sound and unsprouted and within certain grades.  In practice, it is spelt out quite clearly.  In the case of pre-packs it has to be between 20 and 60 millimetres, in the medium package it has to be between 60 and 80 and in the large it has to be 80 plus.  In the 25 kilogram you are allowed to mix one and two, that is, between 40 and 80. The rules are there but the difficulty has been to pin down the people and that is what this Bill is all about: to be able to trace the source, the culprits.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ferris when he says that the consumer will benefit.  The consumer, for the first time, will be given a real choice of a first class home grown product.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey made particular reference to the fact that we do have &mdash; of course we have &mdash; the best quality potatoes in the world but the problem is that we slipped up badly in our preparation and, indeed, our presentation of potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all speakers who did make the point that we will have to look at higher yielding varieties, varieties that look and hold well.  I think the housewife is switching from potatoes that have been <Col N="833" /> traditionally very good varieties like Kerr's Pinks and is looking towards Pentlands that look a lot better on the shelf.  Already, by talking about the quality and so on quite a lot of supermarkets and, indeed, people in the trade generally have come to adapt themselves to what will be fairly stringent regulations.  Here in Dublin it is quite obvious that our presentation has improved considerably, to the extent that there are some supermarkets where you can pick your own potatoes from trays.</P>
    <P>Referring to Senators Ferris' contribution again, yes of course any defects that will emerge can be put right by way of regulation.  So, that should not cause any problem.  Senator Fitzsimons was worried about the merchant not being covered.  Not directly, but they are in fact covered and they are very annoyed at the sort of coverage we are giving them. There are quite a few of these people around who buy from a packer and hand on to another packer and as the Senator rightly pointed out, the potatoes could be left on the lorry over the weekend where they would deteriorate.  Merchants handling potatoes in future will have to put their own name and address on each bag. So merchants will have responsibility under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Just a few final points: yes, the demand has come from growers and people in the business, and I refer specifically to the solid people in the business, not people who move in and out and who cause a lot of the problems.  It will bring order where chaos prevailed and now we have the IFA about to set up their co-operatives in conjunction with ICOS.  I believe already they are about to make some arrangements with the Sugar Company to take over some storage facilities in Erin Foods in Carlow where a lot of this packaging work will be done.  It is quite obvious that they are going about their business in a very businesslike way indeed.  I think the prospects are good.  The weakness is that we do not have adequate storage, and we will need all the help we can get, in the short term in particular from people in ACOT and people with a knowledge of storage to make the best use we can of <Col N="834" /> our existing storage facilities.  It is in March and April that we will have the problem from Dutch imports when our own potatoes are deteriorating, and a word of warning from me at this stage would be for farmers to try to get their crops even into open sheds and keep a close eye on sprouting on so on.  It will certainly help later in the season. There is no need for panic selling.  The year is long and, indeed, there will be a lot of potatoes needed between now and next June when the early ones come on the market.</P>
    <P>I would again thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 2 subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall establish and maintain a register of growers of potatoes and packers of potatoes to be known as the register of potato growers and potato packers and be referred to in the Act as the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if this register can be inspected and, if so, where?  Are there qualifications required in order to get on the register?  When I ask that question I am thinking about people who are not farmers at all and who have been growing substantial acreage of potatoes over the last number of years: professional people such as teachers, members of the Garda.  I have known <Col N="835" /> quite a number of those people who have in the past grown large acreages of potatoes. Can they be included on the register? Is there anything to stop them being included on the register or are there any requirements that state that those people included in the register should be farmers only?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

We will have to go into details in regard to some confidential matters that we may not wish to release.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Hussey's other point, yes, of course, anybody who grows potatoes for sale whether it is a part-time operation or a full-time occupation, will have to register.  This is the important thing: the people who are currently selling potatoes on roadside trailers and so on will also be registered and their potatoes will have to carry the registration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 7, I am wondering about the powers which the section confers on authorised officers.  The powers which this section confers seem to be somewhat similar to the powers which the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and the Fisheries Act, 1980, confer upon authorised officers.  Specifically excluded under that legislation is the right of an authorised person to enter upon somebody's garden or the curtilage of a dwelling house.  If this section is enacted as specified here an authorised officer will have the right to go anywhere where he reasonably believes the potato is grown. Am I not right in thinking therefore that he will have the right to enter upon anybody's garden or the curtilage of anybody's dwelling house?  This section gives tremendous powers which will make the dwelling house and the private property of any individual, which up to now was regarded as sacrosanct, open to the possibility that an authorised officer, warrant in one hand, can march in to inspect it.  If I am correct in assuming that to be a reasonable construction, then it is regrettable.  If I am right in saying so, then my analogy with the fisheries Acts is a reasonable one.  Under that legislation a bailiff cannot go for inspective purposes into somebody's garden or immediately around their private house.  Perhaps I <Col N="837" /> have misunderstood the section as it stands but if not I would be very worried about this power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite reasonable that officers can enter land in which we believe the potatoes are grown and packed for sale.  There is nothing unusual or sinister about it.  Our officers are concerned that the packaging complies not only with this regulation but with the food standards regulations.  The procedure is in existence already.  Officers freely go onto packaging stations, in the markets for instance. We have to do this in order to ensure that the job is being done properly.</P>

      <P>In the run up to the Bill <Col N="838" /> in the Dáil I had some discussions with my colleagues in the Opposition and my own party and there was some concern expressed, especially by Members from the Border counties.  It is a problem that is peculiar to that area.  We can cope with it but not under this Bill.  I am optimistic that we will be able to do this under the Food Standards Act, 1974 to which I have referred already.  It should be possible to include the country of origin.  Potatoes coming down here in bulk from the North could be packaged here under an Irish brand and the housewife would be deluded into thinking that she was buying Irish potatoes.  There is merit behind the suggestion and I am optimistic that we will be able to sort that out.</P>

    <Title>State Financial Transactions (Special Provisions) Bill, 1984    [Certified Money Bill]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable me, as Minister for Finance, to ensure the continued efficient operation of State financial transactions.</P>
      <P>The measures in it are such as would be reasonable to cater for any temporary disruption or threat of disruption in the public finances.  This need not necessarily be due to a strike but could be due to any other factors and it is, therefore, desirable in the widest sense that this Bill be passed.</P>
      <P>I propose now to refer to the provisions contained in the Bill.  First I wish to draw the attention of the House to two minor errors in the Bill as circulated.  In section 1 on line 22 of page 2, the word &ldquo;Exchequer&rdquo; is misspelt and in section 2 (2) (c) on line 49 of page 3 the word &ldquo;reference&rdquo; should be in the plural and the comma after the word should be omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 contains some necessary definitions.  Provisions for commencement and termination are contained in section 2 (1).  I would point especially to the provisions in section 2 (1) (a) that <Col N="839" /> before making any arrangements under the Act, the Minister for Finance will be required to be satisfied that due to special circumstances it is impossible to carry on business in the normal manner and may accordingly, in the national interest, make whatever special arrangements are deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I am responsible under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, for:</P>
    <P>the administration and business generally of the public finance of Ireland and all powers, duties and functions connected with same, including in particular the collection and expenditure of the revenues of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that it is the Minister for Finance alone who is responsible for the State's financial business. Many of the functions carried out by the Central Bank on a day-to-day basis are delegated to it for reasons of convenience. This, of course, is a reference to functions other than the statutory functions of the bank as laid down in legislation.</P>
    <P>The collection of the State's revenues and payments of the State's expenses are, rightly, the subject of careful statutory restriction.  Article 11 of the Constitution provides for payment of all the revenues of the State into a single fund, known as the Central Fund, and payments into and issues from that fund are regulated by law.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides, if necessary, for the introduction of special revised arrangements for operating the Exchequer and State accounts and for carrying out certain State financial transactions, and it is the purpose of the first important part of the Bill, section 2 (2), to provide statutory support for these arrangements.</P>
    <P>A statute which is particularly relevant in this regard is the 1866 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act.  This old statute is still the basic Act governing much of the State's accounting practices.  It sets out strict controls in relation to the lodgment of revenues to and the issue of <Col N="840" /> moneys from the Exchequer account involving the Comptroller and Auditor General in his capacity as Comptroller of the Exchequer.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been fully consulted by my Department in relation to the preparation of this legislation and that office agree with the need for the proposed legislation.  The Governor of the Central Bank has been consulted on the preparation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for my Department to consult with the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to any arrangements made and it will be the intention of my Department to provide arrangements which satisfy him.  The arrangements made will, of course, be subject to review by the Comptroller in the normal course.</P>
    <P>The only statutory function of the Central Bank affected by this Bill is its operation in relation to the Exchequer account. The Central Bank's other main functions in relation to the operation of monetary policy which includes the regulation of credit, interest rates and the management of the official external reserves and also its role in relation to bank licensing and supervision and exchange controls are not affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second important part of the Bill, section 2 (3), empowers me to postpone by order the redemption of, or the payment of interest or dividends on, Government domestic securities where I am satisfied that it is not possible to make such payments.  I regret to say that during the Central Bank strike it will not be possible to make dividend payments on domestic Government stocks or land bonds listed on the Irish Stock Exchange issued before the commencement of the strike on 3 December 1984; or to redeem domestic securities falling due for redemption during the period of the strike, where the registers of such issues are held by the Central Bank.  These registers, which include both computerised and manual systems, contain details of many thousands of accounts, and without access to the registers it is not possible to make the payments where due.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the procedure for <Col N="841" /> arranging for the redemption of, or payment of interest or dividends on, securities postponed under section 2 (3) when the situation returns to normal.  A new date for the redemption or payment of interest or dividend may be fixed by me and this new date must be within three months of the end of the strike or whatever special circumstances required the postponement.  The section also provides that interest will be payable on payments which were postponed and the order will specify the actual rate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the laying of orders made under the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas and section 5 is the normal provision for administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Bill is necessary to enable the Minister for Finance to fulfil his statutory responsibility for the administration and business generally of the public finances; to ensure that he has adequate statutory support for such temporary measures as are needed to maintain operations on the Exchequer and other related accounts and to provide for payment of interest to persons who may be deprived of interest or dividends or repayment of capital owing to the temporary inability of the Minister for Finance to ensure payments.</P>
    <P>Failure to take the proposed measures would cause very substantial disruption to the State's financial business and very considerable inconvenience, and hardship in many cases, to ordinary citizens. Even with the measures in place there could still be considerable inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as a realistic and sensible measure to ensure the continued smooth operation of the State's banking and financial business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two specific points relating to the Bill.  The first concerns the question of the postponement of interest payments on Government stock which, as the Minister has indicated, will cause hardship to vulnerable categories of people.  Secondly, I wish to refer to the problem of the management of the official external <Col N="842" /> reserves during the Central Bank strike.</P>
      <P>Regarding the postponement of interest payments on Government stocks, there is no question but that this will hit the most vulnerable people in the country, pensioners, widows, people who own small farm holdings, and all this before Christmas.  Surely some arrangement could be made to pay these vulnerable people the small interest payments on which they depend heavily for their income.  These people just cannot afford to wait for what may well be a matter of months for payment of interest on stock which they invested in the firm belief that their interest payments would be paid promptly by the State.  We must show compassion towards these people and we must show imagination in trying to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>It is usual in Central Banks abroad to have exempt staff, union members who are exempt because of certain sensitive duties they perform, like foreign exchange.  If we had exempt staff, they could handle the payment of interest to hard pressed people who depend on these interest payments for their income. There is a compelling case for exempt staff in our Central Bank to handle in particular the payment of these dividends.</P>
      <P>I want to put a question to the Minister. Has a request been made to the union concerned, the ASTMS, to exempt staff so that they could carry out this work on economic as well as compassionate grounds?</P>
      <P>Another suggestion which the Minister might consider is that members of the staff in his own Department, the Department of Finance, might take the registers out of the Central Bank and process the interest payments.  I specifically want to know the answer to my question as to whether a request has been put to the union to exempt certain staff to handle this dividend payment work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the management of the external reserves of the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is the custodian of the official external reserves which are the assets of the nation.  It is vital that these reserves are safe and that <Col N="843" /> they are still, despite the strike, being invested in such a way as to secure the best possible return for the country.  Who is ensuring that we get the best possible return on these reserves?  In other words, who is managing these reserves right now?  A drop of even 1 per cent return on the reserves, let us say for a period of four months &mdash; I hope the strike does not last that long but it could last for four months &mdash; would mean a loss of the order of £6 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that there will be a time limit to this Bill.  It is very important in any country that its Central Bank should enjoy a degree of quasi-independence. The repeal of this Act at the earliest possible moment is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a necessary response to the irresponsible actions which have been taken by the staff of the Central Bank in the pursuit of a wholly unreasonable claim, aided and abetted by the irresponsible actions of the main Opposition party.  Senator Hillery expresses the hope that the strike will not last for four months.  If the party to which he lends his affiliation continues to issue statements of support for exorbitant claims in the public service, then we can expect not only a strike in that area but other strikes of long duration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is brought in because of a strike in a State area.  Surely I am entitled to comment on the strike. I do not intend to go on at any great length, because I intend to do so next week instead.  Having made that point and having given notice of my intention to develop it at a later time, there are one or two aspects of the legislation with which I am not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery identified an area of difficulty when he said that the Bill should last for a limited length of time.  I also recognise that the Minister for Finance in his introductory speech stated that certain of these changes in legislation should be a permanent feature of our organisation of public finances.  It states in his script that it could, for example, be necessitated by a breakdown in the computer facilities or some other matter which is not necessarily associated with the present crisis.  I understand that.  I have no doubt that arrangements of a long term nature are necessary but arrangements of a long term nature should be made with due process.  They should not be made and incorporated into a Bill which is passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in an atmosphere of urgency, when the length of time when the Houses of the Oireachtas have to examine the legislation is limited.  That is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If permanent arrangements are necessary in the view of the Minister for Finance, he should come back at a later stage and put permanent arrangements to us. The appropriate way in which to do that is to have a date for the expiry of this Bill.  I will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage which will be designed to have that effect.  I will deal with the actual mechanism and why I choose the <Col N="845" /> particular way of doing it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful of Ministers, acting on advice of civil servants, proposing legislation which could be abused by future Ministers.  As I read this legislation, the Minister for Finance could decide not to pay any dividends because it was temporarily inconvenient for him. Section 2 (1), which is the operative portion of the Bill, contains the phrase &ldquo;owing to special circumstances of a temporary nature&rdquo;.  The non-availability of money might constitute circumstances of a temporary nature and if those circumstances come about a future Minister for Finance could bring into operation the procedure outlined in section 2 (1).  One of the possible effects of bringing that procedure into operation is outlined in section 2 (3).  That is the suspension of the payment of dividends and various other things that follow.  Under subsection (3) the Minister has to be satisfied that the payment of interest cannot be effected.  It does not mean it cannot be effected because of a physical problem but it cannot be effected for some other reason.  It does not say it cannot be affected because the computer has broken down or because the staff are on strike.  Maybe it cannot be effected because the Minister has not raised sufficient taxation to enable him to pay it.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that there is any possibility of that happening now or in the immediate future. We are legislating for generations that are to come.  We are legislating for a situation in 20, 30 or 40 years time when nobody here will be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people who will be looking after the financial affairs of the country are people we do not know.  I am quite sure that the present Government or, indeed, the alternative Government would not act in such a fashion.  We must lay down a proper framework.  That proper framework must consist of the examination of these matters in a non-emergency situation.  If the Minister feels that provisions like this are necessary, the Bill should be drafted in such a way as to limit its operations to a <Col N="846" /> particular period of time.  On the expiry of that period or in advance of it other legislation could be introduced to make permanent arrangements which the Minister of the time might consider to be necessary in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>We would want to be very careful about any Bill that is headed &ldquo;Special Provisions&rdquo; or any emergency legislation because this becomes a permanent part of the legislative process.  If this Bill is enacted into law it is very likely that nobody will ever look at it again until such time as an emergency of one kind or another arises.  The way in which it is drawn up is much too broad.  It is much too blunt an instrument to be given on a permanent basis to the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say that orders made under this Bill as enacted would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have never believed, nor do I believe now, that that is an effective check on the operation of the legislation which may be put to a use for which it was not originally intended.  There is nothing that can compare with the enactment of legislation in due process.  There is nothing that can compare with the issuing of a Bill with an explanatory memorandum and the allowing of a period of time to elapse for those with specialist knowledge to comment on it and to advise those of us who might be interested in contributing in the House.  Nothing can compare with that.</P>
    <P>I recommend very strongly to the Minister that he give serious consideration to accepting the recommendations which I will put forward on Committee Stage or alternatively introducing an amendment of his own which would have the same effect as the suggestion in my recommendation and the feeling behind Senator Hillery's plea with regard to the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that we are expected to pass a Bill at such short notice on an issue of such national importance.  We have not got an explanatory memorandum concerning this Bill and certainly I did not have time to do <Col N="847" /> any in-depth study of its implications.  It is not the first time that this House has been treated in this manner and asked to rush through very important legislation at such short notice and without having time properly to investigate all the circumstances surrounding a particular issue.</P>
      <P>The strike has been on for some time. The Minister had the best part of three weeks to alert us to the fact that he was bringing in this Bill and yet it was not done.  At this late stage I would say to the Minister for Finance to go back to the negotiating table.  The Central Bank have the right under some Act to negotiate for themselves.  The Bill in front of us now leaves the officials in such a state that there is no scope for normal negotiation. I say to the Minister &ldquo;go back to the negotiating table even at this late stage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will not refer to the strike any more.  Senator O'Leary is right in one remark he made, that this legislation could and probably would be left on the Statue Book permanently.  I suggest to the Minister that the Bill have a limited life, perhaps until the end of March, 1985.  In the meantime, I would like the Minister to let the House know exactly where he stands with regard to official quotations for the value of our money in the EMS. I understand that a commercial bank will be delegated certain functions and the functions that will be delegated are not functions &mdash; the Minister will probably agree with me &mdash; that would normally be <Col N="848" /> discharged by the commercial bank.  We will have a problem with stocks and dividends that cannot be paid, and I think the Minister should be straight with the House and let us know will payments from the Exchequer account be affected by this legislation &mdash; I am sure they will be &mdash; and what effect that will have when the Budget is presented.  Will it show a false figure &mdash; as it certainly can &mdash; and in this respect we are entitled to know if the Minister has a vested interest in bringing forward this legislation at this particular time.</P>

      <P>I just rise to support this legislation and to compliment the Minister for his quick and decisive action in bringing it forward and in ensuring that the members of the public who obviously would be involved will not have to suffer adversely, especially coming up to the Christmas period and the time of the year when they are due their dividends or interest.  It is encouraging to find that the Minister has, without any great delay, grasped this nettle and ensured that innocent persons will not suffer inconvenience and loss, especially, as the people at the root of the problem could be described as some of the fatter cats in our society. It is unfortunate that these things happen, and I hope that the machinery provided for solving these problems will be helped to reach a solution that is agreeable all round.  Emergency legislation like this is never good, and I agree with Senator O'Leary that there should be a time limit on it.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the previous speaker: it is not unusual and certainly over the years we have had many occasions in the House where various bits of legislation were introduced on an emergency basis because they were necessary for the common good at that particular period.  It is always welcome to find the Oireachtas taking decisive action and showing that the ordinary running of the State will continue as smoothly as possible.  For that reason, I want to compliment the Minister for tackling the problem and I hope that the necessity for this legislation will be short lived.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I would like to say that I share the views of Senator Lynch.  The Minister has said that the measures in this Bill would be reasonable to cater for any temporary disruption or threat of disruption of public services and that these need not be necessarily due to a strike but could be due to many other factors.  In a sense, this is very important legislation which will go on our Statute Book and I believe that we have had insufficient notice; indeed the short notice is not in keeping with the importance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As well as the items listed by the Minister in his introductory speech I would also say that it is a big drawback that at the present time there is no accurate assessment of the currency exchange rate.  I simply want to say that I share the views and reservations of my colleagues that we have not had sufficient time to consider this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to say anything on this legislation because I realise that it is a piece of emergency legislation.  I must accept the Minister's opening speech when he said that he was introducing it for specific reasons that need not necessarily be as a result of the disruption of the public finances due to any particular reason.  The Minister mentioned the strike in the second paragraph. He mentioned that this legislation need not necessarily be due to a strike but could arise out of any other situation, which is the point Senator O'Leary was talking about.  There are other situations, physical and mechanical, which could create a situation where the interests of the common good could be at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is accepted by all sides of the House that in this particular instance, the people who are due to receive interest payments from State guarantees and State investments are now, through no fault of their own, suffering as a result of the inability of the Central Bank because of certain considerations to pay out what is rightfully due to these people.  The Minister rightly, in the interests of the common good, and in view of the responsibility imposed on him by statute <Col N="850" /> in the Constitution, with that overall responsibility, deems it appropriate that in certain circumstances he would be enabled by legislation or otherwise by an order in this House to perform his functions.</P>
    <P>I would not read any more into it and, as a trade unionist, I would not want to have read into it that this is in fact some heavy-handed action on behalf of either a Minister of a Government or anybody else which would interfere with the constitutional rights of trade unionists to negotiate, actually to serve a notice on their employer, actually to go through the process of discussion, negotiation, conciliation, arbitration, the Labour Court and in fact strike action, if that is what they wish to do.  That is the constitutional right of any worker.  I am glad that I can never envisage the day when people would be precluded from exercising constitutional rights.  That is the argument that Senator Hillery was making when he rightly asked was it possible that there could be some people at a certain level, in the public service particularly, who would be excluded.  It would not be a new phenomenon.</P>
    <P>There is already a class of people in the public service who are precluded, in the overall interest of the country, from taking strike action.  I think that is appropriate. There are certain sections of public servants that the general public could not do without.  I suppose because of that privilege they are exceedingly well paid.  That is the compensation for always having to be available in the public interest. It is appropriate that people should be compensated for that.  There are times when the public would not accept that legislators who are very important in this context should be treated in that way. That is one of the problems we have to contend with in view of the public image we have.  I would regard this legislation as of a temporary nature.  Safeguards are envisaged in the Bill in which any orders arising out of it would be laid before the Houses and could be rescinded by the Houses if it was considered by Members that it was not in their common interest that such orders should be made by the <Col N="851" /> Minister or any future Minister because of the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern about the common good arising out of the present situation in the Central Bank.  We have talked about investors and depositors and people benefiting from State guarantees and loans.  Another section will possibly suffer arising out of this.  I would make a plea, because of their special position in society, that social welfare recipients who anticipated that at Christmas, by decision of the Minister, they would benefit by a double payment will not be disappointed, If any action of any group of people would preclude that from happening in that sensitive area, I would appeal to those concerned to make a special effort to facilitate people in that category.  They are at this time of the year under stress and strain with finances to cope with the holiday period.  I am making a genuine plea here.  It is not made in any way disregarding any case that anybody might have for a betterment of conditions.  They should think of those much less privileged than themselves.  I commend the Bill. The Minister has acted responsibly in coming before the House with his thoughts on the subject and I support this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Members of the House for the remarks they made about the Bill and the questions that they have asked, which reflect the concern that I have and the concern of the House generally.  It goes without saying that I would much rather not be in the position where I have to come before the House with a Bill of this kind.  However, given the situation that has emerged, I think the House would agree that there is no option but to have measures to deal with the situation.  The question then, of course, is which particular measures are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, respond to the concern of Members here as far as it is possible to do that.  Senator Hillery was worried in particular about the postponement of interest payments.  That is one of the larger areas of concern in this matter.  In <Col N="852" /> response to this specific question, to my knowledge the ASTMS has not been asked to exempt staff.  That is something which I will consider, together with another suggestion that was made to me yesterday which I have equally considered. I feel at this point &mdash; and Senator Hillery may not be entirely a blank page on this particular matter &mdash; that it might be a little counter-productive to suggest that staff of the Department of Finance would go down to the Central Bank and take away the register.  It is not practicable since a large part of the registers are computerised.  The computer staff in the Central Bank are out at the moment.  The Senator will agree with me that people who do not know what they are at, if they are trying to take out information that is normally used in the computerised system, could do more damage than good, even if they were to succeed in taking it out.</P>
    <P>As far as the management of the external reserves is concerned, that is being done by those of the staff of the bank who are not on strike, the Governor and a number of the senior staff members of the bank who, I would have to say, have shown a very considerable dedication to their work in this difficult period for them.  They are ensuring that the central statutory functions of the bank continue to be carried out.</P>
    <P>For example, I would mention that the normal detailed controls of the Central Bank on the operations of the Exchequer account are not possible.  We have global controls in operation at the moment. Those controls and the issuing of the global amounts are carried out strictly in accordance with the total amounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General's credits. Detailed daily statements of issues from the Exchequer account are being provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General by my Department, rather than by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I may have misunderstood Senator Lynch but if I may say so in an uncontentious way I thought it was most extraordinary to find a Member of the House suggesting that in some way I had a vested interest in bringing the Bill forward at this <Col N="853" /> stage and asking the question whether the budget would show false figures.  Really, that is downright scandalous.  It is certainly not in keeping with the dignity of this House that a question like that should be asked.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been fully consulted on the measures that have been put forward.  He retains his proper functions.  This State has been very well served down through the years by successive Comptrollers and Auditors General and I have every confidence in the present holder of that office to continue in that position.  So, the House need not worry if any worries are there about that particular aspect of the situation in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>In relation to the operation of exchange controls, the Central Bank have had to increase the authority given to banks in certain areas in the operation of exchange controls.  We have encountered no major problems so far.  I am quite happy at the moment that that matter is being dealt with as well as it can be in the circumstances.  On the foreign exchange market, operations continue to go smoothly. the operations on the market are being monitored by the bank. Monetary policy equally is primarly a matter for the Central Bank.  They continue to be in a position to control and monitor overall banking liquidity.  So there is no immediate problem in that area.  The normal reporting procedures that are required from the licensed banks continue to be observed.  The Central Bank have available to them the credit information that is necessary to assess ongoing developments.  From that point of view the statutory functions of the Central Bank which are not affected by this Bill &mdash; only a very limited part of the Central Bank statutory functions are affected by this Bill &mdash; continue to be carried out by the bank.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the matter of putting a time limit to the Bill. I would like to deal with that matter, first of all, by reference to the provisions that are in the Bill.  Senator O'Leary was particularly worried about the business of having on a permanent basis an Act which <Col N="854" /> allows emergency measures to be taken. I refer Senator O'Leary, and indeed Senators Hillery and McDonald who expressed worries in this regard, to section 2 (1) which sets out the circumstances in which the Minister may make arrangements:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied that, owing to special circumstances of a temporary nature, it is not possible to do any one or more of the following, that is to say, to operate the Exchequer account in accordance with the provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, to operate a State account or to carry out any other financial transaction on behalf of the State, he may, if he believes that it is in the national interest to do so,...</P>
    <P>That limits very strictly the circumstances in which the orders covered by this Bill can be made.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the provisions in the Bill which provide for the making of orders in these circumstances, and while the Minister is satisfied that those circumstances prevail he will make orders which come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary expressed the view that the mechanism provided by orders is not an effective check on measures that have been taken.  I would beg leave to differ with the Senator on that matter.  I think it is a matter of fact that in most cases orders made are perhaps not as closely scrutinised by the House as they might be, but I would think that that is probably more a function of the content of the order, the subject matter of the order, rather than a feeling on the part of the Houses that the orders themselves are not very interesting things and therefore do not require attention.  I certainly take the view that orders of this kind &mdash; which personally I would be reluctant to introduce in the first place, if the circumstances did not oblige me to do it &mdash; would probably attract a great deal more attention and much closer attention than most of the orders that come on the Order Paper of the House.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, the Houses may annul an order by the procedure that is laid down, so that if Members of the <Col N="855" /> Houses so wish we could indeed have a very close scrutiny of the matters set out in the order.  Having said that, I would be prepared to reflect on what the situation might be after this particular difficulty has passed and quite prepared to give consideration to the possibility of inserting a certain suitable provision into existing legislation that would meet this particular problem, although I am bound to say that I cannot see at first glance if that would make an enormous difference. It seems to me that if we were to insert in an appropriate piece of legislation provisions that would allow something like this to be done it would still be necessary to operate on the basis that in certain restricted circumstances the Minister would be empowered to make orders for certain things to be done and we would be back with the same sort of formula, the application of it being defined in restrictive terms as we have in this Bill.  I cannot see, as I said, what great difference would be made by resorting to a method like that.  I hope to consider those matters, and if another way can be found to make a provision I will certainly like to do it.</P>
    <P>I cannot, therefore, see the particular utility of limiting in time the application of this Bill since we do not know what the time span will be of the present problem. It is conceivable, and I certainly hope that this will be the case, that I would be in a position long before 31 March to cancel or withdraw the order. It is equally not beyond the bounds of possibility that the problem could last for longer than that, so that wherever we face a terminal date for the Bill we would have the problem that we might on arrival at that terminal date have to have the same discussion again.  I cannot see that there would be any great advantage in doing that particularly when, as I said, the order is to give effect to the provisions here and will come before the Houses and will have to be the subject of scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the main points made by Members of the House.  I would ask your indulgence for my temporary absence; I had to move a motion in <Col N="856" /> another place and I got back here as quickly as I could.  It was no discourtesy to the House, I think you will understand the exigency of the situation.  I would like to thank again Members for the concern thay have shown and I assure them that both in regard to the difficulties dealt with in section 3 of the Bill and the regret that the Bill is necessary at all in the first place, I fully share the concerns expressed this morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 28, <Col N="857" /> after &ldquo;Whenever&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, before the 12th day of December, 1985,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to deal with the problem of making the legislation of a limited duration but doing so hopefully in such a way that it would not affect anything which might be done in the present circumstances. The purpose of the recommendation is not to have the Bill cease to have effect on 12 December, 1985, but to have the Minister capable of making new orders from that date, but, of course, not affecting existing orders.  In the event of the strike continuing beyond 12 December 1985 the ministerial orders made prior to that date which would have continuing effect would remain effective, but the Minister would not be empowered to make additional orders as and from that date without seeking additional legislative approval.</P>
    <P>The way in which I sought to introduce that was to introduce after the word &ldquo;whenever&rdquo; an additional clause &ldquo;before the 12th day of December, 1985,&rdquo; and that would then mean that whenever before 12 December 1985 the Minister was satisfied, and so on.  So the Minister in considering the present situation, can be quite happy, he will have the opportunity of considering all the relevant difficulties that could arise.  He will have 12 months to consider them in the present situation, 12 months to arrive at the decision which is contained in subsection (1) of section 2 and he would have 12 months to, shall we say set in train the procedure to be followed in the event of this strike lasting for more than 12 months.  At the end of the 12 month period if the Minister felt that it was necessary to have a permanent piece of legislation on the Statute Book to cater for an emergency, well then he would be entitled or enabled &mdash; of course he would be empowered &mdash; to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and have a permanent piece of legislation enacted.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to Second Stage said there might not be much difference between the permanent legislation and the temporary piece of legislation.  That might well be so but there would be one <Col N="858" /> very significant difference in so far as the Members of this House are concerned. We would have had the time and the opportunity to consider the matter and to persuade ourselves that it was right and proper that the proposed legislation was the minimum that was necessary for the preservation of the public order and public good.  We would have had the benefit of such expertise as we had available to advise us and that the various imponderable and the various different possible interpretations of the various sections of this Bill could be discussed in a public way over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Ministers find it very difficult to understand why Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas do not automatically accept what they say.  We are not at the birth of the Bill, we do not get the explanatory memoranda &mdash; I am not suggesting we should &mdash; we are not involved in the cut and thrust of the Bill as the Minister and his officials decide what should or should not go into the Bill.  I have no doubt the Minister got a number of drafts of this Bill and he made contributions before submitting it to his Cabinet colleagues. His Cabinet colleagues took their opportunity to look at it and made further recommendations.  That is a continuing process which is educating any Minister with regard to any legislative provision before the House.</P>
    <P>We do not have the benefit of that.  We arrive in Dublin on Tuesday morning and we are presented with a Bill which we did not even know would come up.  I am not complaining about that as that is the way things are.  We are presented with a Bill in an area which we might have a nodding acquaintance with.  We have not the benefit of the expert advice the Minister has.  It takes time, not because we are any less intelligent than the Minister, to get on a voluntary basis the advice the Minister gets on a professional basis. That is why I am against emergency legislation becoming a permanent part of the enactment.</P>
    <P>It is not that I do not think the Minister has done a good job.  Ministers, 99 per cent of the time, do an excellent job and they come up with good legislation.  The <Col N="859" /> more you examine it the more you come to the same conclusion as the Minister came to because you are going through the same problem as he and his officials went through.  It is our duty to go through that process.  We do not have the facilities to concertina the time.  For that reason it is very important that legislation which is introduced to deal with an emergency situation should be of limited duration.</P>
    <P>We must get an opportunity to educate ourselves.  The way I propose to do that is to introduce what I hope is an effective recommendation, between the words &ldquo;whenever&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 28 of section 2 (1) to insert &ldquo;before the 12 day of December 1985&rdquo; so that the Minister will be limited in the period of time in which he can decide that these special circumstances of a temporary nature have arisen but he will not be limited up to or even beyond the 12th day of December 1985 in respect of any orders which he might have made in respect of a determination which took place before the 12th day of December 1985. He would not be limited.  It would be possible for him to make an order next week, put it before the Houses of the Oireachtas and have it approved.  It would be possible if the strike went on after 12 December 1985 but it would not be possible for the Minister to make a fresh determination that there are special circumstances.  The orders he had made would continue to have effect until he reached the further determination that the circumstances have changed and he can revoke them.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of my recommendation. It is very limited.  It is done in a spirit of being helpful to the Minister on the one hand but also putting forward the point of view that Members of this House are entitled to a period of time to examine technical legislation of this nature.  It is very important that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, whether they support the Government or the Opposition, insist on this action.  We are there as the sounding boards of the public, we are there to give our points of view but that must be an informed point of view. <Col N="860" /> We cannot be expected to have that informed point of view instantaneously.  For that reason I move the recommendation which has been circulated.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point about the scant treatment that certain Bills get in this House.  I accept the urgency of this particular Bill.  I am disappointed that there was not an explanatory memorandum.  I agree entirely with Senator O'Leary's remarks, especially in the case of a technical Bill. It is impossible to assimilate the Bill in the time available to us.  We cannot come up with an informed point of view.  We certainly cannot give it adequate treatment. A few weeks ago we had the Protection of Employees (Employer Insolvency) Bill.  We got one day to deal with all Stages of that Bill also because of the urgency of providing the benefits under that Bill to people in insolvent companies.  I want to make the point that that Bill was in the Dáil for several months and there was no good reason for its delay in reaching the Seanad.  I want to conclude by asking the Minister that in the case of Bills under his jurisdiction, while accepting the urgency of today's Bill, he will do everything possible to exercise his influence so that this House can conduct its business properly and can contribute properly to deliberations on legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last sentiment expressed by Senator Hillery.  I am perfectly convinced of the need to have proper scrutiny and supervision of Bills in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was certainly my impression yesterday in Dáil Éireann and today in Seanad Éireann that this Bill got anything but scant treatment from Members on all sides of the two Houses. The issues in the Bill have been very quickly identified and very closely examined by both Houses.  However, that is probably a gratuituous provocation on my part of Senator Hillery.  I do not wish to be contentious in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary said his recommendation would take away from the Minister <Col N="861" /> for Finance the power to make a fresh determination after the date which he has mentioned.  I honestly cannot see what addition that is to the situation.  The only reason the Minister for Finance would not wish to make a fresh determination would be that the problem continued up until that date and any orders made would remain in force until the Minister judged under the provisions of the Bill that the situation had changed.  If on the other hand the situation had changed and in the meantime the Minister, acting under the provisions of section 2(1)(b) decided to cancel the order if another situation then arose, whether it was before or after 12 December 1985, I would have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas with a new order which the Houses could annual within 21 sitting days so that there would be scrutiny of any further measures taken.  Equally, there would be scrutiny of the reasons why the Minister did it, the circumstances that led to it and exactly the same kind of discussion would take place as we are having now with the same concern being expressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides the mechanism for dealing with an emergency situation but it requires the scrutiny of the Houses on every occasion when the Minister thinks those circumstances arise.  As I said earlier, I will consider the possibility of treating this matter in a different way by adding appropriate measures into existing legislation if I can find an appropriate place but it will still come up against the requirement that we will have to have emergency measures that have to be given effect at a particular time.  The mechanism we have here is the proper one.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary said that he is against emergency legislation being part of a permanent corporative legislation.  If we write provisions into an Act that is already there &mdash; that is what we are doing &mdash; the logical conclusions from that is that there is no way out of having a permanent provision in the light of the emergency measures to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably <Col N="862" /> did not understand what I said.  I probably did not explain it properly.  The purpose of introducing the date, 12 December 1985, is to allow the Minister to make whatever determinations are necessary with regard to the present system.  Viewing it realistically, the dispute will be over by 12 December 1985 so the Minister is giving himself plenty of time.  Whatever determination or whatever action he considers to be necessary with regard to the present dispute he can make that before 12 December 1985 in the way provided in the Bill.  What we do would render this legislation null and void beyond 12 December, 1985 except in so far as circumstances which arose before 12 December 1985 are concerned.  In other words it would allow the Bill to be repealed without the Minister saying he is repealing the Act.  The danger about repealing the Act and putting in a section repealing it is that you could have a continuing emergency situation operating after the date which you put in and the date of the repeal.  If you just repeal all the Act you would have a <i>lacuna</i>.  The idea of doing it this way was to allow such emergency situations as exist on 12 December 1985 to continue but not allow the Minister to make any fresh determinations and to force him to come back and to put permanent pieces of legislation on after due consideration.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to a permanent piece of legislation to deal with emergencies. I object to a permanent piece of legislation to deal with emergencies being passed in an emergency way.  I understand that a permanent piece of legislation to deal with emergencies is necessary.  But I do not think such legislation should be passed in the atmosphere or in the time frame which a particular emergency allows.  It should be passed when there is no emergency.  Then, let us come in and let us consider the question and examine how the Minister should deal with the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that 12 December is in is, on the one hand, to have a date beyond which the Bill would not be operative. The Bill would cease to be operative on 12 December 1985 with the exception of <Col N="863" /> determinations which the Minister had made of emergency situations which arose before 12 December 1985.  They would continue to be dealt with by the various orders that had been made by the Minister.  In that way the legislation is limited, but giving the Minister a complete hand in dealing with the present problem even if it lasts beyond 12 December 1985.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary has illustrated his concern very clearly by saying that what he is against is the notion that emergency legislation should be dealt with in an emergency.  I conclude from that that the question of dates or orders or indeed permanent legislation is not what the Senator finds objectionable. There is not a great difference between the Senator and myself on this matter.  It is accepted that we need a measure to deal with possible emergencies.  The limits of ministerial ingenuity are such that very often you will find that it is not until a difficulty arises that you can conceive of the possibility that that difficulty might be there.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary was excessively modest, and perhaps the limits of ingenuity of Members of Seanad Éireann are wider and more generous than of those who are Ministers.  It is in the nature of an emergency situation that very often you do not foresee it before it comes.  If we have a permanent piece of legislation it will have to make the same kind of provisions, broadly speaking, as we have in this.  If we were to follow a line which either made it impossible to make new determinations under the provisions of this Bill or which, under another thesis, caused this Bill to wither away after a certain point and another difficulty arose, we would have to come back to this House and have the same kind of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that I would, very shortly &mdash; I hope when this strike is over &mdash; consider again the insertion into appropriate existing legislation measures that would allow us to deal with this kind of situation.  I cannot imagine at this point that they will be any different from this and I cannot <Col N="864" /> imagine that they will contain anything other than the kind of procedure in relation to orders provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise that the Minister or his advisers cannot be expected to have legislation on the Statute Book to cater for every emergency situation. I also accept that emergencies arise that nobody thought of before and which give rise to demands for legislation of this kind.  I understand that.  I am seeking to establish that when that situation arises the emergency legislation which is introduced deals with the particular problem. If in addition to dealing with the particular problem it is felt necessary to make permanent arrangements for the <i>lacuna</i> in the law which has been shown up, that should be done as part of a different exercise.  It should not be done as an integral part of the emergency legislation. It should be done as part of the permanent legislation.</P>

      <P>I share the hope of the Minister that this strike will be over before 31 March.  The Minister drew our attention to section 2 (1) (a) limiting the circumstances in which this Bill will apply.  I am not clear about this. Can the Minister give us an assurance that the Bill will not apply from the day the strike is over?  The provisions of the Bill should be terminated as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Whenever at a time when the provisions, or any of the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section are in force the Minister ceases to be satisfied as aforesaid, he shall, as soon as may be thereafter, make an order appointing a day (being a day not later than seven days after the day on which <Col N="865" /> the order is made) on and from which the provisions of those subsections are then in force shall cease to be in force and the said provisions shall cease to be in force as on and from the day so appointed.</P>
    <P>Once the circumstances set out in section 2 (1) (a) cease to exist the Minister, then ceasing to be satisfied that the measures are required, makes an order to cancel the measures in force.</P>

      <P>The Minister in response to the question I raised about the effective management of the reserves and ensuring the best possible return on them, indicated that the Governor and other senior staff of the Central Bank are now carrying out that function.  Is the Minister satisfied that this group, hardworking as they obviously are, are large enough and competent enough, in terms of expertise, to ensure that the best possible return is being achieved in relation to the national reserve, in other words the same type of return that we would have expected from the people who handled this function before the strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of a discussion that I had with a colleague of mine only yesterday about a situation that arose in a particular strike when a friend of his objected to certain measures being taken.  He said, &ldquo;If you were sitting at home one night and the electricity was cut off by a strike would you sit there in the dark or would you light a candle?&rdquo;  It appears that in the kind of difficulty that we have now, the situation that we have before us, we make the best use we can <Col N="866" /> of the resources that we have at our disposal. I have not discussed the matter with the Governor and I do not know if he would say that exactly the same job is being done in all of these areas that would be done if the other staff were not on strike.  I am totally convinced that the best job possible is being done in the circumstances but I cannot answer the hypothetical question as to what kind of job might have been done if there were a strike but all the people who manage the reserves were not on strike and were back in their places.  All I can do is to assure the House that the best job possible is being done in the circumstances. To some extent, the Senator may be exaggerating a little in regard to the complexity of the job that has to be done.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any anxiety about the possible losses?  I am really talking about the management of the fund and the huge sums we are talking about in terms of the return of those reserves.  I cited the example that if we take the national reserves as standing at £1,800 million at this point then my case was that if the strike lasted for four months and through inadequate staffing and expertise a drop of 1 per cent less was received on those reserves that could amount to a sum of the order of £6 million. We are talking about very large sums of money.  That gets us back to the competence and expertise of the people who are handling the reserves and securing a return on them.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention something which I mentioned on Second Stage, particularly in view of the Minister's undertaking at the end of this period of difficulty to examine the permanent features of this legislation.  I would like him to think what this sentence actually means.  Section 2(1) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied that owing to special circumstances of a temporary nature, it is not possible <Col N="867" /> to carry out any other financial transaction on behalf of the State he may...</P>
    <P>We understand what the rest of the sentence means.  It could leave future Ministers for Finance a very convenient way of getting rid of their statutory obligations.  I ask him not to shake his head and indicate he disagrees with me.  I am not asking him to agree or disagree with me.  I am asking him to think about it in the review of the legislation.  I am happy that it is a very wide provision, I cannot say definitely what it means but it is a wide provision. I would like the Minister to be satisfied that it does not include the circumstances which I outlined on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the Senator's invitations to me to listen to him and not either to agree or disagree with him, I must tell him that I disagree with him, particularly as in the remainder of the section we have references to the involvement in the whole affair of the Comptroller and Auditor General who, whatever may be the temptations that come in front of the Minister for Finance at any particular time the Comptroller and Auditor General has a very different function and he must be satisfied in this regard.</P>
      <P>To Senator Hillery I say I would be anxious that our reserves be properly managed.  There is a little more to it than the considerations Senator Hillery mentioned.  I can assure the Senator that I am not in a state of constant nervous agitation about the reserves.  I am quite confident that given the resources that are now available to deal with that problem, we are getting the best possible result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at subsection (2)(a) of the section he will see it is the duty of the Minister to consult with the Comptroller and Auditor General, not to take his advice.  It is like consulting with the Council of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If we follow through the Minister's analogy that you light a <Col N="868" /> candle when you do not have electricity, I hope that the senior team in the Bank of Ireland, are not like a candle but rather that they are as good as the electricity supply so that we are, in fact getting the best possible return from these national assets.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's promise to consider the question of investigating the possibility of exempt staff from the ASTMS to handle the payment of interest on compassionate grounds.  I would like to ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that he will pursue that line of inquiry with the utmost urgency.  After all, the payment of dividends, especially coming up to Christmas, is of crucial importance to these vulnerable categories that I mentioned, elderly pensioners and so on.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about computerisation and the difficulty of people coming in from outside to handle the computer in that regard.  There is reference in the Minister's speech to some of these being manually operated still through the registers as a fall back, but only as a fall back.  I would like the Minister to pursue the possibility of payment of the dividends on a manual basis through the registers.  I would be exceptionally keen that, as a matter of the greatest urgency, the possibility of exempt staff be pursued and that the union be asked on compassionate grounds to meet the requirements of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will, I am sure, be aware that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels on Tuesday a package of measures concerning the harmonisation of legislation in the veterinary and agricultural sectors was adopted.  This package included some decisions which had been taken at the previous Council in June of this year.  One of those decisions relates to the ending of certain derogations from the provisions that applied to trade in live animals and fresh meat both within the <Col N="870" /> Community and externally.  Those derogations were granted as a temporary concession to this country and to the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland at the time we acceded to the Community.</P>
      <P>Straightaway I would like to emphasise that while these derogations will cease with effect from 31 December 1984, we will have until 1 October next year to adapt our legislation and formulate administrative procedures to enable us to adopt the EC systems for intra-Community trade and trade with third countries in live animal and fresh meat.  This interval means that there will be no immediate changes in our import procedures and we will have nine months in which to put all necessary arrangements for careful operation of the new regime in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will, I think be helpful to put the changes I speak about in context by giving the House some background on the foot-and-mouth derogations which this country has had since we joined the EC in 1972.  As I mentioned, at that time Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland were permitted, by way of temporary derogations, to retain national rules on imports of live animals, cattle and pigs, and fresh meat as a protection against foot and mouth disease. For us, this concession arose because we were free from the disease for many years and had maintained a policy of not vaccinating our livestock.  This policy and our long freedom from the disease meant that our herd was totally susceptible to the disease.  Other member states had had numerous outbreaks of foot and mouth disease over the years and had resorted to a policy of vaccinating susceptible animals as a protection measure.  It was therefore conceded at that time that Ireland should not be immediately exposed to the danger of importing diseases by having to dismantle its import controls on live animals and fresh meat.  It was very clear, however, that this was purely a temporary concession pending an improvement in the disease situation in the other member states which would obviously greatly erode the risk for this <Col N="871" /> country when the derogations would end.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease has long and rightly been regarded as one of the worst calamities that could befall the farming industry in a country like ours which is so dependent on agriculture and on agricultural exports.  We have had a long standing traditional policy of blanket prohibitions on imports of animals, with the exception of pedigree animals under quarantine, or fresh meat.  From the moment Ireland joined the Community, the days of that absolute policy were numbered.  The temporary derogations we obtained on accession were attacked relentlessly by other member states and indeed by the EC Commission also.  The derogations were seen as an unjustified negation of the free trade principle and as being excessively protectionist.  The position in regard to foot and mouth in other member states has improved enormously in recent years.  Moreover any such isolated outbreaks which have occurred have not been linked in any way to trade in animals and meat.  The other member states are quick to point to these facts.  They point also to Britain where, despite its large imports of meat, from places like South America where foot and mouth disease is much more common, there has been no outbreak in the past 15 years except one which was attributed to wind born infection from France via the Channel Islands.  This particular one occurred and was contained in the Isle of Wight.</P>
    <P>The derogations were extended by the Council on four occasions &mdash; in 1976, 1982, December 1983 and for the last time, for six months, in June 1984.  For the reasons I have mentioned each extension was resisted more vehemently than the previous one, and as already indicated the most recent extensions were secured only with very great difficulty and then only for shorter periods and on an increasingly restrictive basis.</P>
    <P>While the ending of the derogations will mean that we will no longer be able to prohibit imports of live animal and <Col N="872" /> fresh meat, we will nevertheless be entitled to certain guarantees which will minimise the risk of importing disease.  For example in the case of live animals, the permanent system will still enable us to demand rigorous testing and quarantine conditions for livestock imported from other member states.</P>
    <P>As regards fresh meat we will, of course, have to face the prospect of trade with other members of the Community. Here too we will be entitled to certain guarantees in relation to maturation and deboning until 31 March 1987.  For the information of the House, what maturation is is that immediately after slaughter a chilling process takes place which in effect does away with any bugs in the meat.  In other words, even if there was some problem with it this particular maturation ensures that the meat is safe. After that date, in the event of an outbreak of the disease anywhere in the Community we can immediately invoke the Community's emergency measures to prohibit or restrict imports from the member state or from the region concerned. Any imports that do arise will be supervised.  We will, for example, be designating the specific ports or points of entry through which such imports may be effected.  We will be seeing to it that the practice of non-comminglement will be observed&mdash;that is that imported material will not be allowed to come in contact with meat or products destined for export.  These and other general arrangements will be put in place over the next nine months.</P>
    <P>I should say that our cattle prices here are, in the normal course, at levels which should make the Irish market unattractive to continental exporters of meat.</P>
    <P>In so far as imports from third countries are concerned we will continue to benefit from arrangements under which we need not import from South America, South Africa or Eastern Europe where exotic foot and mouth disease is endemic.</P>
    <P>As regards our exports to third countries, particularly of meat, the Ec Commission have given solid assurances that our full participation in the intra-Community trading regime will not impair our <Col N="873" />&ldquo;white list&rdquo; status <i>vis-à-vis</i> our major export outlets such as USA, Canada, Japan, etc.</P>
    <P>Another important element of the agreement reached was the extension of the Community's Emergency Fund to cover outbreaks of all types of foot and mouth disease.  Community funding will now be available for compensation &mdash; 50 per cent of the cost &mdash; for the eradication of the first 20 outbreaks in a country. This financial underwriting by the EC was insisted on by us as a prerequisite for the ending of the derogations.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the guarantees, already mentioned, which we have succeeded in obtaining under the permanent Community trading system and to the arrangements, legislative and administrative, which my Department are now proceeding to formulate in relation to post-importation supervision and control procedures, we can be very optimistic that Ireland's long history of freedom from foot and mouth disease will continue unbroken.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a Community system &mdash; this is very important &mdash; we would have faced a free-for-all system with no rules applying.  That would be a recipe for disaster leaving us much more vulnerable to risky imports and more importantly leaving us open to artificial restrictions by other countries seeking to restrain trade, our trade, on one kind of spurious ground or another.  What we have now is a balanced regime supported by guarantees that will afford good protection, the facility to act quickly if danger threatens, financial support if we should face an outbreak, and a system which allows trade to move within those safe conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the ending of derogation for live animals and meat is the right decision, because cattle and meat exports account for a major part of our national income.  Any concession of our national prohibition measures in favour of the Community regime would be serious.  I am not satisfied that the safeguards built into the Community proposals are adequate to project Ireland's <Col N="874" /> disease-free status.  There are compelling arguments for the continuation of the trade derogation in the absence of adequate protection for Ireland's unique foot and mouth free status.  It is very important that until such time as the other countries in the EC reach the standards we have attained, then we have a genuine case for continuing the derogation. We know what it has cost over the past 20 years to try to rid our national herd of TB and brucellosis and we still have not got rid of the problem.  We have been very fortunate over the years that with the exception of one or two cases, we have been free from foot and mouth disease, which is a dreadful disease and which has created problems for any country which had the misfortune of having foot and mouth disease among its heards. We must do everything we can to keep our country free from that disease.</P>
      <P>When we joined the club, in this case, the EC, we must abide by its rules.  It is obvious that eventually those rules will be tightened to ensure that we are brought into line with the other member states.  Ours can be cited as a special case because we depend so much on exports of cattle and meat to Europe, North Africa and so on.  It is really more important for us than for any other member state.  For that reason we are entitled to demand an extension as far as possible of this derogation.  Nevertheless, it is obvious that it is going to come.  At that stage all we can do is try to make sure that everything possible is done to protect our national herd and to keep foot and mouth disease out as far as it is possible.  I am sure that the Minister and the Department will make every effort to ensure that that is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IAOS and the CBF have made submissions to the joint committee.  I have been reading some of the arguments put forward by them in support of the extension of the derogation period.  They have put forward some very compelling arguments.  I am sure the Government have taken account of those arguments, because the CBF and the co-ops are the people who understand the problem.  I would urge the Department of Agriculture <Col N="875" /> to look at the views expressed by the IAOS and CBF.  Perhaps there is something there that could be of benefit to them in protecting our national herd against foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>This decision is inevitable.  Seeing that we have got the derogation up to now, every effort must be made at our ports of entry by the Department of Agriculture to ensure that our herd is kept free of foot and mouth disease.  There is the added problem of Spain and Portugal joining the EC.  Both of those countries have had a long history of foot and mouth disease among their cattle herds.  That in itself will create possibly more problems for other members of the EC and for our Department of Agriculture and the Government.  I hope for all our sakes that every effort will be made to ensure that this disease is kept away from our counttry. I also hope that the standards that we have managed to obtain in the past will be maintained in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State for his very full explanation of the procedures which it is proposed to introduce.  However, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. Those of us associated with farming and agriculture business in general acutely realise the importance of our status as far as contagious diseases are concerned.  I barely recall the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 1941.  It is suggested that it may have been only a racket, there was no foot and mouth outbreak at all. We were all very much tied down.  I was very young at the time.  When we were changing pigs from one house to a new piggery a few of them escaped.  There was a hullabaloo about it.  The LDF were involved at the time and we were sure we were heading straight for Mountjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we should have the best possible regulations.  It is a source of regret that we have not been able to have derogation continued.  It would be much easier.  I know that the Minister and his officials have certainly fought a good case to try to conserve this situation for us. Now that we will not be able to have all <Col N="876" /> the restrictions as easily as we have had for years now, does it mean that some time in the future Irish farmers will be faced with carrying out vaccinations against foot and mouth disease, and will the derogations have any effect on the restrictions that have been so effective to date in keeping rabies out of this country? Will it be possible to import any kind of pets or dogs?  Are they allowed to come in and go out quite freely or is there any tie up between those two?</P>
    <P>On the question of Northern Ireland, I take it, even though the Minister has not said so, that the derogations are running in tandem and what goes for this part of the island will also obtain in the Six Counties.  If we have vaccination, it is an important point to know who will foot the bill.  Will farmers be expected to pay for this service or will it be a new scheme comparable with the bovine brucellosis scheme which has been so effectively dealt with over the last number of years?  Do I take it that it will now be necessary for the Department to have a new section dealing with this aspect having regard to the importance of our disease-free status to the country?  Does the Minister envisage setting up a new section in the Department to look at that or will it come under the animal diseases section that seems to be under such pressure at the present time from the veterinary council and the veterinary union on the question of proposed changes which, I might say, I do not agree with?  As a farmer I would jealously guard the right to nominate the veterinary surgeon of the farmer's choice in dealing with my own livestock.</P>
    <P>It is all right to look at this report and to say that Seanad Éireann takes note of the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Ireland's Foot and Mouth derogation &mdash; that is very simple &mdash; but what will the effect of that be on the ordinary farmer?  I will accept when the Minister said so, that they have fought for an extension of the derogation. They have done quite well.  From my knowledge of the workings of the Community I am satisfied and understand that <Col N="877" /> these things cannot last forever.  It is important that farmers should know what these changes will mean to them financially, especially by way of additional cost of vaccination and also the kind of machinery that would be set up to do that whether the Department are going to extend their own veterinary section to carry out vaccinations if they are necessary or if they are going to make some deal with the veterinary council to have it done on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more at this stage except to assure the Minister that their efforts in these regards in order to safeguard the national herd will have the support of all the farming members of both sides of this House, as every successive Government who have worked in this area have enjoyed in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the speech of the Minister of State which sets out the position very fully and frankly.  I do not welcome this foot and mouth disease derogation which comes into effect at the end of this month.  I am sure nobody else in the country will welcome it either.  The position seems to be that as we are a member of the Community we must accept this situation.  I am under no illusion about the tragedy that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would cause. I remember in my youth an alleged outbreak. At that time all the crossroads were manned by the local defence forces. Everybody would realise the tragedy it would be to an agricultural country like ours, if there were an outbreak.  I am satisfied, however, from what the Minister has said that we have inbuilt protective measures which we can rely on.  As he stated, Community funding will now be available for compensation, 50 per cent of the cost for the eradication of the first 20 outbreaks in a country.  This is most important and very welcome.  The Minister stated that we will now have a balanced regime supported by guarantees which will afford protection with which he is satisfied, the facility to act quickly if danger threatens, which I think is very important and as I said, the financial support <Col N="878" /> which is also very necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not welcome the situation.  Nevertheless, in view of what the Minister has stated I do not think there is any need to have great apprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ideally if we lived in a perfect world we would like to see a continuation of derogation.  We would all be very happy.  The matter could be very well summed up in the last paragraph of what the Minister said, that in the absence of a Community system which is now envisaged and proposed here it would be a free for all position and we would be at serious risk of having a chaotic position thrown upon us.</P>
      <P>The other point I would make very, very clearly is that in 1972 when joining the EC we knew that the protection we had enjoyed was going to end.  It was a matter of when.  We have succeeded over the 12 years since in getting derogations.</P>
      <P>The very important thing that I would conclude by saying is that we must monitor on a very regular basis the whole progress of the new situation.  By that I mean that we must have our finger on the pulse at all stages, whether to do with the importation of live animals, meat or whatever, and if there is the slightest indication of any risk whatsoever of this terrible disease approaching our shores because of any changes that are introduced, then the matter would have to be taken up once more at EC level.  In the meantime I am satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister, realising that outside the Community or without the Community rules and regulations which obtain here, we would be in a far worse situation and knowing that, in fact, this is part and parcel of being part of a greater Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I would like to thank Senators for their helpful contributions and their understanding of the reality.  Even from a business point of view the more protection we can get the better, but at the same time we are satisfied that our safeguards are adequate.  Animals in quarantine can <Col N="879" /> be blood tested and go through even more stringent testing but it is apparent that these would be pedigree animals. Quarantine would cost over £1,000 per animal, so basically we would be talking about pedigree animals that would have to go through very stringent testing.</P>
      <P>We will never agree to vaccination.  We will maintain our own disease free status and we will not accept animals that have been vaccinated.  Part of our testing in quarantine will be to ensure that they are not vaccinated and we will have to get guarantees in advance.</P>
      <P>The rule with regard to rabies still holds in relation to dogs or any other animals. This applies to cattle.  Northern Ireland is following the same line as ourselves. Quarantine and all the other procedures will have to be paid for by the people who are trying to import pedigree animals. This will be dealt with by our veterinary section and by our animal health section.</P>
      <P>Senators Hourigan and Fitzsimons rightly pointed out the importance of ensuring that we maintain the controls. We have achieved another nine months to look at every possible aspect of how we are going to look after our inspections and our quarantine rules.  Everyone in the Department is happy that we have taken adequate steps and that we are getting the co-operation of members of the Community to ensure disease free status.  Senator Hourigan rightly pointed out that the alternative is that we would be thrown to the winds and would lose all disease free status.  This involves a very important factor that we did not dwell on, our right to export to certain countries that insist on disease free status.  Of course we are watching this very closely.  In my youth I heard my parents talking about an outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the troubles we had in the area at the time.  I share the worries of the Members but I am satisfied that we are protecting ourselves adequately.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of developments in the European Communities since January 1984.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Ferris)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak mainly to item No. 6, even though it has been agreed to debate motions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.  It is somewhat difficult to speak in the absence of the customary six monthly report on the developments within the EC, so I would like to range casually over a whole series of items, many of them well publicised but some which have scarcely gained any recognition whatever in the public media.</P>
      <P>One of the immediate results of the tragic famine in Ethiopia has been to focus the attention of everybody on EC food policy.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate our Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, on the exemplary manner in which he handled his role as co-ordinator of EC aid for the famine-stricken victims.  The need for a fully integrated food policy has become very obvious.</P>
      <P>Recently we have had the long and tortuous but fruitful negotiations with regard to the super-levy problem in order to handle surplus dairy products within the Community.  It is quite obvious, however, that with surpluses in beef and cereals we are also talking about levies in these areas.  Indeed, we can justifiably predict that they are literally just around the corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may argue from the standpoint that it is far better to have to contend with this surplus situation than a shortfall. One must consider that the cost of storing the butter mountain of one million tonnes <Col N="881" /> amounts to £720,000 per day, just for storage alone, coupled with something in the region of £1 million to keep our beef stored in intervention.  The whole scale of the problem is put very much into perspective.  While we may laud the exercise of giving cheap butter at Christmas time to everybody, I do not think it is seriously addressing the problem.  While it may sweeten people's view of the European Community it is certainly nothing but a stop gap solution which in the long term will probably de-stabilise the market by breaking the generally even pattern of consumption.</P>
    <P>While there are glaring deficiencies in the EC relief effort we must say in defence of the EC that its relief effort has been going on for a very long time.  I would point to last April, for example, when the European Community approved over £57 million for a programme to combat drought and famine in Ethiopia. Again, it devoted further finance for the arid sub-Saharian regions further south in Africa.  Yet, this substantial cash funding got very little attention and precious few headlines from our EC correspondents. I would blame the journalistic representatives of the main papers in this country who are our representatives in Brussels for not focussing sufficient attention on the degree of ongoing assistance which has been forthcoming from the Community for famine-striken areas and by way of positive development of their own resources.  Generally, the cause of the lack of exposure and the lack of publicity could be put down to the fact that there were more immediate and pressing and more exciting negotiations going on at that particular point in time &mdash; last April &mdash; when our super-levy negotiations were in full flight.</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental problems of underdeveloped countries is that we dump EC surplus food production on world markets and in doing so we undermine their traditional economies and their self-sufficiency programmes.  In Europe, for example, we subsidise hothouse producers of fruit and vegetables which would grow quite naturally in the <Col N="882" /> climates of these underdeveloped countries whose industries are destroyed by the big trading blocks, particularly by their trading policies.  The EC, for example, has continued to increase its sugar production despite the repeated warnings that it is the staple crop of many of the economies of these underdeveloped countries.  For long the Development Committee of the European Parliament has been warning that the EC's food aid programme is destroying the self-sufficiency of the Third World.</P>
    <P>However, here we must draw a distinction between the long term strategy of granting aid to develop agriculture in the poorer countries and the immediate need to get urgently-needed relief to the starving millions.  A problem that has emerged very clearly from the most recent famine and one that will have to be addressed for future such contingencies is the absolute necessity of mobilising aid far sooner than has happened on this occasion or on previous occasions.  Many people die before we are even aware of the famine.  Many more die in the stricken areas because we are unable in the initial stages to get little more than a trickle of food to the starving victims.  We are talking literally of thousands dying by the hour as a result of such delays.  It is a situation where every hour counts.  I would make the point that if Berlin could be relieved for a considerable period by airlifting supplies on a constant daily basis by the Western allies then surely it is possible for us to do so in Ethiopia 40 years later.  Surely it is within the competency and capability and the resources and potential of the armed forces of Europe who have the knowledge, the manpower, the aircraft and the technology to do so immediately that such an emergency arises no matter what part of the world it arises in in the future.</P>
    <P>We are now reaching the crucial stage, it has been acknowledged, in this particular tragedy because the initial response, despite the fact that it was enormously heartening and enormously generous, is very much tapering off, and it is quite obvious that the momentum must be maintained for a period of six to nine months if we are even to contain the <Col N="883" /> problem at its present level.  I do not want to be accused of morbidity in my contribution but I will continue briefly in much the same vein by stressing that the recent pesticide tragedy in India has helped to focus attention on the use of pesticides and chemicals in agriculture within the European Economic Community. One welcomes the commitment of the Minister for Agriculture to the introduction of a Pesticide Bill.  We have the problem in many EC countries where the disposal of animal manure has become a tremendous problem, just as great a problem, in fact, as the overuse or the abuse of fertilisers.  In the Netherlands, for example, the nitrate levels in ground water is now 30 milligrammes per litre and although the World Health Organisation standards are 50 milligrammes per litre it is estimated that, at the present rate of increase, within a decade much of the land of the Netherlands, unless emergency measures are taken, will in fact not be usable for the production of food for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Cadmium &mdash; which is heavy metal &mdash; levels in soil are increasing, again at an enormous rate due in many cases to sewerage, sludge, potassium and fertilisers. At this rate, again, it has been estimated that within a century or so the arable lands of Western Europe would be no longer suitable for the production of crops for human consumption.  When one considers that Western Europe contains only about 7 per cent of the world's arable land and that it uses about 25 per cent of the world's annual consumption of pesticides and 17 per cent of the fertilisers used globally, it can be seen quite clearly that there is an urgent need for the development of criteria for the usage of both pesticides and fertilisers.  It is a Bill, therefore, which is urgently needed, there is nothing like prevention and indeed at EC level it is quite obvious that there will have to be integrated pest-management control procedures and regulations.  Environmental alarm bells were also sounded quite recently in the extensive damage done to the West <Col N="884" /> German forests.  The damage in these traditionally very famous forests of Bohemia, Saxony, the Black Forest region, has increased from 8 per cent in 1982 to 34 per cent last year, mainly caused by air pollution.  Again, this highlights the need once and for all for pollution-free cars and the development of technology in order to minimise the effect of pollution and emission from such cars and combustion engines.</P>
    <P>On the lighter side, I would like to stitch into the record of the House my particular welcome for the additional £90 million of EC regional funds which have been made available for the creation of 5,500 jobs.  We note with considerable satisfaction that these will grant-aid the development of three new digital exchanges together with 23 rural subscriber units, and, furthermore, that this money will be needed for the development of our national primary routes and our national secondary routes in order to bring our standards of main route traffic and roads up to comparable EC standards.</P>
    <P>From the Government's viewpoint one of the most heartening aspects has been the EC Commission's Economic Report and its endorsement of the Government's economic strategy.  In particular the Commission's report underlines, approves, endorses and encourages the Government to maintain this policy in two particular areas, and that is in relation to pay restraint and public sector cuts.  It is nice that the people who ultimately are the people funding many of the operations here should be the people that would be in a position to call the tune. While there has been a fair degree of scepticism and a fair degree of criticism and indeed many scathing and derisory comments in relation to the Government's economic policy, the period of the development of our economy up to the emergence of the <i>Building on Reality</i> plan was a very, very fruitful period.</P>
    <P>The Government, in fairness, were not in a position to launch forth with any kind of a plan unless it had got basic component items of the economy right. <Col N="885" /> Inflation has been cut to almost a third of what it was two years ago.  Our balance of payments has been on the right side for 11 out of the last 14 months.  We had managed to decelerate the growth in unemployment and consequently as a result of these initiatives are now in a position to launch forth with an economic plan costed, itemised, with definite objectives and realisable targets within specified deadlines.  It is that type of positive achievement and that type of positive planning that has won the endorsement of the EC Commission for budgetary policy and economic strategy.</P>
    <P>I conclude as I commenced and that is by congratulating the Taoiseach on his handling on his EC Presidential term.  It was a period of difficult and at times of traumatic negotiations, but it was a period which was rounded off in a most exemplary manner, a most fruitful and thoroughly rewarding manner in the historic achievement in relation to agreement on wine and wine-producing states. When one gleans from the various Heads of State their reaction by way of very fulsome praise for the handling of matters by the Taoiseach, one sees very much in perspective the esteem and the respect with which he is held as a European and as a European statesman.  It is most refreshing for a very tiny country, both in terms of size and in terms of population, that we should be able to discharge our function at the apex and pinnacle of EC affairs with such satisfaction and win such fulsome praise from quarters from which it is very often not so readily forthcoming.  I compliment the various Ministers who as heads of their respective portfolio groupings within the EC have performed their tasks and fulfilled their stewardships, again with considerable confidence and with considerable results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, a Sheanadóirí, tá áthas orm bheith in bhúr láthair.  I am glad of the opportunity to address the Seanad on this motion which is of such importance to us all.  I do not need to remind the House that we are going through a very difficult period at the moment.  I will avail of this opportunity to say a few words and I hope you will not think I am straying too far from the subject of the motion involved: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of developments in the European Communities since January, 1984&rdquo; when I review the Irish Presidency.  There are three weeks to go yet and there are some very important Councils, including one which is taking place in Brussels at the moment, <Col N="887" /> before we conclude the six months of our third Presidency of the European Community since we joined on 1 January 1973.</P>
      <P>I will digress here to say a little bit about the Presidency.  The more you examine the European Communities in their founding and the rules that were laid down for their governing over the past 25 years, the more you come to admire the founding fathers who laid down these rules.  It often struck me before I assumed the Presidency that the period of six months in which the affairs of a large complex is conducted is far too short a period.  When you think about it, at the end of six months you come to the conclusion that in fact the period was deliberately chosen to ensure that no one country or no one individual in any country could make claims for a period in office that did not take account of the lead-up to that period and the subsequent following through of whatever negotiations took place afterwards.  This was a very wise decision.  It also ensured that every country, both big and small, had an equal responsibility at set periods for managing the Community.  We assumed during this six months added responsibilities and were in effect the board of management for the entire Community during that period.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must also say that when we assumed office there was a certain number of things in train.  The second direct European elections had just taken place.  There was a new Parliament in session.  A very significant series of summits starting in Stuttgart in June 1983 coming through Athens in December 1983, Brussels in March 1984 and Fontainebleau in June 1984 had all taken place and all had made contributions which I hope we have added to in our Dublin summit in early December this year. They had all made their contributions to this thrust forward that we all recognised and which indeed was reflected in the low poll in the European elections in June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is something that this House, this Parliament and indeed all Parliaments in <Col N="888" /> the Community, should have seen as a warning.  They should have seen red lights flashing at the low turn-out of the poll in June of this year.</P>
    <P>The Summit at Fontainebleau very quickly saw that because they sensed the disillusionment, the slow-down of the machinery of the Community that was taking place, as a result of the disillusionment amongst the ordinary public in all the member states.  They reacted very quickly to that situation when they set up the two <i>ad hoc</i> committees.  One of them was set up to look into the actual functioning of the institutions of the Community.  That is presided over by a Member of this House, Senator Dooge, and it is working extremely well.  It has had a number of meetings and did send, through the European Council in Dublin a fortnight ago, its first interim report and that has since been published.  If they have a chance to look at that I think Senators will agree that the businesslike manner in which they have addressed their tasks and have promised to complete their work and present their final report to the next Summit in Brussels in March is an indication of the seriousness and the sense of urgency which was transmitted to them from the Fontainebleau Summit and cannot but redound in a positive way to the benefit of the Community.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the other committee, the People's Europe Committee &mdash; a novel idea, strange in itself but again the idea was born of the low turnout in the European Elections &mdash; is functioning well. There is no doubt that the lack of interest by the voters of all ten member states of the European Community indicated a sense of distance between themselves and the institutions of the Community; a sense of distance between the reality of their own existence and their perception of what was taking place in Brussels.  That was something that had to be addressed in the second committee to which also an appointed member on behalf of the Irish Government was Mr. Eamonn O'Toole, the Assistant Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Its fundamental task is making the European Community <Col N="889" /> more relevant to the ordinary people in Europe.  I believe that the work of those two committees when completed will give that kind of incentive, that sense of &ldquo;these are our institutions&rdquo; to the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>There are many other difficulties facing the Community but these are very important because they relate to the ordinary people and also they relate to the machinery of governing Europe.  It is certainly in the interests of the people of Ireland and the Irish Government to see that it runs as smoothly as possible.  We said in July, when the Taoiseach first addressed the European Parliament, that we would assess the priorities in contributing to a solution of problems then facing the European Community.  We picked out a number of these in particular. First was the problem of enlargement. Secondly, was the conclusion of the third ACP-EEC convention.  Third is the solution for the 1984 budgetary problem and fourth the establishment of these two committees which I have already spoken about.  I am glad to be able to say that those two committees in fact are now established and they are both working very efficiently.</P>
    <P>As regards enlargement, Spain and Portugal applied to join the European Community in 1977 and negotiations have been going on on a stop-go basis since then.  The political decision was taken in Brussels in March that negotiations should be completed by 30 September 1984, and so allow accession to take place on 1 January 1986.  It became very clear to us in the course of the Presidency that in fact that date of 30 September 1984 was extremely ambitious and that a lot of the necessary work that needed to be done could not possibly be completed in that timescale and that it would be very difficult to complete before the end of our Presidency.  The major chapters that needed negotiation between the two applicant states and the Community had hardly been touched on. There were negotiations between the ten member states to try to reach a common position on all matters that must be negotiated <Col N="890" /> between the applicant countries and the Community.  This involved the chapters on social affairs, high tariffs, fisheries, agriculture, wine and none of these had been brought to conclusion or near conclusion when we assumed office. So we had to set about trying to get results as far as possible.</P>
    <P>We immediately drew up a new calendar, put in a lot of extra Council meetings, foreign affairs Council meetings, to try to get a common position within the Community so that we could present it to Spain and Portugal in November, we hoped.  We also had a whole series of negotiating sessions with the Portuguese and the Spaniards during the last six months.  I, of course, in July went to both Lisbon and Madrid to have discussions with the Spanish and the Portuguese Governments and to point out to them the difficulties I saw on the road ahead and the necessity, both on their side and indeed on the Community side, to have a fully flexible approach to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I think I can fairly say, at this stage, that we have brought all those chapters up to the brink, and while it will not be possible to push them all past the finishing line, I can say that if we can push one part, they will all flow from it.  They are all linked together because it is not possible to put a position on, say, fisheries when certain states are going to have to make sacrifices on whatever is of interest to them.</P>
    <P>We are now at the point where we can get internal agreement on wine between the ten countries, on agricultural products, high tariffs, on institutional affairs and on social affairs.  I hope that when we meet again on 17 and 18 December in Brussels, next Monday and Tuesday, we will be able to get an agreement on a compromise fisheries proposal for the Presidency to put to the member states. If that is so, it will mean that in effect the Community will have achieved common positions on all these chapters during our Presidency.  That is a very significant achievement to have brought about. Bearing in mind what I said earlier about the Presidency being able to claim credit <Col N="891" /> for any progress that had been made, I should add a footnote to what I have said, and pay tribute to the sense of urgency shown and the amount of work that was done by the French Presidency prior to our term of office and, indeed, by the Greek and the German Presidencies before that again.  We can, however, fairly claim that we have now brought the negotiations to where the Community will have a common position on all the chapters &mdash; not three-quarters or 80 per cent &mdash; but on all the chapters.  Next Tuesday evening we can start the serious negotiations with the Spanish and the Portuguese Governments.  If we reach agreement then, well and good.  We have come around a large bend and we are on the last few hundred yards up to the tape at this stage, so I am quite confident the negotiations can be completed.</P>
    <P>Senators will recognise from the Community Summit in Dublin last week that there is a further stumbling block before we can actually formally complete those negotiations with the two applicant countries and that is the general reservation by the Greek Government on the form of integrated Mediterranean programmes to be put in place by the Community. These are programmes that were disagreed on amongst the member states. Proposals from the Commission were made that when the Community was enlarged to include Spain and Portugal there would be no obvious and detrimental effects on France, Italy and Greece, but particularly on Greece.  They stated that the Community should address itself to that problem and make provisions to ease the burden of enlargement on those three countries.  The commencing date for those programmes was 1985.  The community recognises its obligations on that but differs from the Greek Government on the measurement in cash terms of those obligations.  That is the present state of play in those negotiations and until that problem is resolved this remains to be clarified.</P>
    <P>There was some confusion about this last week but all the negotiations are now going ahead and can be completed with <Col N="892" /> Spain and Portugal subject to this general reservation which the Greeks state.  The Irish Government fully recognise their obligation to the Community to protect the Greek economy from the potentially damaging effects of the enlarged Community. But until that problem is resolved the actual signing of the completed treaties with Spain and Portugal will not take place.  We need agreement in March next because unless it occurs in March of next year then the accession date, which is the firm date I have in my mind and which the Irish Presidency has kept on referring to since 1 July last will not be met.  But the date of completion of the negotiations was not a fixed star in the sky; it was movable; it was 1 January 1986.  That must be adhered to for the very good reason, if not for the equally good political reason, the very good practical reason, that the new own resources which are so necessary for the development of the Community, for the continuation of policies, for the adoption of new policies to help the convergence of the economies of the Community cannot come into force until 1 January 1986 with enlargement.  They are tied to enlargement. If we cannot achieve the accession date of 1 January 1986 for enlargement then there will be no new own resources and we will have to go through another period of draft budgets and uncertainty that affect farmers particularly in the member states.  They are the first people who will feel the effects of the decision taken in the European Parliament this morning to massively reject the 1985 budget.</P>
    <P>They have a right to do that.  Parliament is one arm of the budgetary authority of the European Community.  I would have hoped that they would have seen the damage that would ensue from this, even though this is not a point of view they accept.  It is my point of view that damage will ensue to their constituents in the member countries for taking this course of action.  I recognise their right to do it, though it means that uncertainty will exist through the early months of next year, with the Community not <Col N="893" /> knowing, except on an <i>ad hoc</i>, one-twelfth basis, where its cash is coming from each month.  You cannot plan on the basis of those circumstances.  The European Parliament has taken the decision this morning.  We have to respect their right to do so.</P>
    <P>We had other budgetary problems, of course, when we resumed office.  That was the 1984 budgetary problem.  The difficulty we faced was the resolution of the short-fall between expenditure for 1984 and funds available within the 1 per cent ceiling.  In 1984 we needed bridging finance.  Fortunately, we were able to do that in September, through the agreement of the member countries to a supplementary budget to be financed by contributions from individual member states between now and the end of this year.  That problem was got out of the way.  The other two problems which I referred to when I was giving a review of 1983 was the conclusion of the negotiations between the African, Carribean and Pacific Countries and the European Community.  This is a convention which the Irish Government had the honour of signing for the Community on the previous two occasions on which it was concluded. It originally started in February 1975 and the negotiations were completed during the Irish Presidency and signed on that occasion in Lomé by the present Taoiseach.  These are lengthy, difficult and complex negotiations that have to be undertaken and they have been going on now for just over 12 months.</P>
    <P>There are 66 countries under the ACP umbrella and if I spoke earlier about the difficulty of getting a common position between the Ten member states, Senators can imagine the difficulties that my co-chairman of the ACP had in getting a common position between his 66 member states, all of whom are to be found in very much different parts of the world. The African, Carribean and Pacific peoples speak different languages and have extremely differing sets of needs. However, eventually, after a number of extremely late nights, or should I say early mornings &mdash; 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock <Col N="894" /> on two occasions &mdash; we came to a conclusion in the end of November.  I am very pleased with that because again I am proud of having the honour of signing the third Lomé Convention last Saturday in Lomé.  I had the honour of signing on behalf of the European Community on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, signed on behalf of the Irish Government.  This is an extremely valuable agreement between two groups of nations, the ACP and the EC.  There is benefit, political and economic, on both sides.  The three Conventions have developed one from the other and they become broader and deeper on each occasion.  This one is certainly a big advance.  In many ways it is flexible enough to take account of the problems of today rather than just repeating solutions for the problems that were there in 1974 and 1979, in as much as it attempts to tackle the problem of drought and the desertification in the African Continent, particularly in its present convention.</P>
    <P>The amount of money that was to be agreed was the final point on which we differed.  The fact that we have increased in monetary terms by 60 per cent, Lomé three over Lomé two, is an indication of the importance, despite the very stringent circumstances under which all governments and communities are operating, which the individual member governments attached to this agreement. This shows their willingness to make sacrifices under their own budgets to ensure that those sacrifices are not transferred on a north-south basis to the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>The one bonus we had when we came in was the very valuable ground which had been covered in this regard by the French Government, and by the Greek Government before that.  In fact, the negotiation with the ACP had commenced at the very end of the German Presidency in 1973 and continued right through the Greek, on to the French and was eventually concluded this week by the Irish Presidency.  Again I want to go <Col N="895" /> back to what I said in the beginning about no one Presidency being able to say they started and they completed that.  It is just not possible in a single Presidency.  I want to pay tribute here to the amount of hard, difficult work that was undertaken by the two previous Presidents and of course by the Commission itself under Commissioner Pisani who has now left the Commission, in bringing about this agreement that was so successfully concluded last month.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to mention is in regard to a problem which erupted during our Presidency.  That is not a fair way of putting it, because the world should recognise that long before our Presidency the problem existed.  Unfortunately it needed the stopping off by a BBC camera crew in Ethiopia on their way back from India at the end of September to show the effects of drought and famine in that unfortunate part of the world.  The problems of drought and famine are not confined just to that part of Africa.  They affect all the countries in that part of Africa.</P>
    <P>Before that film was shown, the Government had recognised the serious situation because of drought, and that famine conditions were bound to arise in Ethiopia and had instructed the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, to raise the matter in the Council of Ministers. He raised the matter in September.  As a result of the Minister of State raising the matter in the Foreign Affairs Council in September some preliminary work had been done by the Community which took an active interest in the problem.  I am pleased to say the culmination of our interest was in the European Council in Dublin last week when the Taoiseach asked for and received the assent of his colleagues and Heads of State for putting together a massive package of aid for Ethiopia and the other countries which will be affected over the next 12 months. Of course the magnificent and generous response of the Irish people over the past two months bears witness to the fact that where the need is seen the need is responded to.  That has traditionally been <Col N="896" /> part of the character of the Irish people. I am very proud of the fact that on this occasion we were not found wanting.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight, however, of the fact that the Americans and the Russians have also contributed.  Both of these countries have been extremely generous to an immediate need but this does not cure the problem.  We need to do far more than supply food when  hits a country.  We must also provide the means to allow that country to develop so that it can feed itself.  That is where the Third Lomé Convention to the ACP and the EC is so valuable.  It attempts to tackle that problem in a constructive manner and it is in place until 1990 when it will be signed again.  Unfortunately, on this occasion, because of the enlargement of the Community, it is unlikely that there will be another Irish signatory unless something happens to the machinery in the meantime.  I am very happy to have been one of the three people to sign on behalf of the Community for the Irish Government.  Even though there is still some very important work to be done we can look back with a little pride &mdash; and a little tiredness.  The six months have been productive for Ireland and for the Community also.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the attention which they always give to the affairs of the European Community and the detail with which they examine the various documents brought before them, the concern they show and their appreciation of the importance of the Community, not just as a trading bloc for this country but as a political movement.  Twelve years ago the Irish people gave a huge vote of confidence in the referendum of May 1972.  Their decision on that occasion was justified.  I believe it will be seen to be even more justified in the years to come.</P>
