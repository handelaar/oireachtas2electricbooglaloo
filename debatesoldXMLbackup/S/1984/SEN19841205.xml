      <P>I should like to apologise for the delay.  At my request the Leas-Chathaoirleach did not enter the Chamber because a few minutes before 2.30 p.m. a matter came up and the Government Chief Whip was in contact with me concerning the business to be taken today.  I had difficulty in contacting the Minister involved.  I might point out that the delay was not unduly long.  Our Standing Orders indicate that the delay is not serious until it exceeds 15 minutes. This delay was four minutes.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The successive delays over a period of ten years in the implementation of the decision to build a vocational school at Castleisland, County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be <Col N="492" /> taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and to take a break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Item No. 7 will be taken at 6.30 p.m.  There is one-and-a-half hours remaining on this Private Members' motion.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Senators, I might indicate what is being proposed in regard to the sittings between now and the recess.  It is proposed to sit tomorrow and to take item No. 8 in the morning and if it is concluded it is proposed to take items Nos. 4, 5 and 6 on today's Order Paper. It is proposed to sit next week on Wednesday and Thursday and in the following week it is proposed to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday.  If the Dáil adjourns on 14 December this will enable the Seanad, for once, to be able to debate the Appropriation Bill and not have to resort to the device of taking the Bill without debate and having a motion in the New Year.</P>

      <P>Where is the Copyright (Amendment) Bill?  This Bill came before the Seanad and was sent to the Dáil.  It had been listed for approximately six to seven weeks for discussion in the Seanad and I now see that it has disappeared completely from the Order Paper.  I know the blame does not rest with the Leader of the House.  Has this Bill been put into cold storage?  If this is so, it raises a very serious question.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House is the Minister aware that since the Copyright (Amendment) Bill was sent back to the Dáil, the Performing Right Society, who were discussed during the debate on the Bill, have raised their fees by more than 35 per cent?  I want to <Col N="493" /> inquire if the Minister has sanctioned this increase or if it has been sanctioned by the Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>In view of the strong commitment of both Governments to further the process of constructive dialogue in relation to the terrible conflict in Northern Ireland, Senators Rogers, McGonagle and I feel we should withdraw motion No. 17 for the moment at least, in the hope that this may prove helpful to the process of constructive dialogue.  We would add, of course, that we will be watching with interest the outcome of such and reserve our right to bring back that motion at any time in the future.  For the moment, we feel it would be more helpful to withdraw it in anticipation of a more constructive debate taking place over the next two or three months than we have had so far in relation to the Anglo-Irish situation, in particular with regard to the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that there are 17 items on the Order Paper today. There is not one single piece of Government introduced legislation.  Today we are to discuss two orders.  Tomorrow, apparently, the Seanad is to take note of one, two, three, four things.  I wonder why we are sitting at all and why is the Seanad wasting its time sitting today and tomorrow without a single piece of Government introduced legislation.  It is a scandal that the House is treated in this way.  What was happened to the Children Bill and to the Family Planning Bill that we have heard so much about?  There is an opportunity for the Seanad to initiate Bills and the Government calls us back today and tomorrow without a single <Col N="494" /> piece of legislation.  They have a nerve to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House whether he is in a position to confirm if the Minister for Health or his Minister of State and officials from the Department will be present for the concluding stages of the Fianna Fáil motion on cutbacks.  As you know, we were having the spectacle of hospital wards being closed and a number of services in the opthalmic and dental areas being discontinued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the closing stages of what I wanted to say.  These services are affecting the poor people in our community.  We have the shabby spectacle of another way in which this House is being treated by the Government. Last week during the debate on this motion we did not have the Minister or his Minister of State or officials from the Department for a very considerable time.  This is a very serious situation.  It is another way in which the status of this House is being undermined, not to talk of the way in which the Minister is neglecting the people I have referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery;</NameTxt>
      <P>I joined with the Leader of the House last week in deploring the rushed manner in which we had to deal with the Protection of Employment Bill.  There was not anything like adequate time to deal with the Committee Stage and no sooner had the Leader of the House deplored that action than a few hours later we had the shabby treatment in relation to the motion at 6.30 p.m.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House what specific steps he proposes to take as a matter of urgency to restore a semblance of status and order to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the remarks of Senators Smith and Hillery. I felt that the Leader of the House, with great sincerity, last week made a <Col N="495" /> very strong and pointed case about the treatment of this House.  I appreciated his remarks then, as I do now.  The performance by the Minister for Health, by the Minister of State and the Department seemed to me to arise from what the Leader had said.  In my opinion he was snubbed.  It is regretful to allow such a thing to happen.  The Senator has worked very well as Leader of the Seanad.  He tries his best to keep the Government business moving.  Senator Ross is correct: if we look at today's Order of Business and if we look at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I offer congratulations of the House to him and to the IFA for so doing.  It is far more important to this country today than the wine lake which was being talked about in other places yesterday.  I think the man brought back reality to this country.  He should get the appreciation of this House for so doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that all the legislation on the Order Paper is Private Members' legislation.  If the Government are either unable or unwilling to produce legislation, Senator Ross and I would be quite happy to have the other legislation taken today or tomorrow or next week.  Unlike the Government, we apparently can draft legislation and we are capable of introducing it and defending it in the House.  That is not to say we are anything other than grateful for the substantial amount of time the Leader of the House has allocated for one item.  There are two other items that are ready to be discussed, that are relevant to two different areas of important <Col N="496" /> policy, which have no fundamental financial implications in either case and which could usefully be discussed in the Upper House.  They are there and if the Government cannot produce legislation we would be very happy to discuss our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we are to take Nos. 1 to 3 before the break.  I presume that Second Stage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 will be given a full airing today.  If it is not completed by 5 p.m., what is the intention of the House?  Tomorrow morning we are to take No. 8 which is an important report. It is suggested that we then go back to Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  The House was given the opportunity to put those three reports together.  I suggested that the motion that was put down in the name of the Northern Senators could be amalgamated with that set of reports.  We arrived in here and on that day there were no Government speakers, apart from Senator Ferris.  We finished off at the break with three consecutive Fianna Fáil Members.  Does that indicate that there is nobody on the other side of the House who has any interest in developments in the EC, in the milk super-levy, in secondary legislation on fisheries and in the Northern question or is it that they want to drag out the business of this House, as has been suggested by Senators?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the suggestion to withdraw motion No. 17.  It was originally entered in a particular form.  It was then changed and with the support of this side of the House it <Col N="497" /> was agreed that it should be taken.  I am disappointed that we did not have an approach made to this side of the House and that it is being withdrawn, we having agreed that it should be taken.  It should have been indicated to us what would happen.  Is it reasonable to sit tomorrow? It would appear that we are going to sit to take No. 8 and that the other items are fill-in subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to deal with the various points raised.  The first question was from Senator Lynch in connection with the Copyright Bill.  The Copyright Bill passed all Stages in this House and was sent back to Dáil Éireann. I can assure Senator Lynch that I have been urging the speedy handling of the amendment to that Bill in Dáil Éireann. I was informed two weeks ago that some difficulty had arisen in regard to this Bill. I do not know the details of it but such information as I have indicates that it has nothing to do with the Performing Right Society, with that particular aspect of the Bill, or with the question of any charges. I have been urging that it should be returned to us and I will once again express to the Minister in charge of the Bill that concern has been expressed publicly in the Seanad in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the next question raised, that we have 17 items on the agenda at present and that there is no Government business proposed to be done, this is a remarkably clear demonstration of the fact that the Leader of the House cannot win.  If he does not give time for Private Members' Business, then he is criticised because he only brings the Seanad together to rush through Government business and that he does not make this a deliberative House.  Of course it was open to me that the Seanad should not meet this week.  But I wonder what would have happened the following week.  I am quite sure Senator Brendan Ryan would have been eloquent in pointing out the fact, if there was a week in which there was no Government business, that, as he <Col N="498" /> indicated already this evening, there are several private measures.</P>
    <P>The situation is that I asked the Cathaoirleach to have a sitting this week. I proposed that on the Adjournment the last day.  Might I say that there are very few Independent Senators sitting in this House when it comes to the Adjournment at the end of the day when we decide whether to meet next week or not?  On that occasion I proposed that we meet today and we are meeting largely for Private Members' Business.  And why not?  What is wrong with that if this House is to do its job?  It has, of course, a public function in regard to Government business and legislation.  When we have the time I am perfectly willing to make that time available for Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith raised the question of the Private Members' motion that we will be taking from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  The position in regard to this is that I have been informed that the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, who sat through this debate last week will attend this evening and will make a contribution to the debate.  That is the information that I have.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the slowness with which legislation is coming forward, I concur with what has been said. I can state my personal opinion that I do not think there is any Member in this House who would have been happier than I would have been to see introduced in this House one of the three Children Bills that we are supposed to be getting. I have expressed the point of view that these Bills are long overdue.  I have expressed willingness and anxiety that these Bills should be introduced in the Seanad.  What I have said privately I now say publicly.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the Housing (Homeless) Persons' Bill, this is something about which I can well understand that Senator Lanigan should ask a question.  It has been with us for a while. It should be open to Members to discuss this matter this afternoon.  Since it has been such a while since it was discussed I will mention something that I might not <Col N="499" /> have mentioned until the matter came up.  That is that I would ask permission of the House that the Minister of State be allowed to speak on this matter because such time has elapsed since the former Minister of State, now Minister for Labour, intervened in the debate.  Of course, under our Standing Orders the Minister of State has a right to address the House but it is a normal convention that no more than one representative of the Government would intervene.  I trust that the House would welcome a statement from the Minister of State, in this case Deputy Séamus Pattison, in regard to the present position.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Senator Lanigan said about the debate on the EC motion, he indicated that on a previous occasion there were three Fianna Fáil speakers in succession.  We must allow a pardonable degree of exaggeration.  The exaggeration was only 50 per cent in this case &mdash; only two Fianna Fáil speakers spoke in succession after Senator Ferris.  They were Senator Hussey and Senator Kiely. After that it passed to the Government side.  When it was next discussed on 29 November, it went to this side of the House and then went back to the other side when Senator Fitzsimons spoke. After that Senator Hourigan and Loughrey spoke in succession.  If the charge can be made that the Government were not interested in the EC on 21 November then the Opposition were not interested on 29 November.  I think if we all make a resolution that whether this motion is reached tomorrow or whether it is reached at a future date, that all sides of the House will join in a thorough discussion of developments in the EC and the future of the EC which is so vital to our country and to the Community in which we are members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask a question because the Leader of the House proposed something about the Bill I have introduced.  I would be quite happy to have a junior Minister from the Department of the Environment to reply because he would be involved with the <Col N="500" /> Department handling this legislation. Deputy Pattison is not a junior Minister at the Department of the Environment: he is a junior Minister at the Department of Social Welfare.  Therefore I do not understand what a junior Minister at Social Welfare would have to say on a matter of policy to do with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that. Senators are aware that Ireland occupies the Presidency of the European Community. Both the Minister for the Environment and the junior Minister for the Environment are engaged in Brussels today.  It is for that reason that they could not be present.  It was represented to me very strongly that the Housing (Homeless) Persons Bill should not be taken today because of the absence of both these Ministers.  I indicated that I thought it should be taken, that we could find ourselves, if we did not take it today, with Government business crowding it out between now and Christmas and we would be into another year.  Deputy Séamus Pattison will be prepared to make a statement here which will not be the personal opinion of Deputy Séamus Pattison but represents the views of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Employment Equality Act, 1977 (Employment of Females in Mines) Order, 1984</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 28th November, 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 1 deals with a proposal to make an order under the Employment Equality <Col N="501" /> Act.  I will keep my remarks brief not because I think the subject is not important but because I would anticipate that it is not a matter that the Seanad will find particularly controversial.</P>
      <P>The background to the situation is that in the past concern for the safety and health of women at work has provided a <i>raison d'être</i> for a series of protective labour regulations which perhaps not intentionally have had the secondary effect of restricting career opportunities for women.  The core legislation of this area is the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Section 14 of that Act recognises that certain requirements in four items of legislation could have had the effect of forcing employers by law to discriminate against women in employment. Accordingly, its provided that the Minister for Labour would be in a position to appeal or amend any such requirement but could do so only by affirmative order.</P>
      <P>One of the Acts contemplated by the 1977 legislation is the Mines and Quarries Act of 1965.  Today we are concerned with two provisions of that item of legislation. Section 107 (1) of the Mines and Quarries Act prohibits the employment of females below ground in a mine.  Section 110 restricts the employment of women in the mines at night.  Those provisions have outlived their usefulness.  If I can borrow the words of the 1977 legislation, it can be said of them: &ldquo;They are likely to affect or impede the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment or the promotion of equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that I am not alone in that viewpoint.  My view coincides with that of Mr. Justice Barrington and the commission chaired by him in relation to the whole area of safety, health and welfare at work.  That is the most comprehensive review of our entire safety system.  In it the commission argued very clearly in favour of a set of principles upon which an effective safety system should be based. They advanced as a key principle the idea that the system has to embrace all workers.  That report, in my view very properly, draws no distinction between <Col N="502" /> the safety and health problems of women workers and those of men and calls for the review of restrictive regulations to be accelerated.  On the basis of a review of those provisions undertaken in my Department and the views of industrial, professional and other representative bodies who have communicated to me, it is now my intention and the intention of the Minister for Labour to propose, with the approval of this House, that an appropriate order should be made under section 14 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I now come to the details of the draft order which is before the House.  In the first instance, it proposes to abolish the restriction on the employment of women at night in mines.  It then goes on to remove the prohibition on women working underground in a range of professional occupations which may require certain practical experience of underground work, for example, some aspects of management or training posts.  The categories involved include a number of areas of specialisation: radiologists, mineralogists, geologists, to name just a few.</P>
    <P>This is of some significance in the area of female students.  Female students in those disciplines may be required as part of their courses to undertake work experience and to do so in underground work in mines.  Up to now they have been effectively debarred from such experience, so they will benefit from the changes which will be effected by this order.  I anticipate that a number of Senators will ask: why this restricted approach?  Why not go the whole way? Why not remove any restriction on the employment of women underground? Let me say in advance that I see the force of that argument, but we are not free agents.  We are constrained by a convention of the International Labour Organisation, to wit, Convention No. 45 which we ratified in 1936.  That convention forbids the employment of females in underground work in a mine.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to provide that national laws or regulations may exempt certain categories of females employed in non-manual <Col N="503" /> work.  We are going as far as we are permitted to go by the convention to which we are a signatory.  If we were to remove the ban completely, that would involve us in denouncing the International Labour Organisation convention. That is not unthinkable but it is not something which we can do today.  If we were to denounce, the earliest date on which we could do that under the procedures of the ILO would be May 1987.  I am prepared to look at that between now and 1987 and the Minister for Labour and I would welcome the views of Senators on that issue.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to make an order, the Act requires consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the Federated Union of Employers.  That consultation has taken place.  Even if there were no statutory obligation to take the views of the social partners into account, this Government would do so in any event.  We have also gone further and sought the views of the Employment Equality Agency and the Council for the Status of Women.  Both of those bodies are in favour of the measure proposed. The draft order requires an affirmative resolution and I urge the House to make such a resolution today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that on this side of the House we have any difficulty in approving the order but perhaps the Minister could indicate how many females he expects to work in mines.  It seems to be a very depressed industry at present and I should like to hear his views on that.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that EC membership has brought considerable economic benefits but in turn has given rise to certain social obligations, like equality legislation.  Left to ourselves we would be very slow to make these important advances.  Legislation, however, can only go so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago in the Seanad the Minister for Labour made the point that progress in women's affairs cannot be made conditional upon some level of economic growth.  Trade unions give women's issues a low priority.  It is worth <Col N="504" /> pointing out that even in the prosperous sixties and seventies women's issues were also given a low priority by the trade unions.  More recently, despite the operation of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, progress on equality has been very disappointing.  A variety of factors have contributed to the relatively slow rate of progress.  The low priority accorded to equality problems by trade unions has contributed to this lack of progress.  This in turn is related to the exceptionally low level of female participation in their unions.  The low level of awareness among employers about their legal obligations under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, is another obstacle to progress.</P>
    <P>The relatively small number of claims on equality issues that come before the Labour Court machinery is another indication of lack of adequate action on equality issues.  Finally, there is the disturbing trend that in AnCO courses, for example, apprentice courses are composed of 99 per cent male while secretarial courses are 99 per cent female.  This underlines the traditional bias.  This leads us back to the school curricula and attitudes in the educational field.  The dominant trend is for boys to do metalwork or woodwork and girls to do typing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Employment Equality Agency.  The agency have a particularly wide brief which includes promotion and advice, research, review of legislation, enforcement, conduct of formal investigations, codes of practice and assisting individuals with equality problems.  The Agency do not have enough funds to carry out their tasks effectively.  Of particular relevance to us as Members of the Oireachtas is the Agency's role in enforcing the law in the public interest.  Successive Ministers have taken a number of initiatives to promote equality but one of the most practical means of demonstrating that the Minister and his Government are serious about advancing equality is adequately to fund the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>Work reorganisation provides another means of female participation in the <Col N="505" /> workforce.  When the Minister of State was in the House on the Hours of Work Bill, I mentioned the possibilities for work sharing as a means for promoting equality of opportunity among professional women, such as nurses, doctors and dentists.  Many of these professionally qualified women are torn between a desire to work full-time in the home rearing their children and to work full-time in their professions.  These professional women who have possibilities of securing jobs in the public service should be facilitated by the State to work halftime if they so wish.  That is a positive way in which the Government could take action in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to women and their advancement on the equality front, I fear that too often in the on-going efforts to promote equality and women's rights too little attention and credit is given to the incomparable role that full-time housewives and mothers play in Irish society. The contribution of the full-time mother to the rearing and early formation of her children who will be the adults of the future is of inestimable value and should be genuinely recognised and acknowledged at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>As I have said we approve of the draft order.  If further progress is to be made on equality the three main parties, women themselves, employers and Government, must press ahead with changes.  Women can help their cause in a variety of ways, not least by becoming more active in their trade unions and raising the level of priority for their issues.  The three largest unions in the country, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, each has a female membership of one-third of the total.  Unhappily however, the female participation on the main decision-making bodies of these organisations, namely, their national executive committees, ranges between 7 per cent and 9 per cent as opposed to 33 per cent female membership in each union.</P>
    <P>Employers need to increase their level of awareness of their legal obligations <Col N="506" /> under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and, in particular they need to adopt and implement more positive attitudes to equality.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government can certainly help by providing more urgently needed resources for the Employment Equality Agency and by helping with the updating of school curricula.  The Government can also help by constantly reviewing and amending existing legislation.  I should like to ask the Minister when we might be likely to see the proposals from the review of the Employment Equality Act which has been underway for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome and approve this draft order. As the Minister said when introducing it, there are discriminations in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  There is a total prohibition on women being employed at night in a mine and also a prohibition on women being employed underground in a mine.  The effect of this draft order will not remove entirely the prohibition for reasons the Minister has stated &mdash; our commitment to the ILO convention.  I am pleased that he is to keep that under review.  I would imagine that the ILO will be discussing it actively in the next couple of years.  The effect of this order will be to amend the 1965 Act and to remove these discriminations against women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are in a rather narrow range but for those seeking employment in the mining industry they are obviously of importance.  Not only are the provisions an impediment and a barrier to women seeking employment, but they are also a psychological barrier to a whole sector of industry.  They narrow the choices open to women and that conditions employers, it conditions girls who are thinking in terms of career choices, so the effect of an order of this kind goes beyond the specifics of the particular job.  Nonetheless I should like the Minister to give us some figures of the number of women at present who may be affected by the provisions of the order, and how many are likely to be seeking either management or training experience and who <Col N="507" /> would be able to benefit from this amending order.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the power to bring in an order of this kind to amend earlier legislation is contained in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and he is pleased to be in a position to move this order and to effect the change. In approving the draft order, I should like to join with Senator Hillery in asking the Minister to disclose to the House when we will have other priority equality areas dealt with, and specifically when we will have legislation coming before this House to amend the two main Acts, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977. The Employment Equality Agency to which the Minister referred have been consistently referring in their annual reports to the need for basic changes in that legislation.  For example, in the annual report of 1982, which is the latest published report of the agency, they refer to the fact that in 1979 they submitted a comprehensive memorandum for an amendment of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, detailing the proposed amendments and new provisions which would be required to ensure that that legislation was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in December 1981 the agency submitted a memorandum to the Minister for Labour containing proposals for an amendment of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The agency have been concerned for some time, as are the trade union women's forum and other women's organisations, about the lack of priority given to this area.  I should like to emphasise that it is a matter of very significant importance to the achievement of equality that we have the amending legislation which has been very long promised and very long canvassed for by the agency and by others.  I hope we will see that legislation introduced in the next session.</P>
    <P>In view of the discussion on the Order of Business today about legislation being introduced in this House, I strongly urge the Minister to consider introducing that legislation in this House.  It would receive a broad welcome on both sides of the <Col N="508" /> House.  It is certainly necessary to clarify some of the terms in the existing legislation. One important amendment which should be considered is one which would strengthen the role of the Employment Equality Agency.  I should like to join with Senator Hillery in urging that the agency be properly funded and staffed in order to discharge their very important statutory role and functions.  It would appear to be necessary to amend the legislation to enable the Employment Equality Agency to have a specific function which their sister organisations in the UK and Northern Ireland have, in other words, the capacity to assist women workers who wish to avail of either the 1974 or 1977 legislation by providing them with the resources to bring cases to the High Court particularly if they need to appeal on a point of law.</P>
    <P>It is quite notable that the equality legislation has not been either developed or used to its full potential because that resource does not exist.  If we contrast the situation in Ireland with the position in the United Kingdom, we see not only a much greater volume of cases going to the courts there on appeal on a point of law, most of them funded in effect by the Equal Opportunities Commission, but that also has given rise to a number of references in turn to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg under Article 177 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Here the main thrust of bringing a case has to come from women who are supported by their trade union, or in some cases women who are not supported by their trade union.  They go through the procedures with the equality officer in the Labour Court and if at that stage they get an unfavourable determination it is extremely difficult for them to contemplate bringing further proceedings for two reasons and they are very obvious reasons.  One is the contemplated cost of bringing proceedings before the High Court and the other is a psychological approach that the courts are unfavourable to workers and to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>This is reflected in other areas.  At the moment it is a very serious barrier to <Col N="509" /> the full realisation of rights under the equality legislation for women workers. It has to be realised and accepted as being a current barrier.  It can be surmounted if the Employment Equality Agency are enabled, under the amending legislation, to provide the necessary resources to ensure that cases which raise important issues for the individual woman, or women workers, and also for the general jurisprudence in equality legislation are brought before the High Court and, if necessary, are brought further still.</P>
    <P>I welcome this specific order in its own narrow context.  I hope the Minister can tell us more about that context in his reply to the debate.  I urge him to expedite the introduction of the amending legislation. I presume it will be possible and desirable to have one amending Bill to amend the provisions of the 1974 and 1977 Acts.  They are Acts which are, in any case, to be construed together.  It is desirable that they would be amended by one measure and that this would be done as a matter of the most urgent priority.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the statement made by the Minister for Labour this week in which he strongly affirms the Government's commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity.  He reflected a number of the themes which were discussed in this House when the Joint Committee on European Community Legislation report on equality for women was being discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>A commitment such as the one reflected in that statement last week on a positive action policy towards equal opportunity also requires that the Employment Equality Agency should have the resources to monitor how that will be implemented.  To discharge their role and function they must be given adequate funding and indeed an upgrading of their general staff and the necessary specialist staff.  The next few months will give an illustration of the seriousness of the commitment of the Government in this area of equality.</P>
    <P>At an operational level, the commitment has been stated and it will be of importance to see how the follow through <Col N="510" /> comes and, in particular, whether we get the amending legislation and whether we get the practical steps taken to accelerate the pace for the achievement of equality. It is necessary at this stage to reverse a present trend, which is a downward trend.  The situation for women workers is worsening as I said when we were discussing the report on equality for women.  Therefore we must take positive action to reverse that trend and to get back to the achievement of the values which are implicit in this equality legislation, the genuine achievement of equality between the sexes.</P>

      <P>I speak as a non-professional in this debate.  The two people who have spoken before me spoke quite well about the need for continuous amending legislation in the equality field.  I wonder what is the effectiveness of this particular draft order.  It appears to me that this is a cosmetic exercise which will have absolutely no practical bearing on what will happen in the mining industry in Ireland. I presume that it will look well as a statement made by the Irish Government that we will continuously amend our equality of employment legislation.  Presumably this will be used eventually when the debate on amending the ILO convention of 1936 takes place.  It appears from the bald statement that it is a piece of legislation that will be useful, or possibly could be useful to radiologists, mineralogists, or doctors who might at some stage be involved in mining in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how many people are involved in mining in Ireland at present?  How many were involved this time last year?  How many were involved the year before?  It seems to me that this order is dealing solely with one mine, that is, the Tara Mine.  That is the only mine that is in operation at present.  In the last fortnight we had the closure of Ballingarry Collieries with a loss of a number of jobs.  We have seen the total decimation of the Leinster coalfields.  We have seen the total decimation of the mines in Leitrim and in Sligo. This legislation will not do one thing to bring back mining to these areas.  What <Col N="511" /> is needed is not a statement that there is a possibility that people who want training can get it in Irish mines.  What we do need is a Government statement of policy for the rejuvenation of our natural resources. When Ballingarry Collieries were closed last week it was stated &mdash; and the statement cannot be refuted &mdash; that there is at least £29 million worth of fuel available in Ballingarry Collieries but, because we do not have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister when will a mineralogist be employed under this amending order in Ballingarry Collieries?  What is the Government's intention regarding equality of work as between men and women in Ballingarry Collieries?  Is it the intention of the Government that this order will be used to give equality to both men and women in the provisions of jobs in Irish mines? It can only be used at present in relation to one mine.</P>
      <P>When last was there an application from a student mineralogist, or from a doctor of either sex, for training in that mine?  How many people will be affected by this order or is it, as I said at the beginning, a purely cosmetic exercise to have it on the books that we are bringing in amending legislation in an area where there is absolutely no need for it?  There has been no demand for it.  As Senator Robinson said, there are a number of other areas of legislation which need amendment to give effect to real equality. This can be done only if there are jobs available or if there is a need for them.</P>

      <P>Last week I attempted to raise a matter about Clover Meats which is allied to this particular matter. On that occasion it was considered that it was a matter of urgency, but no Minister could be made available to deal with the question.  This week the question is more urgent.  Farmers in the whole of the south-east have supplied cattle and goods in good faith to Clover Meats.  Why should they not be protected in the same manner as the workers are protected? Why should the Government on every occasion be protected?  The Government are protected in this area.  Why should the supplier of goods not be protected? Every time a firm goes to the wall the Government take their stake out of it and it is no good to anybody.  There are down the line firms and in this instance there are down the line farmers.  There are down the line small business people who will go out of business.  What is a motion of specific and important urgency if this is not one?  This is not only a matter of local public interest requiring urgent consideration.  It is a national matter of public interest.</P>

      <P>I just wish to make the point that I sincerely hope that, as a result of this order, somebody will get training in mining.  As I have said, it appears to me to be a purely cosmetic exercise.  I would like to hear the Minister's views. I would like him to reassure me that there will be jobs available in mining and that there will be as many jobs for female trainees as there are for male trainees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that I should intervene briefly in the discussion <Col N="514" /> on this particular order.  I am one of those who is concerned for women's rights and I complain when we, in this country, tend, as we so often do, to my regret, to be the last to remove some particular discrimination against women.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to read the other day, although the author was being slightly anticipatory, that Ireland is one of the two countries which allow women to go down mines.  In fact, not until we and the other House pass this order will that be so.  I am glad to see us in the vanguard, if only on a minor matter.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion on the Order of Business today that all we were discussing were a couple of orders, and that it was hardly worth the Seanad's while to come together tomorrow to discuss the question of women's rights in relation to education which, as I will point out at some length tomorrow, is an aspect of the women's rights situation which is fundamental. I want to say that it is well worth the while of this House to discuss this order today and to discuss the question of women's rights in regard to education tomorrow.</P>
      <P>There has been an ironical twist.  It was the liberal thing in the 19th century to agitate that women be taken out of the mines.  It is now the liberal thing in the 20th century to agitate that women be allowed to go down mines.  This is not really an inconsistency.  The problem has not changed.  The situation in the 19th century was that women and children were used in mines because they provided cheap labour.  It was the exploitation of women and children that was corrected by the reformers of the 19th century. Here, we find ourselves in the position that women are being discriminated against in this regard.  It is not the only area.  I would certainly urge the Minister that this is only the first of a number of areas.  We are now one of two who have taken the first action in regard to this.  I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to look around them and maybe we could find an area in which we would be the first to take action.  I would be happy to applaud that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order is a good one.  It is something <Col N="515" /> to which everyone on each side of the House can assent to.  Being critical on so many occasions, I feel it necessary to rise and be congratulatory on this one.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Hillery has said and with what Senator Robinson has echoed in regard to the support, whether it be moral support or financial support, both are very desirable, for the Employment Equality Agency.  We have moved, mostly under duress, in regard to the rectification of the problems arising from discrimination against women.  Much of that discrimination perhaps is unconscious discrimination.  We certainly have not moved nearly enough.  Let us welcome every crumb and hope, in fact, there will be many more crumbs and a few whole loaves coming from the Minister's Department in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this draft order we certainly have come the whole turn of the cycle.  I can recall in secondary school learning about social legislation in Britain approximately 130 or 140 years ago, after the onset of the industrial revolution and noting the emergence of the various Acts for the improvement of the welfare of the working child and the working woman.  We can all recall the various Factory Acts and Mine Acts which debarred children under a specified age and females from working underground in mines.  This draft order is a complete rolling back of the various tenets of those particular pieces of legislation. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile.  As the Minister stated at the outset, it emerged from anomalies in the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on the record of the House my welcome for the call by Mr. Justice Barrington's commission for further restrictive safety measures.  I would agree generally that this is a non-contentious draft order.  As the Minister of State has said, he was obliged to have consultations with the various interested groups.  We note, therefore, that it has the full endorsement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other interested bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> I would like to agree with some of the observations of Senator Hillery.  By and large all we seem to have done in relation to equality of job opportunity for females is to have paid lip service to the matter. In terms of real tangible breakthroughs we have achieved very little.  Last week and previously we debated a very voluminous report produced by Senator Robinson.  It is very worthwhile but unfortunately a number of speakers did not seem to think it worth while to contribute as an indication of their solidarity with the various tenets and proposals set down therein.  As recorded in that document, it has been unfortunate that with our entry to the EC, the particular industries in which females had the highest input in terms of employment, textiles, footwear, clothing etc., have been the ones that were most vulnerable in respect of shedding jobs when the crunch came. Because of automation and so on, due to the high concentration of females in those spheres of employment they have been the ones to suffer most as a result of new developments.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery mentioned that the new initiatives being undertaken by the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO have been largely male-orientated.  The blame in this case does not so much lie with the agencies in question.  I think both AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency are relatively flexible in relation to the type of projects they will undertake, sponsor, authorise or approve.  It is the job and the responsibility and the task of local communities and organisations to have sufficient ingenuity to come up with schemes which are sufficiently female-orientated in order to provide adequate scope to redress the imbalance in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery seemed to say that we are conditioned by our education to accept specified roles or subjects as primarily female and others as being male. He instanced metalwork and woodwork. From the information emerging from the Curriculum and Examinations Board, there would seem to be considerable ground for optimism that there is a major breakthrough in this respect.  We all look <Col N="517" /> forward with a high degree of expectation and optimism to the initial report of this group.</P>
    <P>I would concur with the various aspirations in relation to further and adequate funding for the Employment Equality Agency and I concur to a large extent with the draft order.</P>

      <P>I would like to begin by thanking Senators for the welcome they have given the proposed draft Order.  Only that Senator Lanigan was a little more sceptical than some of his colleagues, it would be fair to say that there was near unanimity in welcoming the measure.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan was wondering where the request for this measure came from. He wanted to know who was looking for it.  Some of the people who were looking for it included the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, the Council for the Status of Women, the Employment Equality Agency, the advisory committees that operate under the aegis of the Department of Labour, representatives from both sides of the industry and the student representative bodies.  He also wanted to know if this was going to be an entirely academic exercise.  I am happy to say to the House that the reason for the debate today and the impetus for the introduction of the measure was a request made to us by the mining industry who wanted to take on at least one, or perhaps more, female workers in the immediate future and saw the present legislation as an impediment to that.  When the House gives its approval today &mdash; as it now seems likely it will &mdash; and the other House does so in due course, Senators can be satisfied that this will not be an academic exercise just to stay on the Statute Book.  This will have real and immediate effect, even if only in a limited number of cases.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators broadened the discussion to address themselves to the wider area of equality.  I welcome those remarks.  Senators should take comfort from the fact that in this area they are clearly pushing an open door.  That is evident from the priority that has been given by the Minister for Education, in her Programme for Action, to the need to eliminate sexism in education. This is a quite unique policy initiative taken by an Irish Minister.  She is not content to do that only at a domestic level; she has also sought to bring the battle to Europe and has used her current presidency in office on the Council of Education Ministers.  That commitment has been mirrored by the very personal interest that has been taken by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in the social affairs area.  Again we have seen a response from him, both at a domestic level and at Community level.  At a domestic level we have seen his response in terms of his statement issued last week and his earlier remarks in this House following the discussion on the secondary legislation report.  I am happy to say to Senators that the whole question of positive action in favour of women will figure very prominently on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council when we get together in Brussels on Thursday, 13 December, just as it was a major item for discussion at the informal council held in Dublin, earlier in our term, and also at all the other gatherings held during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators were anxious to know about the prospects for further amending legislation.  May I say to Senator Dooge that this is, in fact, only one of four Acts which it is possible to amend by order under the 1977 legislation?  I will happily comb the other three Acts in the hope of finding some similar measures and in the expectation that we might be first with one of them.

    <P>On the more general question of legislation in the equality area I can say to <Col N="519" /> Senators that this is an area that is receiving a very high priority within the Department at the moment.  I must be frank and say that there is something of a legislative log-jam.  That is because during the period 1973 to 1977 a whole raft of very substantial reforms were put into effect and put on the Statute Book by the then Coalition Government.  We are now a decade down the road and it is appropriate that those measures should come up for review.  The result is that we are engaged at the moment in a review of a number of them: the equality legislation, the unfair dismissals legislation, the worker participation legislation, to name but a few.  I can say that the very clear political commitment of the Minister for Labour and my own commitment have been made clear to all and sundry.  It is our determination that reviewing legislation will be before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>May I say to Senator Robinson, who speculated as to which of the Houses of the Oireachtas such reviewing legislation will come before, that of the two measures we have been able to introduce to date one of them was introduced in this House and the other was introduced in the Dáil.  That is a reasonable batting average and I see no reason why she should expect anything worse in the programme of legislation that is to come.</P>

      <Col N="520" /> That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 (Section 51) (Insurance Brokers) Order, 1984</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 29th November, 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Committee on Motor Insurance, who were established in November 1981, submitted a report to the Minister in January 1983 entitled &ldquo;Report of Inquiry into the Cost and Methods of Providing Motor Insurance, 1982&rdquo;.  In this report, the committee made numerous recommendations about the various aspects of motor insurance which they examined.  One of these areas was the work of insurance intermediaries, particularly brokers.</P>
      <P>The committee found that many members of the public who deal through brokers were not particularly aware of the insurer with whom their insurance had been taken out and considered that they were actually insured by the broker. Many of these policyholders were unaware of exactly how much their premium was since the amount shown by the broker frequently included a handling charge or service charge or both.  The PAC considered that brokers' clients were entitled to know (a) how much their insurance premia were costing them and (b) how much the broker was charging for his services.  They recommended that a broker, in billing his client, should show the premium charged by the insurance company separately from any charges imposed by the broker.  The Government approved the implementation of this recommendation.</P>
      <P>While it had initially been envisaged that the requirement to identify service charges would apply only to motor business, indications were received about the imposition of charges on other forms of insurance, and it was accordingly found necessary to extend the scope of the order to cover all non-life insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> As life assurance premiums are paid, in most cases, by direct debit and no complaints had been received in regard to this area, it was not considered necessary to extend the order to cover life assurance business.</P>
    <P>The order as drafted requires insurance brokers &mdash; as defined in the order &mdash; to segregate and show any charges they are making separately from the amount payable under the policy.  The amount payable under the policy of non-life insurance includes the levies applied under the Finance Act, 1982, and the Insurance Act, 1964.  Thus what will be required to be shown is the amount the policyholder is required to pay for his insurance separately from the amount of service charges applied by the broker, or the amount of any other charges, fees or amounts whatsoever.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Insurance broker&rdquo; is defined widely in the order to include all insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>There has been a general welcome for the order from those I consulted.  I know that there have been fears expressed by one broking body as to the consequences of the order, but I must stress that what is involved here is a basic measure of consumer information.  Policyholders are entitled to know what they are paying for.  The order does not prevent brokers making service charges, but it does require them to disclose any such charges. I would hope that full co-operation will be received in implementing the order.</P>
    <P>The order will be enforced by the insurance division of my Department.  The penalties for breach of the order are set out in section 6 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act, 1980 &mdash; £500 or six months maximum on summary conviction, £10,000 or two years maximum on indictment.  I trust, however that given a sensible attitude on all parts, it will not be necessary to invoke that section of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with this draft.  I see it as not being necessary at this time.  There is no organisation in the professional field &mdash;<Col N="522" /> solicitors, doctors and accountants &mdash; being charged in the specific way that the Minister now sees fit to charge insurance brokers.  The measure is totally anti-insurance brokerage.  We know that in 1969 the insurance companies reduced the commission rate from 10 per cent on motor insurance to 5 per cent.  Of course 5 per cent is a totally uneconomic rate for any organisation to work on, hence the reason for a charge.  If this draft is passed, it will simply mean that in many cases when the customer receives his bill from his insurance broker he will go direct to the insurance company and bypass the insurance broker.  Many of them will not pay the fee.</P>
      <P>This is an insignificant measure.  The Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  I agree that something is necessary. What is clearly necessary is suitable, appropriate registration of insurance brokers. Unless we have that, we are dodging the main issues.  We all agree that the consumer must be protected.  But in so far as the insurance industry is concerned, I again repeat that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  Surely registration is the answer.  If there was registration all the points of concern to the Minister of State at that Department could and would be organised and controlled. Insurance brokers have had meetings with the Minister of State.  It is a pity that he did not continue discussions with them with a view to appropriate registration and say to them at the end of the day what he is saying here.  This is premature.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late hour, not to proceed with it but to adjourn it and go for a suitable registration of brokers, which will deal with the problem <i>in toto.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the professional insurance brokers' associations, IBA and CIBI, are very responsible people.  Why should they be penalised for the action of what might be described as a few rogue insurance brokers?  They are people who have professional indemnity bonds, who are totally qualified in the insurance industry, who know exactly the business of insurance, trained people who have set themselves up as experts in the field of <Col N="523" /> insurance to advise their clients to get the best rates possible, to help in claim settlements and so on.  Yet they are to be penalised because there are some rogue insurance brokers who are charging higher fees than they should.  Why penalise the genuine fellow?  Why not go for registration and control every aspect of the industry?</P>
    <P>Mr. Cluskey, when he was Minister, was concerned about the question of bonding, so that if a broker went out of business there would be a fund for him, similar to that for the tour operators. If there was registration, bonding would form part and parcel of whatever proposals the Minister sought, in agreement, having had discussions with the brokers' organisations.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is concerned about the consumer, he should look further afield than this insignificant measure because it defintely is not doing anything for the consumer.  If the Minister wants to do something for the consumer in the field of insurance, I suggest that he make strong representations to the insurance companies to give a 10 per cent commission rate on motor insurance.  Surely it is time, as a Minister with responsibility for insurance, that he brought his counterparts together, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment and said to them, &ldquo;Let us talk about aspects of insurance in your particular Department&rdquo;. Why not abolish the jury system, which is affecting the insurance industry in a way that was never, ever thought possible?  We read recently of three insurance companies who are on the verge of pulling out of Ireland because of the jury system operating here.  Not alone are juries determining the amount of the award but also determining liability. Insurance companies are suckers, they are caught for every penny once they go into the High Court.  In 99 per cent of cases an award is given and usually it is substantial.  There is no way that insurance companies can continue to make a profit, even a minute profit, because of our jury system.  Employer's liability, <Col N="524" /> public liability insurance is almost impossible to get for any heavy risk.  For any heavy risk, premiums are being shot up to 100 per cent, 200 per cent, and varying figures up to 400 per cent.  Why not have discussions with the Minister for Justice in that area and endeavour to eliminate the jury system and thus bring premiums down to a realistic level?</P>
    <P>When we spoke here about the Road Traffic Act we asked the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment to increase the uninsured driver's fine to £1,000.  He said it should be left at £350. The insurance companies pleaded with him to increase it to £1,000.  The Minister would not listen.  He was forgetting that in the mid-sixties, out of the goodness of their hearts, and to protect the good name of their industry, the insurance companies set up the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  They have been funding that bureau since.  This year the figure expected to be paid out is something in the region of £40 million.  Surely the companies who are paying that kind of money, who are concerned about their industry in that way, should be listened to.  I thought it very wrong that the Minister would not agree to an amendment in the Seanad to increase the maximum fine to £1,000.  It was a gesture.  What would happen tomorrow morning if the insurance companies said there was no further obligation on them and they were pulling the plug on the Motor Insurers' Bureau. I am not requesting that they do so, but they could do it and the Government would be left to pick up the tabs.</P>
    <P>What about the famous 2 per cent levy for the PMPA which is not just applying now to motor premiums but is eating into the old age pensioner's household policy or fire policy?  The old age pensioner probably never owned a car in his life, yet he is being penalised for the wrongs of one motor insurance company. Not alone that, but the PMPA are in direct competition with the insurance companies.  It is known that they are cutting rates left, right and centre.  The Minister might argue and look at the <Col N="525" /> Chair and say perhaps that is not relevant. I am arguing that this is totally relevant, that the whole insurance industry, if we are thinking of the consumer, must be examined and looked at. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Going back to the draft, I accept that we have rogue insurance brokers who are charging fees far in excess of what they should but what is this legislation going to do about it?  Is it not a fact that this draft is simply asking brokers to itemise their figures?  If they show a figure of £200 gross premium plus a fee of £50 they are complying with the draft and therefore complying with the law.  What follow-up has the Minister on that?  Perhaps he might comment on that.</P>
    <P>I think that this is piecemeal legislation. It is not dealing with the maverick broker.  It is not dealing with the problem of the insurance broker in the area of life insurance, for example, who is telling his client he will have so many extra millions of pounds at the end of the term of insurance. It is doing nothing in the area of control.  It is not doing anything at all in respect of what I would regard as the public good.  There will be no proper supervision in this area.  Certainly it is not tackling the issues of the insurance industry in the area of brokerage and in the area of insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about this problem he would again consider seriously &mdash; and I plead with him to do this &mdash; the question of registration.  That would surely be doing the right thing. That would surely be answering the calls that were made in the O'Connor Report which dealt with controls of insurance brokers and agreed that qualified insurance brokers should be paid.  I ask the Minister at this late hour not to proceed with this order, to postpone it until such time as he has a proper registration of insurance brokers.  The insurance brokers, those who are members of the insurance brokers' profession and of the bodies that represent them, will only be too happy to talk to the Minister.  They have already spoken to the Minister.  I think it was 12 months ago when one of <Col N="526" /> them met the Minister and I do not think they heard from him since.</P>
    <P>The Minister should meet the insurance brokers' organisations, talk to them about registration, iron out the problems in this regard and not put the cart before the horse as he is doing in this case. Registration is the answer.  It will solve all the problems in this area.  I plead with the Minister to adopt this course.  The consumer must be protected.  Anything that we do should naturally be in the interest of the consumer.  Again, I pose the question: why should the Minister penalise all the genuine brokers for a few rogue brokers?  I hope that the Minister will grant my request and perhaps postpone this matter until a more appropriate time.  Certainly it is premature at this point in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the order.  The main burden of what Senator Fallon has said is to urge that this order be not made today on the grounds that it is merely a piecemeal measure.  We have the old proverb that half a loaf is better than no bread.  Very often a corner of a loaf is better than no bread at all.  While many of us might agree with what Senator Fallon has said, that there are many other things that should be done besides what is in this order, I do not think we should allow that factor to blind us as to what is in this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, over many years in this House, talked on a number of matters on the basis that the public have a right to information. I would like to say that I think the right to information is a citizen's valid right.  I will, as long as I am in this House, defend it.  That is the key point.  That is the kernel of what is in this order that is being proposed today by the Minister of State.  He is suggesting that in regard to this matter the public have a right to information.  I agree, of course, with Senator Fallon that it would be a good thing if the public had a statutory right to information in a lot of other things, in regard to a lot of other professional fees where there is confusion.  If an order or a proposal comes into this House in <Col N="527" /> regard to giving the public a right to information on these matters is will certainly secure my personal support.</P>
    <P>It may well be that there could be a very distinct improvement in the area of insurance and of non-life insurance generally by the registration of brokers. I am quite prepared to listen to this case whether it is propounded by Senator Fallon or by the Minister of State.  It may well be that that is the road that we should take.  That should not stop us taking the action that is proposed to us today.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also said that we should take an alternative approach, that we should go to the Minister for Justice and suggest that there should be a change in the jury system.  This is a very large proposal.  To ask that this small thing which is concerned with the right of information on the part of the policy-holder should be held up and put into cold storage before we enter into a long debate about the scope of the jury system in this country does not reflect a balanced point of view.  In connection with this matter my information is that the situation is changing.  While it might have been true two or three years ago that the amount of damages and awards being made by juries were over-large, my information is that the trend is all the other way.  My information is that the counsel for plaintiffs against insurance companies are now trying to settle before cases go to the jury because a reaction has set in against what was definitely a period of over-large jury awards.  I hesitate to say that because a number of Members of this House are not only members of the Bar but appear from time to time in insurance cases and I would hate them to think that I was endeavouring to make expert judgment on this.</P>
    <P>What we are faced with here is a small, net issue, a very clear recommendation. If we look at the report of inquiry into the Cost and Methods of Providing Motor Insurance which was laid before us on 30 December 1982 &mdash; I am referring to the document that bears the Parliamentary number PL 1323 &mdash; it states in paragraph 4.6:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Many members of the public who deal through brokers are not particularly aware of the insurer with whom their insurance is taken out and regard themselves as being insured with their broker.  The broker's formal reward for his services takes the form of commission which the company allows him on the premiums he collects, the standard rate in motor insurance being 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It goes on later in the same paragraph to say:</P>
    <P>A third form of income has made its appearance in recent years, and many brokers as well as receiving commission out of the premium quoted by the insurance company, add on top of the gross premium a further handling charge as additional remuneration for their services.  It would be necessary to examine individual cases to form an opinion as to whether this additional charge to the client is justified.  What is certainly objectionable is that in many cases the fact of there being such an additional charge is not revealed to the customer, to whom there is quoted a single sum which he may take to represent the insurance premium but which in reality covers both the premium and the broker's handling charge.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.6 goes on to say &mdash; and I heartily concur with what it says &mdash;:</P>
    <P>The client is entitled to know what he is paying for the broker's services and we recommend that a broker, in billing a client, should show the premium charged by the insurance company separately from any charges made by the broker, preferably by giving a copy of the company's quotation or renewal notice to the client along with the total bill.</P>
    <P>That is the net point of what the Minister of State has proposed to us.  I believe that we have a tendency in this country, whether it be in large matters or in small, to cover up, to distort, to obfuscate the real cost of things.  We would be better off in large things and in small to make <Col N="529" /> sure, whether it is the decision in regard to a large investment policy or the payment of non-life insurance, that we know what the real cost is and how that real cost is made up.  We have a right to know what the components are.  A bill that we receive in regard to non-life insurance should be transparent in the sense that it is absolutely clear how much is being paid for every aspect of that.  I agree with Senator Fallon that there are many other areas in which this principle also applies. Let us today agree to apply it in the area of non-life insurance and let us continue to press the Minister and other Ministers responsible to apply it in other places also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Fallon's argument with regard to this motion.  I would query the fact that the Minister is more concerned with the commission paid to the broker than attacking the fundamental problems of high cost motor insurance.  I would like the Minister to let the House know what he has, or his Department have done to implement the recommendation of the inquiry into the cost of motor insurance.  Could the Minister tell us if a commitment was given in the Dáil that the Government and the Minister would act, and act swiftly, to implement the recommendations of this inquiry body?</P>
      <P>We should be tackling the real problem of the high cost of insurance premiums. High cost insurance is the main reason why a large percentage of people driving today are driving uninsured cars.  I agree with the Leader of the House that the public have a right to information; they have a right to assess the profitability or lack of it of the insurance company.  They have a right to know where their money is going or what percentage of the insurance company's money is indiscriminately disposed of through court action where in many cases awards have been given much in excess of what would be an agreed standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the problem with regard to insurance brokers.  It is too easy to become an insurance broker but at the same time the Minister is asking us to <Col N="530" /> adopt a motion which will be mainly concerned with the commission paid to a broker which would be in the region of 5 per cent minimum, probably 10 per cent maximum.  Legislation was promised to deal with insurance and insurance brokers generally.  This is piecemeal legislation to tackle what the Minister sees as a problem but which has not been questioned to my knowledge.  If this motion is adopted today insurers will be paying their premiums direct to the insurance company thus eliminating the broker. But what will happen in the event of a claim?  Where will the broker fit in?  Who will act for the insured person?  We could also be penalising qualified brokers as against brokers with very little experience. This motion should be withdrawn. I ask the Minister to tackle the real problems of insurance in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with some of the views expressed by Senator Fallon in so far as they relate to the necessity for a legislative review of the insurance industry in general and an examination of the problems which beset that industry both in the life and non-life areas.  I also have considerable sympathy with the point of view of the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, in so far as he indicates that it is better to deal with one small area of the problem as it is before us now and not to wait until such time as a very substantial review would take place of the whole insurance industry before making any change whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism of the order, therefore, is not on the basis of whether or not it limits the access to a jury assessment for damages or any other such matter.  My examination of the order is restricted to whether or not it achieves the purpose which it intends to achieve.  Nobody can suggest that the recommendation of the committee of inquiry should not have our enthusiastic support, the Prices Advisory Committee of the motor insurance industry.  It should have our enthusiastic support.  The extract from the report read by Senator Dooge should be sufficient to convince us that there is a necessity that <Col N="531" /> the general public would be informed as to the amount of money which they are paying for the service of providing insurance brokerage.  That is right and proper. My experience &mdash; and I have considerable experience of dealing with insurance brokers &mdash; is by and large that they are very efficient people who perform an excellent service, but there is a value on their service just like anything else.  They should be open to the same scrutiny as any other professional group with regard to the level of charges imposed in respect of the services they provide.</P>
    <P>My criticism of the draft order is that it fails totally to achieve this purpose.  It seeks to tackle only one of the many problems which confront the individual when he or she is deciding the amount of money to pay an insurance broker.  In so far as it does this I welcome it, but it only requires the insurance broker to identify in respect of all non-life insurance any service or additional charge which he might be making in respect of the policy. This is proper, but the average policy-holder will not be aware of the rate of insurance commission which his broker will be getting in addition to that.  This can vary very substantially depending on the type of insurance.  It can be as low as 5 per cent &mdash; a crazily-low figure in my opinion &mdash; in the case of motor insurance. In respect of other insurance, for example, marine insurance, it could be as high as 17½ per cent, and there could be a variation within an individual class of insurance business between one company and another.  This is not adding very much to the store of knowledge of the person who takes out insurance.</P>
    <P>The report quoted by Senator Dooge states that the person taking our insurance is entitled to know what he is paying for the broker's services.  This order is not going to achieve that.  It is merely going to identify the additional charge which the broker considers necessary over and above the commission which he will be getting from the insurance company. It puts no obligation on the insurance broker to identify what percentage of the premium he is going to get in <Col N="532" /> commission.  Therefore, armed with this additional information, which I consider to be welcome, the insurance user is not going to know how much money the broker is making out of the transaction, what his rate of profit is.</P>
    <P>If a person goes to a solicitor for his services ultimately the solicitor will say that he will charge £500 or £1,000 for that service.  The same applies to a member of the bar or a doctor, but in relation to insurance services the user is not aware of the commission the insurance broker is getting.  Therefore, this order is only identifying any additional charge.  These additional charges, as Senator Fallon quite rightly said, came about because of the unrealistic rate of commission which was being given in respect of each motor insurance premium.  In my view 5 per cent was unrealistic for the type and level of service which is necessary in the processing of these matters.</P>
    <P>This order does not tackle or solve the problem of letting the person know what he is going to have to pay for the services, and it is a defective order for that reason. I object to it, not because there is too much information, but because there is too little information.  It is not sensible that the policy-holder will not know what he or she is paying for the insurance broker's services.  I am not objecting to the level of commission in respect of non-life.</P>
    <P>Another reason I have for objecting to the order is that it fails to tackle the obscene rates of commission which are charges in the life area.  There are absolutely crazy levels of commission charged in the life area without the knowledge of the policy-holder.  These rates of commission can range from 50 per cent of the premium to 100 per cent of the premium in the first year, or as near 100 per cent as makes no difference.  The order fails to tackle that.  Why is the order not drafted in such a way that you have to show in respect of both life and non-life policies, the service charge &mdash; already in the order &mdash; and the rate of commission? That is all that is necessary.</P>
    <P>It appears that I am being heckled by the acting Leader of the House.  If the <Col N="533" /> Senator could raise his voice so that I could hear him then I could answer him, but if he mumbles I cannot answer him.</P>

      <P>The reason I think that this is an inadequate order is that it fails to tackle the problem which Senator Dooge identified as being necessary.  One of the conclusions of this committee to which he referred was the necessity to enable the user of the broker's services to be in a position to say what he is paying for the broker's service.  It clearly fails to do so because, as I said, in respect of the life or non-life insurance area it fails to identify the rate of commission applicable to an individual policy.  The rate of commission is all that is necessary, and most people can work that out themselves.</P>

    <P>In respect of the life assurance it fails to make any provision whatsoever.  The rip-off in the life assurance area is in the rate of commission on the first year's premium rather than in any service charge.  If the Minister was going to do something which was necessary &mdash; and I believe it is &mdash; he should have done it properly, and he should have done it in such a way that members of the public could identify what they are paying for the broker's services.  They could then shop around from broker to broker and <Col N="534" /> take into account, not only the cost, but the standard of service which they are getting.  It is not always the person with the cheapest rates who will give the best service in the long run.  Insurance brokerage is a very skilful business, but it is important that people should know what they are paying for this skilful service.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to take a step in the right direction, but, having taken that step, he has not gone far enough.  There are adequate powers for the Minister under section 51 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 to make a further order instructing that in any such written document, as is specified in this order, the rate of commission payable to the insurance broker would be clearly shown.</P>

      <P>At least this order is unusual in that it is being criticised not only for what is in it but also for what is not in it.  Most orders going through the House almost go &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo; and that is not really the ideal way.  The debate so far has been quite interesting.  My experience in the area of insurance is purely that of one of the ordinary people who pays for the minimum cover which one gets away with.  Perhaps that is not altogether true, but I find that very many people have great difficulty in securing adequate cover and that without the aid of insurance brokers it would prove extremely difficult for them.  For that reason I would hope that there would be no damage done to that industry.  I do not know how extensive it is but there are categories, especially younger people, who have not got the experience of shopping around and they find it very difficult to get cover. More often than not the cover is offered to them at outrageous rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since so many divergent views have been expressed here, perhaps the Minister might consider deferring it until a later sitting so that the House might get an opportunity to reach a better consensus. I am amazed at the number of problems that crop up in the insurance field.  There are two youth employment schemes in County Laois and both of them are experiencing <Col N="535" /> tremendous difficulty in securing adequate cover.  I do not know whether that aspect comes under this order before the House, but the entire area of insurance seems to be one that would need comprehensive legislative review.  It is an area where the advice of experts would be needed to know exactly whether one is covered or not, because there is so much small print that needs to be teased out and that needs to be understood and explained.  That is a problem, and I would hope that at some stage the Minister and his Department would be able to refer to it and perhaps give the insurance paying public greater opportunity and greater protection under the Act.  Since the last Insurance Act went through the House there have been many changes in society and people are not able to take the risk.</P>
    <P>Before noon today, I listened to a programme on Radio Éireann.  People who were driving cars without insurance were interviewed and gave the reasons why they were not insured.  They said they could not afford insurance.  If one cannot afford to tax and insure a car, in my view one cannot afford to have a car. There should be a very clear attitude towards that.  The penalties for driving without adequate cover for third parties who may be injured should be stepped up so that they will prove to be a deterrent. Some might think that the few who pay motor insurance premiums will continue to fork out £60 million or £100 million a year to pay the bill for the people who completely disregard the law in this instance.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the speaker who said that the Department of Justice should be involved in the review.  I would hope that if the Minister cannot see his way to defer this motion this evening he would bring in in the New Year as a matter of urgency comprehensive legislation to give support to people who need to be insured if they want to continue with their normal lives.  It should not be prohibitive.  The loading of young drivers, especially those who have not had accidents, from the beginning is bad policy.  Perhaps that aspect is not covered <Col N="536" /> in the motion.  I should have known better than to have been talking while my colleague Senator O'Leary was speaking.  I want to assure the House that I was not commenting on what he was saying.  I would like to apologise to him.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  In relation to Senators Fallon and Lynch, I am somewhat surprised at their opposition to what is essentially a matter of consumer information.  We are all anxious to ensure where at all possible that the consumer will get as much information as possible about matters affecting his or her life. Indeed in this regard it is an important aspect of life that insurance is now such an expensive part of household budgets.

      <P>It is a matter of consumer protection and consumer information. The order is being made for the benefit of the consumer, the policy holders, and I am somewhat astonished at the attitude being taken by the Opposition to this motion.  I was also taken aback by a second aspect of the Opposition's comments.  They said that I am not taking sufficient action in the insurance area, when here I am in fact carrying out a recommendation of the Prices Advisory Committee Board of Inquiry.  I am being criticised for so doing.  Their attitude here is somewhat contrary to logic, and I can assure the House that I am very concerned about the many problems facing <Col N="537" /> the policy holders in insurance, not only motor insurance but also the non-life and life sectors.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out that the measure being moved here today has the support of the insurance companies operating in the Irish market.  I would also like to state that the brokers' organisation were given the opportunity to comment on this proposal when the Government's decision on the Prices Advisory Committee Report were published in October 1983.  I specifically asked for their views on the proposals during a speech to the National Insurance Brokers' Association in March of this year.  The association made its views known to me at two meetings with the Department in July and October of this year.  Its views were fully considered but they were not acceptable to me because they were directly contrary to both the recommendations of the committee and to the Government's decisions on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon thought the order was unnecessary.  He suggested that 5 per cent is an inadequate commission on motor policies.  He thought a service charge was necessary because this claimed a low level of commission.  He then suggested that the public would deal directly with insurance companies if they were aware of the brokers' service charge.  Surely the public are entitled to know if a charge is being levied on them.  That is all that this order seeks to do.  It is to inform the policy-holder about such service charges.  It does not outlaw service charges.  I do not think that any responsible insurance broker should object to this.  Insurance brokers generally perform a very good service to the community.  Their primary function is to act on behalf of consumers to ensure that customers are getting the most competitive price on their insurance.  That is their legitimate role and it is for that that they are recompensed.  It is very important that that role should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon referred to the fines for uninsured driving.  The maximum fine now goes to £1,000.  This is a result of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act passed in July of this year.  He also referred to the control of the level of premiums as <Col N="538" /> opposed to the disclosure of charges as provided for in this order.  The control of the level of premiums is a matter for the National Prices Commission to examine under the Prices Acts.  This order in relation to charges simply complements that control.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch thought I was paying too much attention to this issue as opposed to implementing recommendations of the PAC.  This, of course, is one of the recommendations.  The various other recommendations are also in hand or have been implemented.  I accept that action is required not only in my Department but in the Departments of Justice and the Environment.</P>
    <P>The most notable action that has been taken is the increase in the fines for uninsured driving, the greater Garda vigilance in relation to this offence and the setting-up of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which I announced last week. I feel that that board would be of great assistance in advising me of the various problems in motor insurance.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that the draft order addresses only one aspect of the role of insurance intermediaries and the relationship between intermediaries and customers.  The aspect which is dealt with in the draft order is, however, an important one.  I am doing it now rather than waiting for a more general comprehensive scheme for the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  The question of commission payments to intermediaries is not dealt with in the draft order for a number of reasons.  Commission payments are included in the basic premiums charged by the insurance companies and therefore can very considerably between different insurance policies.  The payment of the commission forms part of the contract between the insurer and the intermediary rather than between the intermediary and the policy-holder. However, the cost of commission payment is of course ultimately borne by the policy-holder.</P>
    <P>My responsibility as Minister in charge of supervising insurance companies is to the policy-holders.  I am therefore anxious to achieve the most reasonable <Col N="539" /> level of commission payments in all areas of insurance.  This is the case for non-life insurance as a mechanism of the Prices Acts, and all applications for approval of increases in insurance premiums are looked at and any excessive commission levels are disallowed.</P>
    <P>The order before the House represents only a small part of the general plans for the regulation of the activities of insurance intermediaries.  This general question was raised by a number of Deputies. Following consultation with various interested parties in this matter, my Department are currently putting together proposals aimed at protecting the public by bringing about a situation of legally binding standards for intermediaries. When legislation is introduced we will be able to address this area very comprehensively.  It will be appreciated that I cannot enter into any details in regard to the possible provisions of such legislation as these are, of course, matters for the Government to decide on.  I would stress that the introduction of the proposed order represents the first move in the introduction of a system of regulation of the activities of insurance intermediaries. It is my hope that legislation giving effect to the regulatory scheme can be introduced as soon as practicable in 1985.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary referred to commissions in the last insurance period.  I recently indicated that legislation would be brought in to ensure that commissions will be at reasonable levels in that segment of the industry.  A number of attempts have been made to achieve agreed levels of commission payments within the life insurance industry.  A few companies have not gone along with these arrangements and I am making my views known to them.  If excessive commission rates are paid on life assurance policies the powers provided for in the new legislation will be used.  The House will be clear, therefore, that I do not intend to remain silent or inactive on the whole question of commission rates or on regulation of intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The order before the House I would consider to be reasonable, a step in the <Col N="540" /> right direction.  It is to inform consumers of the cost of insurance policies to them. It is only a first step.  I fully realise that the whole area needs to be addressed widely, from the report of PAC on motor insurance to excessive commissions in the whole insurance area and to dealing with the registration, etc. of intermediaries. These questions will be addressed at the proper time and in the most comprehensive manner possible.  This order is not an anti-broker order and I object to it being described as such.  It is an order informing policy-holders of what they are being charged for their policies and therefore it must be seen as an order in the consumer protection area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is having a somewhat chequered career in its progress through this House.  It was last discussed here &mdash; and I moved the adjournment &mdash; on 2 May 1984.  So it is really up to Senators to try to get back into the mood which was generated at that time when we discussed the plight of the homeless to which this Bill attempts to address itself.</P>
      <P>This group &mdash; the homeless &mdash; are definitely one of the most deprived and marginalised sectors of our community. It is difficult to ascertain just how many people we are talking about.  The last official survey of the number of people who are homeless &mdash; those in hostels, or county homes, or sleeping rough &mdash; was carried out at the request of a British Government.  That was during the period 1904 to 1906.  I refer to the Department of Health, 1906, Parliamentary Papers.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that in the 80 years since then &mdash; given the rise in social awareness, and given the fact that the problem is one which we cannot ignore &mdash; no other official survey has been carried out.  That is lamentable.  It is a great lack in our statistical knowledge of our own community. It is my hope that, as a result of debating this Bill such a survey and such a statistical analysis will be obtained so that we can quantify and know very clearly exactly what we are talking about when we refer to the homeless in our community.</P>

      <P>It is true to say that we know from our own personal observations and from the reports coming in from workers in the field that the statistics of homeless people is an increasing one, and that more and more young people are finding themselves among this group. <Col N="544" /> That gives me a feeling of disquiet.  It is probably obvious to all of us why this should be so.  In speaking about a homeless persons Bill and in looking for some arm of Government to make itself statutorily responsible for the homeless, we must not overlook the fact that the root causes of homelessness must be attacked with vigour by our Legislature.</P>
      <P>The origin of the state in which an increasing number of people find themselves is in the breakdown of individual family situations.  This is a very poignant and sad situation if we reflect upon it. There is usually a breakdown of relationships in a family context, or perhaps in an educational context, or an employment context.  In general, such a breakdown takes place in the community in which these individual people find themselves. This becomes apparent to all of us when we see the number of deserted, aged people and the number of youngsters who, perforce, sleep rough.  The youngsters sleeping rough is a new phenomenon in our society and one which is extremely poignant and gives cause for enormous concern.</P>
      <P>Once a problem is defined as a social problem rather than an individual or a personal problem, society is bound to intervene with some adequate response in order to alleviate the problems and to redress it.  This intervention can take many forms.  It could, as it is hoped by the proposers of this Bill, take the form of legislation, or it could take the form of a therapeutic service.  Indeed, we have various voluntary and therapeutic services working very vigorously in this area. I should like to pay tribute to them and to the proponent of this legislation who has always worked tirelessly in the field of the deprived, the oppressed and the marginalised.  I refer to Senator Brendan Ryan.  A tribute from all sides of the House is due to him for his unceasing vigilance and care in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is the only EC country, with the exception of Greece, which does not have some kind of statutory provision for the homeless.  If we really think about that, it is quite shocking.  It is something which we must take urgent steps to <Col N="545" /> redress.  I will give examples of how other EC countries cope with this problem, which is a common one to all of the member states.  In France there is a national rehabilitation programme under the Interior Department.  Germany spends over 400 million Deutsche Marks annually in a series of programmes for the homeless.  In Denmark the 1966 Social Assistance Act guarantees social services for the homeless.  In Italy the homeless must be housed by the autonomous regions.</P>
    <P>In Britain the 1977 Homeless Persons Act ensured the housing of over 100,000 families since 1977.  In the socialist countries housing objectives are part of the Constitution.  Leaving the EC aside, in two of the American states there is a constitutional right to shelter, in West Virginia since March 1983 and in New York since December 1980.  In this latter case the Governor was taken to court by homeless men in the city and the Supreme Court ordered New York to provide shelter immediately, and they meant immediately. In fact, they meant that night.  For every hour the city authorities failed to do so, they were fined heavily by the Supreme Court until it was cheaper to provide shelter than to pay the fines.</P>
    <P>It may well be that if our marginalised homeless people receive scant attention from our authority, they will have recourse to some similar measures.  I can see somebody not too far from me who would avail of the opportunity to do something like this if the basic requests which are being made by way of this legislation are not met with an adequate response from Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to do three things. First it defines a homeless person.  This may seem a fairly simple, basic, germane way to approach any legislation.  It is a classic instruction given by teachers to all students to define your terms.  It is quite extraordinary that this has not been done before in the case of the homeless.  It is very necessary that it should be done. Secondly, the Bill attempts to define the local authority as the responsible agency. Here we have a problem, because there <Col N="546" /> is a certain anomaly or ambivalance in our community and the homeless generally tend to fall between two statutory bodies, the health authority and the local authority, and end up in a no-man's-land where nobody feels responsible for the provision of housing for them.  Thirdly, the Bill sets the responsibility firmly on the local authority to house homeless people.  This is the logical thing to do since statutorily the local authority are charged with housing rather than the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill defines a homeless person as someone who sleeps rough or who has no ownership of property, or access to property by virtue of renting it or who, because he is homeless, has to stay in night shelters, or in common lodging houses, prisons or psychiatric institutions. It should embrace all the categories of what is commonly understood by the word &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  That is a fairly comprehensive definition.  Anybody who is aware of the plight of the homeless will know that generally the sorts of places where they end up to get shelter are covered by this definition.</P>
    <P>The local authority, as I have already stated, are defined as responsible.  The thinking behind the Bill is that homelessness is a problem caused by the lack of access to housing.  This Bill is devastatingly logical, and it is hard to avoid this inescapable quality of it.  It is not seen as a health problem.  The ill-health of homeless people, for example, TB, or foot sores, malnutrition, or alcoholism, is generally as a result of their being homeless and is not the cause of their homelessness.  As I said earlier, the cause is generally a breakdown in relationships which arises from a variety of reasons for the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>What was apparent to speakers who spoke the last time on the Bill and will be apparent to all who take part in the debate today is that no agency is uniquely responsible.  We all know that when no one agency, or person, or institution, is responsible for something, it is generally shrugged off as being the responsibility of no one.  Health boards are very clear in their belief that the responsibility of <Col N="547" /> housing the homeless is a local authority housing problem.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities, because of the plethora of social problems attached to the individuals, are inclined to the belief that it is a health problem and they send them back to the health boards.  There is a great deal of what is commonly called buck passing between the one and the other, all very well-intentioned and very concerned but because the parameters are not drawn there is a lack of clarity which makes it possible for this kind of exercise to occur.  Anybody who is a member of a local authority will be well aware of what is happening in this area and will be concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill obliges local authorities to house the homeless because, under the existing policies of most but not all local authorities, single people are not eligible for housing no matter how destitute they are.  Dublin Simon has single homeless people aged 72 years of age who cannot get housing.  Others are in their fifties and in their sixties.  Very often they have TB and they cannot get housing.  Several men died in the 1982 freeze-up sleeping outside because they were too young in the eyes of some local authorities to be considered for housing.  There is a devastating body of information collected by Simon and other agencies which points up the painful reality for many people because of the lack of clarity and statutory responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that the local authorities should house the most needy of our citizens and bring the country into line with our nearest neighbour, the UK, and with our European neighbours.  It is humanitarian in intent.  It may lack in the area of practicality.  I am sure that the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Pattison, whom I welcome here today, will have something to say about the practicalities involved. The Minister will know very clearly what this is all about because he and I both served on the South Eastern Health Board.  Anybody who serves on a health board is kept aware of the plight of the homeless because of the anomalies to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> On 2 May I spoke at length on the Bill. It is not my intention to take up the time of the House at any great length today.  I should like to make reference to my own city of Waterford where there is a very active St.  Vincent de Paul Conference who run an excellent shelter for the homeless in Waterford called Ozanam House.  It is new, very well equipped and extremely well run by a body of dedicated people.  The house accommodates approximately 40 men.  They are charged a small amount of money, £19 or £20 per week, for full board and lodging.  Great care is taken by the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Conference to relate to the people who are dwellers there.</P>
    <P>While speaking to Mr. Martin Arthur, who is very prominent in this area, I asked him if he could give me some idea or some breakdown of the sorts of people who use this hostel.  A majority are older people.  They are there for a variety of reasons.  Alcohol is one of the difficulties of some who sleep in the hostel.  It is a result of their homelessness rather than a cause generally.  Interestingly enough some few have been released from prison but, because of the absence of any rehabilitation programme in our prisons, or indeed a follow through after being released from prison, these people feel unhappy about re-entering their old familiar environment and end up being homeless.  Very often they are pressed back into a life of crime because they have not come to terms with the fact that they have discharged their obligation to society and that they can re-enter it as useful law-abiding citizens.  They are confused, unhappy and, willy-nilly, they are sucked into the hostel-type life.</P>
    <P>It intrigues me to think people are coming into hostels who formerly served in the Irish Army.  This is a feature of some of the people who are homeless.  I expect it is like any group of people who have been living an institutional life and who suddenly find themselves outside that institution.  They have difficulty in coming to terms with life back in civvy street and, for a variety of reasons, they drift towards hostel accommodation.  It points up the need for rehabilitation and <Col N="549" /> re-education programmes when people are discharged from the Army or decide to leave it.  They should be eased back into life in the community.  Having lived in an institution for four or five years I know that it gets a grip on an individual no matter what that institution is.  Some of us who may leave this institution will find it very difficult to get back to living as private citizens.  Perhaps it is tempting fate to even speak about it, let alone think about it.  This is another reason why people find themselves living in hostels.</P>
    <P>We have a growing number of young people in the Waterford hostel.  This hostel caters for men, so I can only speak of them, who have become alienated from home and society and who find themselves in hostels.  The members of St.  Vincent de Paul who work in the hostel do their best to try to effect reconciliations with families and to hasten young people out of this way of life because they know how demoralising it can be for them as they get older.</P>
    <P>We have an acute problem in Waterford and I expect it is no different from anywhere else in that we have no provisions for homeless women and young girls.  However, we are aware of this in Waterford, and there is a very active committee called Oasis which is busying itself in fund raising and getting tremendous help from Waterford Rotary and from Concordia, a well-known women's organisation in Waterford, and from various other sources in order to provide hostel accommodation or crisis intervention accommodation for homeless women and young girls.</P>
    <P>Mr. Martin Arthur, to whom I spoke about this problem, the person I referred to connected with the St.  Vincent de Paul, told me of two young women in Waterford last week.  They gave them accommodation in a night room just for a couple of nights in order to sort them out.  He felt badly when they were not able to do this for any continuing period, and he had to let them go wondering what on earth would happen to them.  We must not ignore the fact that there is a danger both for young men and for young <Col N="550" /> women, especially in a port city, of being attracted to prostitution and crime and abuse of one sort or another.  We have to make sure that the services are there to help people like them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of this Bill and I absolutely subscribe to the humanitarian beliefs which underlie it.  There is a serious social problem which should be and must be tackled both at this end of ensuring that there is statutory provision for housing and more importantly, at its root cause.  That is difficult, of course, and it really depends on the interaction of individuals within their own community. Legislation is required in order to deal with what is at present a grey and anomalous area.  I feel strongly that there can be no room in our response for attitudes of prejudice, hypocrisy or silence in the face of this human tragedy which affects a growing number of Irish men, women and children.</P>
    <P>There is total confusion as to where the responsibility lies.  The Simon Community did a survey of 15 county homes. It is very interesting to see the extent of the confusion.  Five of the county homes which were surveyed by Simon thought they had a statutory obligation to provide accommodation.  Eight of them thought they did not, and two did not know. Official Government policy is that institutional care may be provided for individuals by the health board, but one health board at least do not accept that view. Others acknowledge responsibility for people called genuine mendicants, which is a very interesting turn of phrase.</P>
    <P>Another of the health boards surveyed by Simon specifically disavow responsibility for able-bodied, single people.  No mention is made of their psychological or psychiatric state, which is as much an illness as physical illness and should demand a response.  The homeless, therefore, find themselves in a limbo.  It is a limbo of bureaucratic and official confusion. They are uncounted and their needs, since they have never been ascertained, are not being responded to, hence this legislation before the House.</P>

I have shown a remarkable amount of patience, for a man of my temperament, on this issue over the past 12 months.  I have tolerated a succession of broken promises.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to me of contributing to the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill promoted by Senator Ryan.  In <Col N="555" /> doing so I am standing in for the Minister for the Environment who is unable to be present.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State at his Department are, arising from this country's Presidency of the EC, attending a major Environment Council Meeting in Brussels this week.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is not something that the vast majority of our citizens ever face. Perhaps this is one of the main reasons that the plight of the homeless has not been accorded the priority that it might have over the years.  But the success, and I would count it as such, of housing policy in catering for the housing needs of the population at large, must not distract us from the need to protect and assist minority groups, like the homeless, who have special problems.</P>
      <P>The Government have no arguments with the objective behind this Bill.  As the Minister for Labour, then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, clearly said during an earlier debate, the Bill is an obviously well intentioned and socially concerned measure.  I agree with this assessment.  But I must say also that the Bill as it stands does not offer a solution to the problem of homelessness.  Its effect would be to create confusion and cause disruption in our housing programme and in the provision and letting of local authority housing. It is essential that there should be an orderly process whereby persons in need of housing &mdash; families, the elderly, single parents, disabled or handicapped persons, the homeless, travellers, etc. &mdash; are dealt with fairly on the strength of their relative needs and without placing any category in a superior position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to repeat in full the various difficulties the Bill in its present form poses since the present Minister for Labour has already dealt with them in considerable detail.  These difficulties have to do mainly with the broad definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; in the Bill, the concept of &ldquo;threatened homelessness&rdquo; it introduces, the imposition of an enforceable duty on local authorities to house a single category of persons giving them a superior right over all others and the <Col N="556" /> difficulties a binding duty of that nature would create for authorities faced with limitations on the resources likely to be available to them.  I would simply say that the Government consider that the approach taken in the Bill would be damaging to the existing well tried system whereby local authority houses are allocated to those most in need without replacing it with any acceptable procedure for determining priorities among persons seeking local authority housing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions need to be designed to afford access to local authority housing for the genuinely homeless without seriously disrupting the allocation of houses to persons currently on the waiting lists or creating alternative avenues to local authority housing.  The Government examined the possibility that Senator Ryan's Bill could be amended to make it acceptable.  It emerged that this was not feasible and that any attempt to do so would fundamentally alter the tenor of the measure and would not give a satisfactory outcome. In these circumstances the Government undertook to bring forward their own proposals in legislation framed after reasoned consideration of all the implications and forming a properly integrated <Col N="557" /> housing code which would avoid major disruption of established principles of the public housing programme.  In paragraph 5.88 of the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government have reaffirmed their commitment to legislate in this area.</P>
      <P>While there is a clear need for new legislation to provide for the needs of the homeless, it is regrettable that the impression is often given in debates on homelessness that little or nothing is being done for the homeless under the present arrangements.  This is not the case.  During 1983, for instance, local authorities made 363 lettings to homeless persons or over 4 per cent of all lettings made in the year.  That figure does not include lettings made to members of the travelling community, some of whom would come within the definition of homeless persons.  There were as well nearly 400 more homeless persons on local authority waiting lists at the beginning of the year.  While single homeless persons may necessarily have a lower priority in comparison with families in unfit or overcrowded conditions the efforts local authorities are making to cater for the homeless should be given recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the role of local authorities, a number of voluntary bodies have been active in the provision of housing accommodation for particular categories of persons.  I would see a continuing and positive role for such bodies availing of financial support from the Department of the Environment and local authorities. Earlier this year major improvements were made in the scheme of assistance to voluntary bodies providing housing accommodation.  Under the revised scheme local authorities may provide loans to meet 80 per cent of the cost of an eligible project subject to a maximum loan equivalent to £16,000 for each unit of accommodation provided, including caretaker accommodation.  The loan charges which would have been payable in respect of such loans by the voluntary bodies will be met in full by the Exchequer as long as the accommodation continues to be let in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  Most importantly <Col N="558" /> in relation to today's debate the scheme has been extended to include, for the first time, the provision of housing accommodation for homeless persons.  The terms of the new scheme are generous and have been widely welcomed.  They will, I hope, give a worthwhile boost over the next few years to the provision of appropriate housing accommodation for the categories of persons covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>The national plan also includes a number of other important provisions designed to improve the availability of local authority housing for letting to persons not able to provide housing from their own resources.  These include undertakings to provide accommodation annually for 9,000 households on local authority waiting lists and measures to ease the demand for such housing by retaining and improving incentives to private housing.  In the latter context the new £5,000 grant to tenants and tenant purchasers vacating their local authority houses to purchase a private house should make a significant contribution.  By increasing the flow of vacancies from the existing stock of rented houses, the new grant will improve the capacity of local authorities to provide accommodation for persons, including homeless persons, most in need of it.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I would like to say that the existence of the acute social deprivation of homelessness in our society is as unacceptable to me and to the Minister for the Environment as it is to the Members of this House who have come out in support of Senator Ryan's Bill.  It is one of the prime objectives of this Government to take all steps reasonably open to us to alleviate the plight of those unfortunate enough to find themselves homeless.</P>
    <P>The proposed Government legislation in this area will be of considerable benefit to the homeless in ensuring that their needs are accorded proper priority in the allocation of local authority housing.  But it must be understood that the legislation cannot deal with the homeless in isolation from the housing needs of other priority groups.  It will, therefore, be a major and complex measure embracing a number of <Col N="559" /> other important facets of housing that have arisen since the promise of legislation was first given.  Among these are legislative provisions required to give effect to the Government's statement of 20 July last on policy in relation to travellers chiefly the need to clarify the responsibility of housing authorities in relation to the housing of travellers and the provision of halting sites for them. In addition, the proposed legislation will provide statutory backing for a number of major initiatives announced in the national plan, for the £5,000 grant to which I have already referred and for the scheme of major structural improvements to &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; and older rented local authority housing.</P>
    <P>All in all, the forthcoming Bill will be a comprehensive one on the preparation of which work is now well advanced. Because of the complexity and far-reaching implications of the measure it is not possible for me to give a definite date for its introduction.  However, my understanding is that the Minister for the Environment is hopeful that the Bill can be presented in the course of the next parliamentary session.  I trust that Senators will accept that the prudent and advisable way of securing an improvement in the lot if the homeless who are undoubtedly among the most deprived in our community is to await the measure the Government have undertaken to bring forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the <Col N="560" /> adjournment of this debate last week I was disputing the accuracy of the motion we were debating.  I was questioning the implication in that motion that there were serious or damaging cutbacks in the financial support being made available by the Government to the health services. These points were being made from the other side of the House.  I was basing my argument on the fact that the amount of Government finance being made available to the health services has been increased in the present year and that the commitment under the national plan over the next three years is substantially to increase the amount of finance being made available to health care and services and that because of that it was inaccurate to suggest or imply that there was a cutback in the health services or in the amount of finance being made available for the health services.  It was based on that increased financial commitment by the Government that I was making the argument that the motion in itself was inaccurate.</P>
      <P>I quoted some figures last week.  The contribution from central funds to the health services in 1984 was £968 million. Under the terms of the national plan it is proposed that that figure be increased by substantial steps each year up to 1987 to a figure of £1,123 million.  That represents an increase of almost £140 million over the period.  How could such an increase rationally be described as a cutback?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also stated that at a time of scarce financial resources I saw every merit in any system that encouraged health boards or any other organisation or institution in receipt of State funds to measure the value of their activities and to deploy effectively the resources available to them to eliminate any waste that was occurring in their area of operation.  In general terms I am not satisfied that such an exercise has been engaged in by health boards, at least up to now.  Statements from some health board executives were quoted here last week.  It is the usual about of moanings coming from any organisation that is told its performance can be improved and that there is room within its activities for the better deployment of <Col N="561" /> resources or the better servicing of the activities it is engaged in.  These moans are to be expected.  I outlined one case in relation to my own county where I objected to the tactics being used by the Mid-Western Health Board to extract finance from the Government by using the opening of one hospital as being dependent on the closing of another very necessary one.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister and the Government are fully aware of the needs of the health services and health care in Ireland and that the commitment they have expressed in the national plan is there to ensure that the fullest possible resources will be made available for health care and services.  Because of the points I raised today and last week, I believe the motion is inaccurate, it is not based on sustainable facts and it may cause fear and concern amongst sections of our people who are dependent on health care and services and that is unjustified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose in the first place to say a few words about the resources which will be available for health services this year and in the period to 1987 and on the planning framework for the health services which is contained in the National plan.</P>
      <P>As regards the current year the position is that no extra funds can be provided for health services by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  This situation cannot be changed.</P>
      <P>With regard to future years the non-capital provision for 1985 will be £1,019 million.  The provision for 1986 will be £1,078 million and the provision for 1987 will be £1,123 million.  The expenditure by health agencies cannot exceed the levels which these allocations will support. These are substantial expenditure levels bearing in mind that in 1973/74 net non-capital expenditure on health services amounted to about £143 million, representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP. In the current year expenditure is estimated at £1,087 million, representing about 7.5 per cent of GNP.  In other words, relative to our national wealth, expressed by GNP we are spending almost 50 per cent more in real terms on day to day health services provision now than we were spending ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One important advantage in the present situation as compared with previous years is that we know with certainty what resources will be available up to and including 1987.  Despite inherent difficulties <Col N="563" /> this is certainly a step forward in the advance planning process.</P>
    <P>This has undoubtedly been a difficult year as regards the management and provision of health services.  In the aftermath of a decade and more which had witnessed a steady, sustained and unparalleled growth in the level of financial and personnel resources made available to the health services, the urgent need to control the levels of public expenditure has meant that the resources available to the health services have had to be limited, in line with the overall budgetary limits on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to expect that in a situation which called for curbs in the growth of public expenditure generally, the health services which absorb almost 20 per cent of overall public expenditure could be exempted from the requirement to secure reductions in costs.  The situation required immediate action to identify and implement measures to secure alignment of expenditure with allocation levels.  I am glad to say that in general health agencies responded in a most co-operative way and, by various strategies, succeeded in reducing costs substantially.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of the various health agencies, however, it now seems likely that a number of health agencies will exceed their 1984 allocations.  The outlook for 1985 would be considerably improved if overruns in 1984 could be eliminated or minimised.  Clearly there is still some way to go before expenditure is brought into line with what can be afforded and, to do that, it is clear that all concerned will have to work together in a more planned, purposeful and coordinated way.</P>
    <P>Of course the application of restraint to any programme of health expenditure is a difficult process to carry through, particularly so when the need for constraint follows after a period of steady, sustained growth in expenditure and personnel as has been the experience in the health services.  The motion before the House perhaps unwittingly highlights the dilemma inherent in attempting to satisfy <Col N="564" /> an insatiable demand for yet more and more increasingly cost intensive services while at the same time grappling with the reality of cash limits and financial boundaries in the real world.  The reality of financial boundaries must be faced. Options have to be selected and real choices have to be made.</P>
    <P>It is strange that some wish us to increase health expenditure in cash terms <i>ad infinitum,</i> with little or no regard to the taxation resources base from which services must at the end of the day be funded.  The major problem inherent in the constantly escalating cost of delivery of any given volume of health services is one that simply must be faced, tackled and, if possible, overcome.  Although spending on health services, in real terms, has roughly doubled in the last decade or so, no one will seriously attempt to argue that the population are twice as healthy now as they were at the beginning of the decade.  Senator Robb correctly pointed out that it does not follow that an increase in the resources provided for health care will result in a healthier people.  This and the absolutely essential overall need to control public expenditure within a planned framework impelled the Government to include in the national plan specific allocations for health services for each of the years 1985 to 1987 as well as certain decisions as regards where costs should be reduced and some planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>There are three points stressed in the plan in relation to approach and attitudes which are worth mentioning:</P>
    <P>(i)  First, wherever possible and justifiable, Government assistance in the social area should become more specific and more carefully aimed at, and delivered to, the poor and underprivileged &mdash; those in need &mdash; instead of using generalised measures which provide help to the better-off, who do not need it, as well as to the poor. (Para. 5.14).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Second, all possible measures must be taken to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the administration of the social services. (Para. 5.15).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> (iii)  Third, it is important that everyone in the community &mdash; whether those in the public sector administering the social services, or the recipients of the services, or all taxpayers financing the services &mdash; should be prepared to accept changes over the years.  The needs of the country have changed greatly in the last decade so that the range of social services and the way in which they are provided must also change. We must all be prepared to accept a reduction in, and even abandonment of, established services and structures which are no longer appropriate to current needs or requirements, so as to enable an efficient and streamlined system to provide economically for the needs of the future.  (Para. 5.16).</P>
    <P>In relation to the health services, a number of tasks have been highlighted. These might be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  Promote health (a task which involves many Departments and agencies) and prevent illness.  (Para. 5.34).</P>
    <P>&mdash; I might point out that already the Government have provided tangible evidence of their intention to develop health promotional campaigns by allocating an extra £½ million to the Health Education Bureau in 1985 &mdash;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Wherever possible (provided it is cost-effective) provide services on a community or out-patient basis; in the medium to long-term bring about a redistribution away from institutional services.  (Paras. 5.35-5.37).</P>
    <P>(iii)  Make necessary in-patient care available to all; improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness by closures of outmoded or non-essential facilities and by improvement of information systems.  (Para. 5.38).</P>
    <P>(iv)  Maintain a range of care and support (welfare) services, with particular reference to children at risk, low income groups not availing of services, and the disabled.  (Para. 5.39).</P>
    <P>(v)  Continue to improve efficiency. (Paras. 5.45-5.48).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> We must also take account of the objectives and targets which have arisen or will arise out of recent or pending reviews of aspects of the health services, for example:</P>
    <P>&mdash; review of organisations of community care;</P>
    <P>&mdash; report of working party on GMS;</P>
    <P>&mdash; review of psychiatric services;</P>
    <P>&mdash; review of mental handicap services;</P>
    <P>&mdash; implementation of the Green Paper on the Disabled;</P>
    <P>&mdash; review of the public health nursing service;</P>
    <P>&mdash; implementation of systems policy and programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash; implementation of Children and Adoption Bills.</P>
    <P>These reviews will lead to a more rational and effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the revenue Exchequer allocations for each of the three years have been determined at £1,019 million in 1985, £1,078 million in 1986 and £1,123 million in 1987.  The expenditure on health services must be aligned with these allocations.  The allocations take into account the specific measures incorporated in the national plan and the Government decisions associated with it.  The main features include the following:</P>
    <P>(i)  Specific decisions in relation to pay budgets.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Any excess expenditure over budget in 1984, or, indeed, subsequent years, must be absorbed.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Private and semi-private in-patient charges will be increased to realise about £4.6 million additional income in 1985.</P>
    <P>(iv)  A contribution of about £1.4 million in 1985 is to be secured from hospital consultants in respect of the <Col N="567" /> use of public facilities for private practice.</P>
    <P>(v)  Savings on drugs expenditure in the GMS of £2 million are to be achieved in 1985.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The Government have decided that, throughout 1985, the arrangements where by two-third of vacancies occuring in the Civil Service &mdash; excluding vacancies arising from career breaks &mdash; are held open will continue in force and that measures at least equivalent in effect in terms of the numbers of posts, which must remain unfilled and/or their pay costs, are to be applied in health agencies.</P>
    <P>In spite of the constraints affecting public spending generally the Government have allocated funds for the following specific purpose in the health services:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a sum of £2.5 million has been set aside in each of the three years for improvements in community services; as I have already mentioned £½ million of this is being made available in 1985 to the Health Education Bureau for health promotion purposes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a similar provision has been made to enable a limited number of new units of accommodation to be commissioned.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusions as to the magnitude of the task which we face.  If there were not any overruns in 1984 our task would be considerably easier.  The position in respect of the two subsequent years will not be quite so difficult provived the budget allocations for 1985 are adhered to in full.</P>
    <P>We obviously need to have a clear strategy, a detailed plan, and arrangements for implementation which will be capable of being closely monitored and adapted, as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>In this regard, every major health agency has been requested to formulate a comprehensive plan setting out in detail <Col N="568" /> the precise actions which the management of that agency feels will have to be taken in order to ensure that the agency concerned will firstly live within the framework of its financial allocation and that, secondly, the local plan prepared by individual agencies reflects the general philosophy and intent and specific decisions of the national plan.  This will place a much greater emphasis on the managerial capacity of those who are charged with administering and managing the health services at local level.  There have been some disparaging remarks made about the emphasis that the Minister has placed on the responsibility of health boards in particular to manage their services effectively and efficiently within the framework of the financial allocations made available.  These criticisms overlook the fact that the delegation of very substantial responsibilities to the health boards was one of the foundation stones of the regionalisation structure which was established in 1970.</P>
    <P>Obviously in drawing up their action plans, health agencies will be examining all areas of expenditure in order to identify opportunities for reducing costs.  Some of the obvious areas which must be looked at include, reducing the level of admissions to hospitals and institutions. A more rigorous admission and casualty department policy is needed in general hospitals to ensure that patients who can be treated in the community are not admitted to or treated in hospitals.</P>
    <P>Secondly, surplus institutional facilities should be identified and closed.  This is a very difficult issue.  But it would be foolish to allow the quality of service in essential facilities to be threatened while resources are wasted in maintaining facilities that can well be done without.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, careful and detailed consideration should be given to changes in the role/use of certain in-patient facilities.  A number of approaches could be envisaged under this heading.  Indeed, when the Minister for Health recently met, in County Kildare, the chairmen and the chief executive officers of health boards and indicated some of the things that I am now going to mention, they were, of <Col N="569" /> course, used for political purposes at local level by a certain number of chairmen who were there.  Various combinations of the following actions might be taken:</P>
    <P>(i) reduce the number of seven-day in-patient beds;</P>
    <P>(ii) reduce seven-day beds to five-day beds;</P>
    <P>What we mean by that is: why keep a patient in hospital over the week-end if he is due for discharge and could be examined on Friday and allowed home?</P>
    <P>(iii) increase use of out-patient facilities;</P>
    <P>(iv) convert small hospital to health centre/hostel/day activity centre;</P>
    <P>(v) redeploy or retrain staff for work in their existing institution or in another institution or in the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan in the course of her remarks ridiculed the notion of five-day beds.  The point is that all beds need not be manned on a seven-day, 24-hour a day basis, because many patients can be dealt with to finality within a period of five days.  I have previously elaborated on that.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we have to reduce expenditure on pay.  The actions taken in relation to the closure or change of use of hospitals could contribute under this heading. In addition, action could be taken under various other combinations.  For example, we need to examine very carefully the extent to which we can:</P>
    <P>(i)  Maximise non-filling of vacant posts, consistent with maintenance of agreed standards of service.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Reduce locum cover.  <i>Prima facie,</i> there are wide variations between boards in the extent to which savings are being achieved under this heading.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Restructure rosters to improve efficiency.  There is insufficient information available to enable an assessment to be made of the potential savings under this heading.  However, it is an option that should be quickly <Col N="570" /> examined and the implications of change fully assessed.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Introduce permanent, part time staff.  This would enable a more flexible approach to rostering and would enable staff to be concentrated on the work at the busiest times.  This suggestion is already being examined in the Department as an alternative to widespread job sharing.</P>
    <P>(v)  Reduce the volume of premium pay.  The key question is to what extent we can run our hospital services on a five or six day week basis.  The rostering of staffs on Sunday is particularly expensive.</P>
    <P>In the area of improving efficiency the Department of Health, with the cooperation of health agencies, have already carried out a number of studies. In the general hospital sector these have ranged over purchasing, heating/lighting, housekeeping and transport.  Further cost efficiency studies are now being undertaken in the area of hospital admissions policy, the excessive use of hospital laboratory services and, arising from these studies, an examination is underway into the potential of five day wards and indeed day-beds as a real alternative to traditional practice for the many persons who do not require total continuous hospitalisation but yet who find themselves subject to long and inconvenient stays in hospital at present.</P>
    <P>These new initiatives are not an academic exercise.  The findings which emerge will be of considerable significance for the future of the services. Already, useful and practical recommendations have emerged from these types of studies and have been communicated to the executive agencies in terms of principles of good practice.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate reference was made to the disparity between costs in similar hospitals.  In the area of comparative costing the Department have made available to various hospitals data as to how they compare with similar hospitals as regards costs and prices etc.  This type of information will &mdash; I hope &mdash; help <Col N="571" /> agencies to identify particular areas of weakness in their own operations as regards financial performance.  It is also intended to develop and to refine these comparative cost data as an integral part of the accelerated movement towards greater value for money in the health services.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, in addition, that there be readily available detailed information and data on the financial consequences of decisions taken by the medical profession.  We need to identify clearly the expenditure involved in treating individual patients and specified categories of patient, categorised by specialty or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The new management information systems currently coming on stream, will be extremely useful in this regard by providing ample opportunity and scope for the introduction of much more sophisticated costing systems.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the successful implementation of the national plan requires a co-ordinated, planned approach to the management of the service as a whole and tremendous co-operation among all parts of the service.  It will not be enough for each agency to allocate the available funds between programmes, even if these allocations accurately reflect the philosophy, intent and decisions of the plan.  Clearly, in the light of previous experience and having regard to the multiplicity of fronts on which the problems must be tackled, a detailed plan must be drawn up by each health board and agency, setting out in sufficient detail the precise actions which have to be taken in order to ensure that the level of expenditure is brought into line with the approved allocations.  The decisions required to do this will have to be taken quickly. After all, the biggest challenge arises in 1985.  As I have already mentioned, the major health agencies have been asked to produce plans on these lines.</P>
    <P>Over the next month or so, therefore, the concentration must be on achieving three things.  First, it will be necessary for each agency to draw up a realistic action plan setting out how it proposes to ensure <Col N="572" /> that its expenditure in 1985 will be in line with the approved allocation, taking full account of the liability arising from any excess expenditure incurred in 1984. Secondly, in the case of health boards the available funds must be distributed between programmes to reflect the assumption made in the action plan and the policies for health set out in the national plan.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that all of this and the continuing effort through the period of the plan will place a great strain on health agencies and their staffs.  Nevertheless, I am sure that most people will welcome a situation in which we now clearly know what has to be achieved over the next three years.  What must be faced up to is the need to set real priorities in the provision of health services.  This has become much more pressing than was previously the case.  Here again the national plan sets out a clear framework for the development of the necessary strategy.  In a nutshell, we will have to become much more selective in focusing and in targetting the aims of public expenditure generally, and this argument applies to the health services with a particular force.  The most vulnerable groups will have to be protected and services for these groups in particular will need further development.  Given the fact that the financing of our health services must be funded within a ceiling of fixed cash limits over the next few years, a reallocation of resources is now called for.  I am confident that with the co-operation of all concerned the difficulties which will inevitably arise can be overcome and that the financial and planning targets set out in the national plan will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the time at my disposal I am unable to deal in detail &mdash; I certainly would not want to prevent Senator Killilea from making his contribution &mdash; with the points raised in the course of the debate on the motion before the House.  Nothing that has been said provides any real evidence of a disimprovement in the standards of essential services.  Indeed, despite the chorus of criticisms, the financial restraints which have had to be applied to the health services in recent <Col N="573" /> times have been absorbed without any serious impact on the structure and volume of essential services.  It has been acknowledged that despite the expenditure limitations we have excellent health services.  We intend to ensure that within the framework of the national plan, the essential fabric of the health services will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The motion implies that the Minister is not as concerned as he should be about maintaining the level and quality of health care.  This is scarcely to be taken seriously.  The Minister has demonstrated that he is totally committed to strengthening and improving the health services on the basis of the substantial resources allocated for the services in the period to 1987.  It would be naive to think that difficulties will not arise, but the Minister is confident that if all concerned work together in a constructive manner these difficulties can be overcome. Accordingly, I consider that the motion is inappropriate and should be rejected.</P>

      <P>After listening to two-thirds of the Minister's speech here tonight, I feel it very appropriate that Senator Howard should leave this House with tongue in cheek after the statement that he has made in which he said that the Government have made and will continue to make an abundance of financial aid available to health services.  I say no more because I think people will consider that statement made by him and the statement made by the Minister as to be very contradictory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on numerous occasions before, being a member of the Western Health Board, we find ourselves in a very precarious position at this time.  For the last four months the essential question asked at our health board meetings and by members of every political party present &mdash; many of them very senior members in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party &mdash; and which the Minister, and the Minister of State tonight, have not answered was: have they defined or will they define or <Col N="574" /> do they ever intend to define for the health boards a list of the priorities and a list of the essential services which we have to maintain?  It has been mentioned in the Minister of State's speech here tonight, again only at the very end &mdash; almost missed, actually &mdash; cleverly and intelligently put in at the end of a speech which had no bearing whatsoever as a statement of fact in regard to what are the basic priorities and the basic essential services that the health boards must supply.</P>
      <P>At the very opening of the Minister of State's speech he used phraseology which I believe should not be used by this Government or any Government.  The statement is contained in the second paragraph.  He states that this situation cannot be changed.  I would rather suggest to the Minister of State that the words used there should be &ldquo;will not be changed&rdquo; supplemented by &ldquo;during the term of the Coalition Government.&rdquo;  Any Minister for Health with compassion in his heart will have to change the situation of the health services and the health boards.</P>
      <P>I want to say that the language has been chosen well for the Minister rather than by the Minister.  It is very significant in this debate on the health services.  The reality is that no matter how many pages of a document we receive from the Minister, the health services are denuded this year of £37 million.  It is a fact of life which has been given out and agreed upon by the chief executive officers of all the health boards and by chairmen of all health boards together in a joint statement at the meeting mentioned by the Minister of State in County Kildare recently.  To me, that is preposterous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last two years &mdash; and there is no Member of this House or the other House or any health board who cannot and will not agree &mdash; we have pruned the health services to the demand of the Department and the Minister to an extraordinary extent.  Many health boards have pruned the flesh into the bone.  The Minister and the Department are now asking us to prune the bone <Col N="575" /> of the health services.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I can only speak for those I represent in the Western Health Board.  Last Monday we were told by the Minister that we had to prune the Western Health Board again this year by a further £4.04 million.  Even before we began the debate on this particular pruning we discovered that the Department only allowed us an inflation rate of 5 per cent when the national statistics tell us that we are going to have an inflation rate of 7.7 per cent.  Even before we talked about it the Department had cut back our allocation by £489,000 by not allowing us the going rate for inflation.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years we have been asked to prune staff employment through all hospital grades in the first year by 1 per cent and in the following year by 2 per cent.  We did that.  Now we are being asked to make cuts again in the staff of our hospitals.  The national figure given was in excess of 1,000 people.  As far as we are concerned in the Western Health Board, we are not capable of adjusting ourselves to the budget allowed to us by the Minister, particularly taking into account the most important facet of it, which is that neither the Minister nor the Department has defined clearly what are the essential services.  We classify as a gift given to us in the Western Health Board a scanner machine in Galway, the last post in the west, which is being left there, maintained by those who put it in but funds for staffing arrangements and costs estimated by the Department have been consistently refused.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the Seanad of the motion on the Adjournment that I have down about the maternity unit and the disgraceful situation which prevails in Galway city where we have a unit which cost £4.6 million lying idle.  We were forced into the situation of closing the fever hospital in Galway to try to give some skeleton staff for an extension of that building.  We had the most recent situation where an expectant mother, while waiting on a trolley to be admitted gave birth on that trolley.  She was accompanied <Col N="576" /> by her husband.  I think this speaks for itself.  I am disappointed again tonight, as I have been in the past, that the Minister of State, Mr. Donnellan, has not brought home this situation to the Department and his Minister.  It is a scandal in the west of Ireland today.  Any Government who condone it should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not going to talk about the other services which we have cut.  We had Senator M. Higgins, on the Government side, at our health board meeting the other day raising the question of orthodontic services.  I will not elaborate.  I could not elaborate on the facts in the manner he did in the health board.  I suggest that the Minister pick up the minutes of that meeting and see what he had to say.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows of the crazy situation regarding the supplementary welfare allowances which are billed to the county council and owed to the Western Health Board.  We are at a stage where we now have a bill of £2.4 million in County Galway and we are unable to pay it.  We recently found out why.  We have now discovered the reason in two comparative figures.  In the case of the Western Health Board the State grant total was 24 per cent whereas the North Western Health Board got 73 per cent.  I ask is this government?  I put it clearly to the Seanad, that this Minister for Health who is not present here tonight has a hatred unparalleled by any administrator ever in this country towards the west of Ireland and specifically towards the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The Minister should let Deputy Desmond teach him some manners. The fact is he is saying the options have to be selected and real choices have to be made.  But he forgot to say by whom &mdash; the health board members.  In his speech he said:</P>
      <P>Wherever possible and justifiable Government assistance in a social area should become more specific and more carefully aimed at.</P>
      <P>Where are the prophecies of days gone by that they would look after the social welfare aspect of the bills from the health boards to the county councils?  There is no mention of it in this document.  The Western Health Board are still owed £2.5 million from the county councils.  We will skip through this magnificent document read here tonight and come to page 6:</P>
      <P>We must also take account of the objectives and targets which have arisen&mdash;</P>
      <P>But of course these have not been defined for us.  The poor fools in the health boards have to define what they are, but the Minister will tell them what they must do.  He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" />&mdash;or will arise out of recent or pending reviews in respect of the health services&mdash;</P>
    <P>He gives the options:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to review the organisation of community care&mdash;</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the reorganisation of community care which went on in our area, and the Minister of State must know this.  In Carna we had a day centre which we could not keep open, although we asked for finance to so do.  Yet in this document he says that we must review the organisation.  What this means to the health board people is that we must close more centres.  That is the way we have to take it.  We have to get our £4.04 million. Then comes the most abominable statement of all, and it brings the point back to Senator Ferris:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the review of the psychiatric services, for example.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister of State allowed that to be put in?  In a public statement made recently it was said that we would have eight closures of psychiatric hospitals. Therefore, Deputy Desmond must have meant what he said in Kildare when he passed the remark to our chairman and CEO that he could close three psychiatric units.  We cannot, and will not close three psychiatric units.  I will give this message to this abominable Minister for Health, not to the Minister of State, because I know he is only the boy, the puppet.  The Minister for Health should be ashamed of himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Opposition would define the word cutback as not getting what they asked for.  The only basis I have before me is what my health board have asked for.  My health board asked for an allocation and we got an increased allocation over the previous year but it is not what we asked for.  We term that as a cutback, if you like.  A previous Minister for Health from the Fianna Fáil Party was the first man ever to talk about cutbacks in health services. Senator Killilea might like to know that Deputy Woods was the first Minister for Health to make it obligatory on health boards to cut back their staffs by 5 per cent.  That is the first time that I as a member of a health board, ever heard of the word cutback in regard to staffing &mdash; obligatory cutback of staffs.  We had no option, and I disagreed with it.  I disagree now with the Minister asking us to have a blanket cutback in staffing levels throughout the health services.  I said that not only tonight but weeks ago during the debate on the national plan.  I feel it is an area that cannot be dealt with in the broad sweep of some official's pen, to say that you cannot have an increase of staff in health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give you statistics to prove it.  If we look at the staffing levels in the various hospitals throughout the country there are some regions which are more advantaged than we are.  I am not denying that the west might be one of those regions &mdash; I can only speak for the South Eastern Health Board.  I know that the staffing levels allocated to us do not compare in any way with health boards throughout the rest of the country.  I would be failing in my responsibility as a member of the board if I did not put that on the record of the House for both the Minister of State and the Minister himself.  I can prove that our health board run their health services £2.5 million cheaper in comparable terms than any other health <Col N="582" /> board in the country and we still have problems.</P>
    <P>What does the word &ldquo;cutback&rdquo; mean? It is a cutback in what we have looked for.  I would wish that the economy would be able to stand for all the things that I, as a health board member, could look for, but because the Minister for Health, who is not present to defend himself, is confined to a specific budget which he has to allocate to the best of his ability, health boards cannot be given all they ask for. I have asked the Minister to look at the various allocations that are being made to the various health boards.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the allocations were as follows: the Eastern Health Board, £347.75 million, which equals £292.4 per adjusted head of the population; the Midland Health Board got £66.80 million, which equals £321 per head; the Mid-Western Health Board got £87.30 million, which equals £390 per head; the North Eastern got £77 million which is £273 per head; the North Western got £76.40 million which works out at £367 per head; the South Eastern Health Board got £106.96 million which works out at £275.4 per head; the Southern Health Board, the one with all the problems, got an allocation of £152.97 million, which works out per head of the population which they have to serve at £291.3 per head, and the Western Health Board got £120.07 million which is £352.2 per head.  They are the comparable figures throughout the country.  My health board deliver a service which is second to none, cheaper than any other health board of comparable size.</P>
    <P>I have to come to grips with the word used in the motion &mdash;&ldquo;cutback&rdquo;.  There can be cutbacks if we cannot get enough money but there can also be disadvantages for areas that are trying to be efficient and are being compared unfavourably with institutions in Dublin, specifically. The staffing levels in Dublin are four or five times greater than any other part of the country.  We started with a disadvantage and we finish up with one.  When times are tough we are expected to tighten our belts the same as everybody else, but on a comparable basis we suffer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> I will refer to the average weekly cost per occupied bed because the public will want to know the cost of the provision of the health services by the health boards set up under the 1970 Act with a statutory responsibility to use their funds efficiently and to ensure that the services are delivered to the people who need them; there has been no suggestion by either the Minister or the Minister of State that anybody should be refused a hospital service over a weekend.  What we are advocating is that acute hospitals should be available to give a service when it is required and that there should be no unnecessary occupancy of the beds over weekends &mdash; to have a person lying in bed for two days and not being seen by any professional consultant in the hospital is a waste of public money.  If that person can be at home, he should be at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not be in hospital if he could be at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  Now we have health boards making definitions of what their roles are.  Nobody should be in hospital who should not be, and nobody should be brought to a clinic in a hospital when the need does not arise.  Thousands of people are being brought into clinics every week and are being looked at momentarily by consultants and are told to come back the following week.  This goes on and on.  I have proof of this.  One needs only to go to these clinics and ask the patients there.  This is the procedure, and we have to depend on the consultants' advice.  Consultants have been asked by members of our health board if they bring in people for consultation who do not need it.  The answer you always get is that if an operation is performed it is the appropriate thing to bring back that person to hospital continuously over a period.  That person could be taken care of by their own GP.  If there was a necessity to send people back to the hospital, that is quite acceptable.  Because of this the whole system is clogged.  Clinic service should be available to people who need it, not because it is nice to see <Col N="584" /> hundreds and thousands of people going to clinics in ambulances.</P>
      <P>Members from both sides of the House will come to terms with what it costs to deliver the health services.  There is a tremendous responsibility on us to ensure that the services are delivered efficiently. Voluntary public hospital cost per bed per week is £871.  Voluntary special hospital cost is £802 per head per week. The cost of the regional hospitals per bed per week is £842.  The county hospitals, which have been decried by previous Ministers, professors and people who want to rationalise the health services, have a fee of £674 per week.  The district hospitals have a cost of £287.  The district long-stay hospitals have £267.  The geriatric hospital cost per week is £159 and the health board welfare homes have a cost of £85 per week.  Those are the comparable costs for which a service has to be delivered. The Minister said in his speech that people who require private or semiprivate services in some way should be subsidised by the taxpayer.  As a Labour Party representative I should like to state that if somebody needs a specialised private hospital service he should pay for it. Scarce resources should not be given to the elite who want to go to those hospitals. Then you have a cry from the VHI people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How can we do it when we have calls from the other side of the House asking the Government to subsidise private treatment also?  The Minister has stated that he is asking for increased amounts to be paid by people who require private or confidential services and let them pay for it.  Otherwise, if they are entitled to the service &mdash; and the 1976 Act states that everybody is entitled to a hospital bed &mdash; let us have the money for it.  Anybody requiring any other kind of service should be expected to pay for it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see that the consultants and others are now being asked to make a contribution.  This is only right.  It is intolerable that anybody engaged in the health services should not make a contribution to ensuring that the services can continue.  Not alone does this stand for the statutory demand that is made on councils but it should apply to the demand that is being made on the private sector to pay their health contributions. In the health board of the south-east we have a figure of £6 million due by people on their health contributions and other charges being made by the health boards up to now.  These have been transferred to the Revenue Commissioners.  This money is due from people who need the service and still will not pay for it.  The PAYE worker has to pay for it all the time, and he is expected to provide a service every day it is wanted.  We must be honest with ourselves in dealing with this whole question.  If we are we will have served some useful purpose in discussing the various options that are available to us under the limited budget that appears to be available from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a commitment to the health services; he wants to ensure that every £1 that he has available to him will be spent correctly.  I am quite sure that there is no proof in any of the allegations that he has any discrimination against any area in the country.  He has to allocate the funds available to him and I am depending on the members of health boards, whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, to do the job to the best of their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> We still will have problems.  Over the past three years at least we have brought some capital projects to fruition that Fianna Fáil failed to do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the object is of this.  I am listening to a Minister who has not got responsibility for this Department shouting across at this side of the House.  I thought that Ministers were not supposed to judge contributions from either side of the House.  I wonder is it because he got a kick on the shins earlier that he decided he had better give a kick in the ankle; then when he got a kick in the thigh he has decided to do something about it.  Having said that, this motion was put in so that we could talk about a very unfortunate situation that has arisen.  One of the last things that Senator Ferris said was that we built hospitals which are not being used.  I agree totally with him.  We built a 14-bed extension to the maternity section of the County Hospital in Kilkenny at a time when there were up to 40 people in the corridors in that hospital.  I make no apology to anybody for being to the fore of looking for an extension to that hospital. There are still 40 beds in the corridors of that hospital and the 14-bed extension is still there but we cannot get staff, as Senator Ferris should know, to open that unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not particularise; but I am particularising.  There is no point in talking about capital extensions unless the staff are available.  The South Eastern Health Board were told that that 14-bed extension can be opened but it has to be staffed from within the existing staff of <Col N="587" /> the South Eastern Health Board area. The people of Carlow will say quite plainly that the only way the extension in Kilkenny County Hospital can be opened is if the maternity unit is closed in St. Bridget's in Carlow.  That is exactly what the health board have been told by the CEO in Kilkenny; that is the only way it will be opened.</P>
    <P>The national plan makes big play about bringing community care into the health services, that we should have an extension of community care.  At the same time it states that the only way community care can be extended to the areas in which it is needed is to use the existing staff, and there will be a 40 per cent decrease in staff over the next four years.  It is a beautiful concept that we will extend community care, which is what we all wish to have.  We do not want people in hospital.  We want them to stay healthy in the first place but if they become ill we should provide that they can be looked after by the community health officers in their own houses and be brought in occasionally for check-ups.</P>
    <P>Over the next four years, according to the national plan, £4 million will be spent in Kilkenny on an extension to a hospital which already has a 14-room extension that we cannot handle.  We are going to spend £4 million on that hospital but we will get no staff for it.  Where is the logic in that?  The builders will get a certain amount out of it, and anything a builder can get at present he deserves.  I cannot see the logic in spending £4 million.  I suggest that that is throwing £4 million down the drain.  That is only Kilkenny. Senator Ferris cannot disagree with that, unless we are given the staff in that area.</P>
    <P>Senators have mentioned the concept of free hospitalisation for everybody and that if anybody wants specialist treatment he or she should pay for it.  That is what closed 90 per cent of the hospitals in London over the last couple of years. Everybody was given free hospitalisation and nobody could get specialist treatment. In London if one has an in-grown toenail it will take seven weeks to get an appointment with a doctor and it will take <Col N="588" /> seven months to get treatment for it, if one does not get somebody to pull it off with a pliers.  Basically it is the pliers pulling that is going on in the British medical service because of the complete extension of the free health service area. How did the Government decide to deal with this?  Charge the consultants for private use, a recipe for total disaster.  It costs a lot of money to become a consultant. It costs the State a certain amount of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs the person who decides to become a consultant a big sum of money, but not alone that: he does not get consultancy status until he is at least 30 years of age.  He has little time in which to recoup for himself and the State the value of his experience.  If the consultants are run out of the country we will be doing the same as they have to do in the Middle East and the Third World countries, building up huge blocks in Blackrock, or wherever, and giving consultants extra money to do operations which are not being done in the countries from which the patients come.  We can force the consultants out of the country; it is the easiest thing in the world to do that, but it is very difficult to get a consultant to come back.  It is equally difficult to get a consultant to the stage when he is capable of going into a hospital to take care of every patient.  I think at times that consultants are paid too much but I never think that they do not give every patient the degree of individual care needed.</P>
      <P>We have a stupid situation in Kilkenny where there is a private hospital, a St. John of God hospital, with 100 beds, which is quite capable of being used by the public health service, but the public health service will not even use it on the basis of transferring patients who have already got over their operations for a convalescent period because the Government think that that would be going away from the socialist principle.</P>

      <P>We have an auxiliary hospital there which has a 12-month waiting list.  We have a St. John of God hospital which was built by the St. John of God nuns who did not take one penny of public funds, but because of the stupidity of this Government we cannot use it to help to ease the very dangerous situation that arises when corridors are clogged. The health services are being clogged because of stupidity.  The Fine Gael people in the Government might not think they are not going totally against the grain in not using the facilities in the St. John of God hospital.  It has the best laboratory facilities.  It has magnificent rooms.  It has everything that could be desired.  It is available to the health services but, because of a socialist principle, it is considered preferable to leave patients in corridors rather than move them to private hospitals.</P>

      <P>The question of bed prices was mentioned.  This was used in a very distinctive way, as if the hospital bed was the only cost.  The inference was that if you went to a regional hospital it would cost much more than a district hospital or a geriatric hospital.  There is no way you can get into a geriatric hospital in Kilkenny.  I agree totally with Senator Ferris that the South Eastern Health Board are doing their best and their cost per patient factor is less than it is anywhere else.  Cost per patient is not everything in the health services.</P>

      <P>We submitted this motion to express in the strongest possible way the great concern that has been shown by the ordinary man in the street, by the medical profession, by the nursing profession, by people who understand what is happening in the whole area of medical care, because of the fact that the standard of health care is declining rapidly.  The tenor of the debate, particularly from this side of the House, reflected the fury of our members at the suggestion that all is well when we know that is not the case. Our involvement in local health committees and various health boards has given us numerous examples of clear cutbacks in the provision of health services.  We stuck quite clearly to the factual position. There is positive proof from Donegal to Wexford of what is happening.</P>
      <P>No matter what is said about the famous or infamous national plan, it will not impress me, or the man in the street, or the person who knows anything about a health board, whether he be a CEO, or an ordinary member, or a member of the administration staff.  Nowhere in the plan is it even suggested that there might be hardship in the years ahead.  There is no mention of the fact that the allocations will be reduced by £37 million over the next year.  There will be inflation in that period so, in real terms, the reduction will be much more.  There is nothing in the plan about two-thirds of the vacancies in the health boards not being filled over the next few years.  There is nothing in the plan which says there will be a cutback in the pay-rolls.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked what are cutbacks. He suggested, very unfairly, that it is what the Opposition want.  That was a most unfair comment.  Cutbacks mean wards closed, units closed, operations not taking place, food cutbacks.  In the past in St. James, they provided nice desserts. Now they have been told to cut out tinned fruit and custard.  Because our health boards cannot get the money there will be cutbacks.  Because they cannot get the money patients will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> The Minister of State has given the impression that all is well.  Let us go back to the factual situation: a cutback in beds, fewer admissions and patients being sent home as soon as possible.  Last week a person in hospital in the west who was not well enough to leave was asked to leave on Friday.  He was unable to go home.  He had to stay in bed.  They pleaded with him to go home.  When Senator Killilea refers to &ldquo;Monday to Friday&rdquo;, perhaps he may be exaggerating a little, but the point is that much of what Senator Killilea and other Senators said is true.</P>

      <P>We have cutbacks everywhere. There are cutbacks on locums, on overtime, on week-end work.  I have already referred to food and other such areas.  Orthopaedic units are being closed.  There are no hip or knee replacements in the Southern Health Board areas.  Psychiatric problems are growing every day of the week.  There is an air of no confidence in the country.  There is low morale with the result that more and more people are seeking psychiatric advice.  Psychiatric hospitals are being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the Evening Herald that 7,000 people have drink problems.  We know the Health Education Bureau are doing great work to solve the drink problem. They placed suitable advertisments in newspapers and on television advising people to drink in moderation.  Yet the Government, in their famous national plan, proposed an extension of the drinking hours &mdash; a kick in the pants to the Health Education Bureau who are doing such good work in this area.  The Government extended the drinking hours when nobody, not even the hardened boozer, wanted that.  The publicans and <Col N="592" /> their staff do not want it.  I would accuse the Government of double standards in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea referred to the scanner in Galway.  In my own town, Athlone, we have been told to cut back on the ambulance service because of re-deployment. There was a serious accident outside Athlone about six weeks ago.  The injured were taken to Portiuncula Hospital in a van.  Yet our fire brigade can travel into Galway.  Roscommon, Offaly and Longford to quench a bog fire, or whatever, while our ambulance service is denied movement to accidents outside our town.  The facts are exactly as I have explained them.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we had a blaze of glory.  I congratulated the Minister for Health on telling us that in Athlone we are getting an orthopaedic unit and a casualty centre.  I know that plans are going ahead, but I also know that the Midland Health Board, acting wisely applied at an early stage to the Department of Health for staff.  They were told: &ldquo;You have to make savings in the rest of your staff.  You have to redeploy.  You have to move them from here to there. You cannot get extra staff.&rdquo;  Yet in the debate in Dáil Éireann, Deputy Ormonde referred specifically to Athlone.  He said he could tell Athlone that he had bad news for them.  Because of good management they were able to move staff into the hospital.  When they went back looking for an extra allocation this year, they were told: &ldquo;You were able to save and we are cutting you by the amount of money you were able to save.&rdquo; They lost out totally.  We will lose out totally.  The intentions of the Minister may be good and honourable, but Athlone will not have an orthopaedic unit because it will not be staffed.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard sang the praises of the Government.  He thought we were in an area of movement to a level of health care unprecedented in this country.  He is alone in that view because, all over the country, members of the Fine Gael Party, councillors, urban councillors and county councillors, and Labour members, are very critical of the Government.  They <Col N="593" /> must all be out of step except Senator Howard.</P>

The very people he talks about, the people who were referred to in the famous Joint Programme for Government, the poor, the sick, those who cannot provide for themselves, are the people who will be penalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this very important local issue to be aired here tonight.  First of all, I would like to outline the diary of events to date in the effort to provide a new vocational school for Castleisland.</P>
      <P>In 1972 due to the local need the Kerry VEC decided that a new vocational school was needed in the area.  They went ahead and sought out a site in Castleisland for this purpose.  In September 1974 a site near the present community centre was purchased for the proposed new school.  By June 1976 the transfer of the site was completed.  By January 1977 details of the number and type of rooms required was forwarded to the Department by the VEC.  In February 1978 there was a meeting of the CEO and staff in Castleisland.  The CEO at the time, Mr. McDwyer, promised that the school would be available for September, 1980. As yet it has not become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1978 the Department of Education forwarded their list of rooms to the principal and to the CEO.  In October of the same year the teachers sent back their comments on the Department's <Col N="596" /> list of rooms that was forwarded to them and they reluctantly accepted the recommendations by the Department. Again they stressed that there was a need for more practical rooms as opposed to the number of academic rooms that were proposed at the time.  In May 1979 there was a special meeting at the Department of Education offices in Dublin and full agreement was reached here on the size of the school and the type and number of rooms.  Mr. Heneghan, who was an architect at the Department of Education at the time, promised that capital was to be provided at the end of 1980 and that a contractor would be on the site at the end of 1980 or the beginning of 1981. Present at that meeting were Mr. McDwyer and Mr. Tarrant, who is principal of the school, and Mr. Kennedy of Kerry VEC.  The time-scale of planning and building was discussed and agreed on in detail.  In August 1979 a sketch of the plan was forwarded to the Department. In March 1980 there was an about-turn by the Department of Education.  They sent back a new list of rooms reducing the size of the school.  Their argument was that due to the fact that the growth in second level education was over there was no point in building a school of the magnitude proposed.</P>
    <P>At the end of March 1980 a revised schedule of accommodation was examined by the CEO and senior staff in the school and referred back to the Department accepting the new reduced school size but requesting an increased number of specialist rooms to include more practical rooms and a language room as well, which I think has more relevance now as a result of the recent EC Summit here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In July 1980 the Department replied. They would not accept any change in their list of accommodation.  Several letters from the CEO and the County Kerry VEC were sent to the Department requesting the Department to accept the local list of accommodation as it was the least they could accept.  Otherwise, they would be accepting a school with a large number of general classrooms and a small number of practical subject rooms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> In October 1982, a developed sketch plan of the new school had been approved. By July 1983 final plans were forwarded to the Department of Education. In May 1984, the plans were revised by the Department and this included a change in the boiler-house from automatic to manual.  A bill of quantities was started and completed by mid-October 1984.  On November 5 1984 the bill of quantities was sent and received in the Department of Education for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to go into the history of Castleisland vocational school and its contribution to the community over the years.  Castleisland vocational school was built in 1935.  The year 1985 will be its jubilee year and indeed it would be a fine gesture if they could get a new school in that year.  The catchment area extends over a wide area.  In most places, it is densely populated, in areas northwards towards Knocknagashel it is sparsely populated.  It extends westwards from Faranfore and Ballymacelligott, overlapping with the Tralee catchment area where it is competing for students and because of the lack of facilities is losing students as a result.  It extends northwards to Abbeyfeale, County Limerick.  It is competing with the very well-facilitated vocational school in Abbeyfeale.  It extends southwards to Scartaglen and here it is overlapping with both the Rathmore and Killarney catchment areas.  It extends eastwards to the Cork boundary, to Deputy Creed's own constituency, overlapping with Boherbue comprehensive catchment area.</P>
    <P>There are pupils crossing over from the Castleisland catchment area into these areas and travelling to school sometimes at the expense of their families because of the lack of proper facilities in Castleisland. The average enrolment of pupils in Castleisland vocational school over the past ten years has been 286.5 students. The current enrolment for 1984-85 school year has been 291.  Recent surveys carried out in the area on the school-going population show a slight increase in the number of students.  There has been a <Col N="598" /> slight increase in population.  At the present time, there are four permanent classrooms.  These were erected in 1935. There are two semi-permanent classrooms which are flat-roofed and covered with felt.  These were erected in 1958.  There are, 11 per-fabs erected from 1967 to 1979.  These, no doubt, were erected in response to the growing need for education at the time as a result of free transport and free education which were introduced at the end of the sixties.</P>
    <P>The rooms are widely scattered and are totally unsuitable for modern large classes.  Timetabling of schools curricula and groups is very difficult as a result of the placement of the pre-fabs.  The pre-fabs are in very poor condition.  They are costing the VEC large amounts of money to maintain.  The structure of the pre-fabs is disintegrating and they will have to be repaired very soon or replaced &mdash; hopefully &mdash; by a new school.  The heating cost has soared over the past ten years.  The fact that the pre-fabs are poorly insulated renders them almost impossible to heat adequately.  No doubt this endangers the health of both, students and teachers alike and is not very conducive to learning. A wide-ranging curriculum is available in the school, both practical and academic, and also social and religious developments are catered for despite inadequate facilities.  A vocational preparation and training programme and a senior secretarial course are made available to the students.  No doubt the curriculum would be greatly expanded and improved if the new school and its resources were made available.  This would be of immense benefit to both the pupils and the community alike.</P>
    <P>The school provides the only metalwork and woodwork facilities for students in the catchment area.  The other two schools in the area do not provide these facilities.  These subjects are continued to leaving certificate as Engineering and Building Construction respectively.  The present classroom accommodation and teaching facilities are totally inadequate to meet the demands of students and the community alike in these subject areas.  Both subjects <Col N="599" /> are being taught in pre-fabs, and although the students have been very successful in intermediate and leaving certificate examinations in these subjects nevertheless they are at a considerable disadvantage when they compete with students who have experienced better schools and better facilities for places on apprenticeship schemes and for entry into third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The school at the moment has no science laboratory; science is being taught in two pre-fabs where there is very little equipment.  No individual experiment units are available, and only a few very dangerous sockets.  This environment, I feel is totally unsuitable for the learning and teaching processes alike. Again, it is very unfair for the pupils and no doubt affects their future prospects if they wish to seek a career in the areas where science subjects are essential.</P>
    <P>In the subject areas of home economics and secretarial studies the present accommodation is obsolete.  The home economics room having been designed in 1935 has no modern cookers or other cooking facilities.  It is half the size of the proposed room in the new school.  Let me add that it is part of the policy and the philosophy of the school to encourage as many of the male population as possible in the school to study home economics.  It is part of their co-educational process in the school.  Secretarial studies are carried out in a pre-fab also.  The availability of typewriters and space is no doubt a limiting factor.  I would like to point out that the school offers the only full secretarial course in the area.  To satisfy this need a proper secretarial room is required.</P>
    <P>Computer studies are being offered to the pupils from first year.  This no doubt is due to the very good principal in the school and his initiative.  Again, this is not being offered at the other post-primary schools in the area.  The school also provides an extensive adult education programme, the only school in the district that provides adult education.  I am sure the Minister realises the importance of this.  Courses in metalwork, woodwork and home economics are available to <Col N="600" /> adults.  However, the scope of participation is restricted due to the lack of facilities, and let me add, the lack of car parking facilities in front of the school.</P>
    <P>As the school is the centre of an agricultural region the staff have made efforts to introduce practical work in both horticulture and agriculture.  However, they find this impossible and have been hampered by the lack of land.  In fact, the land that was originally with the school is now covered with pre-fabs.  They have no space to grow horticultural produce or to carry out any type of practical work in those two very important areas.</P>
    <P>In the proposed new school adequate space will be available for this type of field work.  Emphasis is placed on this type of work in the school.  There has been a lot of interest shown by the pupils in both agricultural and horticultural field studies.  The present art room is converted from the old woodwork room built in 1935.  There is no library in the school. Geography is taught in a pre-fab, with very little space for wall charts, maps and other visual aids.  Having been a former geography teacher myself I realise how difficult this must be for both the teachers and pupils.</P>
    <P>There are no social areas available where pupils can sit and talk during break times and generally take recreation. There are no PE facilities in the present school.  In fact, the pupils have to travel long distances to the local playing pitches and to the community centre for games and PE.  Again, I may add that the new school will be built next to the existing community centre in Castleisland.  No doubt this will enhance the pupils' health and it should lead to more use of the community centre in Castleisland.</P>
    <P>Because of the inadequate facilities available both the students and the community have suffered much over the years.  To be properly prepared for our modern technological era the pupils must have the required facilities, otherwise they will be at a considerable disadvantage when they go out and compete with pupils from more facilitated schools.  The adult population deserve the chance to continue their education and to acquire <Col N="601" /> skills they were unable to acquire &mdash; or were deprived of &mdash; during their school years.  This is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>The new school will provide up-to-date science facilities, including a proper science laboratory, secretarial facilities which will involve the use of computers and word processors, a modern history and geography room, an art room, a multi-purpose room which can be used for PE and drama and other school activities; a library which will be of tremendous benefit to both the pupils and teachers for reference purposes and also to adults in the area; a new home economics room which would further facilitate the school's philosophy towards encouraging co-education in this area; and new woodwork and metalwork rooms which would help to prepare, the pupils more adequately for their future and help them in their preparation for future employment by enhancing their prospects in the job area.  The site of the new school &mdash; as I said before &mdash; is close to Castleisland community centre.</P>

      <P>The pupils will be in a better position to use the facility of the community centre when they are in the new school.  The local athletic club, in co-operation with the VEC, intend to provide a running track in the grounds of the new school.  However, it is a source of disappointment to me that there is no language laboratory in the new plan.  If we are to become adequate at languages such as French and German a language laboratory is an essential part of any school.  I would like the Minister to consider this for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I take this opportunity to congratulate the principal and teaching staff of Castleisland vocational school on their dedication and service to their pupils and community in rather difficult circumstances over the past ten years.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is no further delay within the Department <Col N="602" /> concerning the school and that it will go to tender early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I have no notion of going into all the details which Senator Deenihan has outlined or to go over the road which he has travelled in relation to commitments and promises made already.  Invariably, in a situation of that sort where you have debates on school buildings and where you have local communities and local committees involved in the promotion and the development of a new school, there are quite a considerable amount of pressures.  I have no doubt that Castleisland has been on the mat for a considerable time.  I do not intend to go into the area of the facilities available in the existing school, about which I am sure Senator Deenihan has a very thorough knowledge.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record here this evening, in reply to Senator Deenihan, the sequence of events which led to the current situation in relation to the school. My Department have approved the provision of a new vocational school at Castleisland to provide 325 places.  Planning has reached a very advanced stage. The bills of quantities have been submitted to the Department by the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee and are now under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator speaks of successive delays over a period of ten years.  There has been no deliberate delay in the planning of this school or, indeed, of any other school.  It must be understood that in estimating the provisions to be made each year for capital school building a variety of factors must be taken into consideration, such as the number of projects already under construction, the number of projects reaching completion and the number of new projects to reach the architectural planning stage when the contracts may be placed.  Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that our needs exceed our resources in the matter of capital for school accommodation and that a system of priorities in the handling of applications for additional or replacement accommodation must be operated. <Col N="603" /> Although we may be aware of certain schools, capital and personnel restraints may inhibit the initiation of planning.</P>
    <P>In the case of Castleisland there has been contact since the late sixties between the vocational education committee and the Department concerning the conditions at this school and at their other schools, with a view to the overall development of post-primary education facilities generally in the area.  The existing accommodation has only six permanent teaching spaces, four built in 1935 and two built in 1968.  The remaining accommodation consists of temporary pre-fabricated rooms provided at various times between 1967 and 1975.</P>
    <P>With future development in mind the committee was continuously on the lookout for land on which to build a new school.  Finally in February 1973 the Department advised the committee to open negotiations in regard to the possibility of acquiring a particular site which appeared to be exceptionally suitable. The committee did this and a site was eventually purchased.  However, it was only in early 1975 that the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee applied to the Department for approval to proceed with the development of permanent buildings at Castleisland.  This was only one out of ten projects proposed by the committee.  Before giving their approval the Department had to examine their ongoing commitments and it was in April 1977 that approval in principle to the provision of a new school, to cater for 325 students, was conveyed to the committee, with the proviso that it would not be possible to initiate planning in 1977.  In July 1978 the Department commenced discussion and correspondence with the committee, with the object of taking the project into the building programme.</P>
    <P>The Department advised the committee that provisions would be made for a new school for 375 places &mdash; not 325 as originally estimated &mdash; and sought agreement on the range and extent of new accommodation to be provided.  Schedule of accommodation was agreed to by the <Col N="604" /> committee in March 1979.  In May of that year a planning briefing meeting was held with the committee's design team in order to initiate the planning of this project. A site report and an outline sketch scheme was submitted by the committee on 19 September 1979.  While this was being examined the question of the number of pupil places to be provided was reviewed.  In the light of the current enrolment trends it was decided that 325 places would be sufficient for the foreseeable future.  This necessitated a revised schedule of accommodation to be provided and also the submission by the committee of a revised outline sketch scheme. The committee wished to have full provisions made for all the practical and scientific subjects, including both building construction and senior metalwork, subjects which had been taught in the school since 1974.  It was not possible to meet the committee's wishes within the limit of our area norm without causing a serious imbalance between teaching areas and areas for ancillary accommodation plus circulation.</P>
    <P>Discussion was ongoing during 1980 on the matter.  Finally, in May 1981 a revised schedule of accommodation was agreed, which, by skillful re-arranging of spaces met fully the needs of the school for specialist subjects at a cost of a mere 100 square metres above our usual area norm.  This, however, was a very exceptional measure.  The committee submitted a revised outline sketch scheme to the Department in November 1981, although outstanding documentation was not received until February 1982.  In March, the committee was advised that their planning approach, as shown in the outline scheme, was considered satisfactory as a basis for proceeding to the next stage. The developed sketch scheme was submitted to the Department in July 1982. It was necessary to carry out the revisions to this stage but it was finally cleared in January 1983.  The next stage &mdash; that is the detailed working drawings &mdash; was submitted in July 1983.  Whilst this documentation was under examination it was necessary to carry out a review of all projects in course of planning with a view <Col N="605" /> to rationalisation to ensure that in our existing financial climate there would be no unnecessary duplication of scarce resources and that there would be the maximum amount of co-ordination and integration in the provision and use of school facilities.  This meant that the approval to prepare the bills of quantities for Castleisland could not be given until June 1984.  The committee submitted the bills in November and these are now being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the Department's building programme is carried out in accordance with well defined procedures. The procedures have been developed in response to the demands for the provision of suitable buildings in accordance with carefully worked out space requirements and cost planning for the purpose of having buildings provided as speedily as proper planning allows.  Standards of school design, cost control and effective administration have been set adherence to which will ensure that the programme of educational building required will be put through to provide buildings which serve their purpose well and achieve this economically.  When the wishes and requests of schools authorities are not in line with our procedures and standards, then it is necessary to work at the problem arising, and this takes up much time. Castleisland is at an advanced stage, and as soon as the examination of the bills of quantities has been completed and the <Col N="606" /> documentation found to be satisfactory, the question of allowing the committee to seek tenders will be reviewed in the light of our other commitments and capital availability.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that it is necessary to provide a new school at Castleisland and it is necessary to provide all the accommodation mentioned by Senator Deenihan.  As far as I am concerned I am only too anxious to try to replace, not alone at Castleisland, but at many other schools throughout the country the very bad pre-fabricated buildings where students are accommodated.  It is difficult for teachers to maintain discipline.  They are cold in the winter and hot in the summer.  I am well aware of the difficulties involved for teachers and students concerned.  We must bear in mind that we have not unlimited resources to meet the demands.  There are many pressing cases at present.  I will have the recommendations from my Department within the next two weeks.  I will examine them. I cannot, at this stage, give any further indication as to when this school will be allowed to go to tender.  There are many other schools in the country equally deserving, but I will see what I can do within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 December 1984.</P>
