      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.  I might mention that No. 2 is a resolution that arises out of an element which appears in the plan on page 46 and which it is necessary to pass before this provision can come into operation.  Accordingly, the proposal is that Nos. 1 and 2 would be debated together &mdash; No. 2 is part of No. 1 &mdash; but there can be separate decisions at the end, when we come to it.  It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 together from 2.30 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. and to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.  We will then resume and conclude the debate on the Private Members' Motion on the New Ireland Forum between 6.30 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the latest.  Then, to ensure that as many Senators as possible would be able to take part in the two-day debate on the National Plan, it is proposed to sit on after the disposal of the Private Members' Motion, No. 3, until 10 p.m. It is proposed to sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and that the final speaker on the Government side on Item No. 1 would be called at 4.30 p.m.  The matter would be concluded, and voted on if necessary, at 5 p.m. tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I would refer to No. 4 <Col N="1314" /> on the Order Paper.  It had been indicated to me that it would not be appropriate that this motion would be taken this week.  Would the Leader of the House indicate when it might be taken, and in so doing say whether it might be possible to extend the time for the taking of this report under the Standing Order on which it is being given Government time? The Standing Order provides that it would only have one-and-a-half hours of debate.  It is, as Members of the House will see, a very substantial report and I think it would be unfair to expect a reasonable debate in one-and-a-half hours.  I would ask if it would be possible to extend it to three hours, and when it might be possible to take the motion.</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter raised by Senator Robinson, if it had not been for the matter before us, it would have been my intention to propose that this item be taken today.  It will be taken on the next sitting day after this week, which it is anticipated will be on 14 November.  In regard to the question of extending the time for it, this is something which should be discussed among representatives of the various groups.  I am personally sympathetic to it and am hopeful that the debate could be extended from one-and-a-half hours to three hours.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the policies set out in the National Economic and Social Plan &mdash;<i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With its endorsement by the Dáil and, I anticipate, by the Seanad tomorrow, the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> ceases to be merely a Government document and becomes the property of the Irish people &mdash; their plan.  It will be the basis upon which they can make their decisions in relation to <Col N="1315" /> economic and social matters for the three years ahead.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that this plan, endorsed by the Oireachtas, should like other plans at an earlier period, cease to be an issue of contention between the parties and become the common ground upon which all of us can build together during these three critical years &mdash; build a solid foundation for the future progress of the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Seanad has taken this early opportunity to debate the document as I know from my own experience of this House, where I started my political career, that it has a capacity for a less partisan debate, and this, I believe, is pre-eminently an issue which should be discussed with a minimum of partisanship.</P>
      <P>This plan has been prepared under most unfavourable circumstances &mdash; after a period of economic stagnation, declining employment, rising unemployment and with the public finances grossly overstrained, an excessive level of current budget deficit, and an excessive level of borrowing.  This background has operated as a serious constraint upon the preparation of a plan for the three years ahead.  And there is a further external constraint: we are experiencing a period of limited and, to a degree, uncertain growth in the world economy and in world trade, which makes it impossible for us to base a realistic plan on assumptions about the external environment of the kind that could be taken for granted at the time when the First, Second and Third Economic Programmes were prepared in the late fifties and sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The content of the plan must be seen against this background.  There is absolutely no point in criticising the plan because it does not set out to achieve objectives which could not reasonably be projected as being likely to be capable of attainment in the conditions in which we find ourselves.  In fact, one of the reasons that has contributed to the generally &mdash;<Col N="1316" /> but not, of course, universally &mdash; favourable reaction to the plan outside the political arena has been the fact that it is clearly realistic in its assumptions and in the objectives which it sets out to attain. It does not promise what we all know is unlikely to be attainable in these conditions and within the timescale of the plan itself.</P>
    <P>At the same time, within these constraints the plan succeeds in offering a real prospect of progress in each of the areas in which, by common consent, progress needs to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Thus:</P>
    <P>&mdash; it sets clear limits to Government capital and current spending during the three years ahead, based on specific Government policy decisions affecting each head of expenditure.  The imposition of these limits will allow the whole of the increase in national output attainable during these years to be made available for the improvement of living standards and for increases in private investment.  This is in contrast to the last four years during which out of the stagnant national output public sector spending has risen leading inevitably to a reduction in the amount available for private investment and for the improvement of living standards</P>
    <P>&mdash; it proposes measures to create the conditions necessary for growth in employment in manufacturing and private services.  In addition it provides additional measures to stimulate both entrepreneurial and social employment, on a scale that is designed to reduce unemployment by something like 25,000 below the figure that would otherwise be attained.</P>
    <P>&mdash; it commits the Government to halting the increase in the burden of taxation as a share of GNP, and in particular to increasing income tax bands and thresholds with a view to halting, and, to some small degree at least, reducing, the PAYE burden during this three year period.</P>
    <P>&mdash; it proposes the concentration of <Col N="1317" /> Government funded social policies on the neediest sections of our society</P>
    <P>&mdash; as a result of the financial measures mentioned earlier it will reduce by about one-third both the current budget deficit and the public sector borrowing as a share of GNP.  Thus, by the end of the period, the diversion of an ever-increasing share of our tax revenue into interest payments on a mounting public debt will have been halted.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, perhaps, from the point of view of the creation of an atmosphere of confidence in which new investment can take place that will produce additional self-sustaining employment in the longer run, is the fact that the plan introduces into our economic and financial system an element of stability that has been lacking since the beginning of this decade.  For the first time since the eighties began, workers, farmers, entrepreneurs, the unemployed and young people have been given a clear picture of the shape of public policies for three years ahead; of the steps that the Government will be taking during this period to limit public spending; of the tax environment that will exist during this period; and of the nature and scale of public investment.  It is because the plan has reintroduced this element of stability into our system that it has been generally welcomed despite the fact that its targets are necessarily modest by comparison with other similar documents produced in the past under more favourable conditions, and despite the fact that it involves a commitment to restraint in spending under a number of headings, a restraint that cannot be welcome to those likely to be adversely affected by these decisions.</P>
    <P>Let me develop one or two of these points in a little more detail.  This Government have been determined from the outset to get our public finances under control &mdash; both in terms of reducing the current deficit and borrowing to a sustainable level, and in terms of controlling spending within each financial year so that it does not significantly exceed the budget targets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> Indeed, our work on the control of spending within the financial year began when the Government, under my leadership, took office in mid-1981.  At that time there had been an unhappy experience of expenditure during successive financial years running very far ahead of budgeted figures, with the result that the level of current deficits and borrowing had been higher even than the very large figures planned by Governments for these years.  It was clear that there were serious deficiencies in the control of spending within the financial year, as well as some measure of inadequacy in the decision making process designed to determine what that level of spending should be.  We introduced then and have since maintained the most stringent standards in respect of the projection of future expenditure needs on the basis of firm Government decisions taken in respect of public spending under each heading.  We also introduced a system of month-by-month monitoring of public spending, based on a monthly profile of the likely pattern of spending in each Department within the budget year.  The fruits of this were to be seen last year when the excess of spending over the budgeted limit was less that 1 per cent and they are emerging also in the current year as expenditure is being held firmly within the budget limits set.  At the same time the estimation of revenue in the budget has been improved, with the result that the flow of revenue to the Exchequer last year and this year has in each case been extraordinarily close to the figures projected at the time the relevant budgets were drawn up &mdash; despite the obvious uncertainties that must arise in connection with such projections.</P>
    <P>I mention these facts because they have not yet attracted sufficient attention either in the Oireachtas or amongst those commenting on our economic and financial affairs.  I emphasise that it is not mere coincidence that last year and this year our budget targets have been and are being so closely met; this has been the result both of the most stringent self-discipline on the part of the Government at the time when decisions were being <Col N="1319" /> taken on the Estimates and in respect of the budget and of an expenditure control system very much in advance of anything ever previously attempted in this State.</P>
    <P>The fact that both last year and this year the budget targets have been and are being so nearly adhered to has itself been helpful in restoring confidence in public sector financial management.  But this confidence has also been restored because of the evident determination of the Government to take all necessary action to reduce the current deficit and borrowing at a rate compatible with the avoidance of severe deflation of our economy but sufficiently rapid to secure the target of halting by 1987 the process by which, in all recent years, the share of GNP and of taxation absorbed by interest payments on national debt has increased with apparent inexorability.</P>
    <P>We are refusing to be deterred from this course of action by facile criticisms of being a &ldquo;book-keeping Government&rdquo; or of being over-preoccupied with &ldquo;financial rectitude&rdquo;.  Suggestions that we have pursued these financial objectives without regard to the impact of these measures upon our economy could scarcely be less well-founded.</P>
    <P>Our very first act in taking over the reins of Government in November 1982, was to modify what appeared to us to be the excessively draconian reduction in the current deficit proposed by our predecessors; we set a target of £900 million for the current deficit in 1983 as compared with the £750 million target in <i>The Way Forward.</i> Since then we have reviewed our commitment to phase out the current deficit completely by 1987, recognising realistically that with recent and current levels of interest rates, rigid adherence to this target would have had deflationary effects on our economy that would have been profoundly damaging. Accordingly, we have modified this constraint, aiming instead to reduce the current deficit and borrowing by one-third during the three years ahead.  I believe that this decision has been vindicated by <Col N="1320" /> its acceptance by the financial community, as well as by public opinion in general.</P>
    <P>We have thus aimed at, and I believe secured, a sound balance between the maintenance of progress towards a radically improved situation in the public finances, and sensitivity to, and flexibility in respect of, a changing economic situation, with a view to limiting the deflationary impact of the steps that we have had to take.</P>
    <P>Turning from this area of the public finances to the employment sector, we have in our industrial policy document taken steps to modify in a sensitive and sensible way public policy in this area with a view to accelerating the growth of investment in manufacturing industry and the expansion of private services. Aided by an improvement in the world economic situation and, thus, more favourable external conditions for exports of goods and services from this country, we have brought to a halt the decline in employment which over the past four years has reduced by 40,000 the number of people out of work in our State.  The situation we now face is one in which we can look froward to a recovery in employment in manufacturing and private services that will be only partially offset by the continuing reduction in the numbers at work in agriculture and in the public sector.  But we have not been content to accept the scale of employment growth that will be brought about by these measures designed to stimulate employment through refinement of public policies affecting the context for growth in the private sector.</P>
    <P>We have in this plan supplemented these measures by a number of imaginative schemes which bring the hope of employment to many who otherwise would, even with a recovery in private sector employment, find themselves without the opportunity of work.</P>
    <P>One of these schemes, the enterprise allowance scheme, has already provided 3,500 unemployed people with the opportunity of entering into self-employment and the demand for this scheme is continuing at a rate which gives us grounds <Col N="1321" /> for believing that, by 1987, over 10,000 people will through its effects have moved from the live register to self-employment.</P>
    <P>The other major scheme, introduced in this plan, is the social employment scheme, designed to provide part-time employment for people who have been unemployed for a long period of time and who are in danger of losing hope of reentering the labour force, and, possibly, in some cases, in danger of losing the capacity to work.  The implementation of this scheme is at present being pursued energetically by the Minister for Labour, with co-operation both from other Departments and from other agencies such as local authorities, who have shown a commendable willingness to join with us in making the fullest use of the opportunities provided by this scheme to offer employment to as many of the long-term unemployed as possible.</P>
    <P>While this scheme is designed to provide work for 10,000 longterm unemployed during the first year of its operation, I am hopeful that we shall be able to do a good deal better than this &mdash; but here, as elsewhere in the plan, we have deliberately set out targets cautiously. I would prefer that we over-achieve on modest targets than that we fail to achieve unduly ambitious ones.</P>
    <P>The plan also contains a clear commitment to halt the rise in the burden of taxation which has been such a striking feature of the last few years, as the bill for the massive increase in public spending during the late seventies and early eighties has come home to roost with the taxpayer &mdash; with whom ultimately, the buck for all public spending eventually comes to rest.  There is, I believe, universal agreement that the overall burden of taxation must not be raised any further and that any reliefs that can be provided must be concentrated on the PAYE taxpayer. The plan provides accordingly. The estimates of public spending for the years ahead, set out in the Plan, Department by Department, so far as current spending is concerned, and also in considerable detail in respect of capital spending, have been confined within the <Col N="1322" /> limits that can be financed by the present level of taxation as a share of modestly rising national output.</P>
    <P>It was not easy to achieve this result and the implementation of these provisions will involve sacrifices on many sides. But I believe that it is the clear will of our people that from this point onwards priority be given to halting the increase in the burden of taxation and to moving as rapidly as possible to a reduction in that burden; it is accordingly their will that the total level of public spending must be limited and restricted, however painful that exercise may be.</P>
    <P>The measures by which expenditure will be controlled are set out in detail in the plan; I believe that it is important that everyone should know from the outset precisely what are the limitations on public spending that we propose in order to achieve this taxation objective.  It will be clear to anyone who examines the plan that we have been particularly concerned to limit the cost of the general overhead of public administration.  We have preferred this course of action to the alternative of cutting out programmes which, in one way or the other, serve the public interest, either by promoting investment and production, or by providing for the social needs of our community.</P>
    <P>This has meant that the public sector is being asked to bear a very large part of the impact of these measures.  Numbers in the public sector, which already have been reduced as a result of the measures we have been implementing since we first took over Government in 1981 will continue to fall, and in the plan we have specified the limits of the resources available for public service pay during the three years ahead.  This latter provision is an essential feature of the plan.  There can, in fact, be no plan in any real sense of the word without such specific provision being made.  The failure to make such provision in all previous plans in fact prevented them from containing any financial targets whatever in respect of current spending.  In the absence of any such element in any previous plan, public spending has consistently run out of control, contributing both to the steady increase <Col N="1323" /> in the burden of taxation, and to the high rate of inflation in the economy.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in deciding to include in the plan specific cash limits for public service pay, the Government are taking a step which requires from the public service, a very great effort of sacrifice and self-discipline.  I know that there are many outside the public service who fail to appreciate the nature and extent of its contribution to the life of our community, and who have no understanding of the extent of the commitment and dedication that the vast bulk of the members of the public service show in serving our society. The fact that the structures of the public service have been allowed by politicians to atrophy over a long period of time, and that restructuring and reform is now needed in this sector, is not, and should not be seen as, a reflection on public servants who have loyally worked the system as it is, whatever they may have thought of it, and who have readily accepted changes, even radical changes, when Governments have set their minds to make such changes.</P>
    <P>I believe that the sense of commitment and dedication which I have mentioned will help to secure an amicable agreement on how the resources set aside by the Government for the public service during the next three years should best be deployed during this period.</P>
    <P>This plan is designed to face and to tackle the three different sets of problems, which have accummulated, one on top of the other, as we face into the closing two decades of this century.  The first of these problems is one which has been foreseeable for more than two decades, namely the impact of the demographic revolution which began in 1961 with the decline, and eventually, the reversal, of the persistent, and for much of the fifties, enormous problem of emigration. It was possible to calculate then, more than 20 years ago, that the scale of the annual labour force increase that would be facing us in the eighties and the nineties would require for its absorption into employment a sustained growth of national output beyond anything that had <Col N="1324" /> been achieved in Europe even during the height of the post-war boom.  So it has proved, although we have succeded in accommodating, for a period at least, part of this increase into a rapidly expanding educational sector, and especially during this decade into third-level education.</P>
    <P>What could not then be foreseen were the other two factors which have operated to make the achievement of such a rate of economic growth &mdash; never likely to be easy &mdash; in practice impossible for the time being at least.</P>
    <P>The first of these has been the slowing down in the rate of expansion of the entire world economy following the double shock of the first and second oil crises.  It may be that even without these two traumatic events it would not have been possible to have sustained into the last quarter of this century the historically quite exceptional rate of economic growth achieved world-wide during the previous 25 years.  However that may be, the fact is that the growth of the world economy and of world trade is today, and has been for some time past, much lower than could have been foreseen in the sixties, and our capacity as an open economy to achieve a high domestic growth rate has been affected accordingly.</P>
    <P>The second unforeseen factor has of course been the extent to which the mismanagement of our own finances during the past seven years has deprived us of the limited leverage that we might have enjoyed had we husbanded our resources and retained the financial lee-way necessary to offer our economy some domestic stimulus during this period of slow external growth.  Far from being in a position to promote growth in this way we have since the beginning of this decade been constrained by the scale of our current budget deficit and our borrowings to raise taxes and, now, to hold down public expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which this plan has had to be prepared.  The constraints have had to be recognised and faced.  We have had to cut our cloth very stringently but also I believe reasonably skilfully &mdash; making the most of what little <Col N="1325" /> lee-way remains to us in steering the economy towards the achievement, even if on a modest scale, of each of the goals that must now be ours &mdash; the expansion of employment and reversal of the rising tide of unemployment, the holding down of taxation, the tackling of social inequalities, and the stabilising of our public finances.</P>
    <P>No criticism of the plan that is not set against this background and that does not face these constraints has any objective merit.  Senators will, I know, be conscious of this reality and I look forward to their constructive contributions to the discussion of the national plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to this House, the House in which, as he said, he started his political career.  He mentioned that he hoped we would have a very constructive debate on this plan in the House.  I am sure we will, but I do not think he should expect that we on this side of the House should concur with everything he says and that if we do not concur we are not in actual fact being very patriotic, because that is what is implied.  Now that the plan has been passed through the other House he feels that if we do not go along with it then it is not as it should be.  Plans of this nature &mdash; I presume this plan is no different from any other one &mdash; give a little bit of truth to the advertisement which was placed in the newspaper by the person who was looking for a one-handed economist. When he was asked why he wanted a one-handed economist, he said he was fed up with people saying to him &ldquo;on the one hand&rdquo; and then &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo;.  I am afraid there is an element of on the one hand and on the other in this plan because as it is drawn up it is based not on specifics but on what might happen in international or national affairs in the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we are discussing the plan here, tomorrow we will vote on it and the day after that the same difficulties which are being faced today will be faced by each and every one living in this country as <Col N="1326" /> though this plan had never been produced. The introduction of the plan has given politicians, economic advisers, political analysts, and media gurus a respite from the actualities of life and has allowed them to mull over, analyse, and generally dismiss this plan as being nothing more or less than an attempt by theoretical economists and political and media handlers to fool the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a need to meet the crisis of today and in meeting the crisis head-on to give hope that the future is not something to be dreaded but something to be looked forward to with hope and confidence, based on the reality that exists and not the spurious reality of the economic plan.  In the past few years we have heard no hint of encouragement to the people of Ireland, young or old, that they should remain here and be able to live in relative peace and relative comfort and not be hindered by any Government-spancelled doctrinaire economic mores.</P>
    <P>We live in a country in which nobody is satisfied with his lot.  Unfortunately the actions of the Coalition Government have exacerbated the situation.  The incentive for people to become selfemployed has been taken away.  The incentive to employ people has been eroded by the penal taxation and levy systems that exist for both sides in industry.  The incentive to work has been eroded by taxation and also by the policies of the Government which have made workers suspicious of their employers and equally envious of the rewards gained by people who do not have the privilege of being able to work.  We are now in a situation in which industries where high skills are needed are not able to train apprentices and this will lead to the point when, even if there is an upturn in the economy, we will not have the skills available to take advantage in the engineering, construction and allied trades.</P>
    <P>The plan goes through every aspect of the economy with what at first reading of the précis given out with the full document seems to be a fine-tooth comb but on further examination, turns out to be nothing <Col N="1327" /> more or less than a re-hash of the documents on industrial policy published in July, the Green Paper on the national income related pension scheme, the Green Paper for social insurance for the self-employed, the Programme for Action in Education published in January, the 61st Report of the NESC, the Programme for Government, 1981-1986, the McKinsey Report on CIE and reports of the working group on the four year plan for agriculture.  Why has there been such an effort to portray this amalgam of reports as the panacea for all our troubles?</P>
    <P>If we are to have constant re-hashes of Government reports, I believe that the only people to benefit will be the printing industry who will welcome the business and will be able to cope with the extra workload by the use of high technology printing methods with very small increases in employment.  No document produced in recent times has been critically analysed to such an extent as this one. Certainly there has been no document which has been rejected so emphatically by all the social partners in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The plan does not, as the Taoiseach suggested in his summing up in the other House, restore confidence in the financial stability of our economy, the confidence of people of older and middle years in the State or the lost confidence of a whole generation in the possibility of effective democratic Government in the interests of social justice.  The Taoiseach is right when he refers to the danger to our social stability deriving from social injustices. Society has been destabilised in many ways in recent years.  I agree that in the sixties men of vision created the spirit and atmosphere to remedy the problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does neither himself nor his plan any good by continuing to run down the policies and personalities of the sixties.  His suggestion that economic recovery has to be the cause of moral decay is monumental in its naivete and an insult to the people who were involved in improving material standards for industry, workers and the underprivileged throughout the sixties and early <Col N="1328" /> seventies.  If there were more people in the Government who were committed to economic growth we might have more confidence in the results of this plan.</P>
    <P>The plan presents itself on a very broad base of economic conjecture at both international and national levels and it can be so far out in so many facets that it is probably more useful to economics students than to anyone who wants to plan for the future in business.  In the first section, at paragraph 1.19 we find what I see as the first major fault in the plan.  It is suggested, apart from the international recession, that labour cost increases were the other major cause of our non-competitiveness. It is true that there were labour cost increases but there were other costs which were of more significance such as energy, transport costs and taxation levels.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in paragraph 1.20 that the decline in output is starting to level off and that overall growth should resume early in the period of the plan.  From statistics produced by the CSO or any other source it is hard to see how this conclusion is reached as cement sales and employment levels are down and the lack of any major input into the construction industry by Government will not bring about a significant change in the near future.  The Government suggest the extra amount of moneys to be put into the road programme will bring about a significant upturn in the construction industry but it is a fact of life that road building is very capital intensive, not labour intensive, and since quite a major proportion of any road building programme will be done by our local authorities then the benefit to our economy by the programme will be lessened by the fact that the work will be done to contain the loss of jobs in the public service rather than to improve our overall economic situation.</P>
    <P>The bald statement in paragraph 1.27 that over the three years to 1987 the evolution of unemployment will depend on the generation of jobs, the retention of existing viable employment and on the growth and number seeking jobs is factual.  However, what concerns me and <Col N="1329" /> anyone who has to cope with the job situation is that the Government have no plan to decrease the number of people out of work.  The figures for current unemployment are already running ahead of what the plan envisages and although we wish we could say otherwise the facts do not give much hope for a brighter future based on the plan as produced. The Government have not produced in the plan any of the means to create the rapid employment growth as laid down in paragraph 2.4.  For example, where are the plans to encourage a degree of initiative and management effectiveness and plans for better industrial relations? How can we improve wage-cost competitiveness when we see a constant and increasing take of direct and non-direct tax from wage packets?</P>
    <P>We agree, as is stated in paragraph 2.12, that the past number of years have been traumatic for two main groups, the school leavers and the growing number of long term unemployed.  There has been a significant increase in the number of older workers being made redundant.  I fear most for those over 35 years of age who lost their jobs as there is absolutely nothing for them in the plan.  We have condemned to the economic dungheap people who have many years of experience to offer to employers and in many cases to the country.  We have lost years of both academic and non-academic training which has cost the State and individuals so much.</P>
    <P>We agree with the aims as stated in paragraphs 2.24, 2.25 and 2.26 which are recommended by the National Planning Board.  The plan states at paragraph 2.55 that the Government recognise the opportunities that exist in the fishing industry but makes no mention of the fact that on the advent of Spain to the EC we will have an increase of fishing in our waters which is likely to wipe out our fish stocks and our small fishing fleet.  There is no acknowledgment in the plan that the size of the Spanish fishing fleet and their knowledge of Irish fishing grounds over many centuries will do lasting harm to an industry which already has major problems because of quotas, energy <Col N="1330" /> costs, capital repayment costs and the problems associated with illegal fishing even by the Spaniards in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The Spanish fishing fleet has 17,500 vessels involved, with a gross registered tonnage of 750,000 tonnes.  The Irish fleet consists of 1,600 vessels with a gross registered tonnage of 36,000 tonnes and the Spanish fleet catches over 70 per cent of the Community fish take.  One of the main worries that has not been adverted to in this report at all is the fact that the Spaniards have well over one hundred third country agreements and that these third country agreements will be brought in by the Spaniards to the EC as happened in the case of very many other countries who were allowed to keep agreements with third countries.  The fishing industry on the advent of Spain is going to face not alone the problems that it has now but major problems that will be very hard to overcome.</P>
    <P>The problems of the agricultural sector are to a large degree totally ignored in the plan.  The Taoiseach did not mention that we have on the Order Paper here to be taken in conjunction with the plan the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1984, which will add £7 million to farmers' costs in each of the next few years from 1 November of this year.  I am not surprised that it was not referred to in the plan but it is something that Members in this House will be adverting to fairly often during the course of this debate. The plan states the problems in agriculture but does not go into any depth about how to promote recovery.  There is a clear acknowledgement that the industry is in decline and there is no sign of commitment to halting the decline.</P>
    <P>It appears from the plan's objectives that only those with a high degree of education and those planning profitable business developments will be helped in the future.  Those who can afford most to pay will benefit from the very excellent ACOT and farm development services. Mention is made at paragraphs 2.47, 2.48 and 2.49 of the need for greater land mobility and leasing and retirement schemes but no solution to any of these problems is put forward.  We are told <Col N="1331" /> that these are all being examined and I presume will be in the next plan which is proposed to be produced after 1987.</P>
    <P>In the section on tourism the objectives are laid down but there is a total lack of information on the planning by Government to achieve the objectives.  It appears that the onus is being placed on the industry to produce the goods.  It is by and large because of Government policies on taxation and energy costs that tourism is not doing as good a job as it is geared to do.  The only positive part of this section is paragraph 2.58 which would expedite development at Dún Laoghaire and the more important plan to set up a harbour authority in Rosslare where there is a need for a vast improvement in passenger handling facilities.  Since air fares are soaring and there is a huge increase in people travelling by ship, improvements at Rosslare are of paramount importance. CIE at present manage the harbour and due to inadequate funding the majority of tourists do not have the most pleasant first view of Ireland.  It is not because of the surroundings of Rosslare but because of problems arising from the work which has been going on for many years without any end in sight.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 2.59 the plan introduces a very controversial and almost universally accepted non-starter.  The proposal to extend licensing hours is not needed or likely to be of any benefit to the tourism industry since our tourist, generally speaking, is not the type who wants to spend extended hours drinking.  The tourist who comes here is not the type who goes to the beaches in Spain.  Our industry is based on ethnic tourism.  Many such tourists stay at home or go out for a few drinks with relatives and friends. Alternatively the tourist who comes here wants to see what we have to offer in terms of archaeology and places of historical interest.  The only area where there might be some value in this extension is the seaside town where there are large numbers of caravans and it is very hard for young parents to get out on a Sunday night.  That is the only area where I would see any merit in this proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> The reduction of excise duty on spirits was necessary in order to discourage the huge cross-Border trade which has built up in recent years but it will have a detrimental effect in that it will encourage more people to drink spirits than the pint of beer or stout, which is larger in volume but has a smaller alcoholic content.  This trend is already being seen.  It has reached the stage where a pint is dearer than a &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; and certainly a lot dearer than white spirits.  It is very nearly as dear as brandy.  Our priorities are wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government in Paragraph 3 admit to a serious deterioration of our road network and if the provision in the plan to increase expenditure on this network is implemented it will be more than welcome. I am disappointed not to see any mention at paragraph 3.25 of the long overdue works on the New Ross-Waterford road.</P>
    <P>On transport it is stated at paragraph 3.40 that legislation will be introduced in the next session to allow free availability of transport licences.  Any examination would show that there is a need for some liberalisation but full liberalisation would lead to even greater efficiencies than we have at present.  We have a licensed road haulier system which gives a very professional service at costs which at times are very much below economic returns and are based on the returns which road hauliers were getting in 1979.  These hauliers are competing at home and abroad while putting up with constraints such as the high imported cost of road haulage vehicles due to import taxes and VAT which make them much more expensive than those of their foreign competitors.  Spare parts are also enormously expensive here due to VAT and 25 per cent import duty. Road tax, insurance and fuel bills are higher than anywhere else in the Community. They still manage to keep our exports flowing and in the end the main beneficiaries of this excellence in road haulage are the banks, the hire purchase companies, the oil companies, the tyre companies, the insurance companies and especially the Government.  If we liberalise further we will have a build up of non-professional hauliers and firms investing <Col N="1333" /> in road vehicles which are not really necessary and will be under-used.  I believe that in the end the cost to the consumer will be more expensive.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.43 lays down broad outlines for the break up of CIE and it is very hard to comment on this until we see the arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the plan makes no mention of native coal having any part to play in our energy requirements. With the type of technology available I am of the firm opinion that Irish coal, even if of low quality, could be used by Irish firms using the fluidised bed system and I hope more thought will be given to further studies in this field which will be of enormous benefit to the economy, to Leitrim, Tipperary, Carlow, Laois and my own county of Kilkenny. A certain coal importer in Dublin wants to import 50,000 tonnes of anthracite which will be sold at approximately £200 per tonne.  I am sure this type of anthracite is available in Ireland and I am certain that we should give more thought to the use of crow coal, low grade anthracite and high grade anthracite such as is available. We should consider whether we should make an attempt to burn lignite and crow coal and this could be discussed with the people in Northern Ireland.  The lignite around Lough Erne is not being used to the greatest possible extent and this is a major national resource which crosses the Border to Arigna.</P>
    <P>The provision of natural gas to towns and cities should be speeded up.  I am not sure whether there is an ideological basis for the delays.  It would seem to be so because the only extension to the natural gas grid has been through Clonmel by a company which is owned by the local authority.  It would appear that the licence was given to them while licences are being withheld or delayed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I feel, as do many other people, that the drive to create new employment has been largely aspirational and lacking in palpable expression.  Despite the various measures taken at local and national level over the past few years to promote the training and employment of young <Col N="1334" /> people, their job prospects have worsened as the recession has deepened.  As the rate of unemployment has increased, so has its duration.  Over 2 million young people in the Community have now been without a job for more than six months and almost 1.5 million for over one year. In Ireland the seriousness of youth unemployment is emphasised by the fact that over 60,000 people aged under 25 are registered as unemployed.  It is felt that the special problem of youth unemployment in Ireland is directly related to the numbers seeking work for the first time. Under the plan there will still be overlap and duplication in the services provided for training, recruitment and job creation. I hope a serious attempt will be made to rationalise these services and adapt them to the needs of the users.</P>
    <P>The brunt of the effort in job creation in the plan seems to concentrate on the introduction of the new social employment scheme which will offer part-time work on a half-weekly basis for one year to persons who have been unemployed for over a year and are drawing unemployment assistance.  I am not too sure how this scheme will work in reality but for the sake of the unemployed I hope it can be made work and that it will not create problems with our employed who earn close to £70 per week after deductions and do not have the buffer of a half week's social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 4.14 &ldquo;alternance&rdquo; is a new word to me which does not suggest that it is anything else but on the job training allied with some element of off the job training.  The word might be new but the concept is not.  I am disappointed that the only mention in the whole document of sport is at paragraph 5.32.  It says that a national lottery will be advanced which will help in the attainment of sporting excellence, in the preparation of athletes or in the spread of sport in general, and it then goes on to say that only part of the proceeds of the lottery will go to sport.  There is no mention where the rest will go.  I presume that, like road tax and so on, it will go into the Exchequer. If we are to have a national lottery for sport, the money should be used for sport <Col N="1335" /> and nothing else.  If it is used for sport, the added benefits will not alone increase excellence in performance in sport but could lead to what is continuously being mentioned here by the Government: reduce the need for very expensive medical centres.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.76 says that in future community care will take over to a larger degree from in-hospital treatment.  That is a lovely aspiration but anybody working in the community care area at present will tell you there are not enough people involved in this area, that there are not enough small buildings and that there is not enough emphasis being put on community care.  The aspiration is there but unless money is provided to give the people working in community care the financial help needed, I am afraid that aspiration will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>The only mention in the plan that will benefit local authorities is that there will be an increase in spending for roads and that in 1987, when farmer taxation comes in, the farmer tax collected will be given to local authorities.  There is no mention of the problems local authorities are facing now or that they will face in the next couple of years.  There is no mention of the fact that 90 per cent of local authorities have run out of money, that they are paying enormous bank interest rates and that they are running down their services because they are not getting enough money from central Government.  We are told they have the right to fix charges for water, sewerage and any other services which might be needed.  That type of charge is an increase in taxation the bulk of which is borne by people who cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>There is a new £5,000 grant to house owners living in local authority houses for more than three years.  It is hoped that they will give up these local authority houses thereby releasing about 6,000 local authority houses.  Again, I think this aspiration will not be fulfilled because of the cost of providing new houses, although it may be that in certain limited areas private builders can provide a house at a cost below the local authority cost. <Col N="1336" /> This might work but I do not think it can.  Local authority house building in the future will be tied into this £5,000 grant where people are going to give up their houses thereby releasing them for those who need them.  I do not think this will work but I sincerely hope it does.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.89 is not mentioned in any publicity about the plan.  It states quite categorically that no longer will local authorities pay for house repairs.  It is suggested that if people are lucky enough to get local authority houses they should maintain them.  That is not the way the Labour Party should be looking at this. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to which the Labour Party is affiliated, produced a document stating that the privatisation of housing should not be allowed to continue.  I am surprised that the Labour Party would get involved in a plan which essentially is trying to privatise housing for those who are in need.</P>
    <P>The plan is based on the need to get our economy to balance.  However if our economy is brought into balance, by sending some of our people to Germany, Sweden, France or wherever while the people at home are unemployed, I do not think it matters whether our economy is in balance or not.  The plan does not give me and has not given anybody to whom I have talked, a feeling of optimism.  I do not think it will achieve, as the Taoiseach says, its very modest aspirations.  I sincerely hope that a lot of what is in this plan works.  The Government are trying to implement it, but I am afraid that the people have rejected it.  However, at the end of this debate I hope they will see that there are other options apart from the options in the plan.  Many of these options will be spelled out by spokesmen on this side and have been spelled out in the Dáil over the past number of months. For the sake of our young people I hope the plan works, but from my reading of it I cannot see that it will.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Lanigan in his welcome to the Taoiseach.  It is not his first visit to the House and he is always very welcome.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  That is already on the record.  We gave the Senator the opportunity.</P>
      <P>The publication of this plan <i>Building on Reality</i> on 2 October has created an environment in which all of us can make a critical analysis of our responsibilities, our achievements to date and our expectations over the next three years.  All of us includes the Government, who must have a primary role in creating initiative and the correct climate for us to have confidence in ourselves.  Listening to Senator Lanigan I have no doubt that I can include also the Opposition who play a very vital role in this country.  The plan must be seen to be constructive and supportive where necessary.  If it is not seen in that light, the population, and particularly the young population, will lose faith in the democratic process and may turn to other alternatives.  There is a responsibility on all of us, in Government or in Opposition, to be seen to be trying to achieve something worthwhile for this country, and by working together we can do this.  I should like the Civil Service, the semi-State sector, the private sector whether employers or employees, and their respective unions &mdash; the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; to be self-critical. To put the record straight for Senator Lanigan, the Labour Party are not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions although they might often think we should be, but the majority of members of the trade union movement are affiliated to the Labour Party.  I am pleased to put the record straight.  We have an input but we do not dictate the policy of the trade union movement.  The Labour Party was founded out of the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Senator would read about the actual structure of the trade union movement.  The Labour Party was founded as the political arm of a very important movement and one which, I have no doubt, will make its contribution to the fulfilment of this plan. We must include in our consideration of any plan the elderly, the under-privileged, the sick, the homeless and particularly the unemployed.  All of these groups can now make a critical analysis of the plan.  Any plan has good points and bad points.  You cannot have everything you want in a plan because if you do it will not suit everybody.  There are bound to be sections in the plan of which we can be critical and would prefer if they were not included.</P>
      <P>We are asked in the Seanad to approve all the policies set out in the plan.  There are several areas that I will not touch on because it would be inappropriate for one speaker, apart from the Taoiseach and somebody who will be responding to the debate for the Government, to deal with all the sections.  I will not touch on the area of education &mdash; not because I do not think it is important; it is a vital area and one about which there is a tremendous commitment in the plan but I will leave it to a spokesperson from this side of the House and also from my party to deal with that matter.  The question of CIE is one I would like to discuss in the greatest possible detail because I have an intrinsic dislike for the McKinsey report.  I am not sure from the new structures envisaged what is required of CIE or the employees. I will leave it to the trade union movement that represents the employees in that public service, on which all of us to some degree or other depend so much, particularly in the city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not deal with the area of forestry. There is a commitment in the plan to the replantation of our forests.  There is a tremendous need for an addition to our forest plantations.  There are facilities in this country to process all the timber that the State can produce and thus fill the export market.  Forestry is of vital importance and some other speaker will deal with it.  As a party we will be making an <Col N="1339" /> input, through a submission to Cabinet, on how we think the area of fishing and mariculture should develop.</P>
    <P>Tourism is also a vital area but I will not go into it in detail.  I share the views of Senator Lanigan on the extension of drinking hours for a particular reason.  It is quite obvious to anybody involved in tourism that there is a need for this facility to be available.  Tourists are used to it in their own country, and there is also a need for extensions in certain parts of the country at particular times of the year. The courts recognise this by giving extensions to certain areas for festival purposes. It is appropriate to have a plan designed for tourism.  I would remind Senator Lanigan that it is unnecessary for a pub to remain open up to 2.a.m.  There is no obligation on the owner to do so.  If there is a need for an extension in a particular area the people concerned can make the necessary application.  Unfortunately there is a liberal interpretation of the closing hours in many parts of the country and it is not confined to seaside resorts.  It is appropriate, from a tourist point of view that we should put the record straight.</P>
    <P>I will deal with a few specific areas of which I have some experience.  I welcome the decision of the Government to have a more gradual approach to the reduction of the budget deficit.  Desirable and all as it may be to achieve a greater reduction over the lifetime of the Government, to do so would have led to unacceptable effects on the level of employment and on the weaker sections of the community. The unemployed and the weaker sections, can expect a general and well-deserved improvement in their lot over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare expenditure, that will increase by approximately 25 per cent over the period of the plan and it will be one and a half times greater than public expenditure in any other area.  All of us have a major responsibility to the weaker sections of our community, whether it be the elderly, the retired or those of pensionable age.  I also welcome the introduction of the family income <Col N="1340" /> supplement.  It is being made retrospective to August to take into consideration the removal, in part, of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The new child benefit scheme is also outlined in the plan and this will be of major importance to the mother to whom the payment will be made and also to the people who will benefit most from it. These payments will be regarded as assessable for income tax.  People in lower income brackets who receive the child benefit allowance should not assume immediately that they will be taxable but they will be taken into consideration for it.  People on higher levels of income who get the money paid directly to the mother will pay tax on it.  My interpretation is that the people who will benefit from the scheme will be those who are unemployed, social welfare recipients or those who are employed and who are in the 35 per cent tax band.  Everybody above that will not benefit from the scheme.  Nobody would expect the Government to hand out money <i>ad lib</i> to people who do not need it, especially when it may be required for other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare of the double payment at Christmas. This will amount to £20.35 million which will benefit approximately 414,000 people.  It is appropriate that it should be stated by the Government that that is their commitment, thus eliminating the anomaly that occurred in the past where the Government could have been seen to be responding to pressure from any particular section.  This is a genuine commitment of the Government.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are now after many years of waiting about to produce a document that will set down a national pay-related pension scheme for everybody will be one of the most welcome developments. It is part of Labour Party policy going back over a number of years.  It is appropriate that people be afforded the facility of contributing to their own pension scheme while they are gainfully employed and that we will not have the fiasco where people at a certain age divest themselves legally of all their possessions <Col N="1341" /> and then qualify for a Government pension, never having contributed towards it.  It is appropriate when a farm is passed on to young people that there should be recognition of that fact but it is common knowledge that it is now being done for the sole purpose of qualifying for the pension.  That is a misuse of public funds. The sooner people pay towards their pension the better for everybody concerned. It is also appropriate that they should be protected if they make their contribution.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is being brought in to compensate people for the partial removal of food subsidies.  I should like this Minister to monitor its effects not just on the lower paid worker but also on people on social welfare, particularly those people who are not presently in receipt of pay-related benefit in addition to social welfare.  There are areas of hardship because of the removal of food subsidies which, of course, was a blunt instrument.  We should make proper plans to ensure that there are no problems for people in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion which is being made available by this Government in the social welfare area is an indication of their commitment and is also an indication of the magnitude of the problem and the level of dependency of the old and the unemployed on those who are working.  We have a major social responsibility and an urgent need for tax equity.  That is self-explanatory. If only a limited number of people are paying tax, there is only a limited amount of money to enable us to support those who are unable to support themselves.  That is an urgent cause for tax equity.</P>
    <P>Our health services are of vital importance costing, as they do, over £1 billion. As a member of a health board I would like to assure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health that I am aware of my responsibilities.  My first responsibility is to protect the level of the service provided for those in need and entitled to it, and to effect economies where possible. Over a number of years the South Eastern Health Board have managed to do this.  We have tried to effect economies <Col N="1342" /> and have been successful in doing so in non-pay areas such as areas of energy costs and others, and we have managed to achieve this without a diminution in the service to the people.</P>
    <P>We now have no option other than to look at other areas in this sector.  We have not had job losses or redundancies in the health board areas, but because of the embargo we have not replaced retiring staff and we have had to deploy some members of staff to allow us to fill essential posts.  We are now down to the real nitty gritty.  Our primary concern is to ensure that there is an adequate delivery of the service.  We now have to look at every area to ensure that that happens, and we have to ask everybody to make a sacrifice.  We are down to the area of automatic locum.  I read a contribution in the other House by a colleague of mine who is a member of a health board also. It was almost inferred in that contribution that we were asking for automatic suspension of all locums which we did not do.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the health board was asked specifically to look at areas that did not need automatic replacement by a locum but we accepted that where there was a need for a surgeon or a consultant of any faculty it would have to be met.  The health board are not unmindful of this.  We have not had a slashing cut in the health services and we have not put any lives at risk.  We have not charged anybody for any services in the hospitals.  We have problems in trying to meet our budget and we are continuing to do that.</P>
    <P>In the whole lifetime of the plan over three years the Minister hopes to save £10 million per annum.  If this is to be achieved in a uniform way throughout the health services, serious consideration must be given to equity in staffing levels in the various health board areas.  I know from working on a health board that the South Eastern Health Board does not compare favourably with other health board areas.  This anomaly should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The staff embargo applied in a blanket way throughout the health board areas <Col N="1343" /> could have serious consequences on the level of health service any board can deliver. I am asking the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to take into account the anomaly that has arisen because health boards in the late seventies in order to comply with a job creation programme, were almost asked to employ people whether they were required or not.  Now we have hospitals in this city which have five times the level of consultancy cover other hospitals have. A few hospitals in the country need consultancy appointments and an embargo on them could be quite dangerous.</P>
    <P>People have a major responsibility to make contributions to the health boards. In the south-east we are owed £5.496 million in non-paid health contributions, youth employment levies, and income levies.  If there is a problem about financing health boards, I am asking those who benefit from the service, and need the service, and demand it, and are entitled to it under the 1976 Act, to face up to their responsibilities, even if they argue about the total bill that is due, they should at least make some contribution to the health boards to ensure that this vital part of the public service is maintained.  That applies to quite a large number of people at the moment.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Lanigan, I am a member of a local authority.  This is a key area of local democracy and has proved in the past to be able to deliver a widespread service to many people at a significantly reduced cost in comparison to central Government.  We are looking for a total reform of the local authority areas.  The Taoiseach has committed us to holding local authority elections next year.  I agree that it is appropriate that the local authority elections should be held as soon as possible, but it would be inappropriate to have local elections if the whole area of reform is not completed.  When you have not sorted out the problems about the boundaries, or the functions of authorities, or the areas of structures, or any other function of the local authorities, to hold elections in a sort of a vacuum would be unwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> I will keep an open mind on this until I see what level of progress is being made by the Minister for the Environment.  I have had discussions with him.  I have tried to find out what he has in mind.  I know he has Cabinet constraints upon him and he is unable to divulge to me what his plans are.  In local authorities the first area of reform must be finance. The plan recognises that, and makes local authorities responsible for the collection of the new farm tax.  That new farm tax is a replacement for the PLV system which was found to be unconstitutional.  The responsibility of the local authorities to collect this tax will be matched by their ability to provide the services.  Each local authority will decide how and from whom to collect it and at budget time we can decide what level of service we can provide to each county.</P>
    <P>Nowadays everybody makes a demand on the local authority service.  Very few people want to pay for it in any way.  We have the problem of trying to collect local authority charges.  The row happened only because it has been extended to the urban authorities and to the corporations. For many years people living in country areas controlled by county councils have been paying these charges. There has not been a word about them. This goes to show what you can achieve if you can get enough people involved in something and making quite a lot of noise about it.  The councillors have the right to make charges and to have schemes for people who are not already exempt.  We are not worried about the people who are exempt.  They have the power to have different sets of charges for different people, based on their ability to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The county managers have the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The county managers have the right if the councillors fail to accept their statutory obligations.  I agree with the Senator.  Many councillors ran away from the problem and did not set up a proper scheme by resolution of the council and because they did not, that left the manager with the power to bring in a <Col N="1345" /> flat scheme in most areas, which is very beneficial from the management point of view.  They now have a flat rate for everybody, irrespective of ability to pay. It is a matter for the councillors to take aboard the problem.</P>
      <P>I would look upon the scheme of local authority charges as being a temporary one until such time as we have approached the problem of the restructuring of finances of local authorities.  We will have other areas of reform taking place, particularly in the area of boundaries and the level of representation depending on the population.  That is appropriate, because in Dublin and developing urban areas throughout the country people are under-represented by members of local authorities.  Local authorities catering for a sparse population could be top heavy with councillors. We must look at this whole area.</P>
      <P>I will just deal with finance again for the moment.  An effort must be made to re-organise local authority and its finances.  The sooner the day comes the better, when we stop demanding from central funds money which can only come from one source, either the PAYE worker or borrowing and we have problems in both areas.  We have a major responsibility.  I noticed Senator Lanigan smiling when I talked about the possibility of some local authorities losing membership.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he had his mind on a future Seanad election where we would have to travel the highways and byways of every county to try to find one person for whom we could even consider voting.  We must also look, in the area of local authority, at the question of capital investment that is projected in this plan. It is a tremendous injection.  It has given a lot of confidence, not alone to existing roadworkers in the county council areas. In the past, we have had some problems of people working short weeks, half a week, a week on and a week off, all of which we found were more expensive than keeping people working full time. <Col N="1346" /> Our county tried to overcome the problem and, thankfully, had no redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital injection in the plan going up from £100 million to £125 million next year, to £140 million in 1986 and £155 million in 1987 represents an excess of ten per cent over the projections of the road development plan.  The resultant increase in direct and indirect employment arising from that will be a major economic factor in all the areas involved and a new contribution will be made to the infrastructure of our regions which is so vitally important if we are to make any efforts to expand our industrial development programme.  This new £5,000 non-repayable grant was confirmed by the Minister for the Environment last week which is the way to govern.  You make a decision and you abide by it, and on 2 October this new plan comes into operation. I have had consultations with engineers over the last week in regard to the purchase of land to build local authority houses.  Already there is a demand to be included in the scheme. Already people are trying to get out of the areas they are living in now.  People who never were used to living in urban areas are confined to living there.  The Government, through the Department of the Environment, had provided a house for them there and naturally they took it. However, people are happier at times to be living just out of the town or in the country and this new scheme of £5,000 plus £3,000 in the mortgage interest subsidy scheme plus the £1,000 new grant will make a major contribution in that area of moving people and assisting them to move.  That special category loan of £20,000 with no income limits, is a major contribution to people in the local authority area to enable them to better themselves. There is nothing wrong with that philosophy.  By so doing, we would release many badly needed houses for people who are on our housing lists all over the country, for many years living in caravans and unfit houses.  If we can have a scheme that will release houses to these people, <Col N="1347" /> we will then be making a major contribution to shortening the housing lists, both in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We also would like to think that the building industry would not avail of this opportunity to escalate the cost of houses.  I hope that this £5,000 will be a maximum and, if not, that a proportion will be given towards the actual cost of the house.  Otherwise, all the house prices will be inflated to take account of these schemes.  That happened us in the past and this Government should have learned from the previous Government of the problems created in this area.</P>
      <P>The building industry will benefit in its own right.  It does not need this kind of movement of money from the Government to the building industry.  There is enough in this plan, in roads and in other areas, to benefit what is, in fact, a major industry that will help a large number of the unemployed.  I am pleased also that the councils will be involved in this new special, social employment scheme that is in the course of preparation by the Minister for Labour.  I know his commitment to it.  I know from my experience as a public representative that most people want to work.  In spite of all who say otherwise, my experience is that everybody who has any commitment at all to his or her country wants to work.  Any scheme towards eliminating the humilation of signing for the dole would be a major step forward in any social legislation. I welcome this new scheme particularly because I believe it will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that local authorities are being chosen as the first employers to implement this scheme, but I have a word of caution for the Minister for Labour in the area of PRSI contributions that will be made on the payment of £70.  The PRSI contributions must be arranged in <Col N="1348" /> such a way that workers in the scheme, those long term unemployed that opt for the scheme will qualify in the future for any credits that they might already be obtaining by signing on.  We have a system at the moment under which people get a credit when they sign for employment and a similar credit must be given to people under this scheme.  If we just use the rate, which is the level of contribution to protect people for workmen's compensation, for this kind of person that would be a disincentive to participation.  The Minister should examine that particular aspect of the scheme.  Apart from that, it is an extremely good scheme.  I would hope for the day when it could be extended to other areas in the community.  However, local authorities are the primary employer because so much work needs to be done at local authority level and this scheme could make a contribution towards it.</P>
    <P>I would like, when we do extend the scheme, that it be extended into agriculture because the drop in the level of employment in agriculture is continuing at a startling rate.  Each year we lose about 1,000 people who had been gainfully employed in agriculture.  There is tremendous potential in agriculture, particularly in horticulture, and I am glad that this plan points to some of the areas that were outlined in the four year farm development plan, which was, first of all, requested by a previous Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Lenihan, and was presented to Mr. Deasy on 4 May of this year.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the plan includes, many of the recommendations of the four year plan in agriculture which was produced, not by the Government but by all the sections in the agricultural world that could make a contribution to that most magnificent part of our economic development, the development of agriculture. It plays a very important role and it is only appropriate that the plan should take note of that.  Our total agricultural exports amount to about £6 billion, which is about 30 per cent of our total exports. If the plan recognises that importance, as <Col N="1349" /> it does, this social employment section would possibly evolve into that area, particularly the area of horticulture.</P>
    <P>Land drainage is mentioned in the plan.  It is appropriate, particularly in the west that we proceed with the cost-effective development of the land drainage scheme, and I am glad that the plan outlines that.  I am pleased also to see the doubling of the payment for beef cows and, of course, the new drive in tuberculosis eradication.  We have made tremendous strides in disease eradication for brucellosis simply because the participants in the scheme can recognise immediately the losses they can be subjected to from brucellosis.  They can see the aborted calf, the loss of milk, and their whole livelihood running away from them if the have not taken an active part in the brucellosis eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the TB eradication scheme.  As a member of the Animal Health Council who were set up to advise the Minister, I can say that there is a new awareness, certainly among members of the council, that something radical needs to be done in the area of TB eradication.  It is not just a question of money, although money is of paramount importance for the success of this scheme.  However, it is not a lack of money over the past 20 years that has caused this scheme to fail.  There is now an awareness that in areas which cost no money the disease is spread laterally by uncleaned lorries, by the removal of reactors not directly to the factory but on an interim basis to a dealer's land or to commonage which it is not generally known who owns or what dealings have taken place among people who graze it, and by the illegal movement of animals between herds and out of herds to outside land adjacent to other clean herds.  Statistics shown recently indicate that animals can escape the testing net for up to two years.</P>
    <P>Considering the total input by the Government and the taxpayer into TB eradication and that all these things are still happening, albeit illegally, a major effort must be made to make farmers <Col N="1350" /> aware of their obligations in the protection of their own herds.  The time is coming when farmers should not allow a lorry to enter their farms unless that lorry is cleaned properly and certified as being cleaned.  I ask that all livestock marts ensure that the facilities to do that are in place.  The ministerial order worded that a lorry would be cleaned &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; does not do justice to the problem of TB eradication.  This scheme must succeed.  If it does not succeed we will not have a livestock trade with Libya or any other part of the world.  Unless we achieve a certain standard of disease eradication in our herds, eventually we will not have markets.</P>
    <P>The motion to increase levies in regard to this will be unpopular.  Farmers feel, rightly, that they have never made a gain on the TB scheme or any other disease eradication scheme.  Every farmer in the country who must by law participate in this scheme has lost money.  Therefore, maybe we should look at the levels of compensation.  Certainly we should look at the levels of compensation under the depopulation fund.  Proposals have been made to the Minister in this regard and I ask him to take cognisance of them.  It is important that people would not be afraid to tell a veterinary surgeon that they have a reactor on their place.  Most farmers are intelligent.  They inspect their stock after they are injected on the first day. The veterinary surgeon is paid for the number of tags he writes down in the TB eradication report.  I would like to see a greater tightening up of the manner in which the animals are subjected to reading on the reading day and the double check that takes place to ensure that all the animals are presented.  People can sign documents to say that all the animals are presented, but if the level of compensation is not right, maybe because somebody could be put out of business, the reactors may not be disclosed on the day of the reading.  If that happens and the animal gets a blue card updated, there could be a movement of animals between herds and to innocent purchasers.  I would like to see a tightening up in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the plan, I would like to tell <Col N="1351" /> Senator Lanigan and his colleagues who will be making a contribution on this section that this increased levy will apply for one year only.  The farming bodies have had a number of discussions about the possibility of paying for a round of testing. This year, because of the amount of money available, we were unable to perform a complete round of testing.  A complete round of testing is important. It is not the only thing that will eradicate disease, but it will identify disease.  It will not identify the cause of the disease.  We should spend a great deal more money on epidemiology and all areas of research to ensure that we know what causes the outbreaks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. It is a levy for one year but there was an option that farmers could pay for one round of testing and the Government would pay for another, with some reservations on behalf of the veterinary profession. I do not know why.  They were assured of a continuing income in this <Col N="1352" /> area, and I was disappointed that agreement has not been reached now that the levies are doubled.  It is perhaps of greater urgency that they look at this area of paying for a round, because one is paying for something.  They have much more regard for the end result than to have everything handed down to them by the State, particularly in this area where their livelihoods are at stake.  The farmers recognise that and they are anxious to make a contribution.  I would prefer to see them doing it directly with their own veterinary surgeon than to have levies initiated which go into a pool and then come back out again.  Admittedly, the amount collected in the levies is only a fraction of the increased expenditure in this scheme for the next three years.  As a member of the animal health council I welcome that increased contribution to ensure that we come to grips with this horrible disease of TB in livestock in the eradication of which for many reasons we have made very little progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan contains a comment about the abolition of the Land Commission. Here I am critical, I hope constructively so.  Up to quite recently the party I represent &mdash; I happen to be chairman of their agricultural committee &mdash; envisaged that possibly the Land Commission were under threat.  Of course, they were right because the Government then announced suddenly the abolition of the Land Commission and the movement of all their staff into other areas such as adjusted acreage.  That is a retrograde step unless &mdash; there is still time to make some redress in this &mdash; the Government address themselves to the problem of what agency we should have in place of the Land Commission.  As a party we intend to make a submission to the Cabinet as to how the Land Commission should be replaced and what functions the new agency should have.  One of their primary functions should be to acquire land which is under-utilised for one reason or another.  We have never advocated that we take land forcibly from people who are using it properly, but there are people who do not want to use land correctly.  It is appropriate that that <Col N="1353" /> land be made available to people who are prepared to work it.  I envisage that this new agency would implement a system of land acquisition, distribution and transfer and would ensure priority access to farming and farm land for all small and medium farmers who have the competence or potential to manage viable units and reach acceptable living standards as is enshrined in the Common Agricultural Policy.  It would also make land available to individuals who have received adequate training and experience in farming and who do not now own land and have no alternative source of income.  I am talking about unemployed people in rural Ireland who, with assistance from a land agency, could have access to land and use the enterprise allowance scheme to make a contribution in the area of horticulture.  I would like to see access to land for farm workers who are trained and experienced in farming and may wish to pursue a career in full time farming on a viable unit.  I would like to see the agency having some power of deterrent to prevent utilisation or ownership of land by individuals who derive most of their income from nonfarming interests, such as the professions, and have no direct training or experience in farming.  We had in the past, tax incentives for people to buy land although such people did not need it.  When such people are in the land purchasing market it makes it more difficult for people who would like to get into farming and could usefully do so, to get more involved.</P>
    <P>I would like the new agency to develop a strong central authority to implement the policy objectives particularly in the area of land acquisition and transfer.  Our party will be making submissions to the Cabinet on these topics because we feel agriculture is important.  Land usage is important and we should not throw our available land open to the markets of the world and the cheque book people outside the Community when people here could usefully participate in working the land.</P>
    <P>On the question of farmer taxation, I note there has been some problem about the land tax.  Generally speaking, the <Col N="1354" /> farming community welcomed it because it allows them a certain initiative without being penalised.  They have not been used to keeping accounts in the past and they are reputed to have spent in the region of £40 million trying to prove whether or not they were entitled to pay tax.  That is probably an inflated figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer who can afford to pay accountants can afford to pay a lot more tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  One thing about this tax is that it envisages double take of tax from the farming community.  I will ignore the interruption from my left.  It is difficult to be Left of me but Senator Ryan would like to think he can match that.  Under the scheme which came into operation on 5 April 1984 we brought every farmer into the tax net.  They were obliged to give a profile of themselves, their names and addresses particularly, the level of farming enterprise they had and the number of livestock units.  Out of the 90,000 farmers eligible the Revenue Commissioners managed to get out over 20,000 of which 13,000 made returns. About 37 per cent of the 13,000 were not liable for tax.  I assisted some of them, for no fee, to complete the profile and I was delighted to learn later that they were exempt from further recognition by the Revenue Commissioners for three years. About 63 per cent of the people who returned a profile were liable for taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme eliminates some of that.  It talks about adjusted acres.  I hope the people who will be working on this will take into account what an adjusted acre is.  For a farmer with 80 adjusted acres &mdash; on the calculation we have that amounts to about 120 acres&mdash;who has a big input in dairying I would be worrying what his income might be.  It must be an incentive to feel that up to that all one pays is £10 per adjusted acre to the local authority and there is no other obligation to the Exchequer.  There should be an obligation for that section, and all sections, to make their health contributions, pay the youth employment levy and so <Col N="1355" /> on, because it is appropriate that if we are to have equity everybody will be seen to have made his fair contribution.  The trade union movement are not too happy about this basis of tax equity.  However, reading the wording of the document on farmer taxation I note that it allows a certain element of take which everybody feels the agricultural sector should be making.  We should adopt a wait and see approach and see what the income from the old system over the next two years will be and then assess what the take from the new tax should be.  That is the appropriate way to move forward.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have made the point forcibly that this plan depends to a very large extent on the private sector.  I hope they meet their responsibilities because their performance in the past has been disappointing.  I accept, as a socialist, that in a mixed economy it is important that all sides should play their part in creating jobs and not just making profit.  I hope the responsibility we are placing on the private sector by way of incentive and so on will be matched by performance.  The figures outlined for job creation in the private sector, whether in manufacturing or service industries, are outlined in the plan in detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the role of the trade unions in the success of this plan. The Taoiseach in his contribution outlined the importance for the success of the plan on the support of all sections, particularly from the trade unions.  The trade unions represent the vast majority of people in every walk of life.  As a member of a trade union I have a long loyalty to the trade union movement and I will defend their right to represent the interests of their members when there is not a national pay agreement.  The interest of members can only be protected through negotiation, conciliation and arbitration.  I have no doubt that the trade union movement will play their role in this vital part of the plan.  In the private sector, in particular, the trade unions have over the last year or so, when we did not have a national pay agreement, negotiated on an individual industry <Col N="1356" /> basis, whether they were co-operatives, the building industry or the tourist industry and managed to achieve wage agreements by discussion and negotiation.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the thorny section in the plan which deals with the trade union movement and the public sector.  The plan states that there will be a specific cash limit for the three years of the plan. Do I take it that there will be a limited amount of money budgeted each year and that unless there are increases in borrowings or increases in taxation, or an additional budget the trade unions will be forced to negotiate within the constraints mentioned in the plan for only a specific amount of money that is available to share out?  The trade union movement will be asking us, and considering themselves, how they will meet that on the basis of equity, especially when it is applied to the public sector.  In the past, most increases in the public sector, apart from special awards, were given on a percentage basis.  It is easy to know the greatest beneficiaries from such increases.  I ask the public sector, and the trade union movement, to look at the incomes of the elderly as a guideline as to where they should be moving in this area.  I might refer also to the State Directory of the Public Service, published in 1984 showing their levels of pay.  We see there levels of pay ranging from about £5,000 to £37,442 annually at the top.</P>
    <P>One does not need to be a mathematician to work out the anomaly that would be demonstrated if one applied a percentage increase to any of those figures.  I hope the trade unions, in their wisdom, will ensure that the greatest need in this area is met equitably.  In the past the same trade unions accepted postponement of an award which had been negotiated, in good faith, between themselves and a previous Coalition Government.  There was a sum included in the budget of that year to cover the public service pay award.  Such award was capable of tolerance at that time but a previous Government arbitrarily postponed it.</P>
    <P>I know that the trade union movement will not be incapable now of showing <Col N="1357" /> similar tolerance and understanding in the knowledge that at least this Government have placed all their cards on the table.  We know that if increases are to be sought over and above those advocated in the plan they will warrant additional budgeting, borrowing or taxation of the already overtaxed sections.  Unless there is absolute tax equity, or a spread of the tax intake then any increases in public service pay can come from those sections only.</P>
    <P>I agree with the trade union movement thinking that there should be a broadening of the tax net, with a larger capital tax intake thereby lightening the burden on those in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I said we should all be capable of a critical analysis of ourselves.  I hope that this plan will prove to be the basis on which we can begin to build on reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to a number of speeches in both Houses on the national economic plan. Probably the singularly most important omission seems to be an almost fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability of high levels of unemployment.  There is, of course, the almost ritual obeisance to the problem of unemployment.  But how many of the long speeches in this House will be devoted to any great degree to that problem?  The particular tragedy is that the only sources of advice heard or listened to by Irish society today on this problem are those represented by the voices of the right who have hypnotised this country into believing that there is a right-wing magic formula based on low wages, reduced public expenditure, decimation of trade union rights, the paring of the welfare system and the introduction of privatisation in numbers of areas.  We have been led to believe &mdash; if not hypnotised into almost total acceptance &mdash; that this is an infallible route to full employment.  The truth is that, with the possible exception of the late seventies and in recent times in the United States &mdash; and there are very good arguments to be made that this is quite an exceptional economy for many <Col N="1358" /> reasons &mdash; those policies, which have been tried either explicitly or implicitly until the late thirties by most Governments managing economies, failed miserably in all of the major objectives of any national economic plan. What we are now seeing from the right is what we always get from the right &mdash; an attempt to go backwards, to revert to old ideas.  Traditionally new thinking, innovation and ideas in political economy and political thinking have always come from the left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore one would have hoped, in an economic plan that is the combined wisdom of two parties who claim to be either social democratic or socialist &mdash; and where the socialists or social democrats lie within the two parties is a matter of political opinion rather than of fact &mdash; that irrespective of the political views of a given party, or those of any party in this or the other House, there would be three basic objectives: the first would be the fundamental requirment to restart, and expand economic growth.  Beyond perhaps some elements of the Green Movement in Western Europe there is no political party which does not accept the need for renewed economic growth as the prerequisite for dealing with the problem of unemployment; the second area in which any economic plan should demonstrate fundamental strategy is in addressing itself to the questions of unemployment and the creation of jobs. It is worth noting this repeatedly.  Certainly it is a consensus among politicians because we in this and the other House deal on a day-to-day or weekly basis, through our clinics with the victims of unemployment.  It is absolutely necessary for us to state repeatedly that the basic purpose of economic growth is to create jobs.  But let it be said that most of those from whom the economic advice is emanating &mdash; and which is being accepted by the media, by the Government and all the major political parties &mdash; will immediately dismiss any suggestion as to from where such jobs will come.  Newspaper reports of the meeting of the Dublin, Economic Workshop in Kenmare some <Col N="1359" /> week-ends ago suggested that the director of the ESRI ask that question: where will the jobs come from?  One of our most eminent economists quite obviously shrugged his shoulders and said: we do not know, we must leave that to market forces.</P>
    <P>That is the bottom line of the economic advice which has created the sort of hypnotic consensus about which I am talking, that we really do not know from where the jobs will come.  They do know that the present system does not work; they know where they want to go to, but sadly, at the end of it all, they will say that that is the end of their role as economists &mdash; to tell us how to get out of this mess, that the jobs are a matter for market forces. That has been repeated consistently by this array of right-wing academic economists who seem to have virtually taken over the Irish media.  I shall return to that later.</P>
    <P>The third strategy of economic planning &mdash; the one on which there is less likely to be agreement and quite definitely the one on which there is likely to be very widespread disagreement &mdash; is the achievement of social justice.  In fairness to it this plan does address those three issues&mdash;the issue of restarting growth, of creating employment and of developing social justice.</P>
    <P>In the light of some of the, shall we say, slightly negative comments I will make later I would like to commend the report.  If it does no more, at least it incorporates the basic definitions and structures of social policy.  In saying that I do not mean the strategies, outlines and final plans but the basic concept of social policy.  That is done apparently with approval, since there is included here without comment, remarks of the NESC Report No. 61 to the effect that the values which underpin all social policy should include societal acceptance of the dignity and right to personal development of the individual, the value of bonds of mutual obligation within society, the importance of fair shares within the community and the securing of basic rights within a democratic framework.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> I would respectfully suggest to the army of right-wing economists of the free market variety most of whom, I would respectfully suggest as being of one shade or other of blue that those particular social policy values are irreconcilable with the sort of economic structures they would foist upon us.  NESC Report No. 61 suggested a number of aims for Irish social policy, and they are incorporated in the plan, paragraph 5.4 of which states:</P>
    <P>The Government are also concerned with the wider question of social justice, of appropriate legal provision, of institutional reform and the development of public education and information and, more important, action aimed at grappling with the structural and other causes of poverty and inequality in our society.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that this Government, or spokespersons for them, have taken and used such fine rhetorical language about social justice.  The trouble is that that fine statement of policy is, to say the least, inadequately reflected in the Government plan, and to say the most is almost entirely ignored in the plan.</P>
    <P>For instance, if we are to have social justice there must be fundamental commitment to the redistribution and the transfer of income from those who have to those who have not.  Yet in many areas of taxation, which is one of the more fundamental but not the only instrument of income redistribution, it appears to me there has been capitulation to various powerful vested interests.  There is a suggestion that Irish public opinion will not tolerate higher levels of taxation.</P>
    <P>Let us be very careful and clear about this.  The reason there has been such a violent reaction to levels of taxation in our society is because of the effectiveness of certain lobbies in preventing Governments from introducing measures that would ensure equity in the taxation system.  When trade union demonstrations about tax equity began they did not appear out of thin air.  They appeared when the Government at the time backed down on a number of efforts to increase <Col N="1361" /> taxation yields from farmers.  It was that which provoked the outrage of PAYE people.  It was not the basic question of taxation itself but the obvious and visible capacity of one major lobby to force a Government to change their mind at a time when other people were carrying more than their fair share.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary there should be so much hand wringing about the enormous expense farmers have to incur in order to draw up their accounts, when every individual going to work in a factory or office also has to pay taxation but without being able to use an accountant with the same degree of expertise as many of those poor unfortunate farmers.  As I said earlier in a disorderly fashion, if the farming population could afford to pay £40 million to pay accountants to avoid paying tax I would regard that as a fairly good indicator that it is well within their capability to pay a substantial and considerably greater level of tax than that currently being paid by them.</P>
    <P>I will not get involved in long arguments about land tax and its merits or demerits &mdash; I see mostly merit in a real land tax &mdash; but to suggest a total yield of £80 million from a section which produces about one-third of our total exports is to be offensive to the rest of our society.  I did a quick sum and I reckoned that £80 million is about the revenue the Government would get from putting an extra 20p on the price of a pint of beer.  Therefore, the total direct contribution from farming taxation is about the equivalent of an extra 20p on the pint.  That is the real contribution.</P>
    <P>Two different measuring sticks are being used.  On the one hand, PAYE taxpayers have to carry an enormous burden because of inequity, and on the other hand what is being sought from other groups is only a fair level of taxation. Basically, we have two approaches, the approach to those who are burdened with what is admitted to be an unfair but apparently necessary level of taxation and the approach to those of whom it is expected that they should pay only a fair level of tax.  Incidentally, £80 million is far less in real terms than the farming <Col N="1362" /> community would have paid in one form or another, including rates, ten years ago, not withstanding the enormous increase in farming prosperity in the last ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>I think that the whole capitulation on capital taxation should be commented on.  In the thirties, when we were an impoverished country in the middle of an economic war, capital taxation could contribute between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of total Government revenue. Nowadays it achieves about one-tenth of that, and to suggest somehow that there is less capital available to justify capital taxation than there was 50 years ago when this was an impoverished country is to mislead the community.  The difference is that the political will is now lacking.</P>
    <P>It is funny that when everyone else is being asked to make sacrifices, when political promises are being broken left, right and centre, one thing that is sacrosanct is the 10 per cent of zero rate that manufacturing industry is allowed to luxuriate in.  That, of course, is because we are hypnotised by the threat of a massive multi-national withdrawal and the consequences for employment here.  It is about time we began to call some of that bluff &mdash; a large part of it is only bluff.  We have the lowest industrial wage rates in Western Europe.  In multinational industry we have high levels of worker productivity, as high virtually as anywhere else in Europe.  It is not in the new manufacturing industries that there is a problem with productivity in Ireland.  It is in old Irish industry and in agriculture that our productivity is weighed down. Therefore, there is a good case to be made that the £1,400 million profits generated by export-orientated manufacturing industry last year should be subjected to a level of taxation.  A 10 per cent level would yield £140 million, a 20 per cent level nearly £300 million.  That amount removed from the burden of PAYE taxpayers would relieve their problem considerably. Probably I will be accused of being unpatriotic for suggesting that because I may frighten away the multinationals. It is an extraordinary reflection <Col N="1363" /> on ourselves that before all else we must worry about those mysterious and extraordinary multinational corporations. Regrettably, powerful vested interests, apparently uncontrollable in our society, have deterred the Government, as they would have deterred a Fianna Fáil Government, from realistic taxation.</P>
    <P>There is also less than total frankness about public expenditure.  It amounts to deception in some cases and at the very worst there is almost a conspiracy to deceive the community.  I will give a couple of examples.  In the plan there is the commitment at paragraph 7.60:</P>
    <P>the Government have made provision in the Plan for an increase of 28 per cent by 1987 on the expected 1984 outturn for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>That issue was highlighted in a summary of the plan and in the media reports of the plan when initially published.  This 28 per cent was regarded as a major victory for social justice.  I went through table 7&mdash;1 on page 136 and I discovered that on the basis of the budget provision for social welfare for 1984 the actual increase in expenditure for 1987 will not be 28 per cent.  It will be 23 per cent.  That means that somehow £50 million will have disappeared over three years out of the pockets of the less well off and the most impoverished in our society.  It was confirmed for me by the Department of Social Welfare that they expect to spend less in 1984 than was provided for in the budget. Therefore, what they were talking about was not an increase over the 1984 estimate but an increase over 1984 expenditure. The Government are saving this year on social welfare in order to give the impression that in later years they will be very generous to social welfare recipients. That £50 million is being used to pay the double week at Christmas for all those except the army of the undeserving &mdash; the unemployed &mdash; who never get a double week, apparently because they do not deserve it.  It has been standard practice for successive Governments of all political complexions not to give a double <Col N="1364" /> week's money at Christmas to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The real increase in social welfare over the next three years will be 23 per cent. That item was highlighted and an inflated value given to it, 28 per cent, when it turned out to be 23 per cent.  It is very handy to be numerate because one can check up on these things.</P>
    <P>The second area in which there is something quite sinister is expenditure on Justice.  In this area we are given a number of commitments.  One is that there will be no increase in the number of gardaí employed over the period of the plan.  The second is the severe restraint, amounting almost to a wage freeze, in public sector pay.  If one looks at the increase in expenditure on Justice it works out at the second highest in the entire range of Estimates &mdash; at 28 per cent over three years, or £80 million.  It is a 28 per cent increase on expenditure in a Department where there will be no increase in staffing and no increase in wages.  This is not capital expenditure: it is current expenditure.  It is not stated anywhere but it appears notwithstanding public sector embargoes etc. about 1,000 extra prison officers will be recruited over the next three years.  This was never boasted about.  We never heard anything about this in all the statements about the plan.  Of course, it is a necessary followon to that obnoxious legislation which we unfortunately passed a few years ago.  It suggests a certain dishonesty that that vast increase in one Department passes through without as much as a comment. Perhaps some people working in the media noticed it but in all the talk about levels of expenditure this extraordinary increase in expenditure in the Department of Justice went without being noticed.</P>
    <P>Then we have the sort of games that are played with us in the area of housing. There are admittedly four references to the homeless throughout the plan.  It is to be welcomed that this category of need has been recognised.  There are within this document statements of policy about housing policy which are so fundamentally contradictory as to raise questions <Col N="1365" /> about the real objectives of the Government in this area.  I will just give a basic example.  At paragraph 5.76 there is a welcome proposal to make a grant of £5,000 available to local authority tenants purchasing or buying a private house.  It is a good idea although I hope the building industry will not cash in on it.  But how do I reconcile that with paragraph 5.86 which talks about the average weekly rent in local authority houses being too low and attempt to persuade the better off among local authority tenants to move out of local authority houses &mdash; an objective I agree with and support?  It states that: &ldquo;many are paying rents that are too low in relation to their incomes&rdquo;.  That section of local authority tenants who presumably have the highest incomes are about to be moved out of local authority houses and it is proposed, after they are gone, to raise the level of rent substantially &ldquo;to a level more in line with the actual cost of local authority housing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is the point in providing local authority housing for people who cannot afford to pay for it if they are to be charged rents &ldquo;which are more in line with the actual cost of local authority housing&rdquo; and when we will syphon off from the top of the local authority tenant structure those who can most afford to pay those rents?  Somebody is kidding somebody.  Either those who are badly off, unemployed or on very low incomes will be shafted for enormous increases in rents or else this statement is untrue.</P>
    <P>I suspect that what is intended is a dramatic increase in rents for those left in local authority houses, who will because of the £5,000 grant be the people who can least afford to pay increased rents.  I can see a quite ridiculous situation developing where local authority tenants on very limited incomes will pay more of their income on rent than, for instance, people who buy houses from the Housing Finance Agency and pay a fixed proportion of their income on rent.</P>
    <P>The average rent in 1983 was about £7 &mdash; for new houses the rent was £10 weekly.  People had to pay £7 rent for obnoxious housing in both of our major cities which is classified as local authority <Col N="1366" /> housing.  For somebody with a wife and two children in a unit of local authority housing, who is getting about £70 a week on the dole, as it stands now he is paying about 14 per cent of his income on rent. It is suggested that person can afford to pay more?  If so, how much more?  I see a quite deliberate decision to reduce effectively the living standards of people at the bottom of society.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris quite rightly mentioned one of the facts of life about public sector pay which is such a central part of this strategy.  There are huge variations in public sector pay.  There are 20,000 or 30,000 teachers in the public service. Their salaries would be well above the public sector average of £11,000.  There are obviously large numbers of people far below that £11,000 average.  It is quite unjust and socially retrogressive to suggest that a wage freeze which I, for example, could probably sustain without any great damage to my lifestyle or family circumstances, could be sustained by somebody working as a messenger in a Government Department or as a street cleaner or doing very basic manual jobs in the public sector for £100, £150 or £180 a week.  It is quite unjust to impose the same wage freeze on those people.  There is a significant spin-off from that freeze which people have chosen to ignore. There are thousands of public service pensioners who will, over the next three years, get increases in their pensions far below the increase in the cost of living and far below that of social welfare recipients. Their pensions are not tied to the cost of living, as much employer and Government propaganda suggests, but to public service wage levels.  If public service wage levels are frozen for three years, public service pensions are frozen for three years.  It will be a substantial saving to the Government but it will be a saving at the expense of the elderly and infirm who are public service pensioners.  It is unworthy of a Government which claims to be committed to social justice.  They could at least make a distinction for public service pensioners.</P>
    <P>Even if we have to accept the model <Col N="1367" /> of an economy based on the outlines contained in this plan, there is so much that could be done in the area of legislation which would cost little or nothing.  For instance, there is the whole question of children's legislation.  It is astonishing and hurtful that a Government who lay claim to social justice and social commitment can, in paragraph 5.44, dismiss the reform of juvenile justice in the following trite statement:</P>
    <P>The Government are also committed to bringing forward revised measures in regard to juvenile justice.  This will be the subject of a third Bill which is under examination at present.</P>
    <P>This is more than ten years after the task force was instituted.  It is two or three years since the task force reported and at least two years since Deputy Michael Woods announced that a Children Bill was almost ready for publication, incorporating this and other areas.  After all that time, a reforming Government can say no more than that they are committed to bringing forward revised measures to deal with juvenile justice, this in the light of the indecent haste with which the Criminal Justice Bill was rushed through. It may have seemed slow to many people but I still believe that it was indecently rushed through and indecently defended against the attempts of many of us to protect our children from it and yet we have no sense of similar urgency in terms of protecting our children from the ravages of the 1908 Act.  There is nothing either in this plan for social progress on the humiliations of the unemployed.  I will quote from a document that should be read by all of us in public life, that is the Economic and Social Research Institute's report <i>Employment and Unemployment Policy for Ireland.</i> On page 319 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Even if the social dangers inherent in having unemployment concentrated by age and district can be averted, there is, however, a more general social problem to be faced.  Apart from having to contend with the low income, <Col N="1368" /> which seems inescapable, most unemployed also have to suffer from reduced esteem, including in many cases their own.  This is not only unfair, in that the unemployed individuals are not themselves responsible for the high level of total unemployment, but socially damaging, as the fall in status can put strains on family, social and community relationships.  The principal counter to this problem lies in a relaxation of the strongly negative attitude that is often prevalent with regard to the unemployed.  Those in a position to be heard should repeat consistently that to be unemployed is a misfortune, not a personal failing, and they should be quick to counter ignorant assertions that it is only their own laziness or the generosity of the welfare benefits which prevents the jobless from obtaining work.</P>
    <P>A manifestation of the low regard for the unemployed lies in the nature of their transactions with the State bureaucracy, either in seeking jobs or in drawing their benefits or assistance. To permit greater dignity to these transactions would cost money, both for increasing staff numbers and for improving the physical environment of the relevant offices.  Even in a period of financial stringency, a strong case could be made for such money to be spent, as a public and visible recognition that the victims of prolonged imperfections in economic management are deserving of normal human respect.</P>
    <P>For relatively small expenditure that could have been done and it could have been contained in this report.  It is not there and in fact what is there is a suggestion that unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance should be linked to wage levels, effectively accepting the argument that to do otherwise would increase the disincentive to work as if there was a close correlation or a close relationship with the unemployment rates and wage rates.  In fact they are substantially less.  The average payment of unemployment benefit or assistance is £50 per week per beneficiary <Col N="1369" /> which is a long way off even the lowest levels of wages and in fact I would respectfully suggest that this linking of unemployment assistance to wage rates is a Government attempt to lower wages in yet another way in Irish society.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this document about social welfare appeals.  Probably the most galling and the most offensive procedure anyone on social welfare has to go through is the antiquarian and indeed socially degrading structure of the present social welfare appeals system. There is no mention either of the quite appalling supplementary welfare system with its extraordinary vagaries and unevenness of interpretation, all of which bear heaviest on those least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>Last week, all of our major political parties displayed their extraordinary timidity in the area of social reform in the way in which in the Dáil they talked around the question of vagrancy for a number of hours conjuring up visions of armies of homeless descending on Grafton Street, intimidating tourists, begging and frightening people.  The Deputies decided not to deal with the question but to wait for the Law Reform Commission to report.  Only then will they decide whether people should be sent to prison for begging and, secondly, whether it should be a crime to be wandering abroad without visible means of support, again the only penalty for which is a prison sentence.  The entire political establishment in Dáil Éireann, including the Minister for Justice, ran away from those two questions for reasons that escape me. The Minister said he, too, would prefer to wait for the Law Reform Commission's report.  If we are to wait for the Law Reform Commission's report on that issue then the whole question of legislative-based social reform is not a political reality, it is just a useful piece of rhetoric on the occasions of ard fheiseanna and so on.</P>
    <P>Many people of the left are not prepared to face up to what is the fundamental question, the question of jobs.  I am not talking of jobs that are suddenly plucked out of a hat without questions as to how <Col N="1370" /> they are to be financed.  There is no doubt but that the creation of wealth through the manufacturing and productive process is a fundamental prerequisite for any real dealing with the question of job creation. It is extraordinary that all through this report in a strategy which admittedly is well intentioned to create this wealth there is such a glorious contradiction between, on the one hand, the request for patriotism, the request for commitment to society &mdash; the Taoiseach made reference to this here today in expressing the hope that public servants would respond to the need for pay restraints &mdash; and on the other hand the quite unashamed assertion that we must create what is called the climate for enterprise so that those with ideas and wealth will invest their money.  Apparently it would be naive of me to suggest that the same requests for patriotism, the same request for social concern, the same request for concern for other people, would be directed towards those who take decisions about investments, those who take decisions about enterprise, as are being consistently directed towards those whose livelihoods depend on fairly low levels of pay.  That is the glorious contridiction that runs through the strategy of both Fianna Fáil and the Coalition on the question of wealth creation.  They are apparently incapable of believing that those who control wealth and capital will operate on any basis other than their own greed and selfishness but that those of us who earn a wage, whether manually or otherwise, can be persuaded to accept that sort of patriotic self restraint while others are not only escaping the restraint but are being offered increased incentives.</P>
    <P>There is so much talk about incentives, about taxation structures and about all of that in the area of industrial development, but industrial development does not come from strategies of investment or from strategies of incentive or from anything like that.  Industrial development comes fundamentally from an idea. It comes from people with ideas for new products and it is an area in which this country has failed quite gloriously in the <Col N="1371" /> past 20 years of reasonable industrial development, in other words, the area of indigenous new products based on ideas developed in this country.  Ideas are the basic prerequisite for indigenous manufacturing industry, not incentives, not taxation structures and not even marketing. I suggest that the source of ideas has been and always will be young people.  I do not believe it is possible for old men in their fifties and sixties to generate ideas on the scale and with the imagination that our young people can do it.  The example of the United States where the whole micro-chip revolution is by and large a young persons' phenomenon is a good example to look at.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, as a contribution towards the development of ideas, that since virtually every area of third level education is now financed to a greater or lesser extent by the State &mdash; about 80 per cent in the case of the universities and 100 per cent in the case of the remaining sectors &mdash; every single economic and economically related third level course, engineering, architecture, economics, commerce and all those areas, should contain a module on new product development. Everybody who graduates in engineering, in science or in any of those areas should be expected as part of their final year programme to produce an idea for a new product.  State funding should not be available to any course which did not accept that because what this country needs, more than it needs capital investment, more than it needs jobs, is ideas. It needs ideas incidentally in many areas apart from the economic area.  Even if we get the levels of economic growth &mdash; I would hope we would get beyond the pessimistic 2 per cent or 2½ per cent that the plan suggests &mdash; nobody, and I least of all, is persuaded that that will generate the sort of levels of employment which can solve our economic and unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is worth while referring again to the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute which clearly and in some detail proposes a strategy <Col N="1372" /> whereby they recognise that economic growth is the basic prerequisite for dealing with the problem of unemployment. They then go on, in the flight of what I described earlier as the hypnotised consensus, to suggest that part of and indeed fundamental to the strategy for dealing with the unemployment crisis, must not just be the stabilisation of employment in the public sector but an expansion of employment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The report produces a substantial amount of evidence from other OECD countries to suggest that it was the case in every OECD country in the period of low unemployment and of virtual full employment, that public sector employment increased more rapidly than private sector employment.  Let us get away from this image of the public sector around the neck of the magnificent entrepreneur.  In all those countries, with the exception of the United States, where public sector employment by and large increased more rapidly than private sector employment, overall economic growth rate was higher than in the United States and considerably higher than it was here.</P>
    <P>There is no basic conflict between high levels of public sector employment and high levels of economic growth.  That is an ideological issue.  It is not in any way a basic law of economics.  It is a position taken by people with a particular ideological perspective.  It is not true or objectively sustainable.  There are circumstances in which it might be true and circumstances in which it might not be true.  The Economic and Social Research Institute proposals in this area fly in the face of the new right and the new media economist and represent a real strategy for jobs as distinct from a strategy for the creation of wealth without any concept of what to do with it.</P>
    <P>If we are to do more than make ourselves the agents of an economy and instead make the economy the servant of ourselves, then we should begin to think in terms of the public sector as a major area of job creation, fuelled of course, by wealth creation both within the public and the private sectors.  Let it be said <Col N="1373" /> again that there is an increasing ideological hostility to the whole area of public enterprise based on a mixture of, in some cases, the errors made by some public sector companies, and also on a quite deliberate distortion of the achievements of many companies in the public sector who are burdened by Government policies which give them large social functions.</P>
    <P>For instance the ESB, for social reasons, are forced to keep turf burning stations open, although they are the least economical.  I agree with that decision, but it is unjust, unfair and quite demoralising to those who work in what is a relatively efficient industry to say then it is their fault that they are not making money on the scale required.  That sort of political interference in commercial decisions by State-sponsored bodies highlights the need for a body such as a national development agency to act as a protective layer between the obsessive interference of politicians in many of the commercial operations of semi-State companies and those bodies.</P>
    <P>I admire the Taoiseach enormously &mdash; I will never forget him saying at a conference in Kilkenny that in order to deal with the problem of poverty we need to subvert the established economic order. To have the Taoiseach use the word &ldquo;subvert&rdquo; was, for me, an enlightening experience and I still think it is true.  The present economic order and the concept of social justice are fundamentally irreconcilable. The Taoiseach said it and I, like other people present, did not think that he was going to produce a social revolution, but it reflected his commitment to social justice.  It is a tragedy, therefore, that this report does not reflect that as much as it reflects the current fashion of the right wing pariahs of economics who have a quite clear economic ideological conviction to a particular viewpoint which is not based on any sort of human need concept of economics but on a model which suggests that we are all little economic functionaries who will respond to material incentives in a particular way and suggests that the best way to deal with us is to make us work a little harder <Col N="1374" /> by taking a little more away from us.  It is based on quite clear, vested interests which have suffered as social democracy has developed in this country in the last 20 years and who now want to take back the little that was taken from us.  Incidentally, most of those right wing economists have one thing in common, they are all in secure employment, probably more secure and vastly better paid than anybody in the public sector that they so loudly deride.  They have been feeding a very compliant media and apparently have been winning the argument with the Government because it is quite extraordinary that a strategy for employment produced by the State's own Economic and Social Research Institute, written by the entire staff of that institute, could be so easily repudiated in a Government strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy contains one of the basic underpinning elements of the ESRI strategy which is a substantial reduction in the relative levels of public sector pay, not in the numbers but in the pay levels.  They have failed to build in that strategy an expansion of the public sector and the numbers who can be employed within the public sector.  Ultimately it comes down to what is and is not politically acceptable.  This is where the Government and indeed Fianna Fáil have failed miserably.  It is on the levels of taxation which are politically acceptable and the way that burden is distributed throughout the community &mdash; because it is from taxation that both public sector employment which is a necessary part of dealing with the unemployment crisis can be funded &mdash; and also from which transfers can be made to those in greatest need.  The levels of acceptable taxation are political questions.  The fact that the economic consensus now states that taxation levels are too high is a basic obstacle to dealing with the problem of social justice.</P>
    <P>I dispute the possibility of full employment ever being possible in a low taxation economy.  The United States have never got much below 6 per cent unemployment, even at the height of their boom period and that was an exceptionally high <Col N="1375" /> performing economy.  It also left enormous gaps in poverty, health and in housing, within that high level of growth. Therefore, I respectfully suggest that that particular model is of no significance.  We should look to our Western European partners who have built full employment on the basis of high levels of public sector employment and high levels of taxation. That is the way forward.  It is not popular, it is not fashionable, but it might perhaps be better than the blind ideology which seems to motivate many of those who stand, not so much on the right as in the limelight in Irish economic thinking today.  It is regrettable that we will have to go through painful social traumas before these ideologies are demonstrated for what they are &mdash; far more ideologically committed, far more rigid in their thinking than many of us who are accused of standing firmly on the left.</P>
    <P>I regret that at the basis of all this is an unwillingness on the part of Government and Opposition to tell the public that you cannot have decent education for your children without high levels of taxation, you cannot have security in the area of defence and the Garda without high levels of taxation, you cannot have the health services without high levels of taxation. If that was the argument that was put to people it would be relatively easy to get high levels of taxation accepted. We are getting instead a sniping at the entire fabric of social services, not based on any evidence of waste in any substantial quantities, not based on widespread abuse but on an ideological demand to reduce public expenditure <i>per se.</i> That, deep down under all the gloss and trimmings, is the regrettable conclusion of this report.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I commend to the Government something simple, taken from the <i>New Internationalist</i> of July 1982, on how to change your life.  It is a cartoon and, since we do not have audio-visual aids here I cannot display it to the House and it will not be contained in the Official Report.  It starts off by saying &ldquo;Begin where you are&rdquo;, so let us have less of this talk from the Government <Col N="1376" /> about what we would do if things were other than the way they are this minute. Those of us who are working for change in society in one form or another have no such luxury and neither have Governments.  You start where you are and you work from there.</P>
    <P>The second thing is to learn how the other half lives and that includes understanding that within the public sector there are not just the people on £15,000 a year but people on £80 and £90 per week and when you categorise the public service in terms of job security do not forget that there are road workers and street sweepers whose jobs are anything but secure.</P>
    <P>The third thing is to be self-critical, something that politicians by and large as a profession are singularly poor at but which would be a useful attribute for all of us in politics and particularly for Government.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is &ldquo;Do not burn yourself out&rdquo; but that will not be a problem with any Irish politician so I need not pursue it much further.</P>
    <P>The fifth point, and the most difficult one in Ireland as it stands, is to believe in change, to believe that it is possible to do something about it.  I am convinced that the number of Members of the Oireachtas, between Dáil and Seanad, who actually believe any more that anything like full employment is possible would be countable on one hand.  People are now talking about getting unemployment down to 100,000 where ten years ago the agreed national aim was zero unemployment.</P>
    <P>The final and most useful reminder from that little piece of information is &ldquo;Ask a big enough question&rdquo;.  The question we should ask again is not whether it is possible to reduce unemployment, not whether it is possible to get it down to 150,000 or 175,000, but whether it is possible to eliminate unemployment.  If it is not possible, we should tell our people so because then they might be prepared, and I suspect they would be prepared, to look at alternative economic systems which would be able to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with those words of welcome to the Taoiseach and also the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, who is to be with us for this debate.  This economic and social plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, is a very welcome document.  It is something that was urgently required at this point to deal with an extremely unsettled situation in the Irish economic scene.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the plan as presented. It contains a very high element of long term positive strategy.  In spite of what might have been said already or alluded to or inferred by innuendo, I am quite satisfied that there is absolute and positive long term strategy in the plan and this is something that has been awaited for quite some time by people wishing to invest, wishing to know where they were moving and so on.</P>
      <P>The plan largely gives a long term programme.  It does, to a degree, eliminate the uncertainty and lack of expectancy that there would otherwise be with regard to budgets on an annual basis.  It gives us a pretty certain solid foundation for a period of three years.  It is important that confusion and uncertainty be cast aside, in so far as it can be done, because confidence is the most important incentive that we can present to anybody to move forward in this or any economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise &mdash; and people miss this point very often &mdash; that in an economic programme or an economic and social plan the contribution of the Government is to create circumstances and the environment to make it possible for jobs to be generated by those with enterprise and a progressive attitude. This is something that people often forget.  Governments are expected to do this, that and the other.  There is a limit to what the Government can do but they can positively help in this area of creating the correct and proper environment.  I am satisfied with the emphasis being laid in this plan on the whole concept of inflation and interest rates being brought to the lowest level during the three year period.  That is the kind of environment that will attract people and make people <Col N="1378" /> here invest their money in our economy. It is something that we badly need.</P>
    <P>This is a definite plan.  It is not something that will be tinkered around with, but I would like to think that this central framework would allow an opportunity for certain flexibility and manoeuvrability as time progresses and as the dictates and the demands of the moment require.</P>
    <P>There are two very positive objectives in the plan which do not need stressing but are, perhaps, worthy of mention. Firstly, the plan sets out quite positively and clearly to tackle this very serious unemployment question.  I will in a few moments make reference to some of the points where it can positively and objectively realise its targets here.  Secondly, it sets out to remove the inequity that exists in the whole taxation area.  There is no point in our denying this.  There is inequity in taxation and we must not alone remove this inequity but must positively be seen to do so.  I am satisfied that the plan is a positive step towards solving the inequity in taxation and providing greater employment.  These are matters not easily resolved but nevertheless I am satisfied that the Government will successfully tackle them.  Let us not forget that we are at a very critical point in these two areas.  We cannot sustain any higher figure of unemployment.  We are at a figure <i>vis-à-vis</i> taxation where certain elements in our society will not find it possible to pay any higher.  This is really a turning point.  I optimistically and confidently believe we can realise the targets.</P>
    <P>The plan faces up to the hard realities. There is no point in denying that they are hard realities to face.  We must together endeavour to achieve prosperity and social and economic justice for the good of the country in the time ahead.  There is no way that any single section can of its own accord achieve the sort of things that are positively laid out here without full team work.</P>
    <P>The unemployment question and the taxation question are matters of top priority.  The other factor, also a top priority, is our endeavour to avoid insolvency in our economy and restore health to our public finances.  This is something <Col N="1379" /> we cannot overlook.  We have been living rather dangerously from a country's point of view in recent times and we must bear that clearly in mind.</P>
    <P>There is also uncertainty to which I have alluded already.  We can remove that uncertainty in the years ahead with the confidence I have referred to.</P>
    <P>There are a number of key areas in the plan that are worthy of mention and which have been debated in both Houses. The fact that this plan sets out to achieve the creation of 50,000 new jobs over the period is very important and warrants emphasis.  Direct Government measures will provide more than 10,000 full time jobs and more than 10,000 part time jobs. As I have stated already, the Government can do only a limited amount, but the main bulwark will come from the atmosphere the Government create.</P>
    <P>The modernisation of our national road system, of our whole infrastructure, is vital and £420 million will be invested in this area over the period.  There are a number of other areas I could deal with &mdash; health, education, the introduction of a national lottery and the £5,000 grants, which have already been referred to this afternoon, for persons leaving local authority housing.  That is to be lauded because it will provide houses for persons who badly need them.  There is a target of 50,000 full time jobs in the plan, a target where total employment will grow by almost 25,000 jobs, even before the special measures are taken into consideration. Then we have the other areas where 10,000 jobs will be created, and which I have already mentioned.  At the end of this period we should see a situation where we will have at least &mdash; and I reckon that this is a pessimistic point of view rather than an optimistic one &mdash; 10,000 fewer persons unemployed than we have at present.  People might scorn that, but it would be no mean achievement. I believe our unemployment position will be a great deal better than it is now.</P>
    <P>There are many targets being pursued to tackle the unemployment question. We have glibly glossed over this before. <Col N="1380" /> It is worth referring to the enterprise allowance scheme, the scheme for social employment which provides part time jobs for long term unemployed, and the new training and replacement scheme for the long term unemployed.  All of these, together with the Youth Employment Service, are to be lauded and will do a great deal to help the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector is very basic to the success of our economy.  A thriving agriculture will, and must, play a major part in any effort to put our economy right again.  There are a number of measures in regard to agriculture in the plan, mostly taking effect from 1986.  These include a headage payment for suckling beef animals of £70, an increase of £32; land drainage in the west will be given a very strong impetus; there will be radical changes in the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme and substantial additional funding will be made available under the new arrangements.  This additional levy, which will be discussed here today and tomorrow, the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1984, will only apply to 1985.  That fact is not realised.</P>
    <P>Some people have tended to denigrate the extra taxation on farmers.  It is very small in comparison with what is at stake &mdash; the future of the cattle and meat industry.  If this levy is effective in eliminating brucellosis and tuberculosis, in particular from our national herd it will have been a small price to pay.  It is a small amount of money compared with what our Minister for Agriculture and others achieved in their very satisfactory superlevy deal earlier this year.  There is no point talking about niggardly points and losing sight of the major issues.</P>
    <P>ACOT and the farm development service have a vital role to play in the future because an enlightened farming community is essential if we are to move forward.  Up to now there was a tendency for education for farmers to be of secondary consequence, and far too often it was left aside.  In future there will be emphasis on this aspect and educational standards will be set for entrants to farming. Looking at farming as a business will be more the order of the day than has <Col N="1381" /> been the case up to now.  There will be provision for a certificate in farming for progressive farmers to enable them to get State development aid.  These measures will be designed to increase the rate of land mobility so as to ensure that agricultural land will be in the hands of those best fitted to utilise it.  While land mobility is a very emotive subject, nevertheless, it is important that we make certain that land is in the hands of those who will use it to its maximum potential.  This is something we must not lose sight of: we have a limited acreage of land and we cannot afford the luxury of those limited acres being left unused or partially used.</P>
    <P>The main area of Exchequer investment will continue to be the farm modernisation scheme with special emphasis on investment in livestock housing.  An important sector of the farming industry is our agricultural exports.  Up to now they have not got the attention which would have produced results that would be beneficial to the country.  Added value has been talked about, but unfortunately very little has been done about it in recent times.  Thousands of extra jobs could be found by paying more attention to added value.  There is vast potential in the substitution of many of our imports by home produced goods.  In the food industry, for example, we have the position that between animal feed and human food we import goods valued at approximately £800 million per year.  We could conservatively reduce that figure by at least £300 million per year and that in itself would create many more jobs.  It would help our balance of payments deficit quite considerably and without any question it would add enormously to the prosperity of this country at this time.</P>

    <Title>Report of the New Ireland Forum: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator McGuinness on 12 September 1984:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> That Seanad Éireann take note of the Report of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the Report of the New Ireland Forum and accompanying documents as forming an important contribution to any resolution of the political issues posed by the division of the island and as providing an authoritative basis on which the realities of the political, economic, social and security problems can be considered and resolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Dooge.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to participate in the debate on this motion and amendments concerning the New Ireland Forum.  As a back-bencher, or more accurately as a sub, who participated in the deliberations of the Forum, and who regarded it as one of the most interesting and worth while experiences of my political career, I propose to look critically both at the process and at the product of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that in making my contribution I share the sense of urgency, almost of desperation, voiced by many contributors to this debate.  The New Ireland Forum was established to examine, and I quote &ldquo;the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved in a New Ireland&rdquo;. The very fact that it was brought into being and discharged its task, produced the report and complementary research material that it did, has introduced a new element in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This element can either be positive in helping to bring about a framework for lasting peace and stability, or unhelpful in exposing the lack of political will and capacity to achieve that result.  Either way, for better or for ill, the Forum will not be neutral in its impact on these islands over the coming years.  That is the <Col N="1383" /> gravity of the responsibility on those who are seeking to bring about the framework for a further phase in the production of fruitful negotiations following the publication of the report.  By acting, we have ourselves created a situation where we could, if this initiative were to fail, have worsened a very worrying situation.</P>
    <P>I turn first to the process of the Forum. In my view, it was essentially an educative process for the politicians and people of this part of Ireland, with the valuable spinoff of being able to provide for the several different audiences outside Ireland and in Northern Ireland &mdash; a considered, up to date and, hopefully, united nationalist perspective on the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved in a New Ireland.  This was a very valuable educative process.  It is a great pity it did not take place ten years before, or even 20 years before it did take place.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the educative process of the Forum should not be under estimated. In all, as is indicated in the report, 317 groups or persons made written submissions to the Forum.  There were 12 public sessions at which oral presentations were made by individuals or groups. The proceedings of those public sessions are also available in print.  In my view, they too form an inportant part of the Forum process.</P>
    <P>I personally tend to share the view expressed by a number of Senators that the range of contributors invited to make oral presentations to the Forum was too narrow, omitting in particular those who urged a more radical vision of a new Ireland in which more priority would be given to addressing and redressing the social inequalities and imbalances in our existing societies, both North and South. However, the printed reports of the public sessions of the Forum provide an interesting area of study.  It is worth examining the areas which were particularly emphasised by those groups of individuals who came to address the Forum and then to look at the extent, if any, to which these areas and concerns were given expression in the final report of the <Col N="1384" /> Forum or in the accompanying research documents.</P>
    <P>I recall that one constant theme in the written and oral submissions made by the representatives of the several Protestant Churches who made presentations to the Forum was that the Forum itself provided an unique opportunity for a critical self-examination. It provided a unique opportunity for a critical examination of the Constitution, laws and practices of the Republic.  If this opportunity were taken up this would provide a very valuable contribution to establishing a basis for lasting peace and stability.  However, I invite those with a fine enough toothcomb to peruse the report of the New Ireland Forum and to find those elements of constructive self-criticism which got through the political filter.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties about perhaps being mature enough, or having the political will and sense of priority which others have, to examine and expose areas which the Forum members were invited to look at in that critical context.  There are a number of other examples.</P>
    <P>It must be difficult for the women's law and research group who participated in a public session on 17 November 1983 and also for Sylvia Meehan, the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency who took part in a discussion on 19 January 1984, to find in the written word of the report any indication of interest in their vision and sense of priorities for a New Ireland.  It is valuable to have these printed oral sessions to see the kind of questions that were put and to see the sort of answers.</P>
    <P>The process of questioning was very valuable.  This was brought out particularly in the session which received a great deal of media attention when the representatives of the Catholic Bishops came to the Forum on 9 February 1984.  Apart altogether from the range of issues discussed at that session, the visible evidence, witnessing the Catholic Bishops and their representatives being questioned by politicians at the Forum, may have marked a modest beginning to a healthy separation of Church and State in Ireland.  It has a very real impact on <Col N="1385" /> people throughout the country.  Certainly I got a feedback from people throughout Ireland either in letters or in conversation months afterwards.  They said how interesting it had been to hear politicians discuss issues publicly and question and not necessarily fully accept the answers given by Catholic Bishops, that this was very healthy and not before time.  If we had more open debate of that kind we would create the conditions for a much healthier approach to the very separate concerns and responsibilities of Church and State in these areas.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the product of the Forum which includes not only the report itself but, as the amendment makes it clear, the important research studies which accompanied the reports and are part of the output of the Forum.  I would include in this the printed public sessions where there was the dialogue with those who made oral presentations to the Forum. The document in question has been referred to by a number of other Senators. Included are the economic studies dealing with the comparative development of the economic structure North and South, the economic consequences of division, the cost of violence and so on.  It includes also the study of the legal system and the examination of certain subject areas such as those of energy, agriculture and transport.</P>
    <P>In some cases individual members of the Forum did not have much input into the papers.  These were largely the work of the consultants, also presumably, with a valuable contribution from the secretariat of the Forum, but there were others, particularly the economic studies, where members of the Forum participated actively on sub-committees and vetted the output very substantially.  It is extremely valuable to have this data base which will help to ensure that discussions on the broader implications of any political development on the island of Ireland are considered and debated in a more informed framework.  This is extremely important.  It was one of the very strong messages that came through from one of the oral presentations from the Irish Information Partnership, as they are <Col N="1386" /> called, who are established in Britain and who specialise in the provision of up-to-date information and data.  They emphasised the importance of having an authoritative and comprehensive data base if you are going to have the necessary understanding of the dimensions of the problems and the necessary basis on which to make progress.  For that reason also, the Forum has fulfilled a valuable role.  These research papers and the contribution which they made are not the political core of what is contained in the work of the New Ireland Forum.  That is represented by this comparatively brief report.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to a consideration of the report which was published on 2 May 1984.  Having had several months to reflect on the contents of this report, it is evidently both a brief and a seminal document which requires to be read and to be understood both in the context of the complexity of the issues being considered and in the novel format in which the politicians of the four political parties came together to consider these issues.  It is one of the lasting tributes to the Forum that it succeeded not only in initiating but in continuing this novel process.  There were moments when such might not have been possible to sustain.  There were difficulties, even associated with leaks from the deliberations which were taking place in private at a very sensitive stage which were tending possibly to sufficiently rock the boat to undermine the novel process.</P>
    <P>The verdict on the report may still be premature.  It is a little early for us to be confident that we can characterise the report of the Forum in a definitive way and say that it is the most significant contribution to Anglo-Irish relations in 50 years, or it is a document which is without authority because it did not address the real problems and so on.  It is very difficult to come to a final verdict on the report.  The report of the New Ireland Forum is not to be dismissed, as some commentators have tended to do, as being a political Irish solution for an Irish problem.  There has been a tendency to say: &ldquo;What would you expect from a Forum in which the Nationalist parties <Col N="1387" /> were represented except the unattainable of a commitment to a united Ireland? Have they learned nothing and how is it that in 1984 politicians who did seek to address the economic, social and broader political issues came up with a preference for a unitary state and two other models which are more far-reaching than the majority in Northern Ireland and possibly the Government in Britain would be prepared to contemplate?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The aspect of the report which requires to be understood and which may give it a peculiarly Irish quality in that sense is that it has an element about it of saying one thing in very clear terms but perhaps meaning another and of having within it nuances which are more important than the explicit statements.  In other words, as a member of the Forum and in an individual capacity, I would subscribe to the view that the Forum report does require the sort of treatment which was meted out to it by Professor Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden in a paper which they published.  The title of the paper shows what the thrust of it is.  They title their paper <i>How to Read the New Ireland Forum Report searching between the Lines for a Realistic Framework for Action.</i> That approach is very important in understanding, certainly in the context of 1984, what the significance of the Forum is &mdash; that you must search between the lines of it to get the realistic framework for action.  It is not too difficult, if you adopt that approach, to find within the Forum a very open and realistic basis for political progress.</P>
    <P>The assessment of the present problem contained in chapter 4 is qualitatively different from the assessment that has occurred from Irish sources since the Free State was established and this country was partitioned.  There is much more openness to recognising the different cultural identity, the different sense of Britishness of the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland.  That comes through very substantially in the assessment of the present problem.  It comes through in a very far-reaching recognition of the implications of the Britishness, of the <Col N="1388" /> separate sense of identity and of the importance of recognising that identity.</P>
    <P>It was an extremely important consideration for the members of the three political parties based here in this part of Ireland to hear first hand and to understand in full measure the sense of isolation, the sense of frustration and the degree of sheer pain and suffering endured down the years, right up to now and continuing among the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland.  In many ways we might have thought that we understood this fully but it was not brought home to quite such an extent until we participated in this structured way in examining the extent of the problem and the total lack of expression of identity of the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I say on a personal level that an extraordinary benefit of participating in the Forum process was getting to know individually much better than I did before the many members of the SDLP who participated.  Their commitment to the Forum was quite extraordinary.  Not only were they present in very substantial numbers at every meeting of the Forum &mdash; and it was rare for even some of the alternate members to be absent from any session of the Forum &mdash; but they were also prepared to sit for whatever hours it took, over weekends if necessary.  They were very ready to mix with the representatives of the political parties from this part of the country, and did so in a way which cemented friendships and created a basis for personal meetings in the future which will make an important contribution at the personal level to better understanding by politicians in this part of the country of the situation which the people live with day by day and month by month in Northern Ireland.  That is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Where we look to read between the lines in the report is in the assessment of the present situation in chapter 4 and the framework for a new Ireland outlined in chapter 5.  It is clear that certain elements of chapter 5 must be considered in this way; you have to read between the lines. Paragraph 5.2 sets out what the Forum proposes, having considered the synopsis <Col N="1389" /> of the realities which grows out of chapter 4.  Paragraph 5.2 (2) and (3) place clear emphasis on the prerequisite that any new Ireland which the Forum seeks can come about only through agreement and must have a democratic basis.  Paragraph 5.2 (3) provides that agreement means that the political arrangements for a new and sovereign Ireland will have to be freely negotiated and agreed by the people of the North and the people of the South.  Therefore, you have separate contexts in which there would have to be agreement.  This is a very important acknowledgement which is fundamental to the whole thrust of the report, that there must be the agreement and that, although the parties to the Forum can have a vision and a sense of priorities and can place emphasis where they wish to, as the Forum says, they alone cannot determine; it must be on the basis of entering into a dialogue and discussion. Chapter 5 places emphasis on the preference of the members of the Forum for a unitary state and paragraph 5.9 refers to the other proposals which were examined, the proposals for a federal/confederal state and for joint authority, and these are fleshed out in chapters 7 and 8.  Paragraph 5.10 contains a brief but significant statement that:</P>
    <P>The Parties in the Forum also remain open to discuss other views which may contribute to political development.</P>
    <P>In the context of having stated so clearly that any political commitment requires the agreement of the people of the North and of the people of the South, that emphasises the significance of saying that the parties to the Forum are open to discuss other views which may contribute to political development.  Let me now refer to what some of those other views might be, because obviously they are not in the report.  I would like to refer to proposals in this area put forward by Professor Kevin Boyle and Dr. Tom Hadden in that paper which I have already mentioned. At page 23 of the paper they crystallise what they see as a problem about the approach adopted in the Forum in the options which it has put forward as <Col N="1390" /> the options it would like to have on the table.  I quote from the paper:</P>
    <P>The essential objection to each of the options which the Forum has produced is that none is likely to secure the consent of the majority community in Northern Ireland for the foreseeable future.  Nor does the Forum provide any indication of how the long-standing problem of finding a form of government within Northern Ireland which will provide for the effective involvement of representatives of both communities is to be resolved.  If a process of constitutional and legislative change which would help to produce peace and stability without threatening the established position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom can be found, there are strong pragmatic arguments for adopting that less radical approach.</P>
    <P>The complex inter-relationships between the two parts of Ireland, Britain and the rest of the European Community can be more readily accommodated by making a number of <i>ad hoc</i> institutional adjustments than by attempting to start with a clean slate on which some new ideal model is to be drawn up.  The objective should be to devise a programme of constitutional, legal and governmental action to provide more effectively for the long-standing interdependence of the peoples and states of Britain and Ireland rather than to build models with the traditional but outdated concepts of national independence and exclusive state sovereignty.  This programme should reflect the realities of the relationships between the peoples of Britain and Ireland as a whole and the two communities within Northern Ireland on a number of different levels: (i) the recognition in practical terms of the differing identities and loyalties of the two communities within Northern Ireland; (ii) the provision of effective mechanisms for the exercise of appropriate rights by the majority and minority communities in Northern Ireland at a political level; (iii) the legal <Col N="1391" /> protection of both individual and communal rights within Northern Ireland and the Republic; (iv) the recognition in practical terms of the inter-relationships between the peoples of Britain and Ireland; (v) the development of formal and practical arrangements for security before, during and after the implementation of any new arrangements; (vi) the formal recognition of these new arrangements as binding international agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am afraid I anticipated that my allotted time would not allow me to deal in detail, nor is it necessary for me to do so, with the kind of approach being suggested there.  It comes within the possible other proposals which fit into the structure of the Forum.  They fit into the assessment in chapter 4, the realities set out in chapter 5 and the approach to those realities.  It is important that we are open to the basis for phase 2, for a political momentum which will assist in contributing to the implementation of the real mandate to the Forum: to provide a basis for lasting peace and stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to the point I made at the outset, that when the Forum was launched in May 1983 the four party leaders emphasised in unqualified terms the urgency of the situation.  At the closing speeches on 2 May of this year again great emphasis was laid on the urgency and gravity of the problem.  In the months since the report was published and while we still await a formal British response, that sense of urgency has grown and become something close to apprehension. I must come back to the point I emphasised at the start, that the impact of the New Ireland Forum cannot be neutral.  It cannot be unrelated to whether the initiative succeeds in creating a framework for a structured discussion of the political future on these islands.  If it does not do so, then it will have been negative in its impact.  It will <Col N="1392" /> have had a serious adverse impact which would worsen greatly the political stability and the general situation for ordinary men, women and children in Northern Ireland and within these islands.  It would be a terrible political tragedy if this initiative, an initiative by the constitutional Nationalists on this island, were deemed to have failed so that a political vacuum was being left to be filled.  Whatever differences of emphasis the political parties of the forum might have had on the thrust, or even on the interpretation of the report, we are united in our deep concern for this opportunity that political progress will not be missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the New Ireland Forum is addressed to all the people of this island.  Indeed, it is addressed to the Government and people of the neighbouring island of Great Britain. It was a brilliantly conceived idea to bring all the political parties on this island, North and South, together to discuss the roots, the causes and, hopefully, a solution to this awful tragedy in the north-eastern part of this island.  It was a great pity that only the four main nationalist parties saw fit to come together and talk.  I would say in all generosity and sincerity to the Unionist politicians, and to the population which they represent, that they too are citizens of this island.  It would be realistic, and wise, on their part to see their future not in the context of an allegiance to the neighbouring island but in the context of living on and sharing all that this island has to offer.  They do not belong to the Gaelic tradition or to the practice of Roman Catholicism but all civilised people on this side of the Border see them as part of this country and part of our own population. Whether they are Nationalist, Gaelic or Unionist, whether Catholic or Protestant or wherever they live on this island it is only the minimum in enlightenment to see them all as part of the Irish nation.  I know that this was the attitude that informed the thinking of all the parties who sat down to talk in the forum. One has to say, nevertheless, that there is a minority even within the constitutional <Col N="1393" /> political process of this side of the island, who have something of a troglodyte outlook and who only see progress towards a new Ireland in the context of a tightly controlled unitary State which would suppress all cultural and ethnic manifestations except those of the majority.</P>
      <P>We do not say, of course, that there is a monopoly of the politics of the &ldquo;cave&rdquo; on one side of the line only. The political representatives who came south in the dead of night during the morning of 2 May last to paste their posters with the message that &ldquo;Ulster is British&rdquo; on the portals of the GPO, and on the gates of this building, are all part of that dreary, sad and sterile attitude which states, &ldquo;no discussions or negotiations except on our terms; our side is absolutely right and your side is absolutely wrong&rdquo;.  In other words, &ldquo;not an inch and no surrender&rdquo;. We must hope that the results that may flow from the publication of this report will isolate the propounders of this benighted approach.  It was a great pity that only the constitutional Nationalist parties on this island sat down in this forum and that it did not contain those who give allegiance to the Union.  Perhaps it would be too much to suggest to the three main Unionist parties north of the Border, the DUP, the Official Unionist Party and the Alliance Party, that they too might sit down together and discuss, in the form of another forum, how they see their future on this island.  One accepts fully that that would not be easy, as it was not easy for the nationalist parties to sit down together since there has always been difference and conflict between the Nationalists as to their approach to the North of Ireland and to the all-Ireland question in general.  However, for the first time in 60 years those parties did sit down.  Remembering that they represent 75 per cent of the population on the island, and, indeed, over 90 per cent of the Nationalist population on the island they sat down and discussed their differences and composed them in this report to which they have all given their signature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must commend the procedures <Col N="1394" /> adopted at the forum, the outstanding idea of asking for oral submissions from any interested person, or party, the idea of asking so many diverse interests and organisations within the nation to come forward and give their verbal submissions to the forum.  We must be grateful that the churches of the various denominations came forward and made their oral submissions, had their submissions examined and even cross-examined.  We must be grateful too to the people who came and put the Unionist point of view.  They too had their points of view examined and also cross-examined.  All of this was part of the educative process which over the 11 months of its progress gave us this historic report.</P>
    <P>The document is mostly objective, generous and very much to the point on all our faults.  It is not dogmatic, it has no air of unalterable finality.  No student of history could find fault with its historical analysis of the situation.  It sets out rightly the disaster of the imposition of the Government of Ireland Act of 1920 which was imposed by the Westminster Parliament upon this island.  Rightly it points out that prior to 1920 and during the many centuries of British rule before that this island was seen as a single integral political unit.  While this Act might have hoped to do better than it did in the end it did no more than entail the partition of Ireland into two separate political units. One agrees when the report says that the parliamentary arrangements in the South after partition politically sought to cater for the minority status of the southern Unionists and those not of the majority religion.  This they did with considerable, if not total, success.  One might say that while that was our attitude which was carried out in practice with great success on this side of the Border our attitude towards Northern Ireland itself was something quite different.  From 1937 onwards we adopted on this side of the Border an insular and hostile attitude towards the other part of our population north of the Border.  This, no more than the discrimination of the regimes of Stormont, contributed very much towards the alienation and the growing apart and <Col N="1395" /> giving us a situation of almost two nations.</P>
    <P>The report comments that the intention underlying the creation of Northern Ireland was to establish a political unit containing the largest land area that was consistent with maintaining a permanent majority of Unionists and, since the Unionists were in a minority on the island, they had taken on a siege mentality and the northern nationalists were the principal victims of this arrangement. Out of this colossal, arrogant folly came the mayhem, the violence and the sheer devilry which is part of life in that part of the island today.  Some other speaker said that it was a sowing of the dragons' teeth that grew up as armed men.  That is absolutely true.  We should not at this stage devote a lot of our time to apportioning blame, but I must put it on record that I apportion a far less share of the blame to the Stormont Parliament than I do on the Westminster Parliament.  Stormont was at all times subject to Westminster, but Westminster chose &mdash; until 1972, when at long last it recognised the failure of the 1920 settlement by imposing direct rule &mdash; to allow in the interim 50 years a regime of discrimination and maladministration to prevail that would have been unthought of and unheard of on the main island.  The Sunningdale agreement was perhaps the most honest attempt by a British Government since the time of Gladstone to bring forward a workable or acceptable solution to that remaining part of the Irish question.  Alas, that brave experiment failed when the British Government of the day, in the most cowardly fashion, backed down, scuttled the Sunningdale agreement, the power-sharing agreement, in the wake of a loyalist strike.  It is a great pity that the resoluteness which seems to inform the present British Prime Minister in dealing with a certain ongoing industrial dispute on the mainland today &mdash; whether that be right or wrong &mdash; was not found by the then British Prime Minister in May 1974.</P>
    <P>Since Sunningdale, as the report states, there have been a number of initiatives by the British Government to try to solve <Col N="1396" /> the problem but they were always within the limits or context of finding a solution within Northern Ireland itself.  Of course, all of them failed.  This blinkered approach of the British &mdash; they always seemed to be prisoners of the Unionist veto &mdash; again showed their lack of real understanding, their historic misunderstanding of this island and its problems.</P>
    <P>We commend the report for the manner in which it sought to look into the minds of the Unionist population with sympathy and understanding.  Their summary in Chapter 4, under Unionist Identity and Attitudes, is brief.  But it is very much to the point and constitutes a concise account of how they see themselves, their identity, their perceived Britishness, their very understandable attachment to be economically Britain.  One can fully understand their fears of cultural blanketing in an all-Irish context if we are not to change.  One can understand their fear of the IRA campaign of murder, pillage and arson.  Of course one understands their fears of their minority status in an all-Ireland situation.  The very essence of this report is to say to them: If you join us in effecting a solution to what has been happening over the past 15 terrible years as the report puts it &mdash; we will be absolutely generous in accommodating your aspirations, interests and your guaranteed share of influence under a completely new legal and constitutional arrangement for the whole island.</P>
    <P>Of course there remains Britain and the British Government.  John Hume said last May at the time of publication of the <i>New Ireland Report</i> that Margaret Thatcher now stood at the bar of history, that one hoped she will not miss her historic opportunity, an historic opportunity, to start the solution, once and for all of the remaining part of the Irish question.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Gladstone previously.  He was the last British Prime Minister to adopt a high moral and understanding approach to Ireland, that is almost a century ago.  He was inclined to the correct view that Ireland is a seamless garment, that a solution to its problems should be seen in that context.  We hope that this <Col N="1397" /> British Government will study this report, all of its eight chapters, 38 pages, from beginning to end.  We hope they will, after consideration, act in a generous, enlightened and logical way.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I had better start my reply simply by repeating, what I said at the beginning, that I accept the amendment put down in the names of Senators Dooge and Ferris.  Therefore, I will not be attempting to put the matter to a vote as to whether this amendment should be taken along with my motion.  I am quite prepared to accept it, as is my seconder, Senator Robb.</P>
      <P>It is a welcome thing that this Seanad debate on the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> should end just before the November summit when the British and Irish Governments will be meeting to look into and plan for the future.  It is important &mdash; and the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> brings it home to us &mdash; that, in order to try to propound any sort of solution to the present problems in Northern Ireland, it is not enough simply to put the people of Northern Ireland yet again under the microscope and to point out what faults either community in Northern Ireland has.  It is time for both Dublin and London to look at themselves critically, examine what is wrong with what they have done in the past and what they can do right in the future to try to improve this situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to the British Government's cowardice in giving way to the loyalist strike over the Sunningdale agreement.  He was perfectly right in doing so.  That was but one of the mistakes which have been made by the British Government.  As I made clear in my introductory speech to this motion, there are many things which I feel this Government in Ireland could have done and have not done to try to present a more possible and feasible plan for a united Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many interesting contributions to this debate.  I was very pleased to find that so many Senators were interested and willing to speak on my motion. Unfortunately, I was not personally <Col N="1398" /> present to hear all of them because &mdash; by a quirk of fate Private Members' Time so often clashes with the meetings of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. And I am sure Senators will appreciate the terrible things that happen to one if one does not attend those committee meetings.  Therefore I was not able to hear everyone.  But I have read them all with interest.  While I cannot comment on them all tonight &mdash; in the amount of time available to me &mdash; I should like to make reference at least to a number of them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is understandable that one of the people whose contribution came home to me the most was that of Senator Robb because, as he said himself, &ldquo;remember that I come out of the tradition which has to be wooed in Northern Ireland, that out of that tradition I am committed completely to the building of a new society in Ireland in an all-Ireland context; I am an Irishman&rdquo;.  This is precisely what I was saying, precisely my own position.  Therefore, I was very interested to hear what Senator Robb had to say.  I was very struck by the care he took in his contribution.  I feel that what he has to say about the reality of consent and the reality of consensus &mdash; covered in columns 554, 555 and 556 of the Official Report of 25 September &mdash; where he points out that it is just not enough in the Northern Ireland situation to say that a majority on either side is sufficient to make a decision, that one must look for something rather more complex than that, is a genuine and helpful contribution to how the ideas put forward in the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> could be put into effect.  That is what we are about here, the putting into effect of the hopes and ideals that are set forward in the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i>, not just in congratulating ourselves on how good we were in producing such a handy document.</P>
    <P>What Senator Robb had to say on the social dimension is reported at column 559 in the Official Report and I quote briefly:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> Now we come to the social dimension. All the fine words contained in the Forum report are unlikely to obtain a constructive response from those to whom they are primarily addressed unless the present administration in the Republic also sets about giving an earnest of its intent to set in motion, beyond the New Ireland Forum, the creation of a truly new Ireland, and unless the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland indicates that it appreciates fully that it has had a role in sustaining the outdated phenomenon of political Protestantism in this country as distinct from Imperial Unionism and that it is prepared to take positive steps to defuse this in keeping with steps which it has already taken.  Much more now requires to be done in a true marriage of the tradition that there should be no second-class partners.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things he said is that there should be no second-class partners.  The Forum report itself says it and I tried to bring that out.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan in his contribution was correct in saying that a great deal has been left out.  Senator Robinson drew attention to this this evening when she pointed out that, for instance, there has been no discussion in the Forum report of the position of NATO or neutrality, and that there is exclusion of reference to people whom Senator Brendan Ryan described as marginal, the travellers, the unemployed and so on, in the report.  Despite the thoughtful and careful contributions by the various women's organisations, there is virtually no reference to aspects of policy in regard to the position of women, North and South. This is a pity because of the contributions by such organisations as the Council on the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency, both of which were deeply thought-out contributions, backed up by a great many facts.  I am not saying attention was not given to these contributions but very little came through in the final report.</P>
    <P>Although I agree with Senators Ryan <Col N="1400" /> and Robinson that in many ways the report does not address itself to many questions, particularly social equality, social change, what to do about other minority groups, that it concentrated so firmly on the idea of the Protestant Unionist tradition as being the minority group in the island of Ireland, that it forgot the other minority groups that need to be dealt with, we must accept that the Forum report should be a beginning for discussions on all the other problems.  We are not suggesting that the report is the answer to everything &mdash; if we suggested that we would be condemning it to total failure, because it is not an end in itself. It is a beginning and we should try to include all the other aspects in future debates on the same kind of lines as we would bring both North and South into discussions of the problems that occur which are quite common to all of us in the island.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to homeless people North and South and the problems of travelling people North and South.  There we could make joint contributions towards solutions which would not raise so many political hackles as some of the more difficult questions. We could move forward in regard to these areas.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcomed the contribution made by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am sorry if she felt I tried to be hurtful to her in some of the things I said in my introductory speech.  In some ways it is true that I was stating my case very strongly, precisely in order to provoke her reaction, but I said what I truly felt. It would be a mistake to think that there is no alienation in the minority population in the Twenty-six Counties, not alone among the minority population but the way in which things appear to be moving and the way in which this is symbolised not so much in the result of the amendment referendum last year but the whole course of the debate on it &mdash; the kind of things that were said, the way in which people were treated and so on. These things created alienation which has not yet died down.  A sort of cloth seems to have been drawn over it now but I can <Col N="1401" /> assure you that if you talk to groups who are not necessarily Protestant but who perhaps do not go along with the majority view of that amendment, you will find that the same hurts are still boiling under the surface and that there is still not just a worry about it but a feeling of lack of optimism, not exactly of despair but about where we are going to move from here, a feeling that the promise of the sixties has gone backwards.</P>
    <P>We must look not only at the views of the minority religions but at the increasing numbers of people who do not consider that they really belong to the old forms of tradition on the island.  I listened to a radio programme today which investigated the levels of Sunday Mass attendance. It was admitted by a number of parish priests in Dublin city centre and suburban parishes that 30 per cent was roughly an average attendance of parishioners at Mass.  In the early stages of these parishes, in Tallaght, for instance, it was more like 10 per cent.  In a country where we are accustomed to think that well over 90 per cent of the people are practising Catholics, it is a bit of an eyeopener to find that only 30 per cent of large urban populations are willing to make the traditional gesture of the practising Catholic, attendance at Sunday Mass.</P>
    <P>When we look at the population and say that 90 per cent of us feel this way, I would suggest that perhaps 90 per cent of us do not feel this way, and that it is not only the religious minority but quite a number of our young people and a large percentage of our urban population who feel alienation from the State continuing, whether on a Twenty-six Counties or a Six Counties basis, on the same lines as hitherto with the kind of constitutional prohibitions we have had.</P>
    <P>In a way all this is beside the point I was about to make on what Senator Honan said.  I am perfectly willing to accept that Senator Honan's relationship with the minority religious community in her area could not be better.  She is a close and valued friend of mine.  However, the trouble is that when you are talking in terms of a united Ireland you are not <Col N="1402" /> talking about being friendly with some nice quiet Protestant but of a State in which you have nasty, aggressive Protestants as well.  You are talking of having to deal with that, not just of dealing with people who are reasonably amenable and will not kick up a row about things unless they have been made desperate.  What we must try to create is a new Ireland where we would have not only Protestants who are our good friends but also those who are not.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers's contribution to the debate was important in that she comes from Northern Ireland and is a member of the SDLP, the only party from the North who took part in the Forum.  Senator Rogers was right when she said that the nationalist population in the North are thoroughly alienated from the forms of government they have and from the whole establishment in the North while, at the same time, the Unionist population are more insecure and fearful than ever before.  It is no longer a question of the nationalists feeling alienation and the Unionists feeling triumphalist, that they are the rulers of the roost.  They too are now very insecure and very fearful.  Their unending repetition of the fact that Britain has guaranteed them that Northern Ireland will not be asked to leave the United Kingdom without their consent indicates that they are just that bit worried about whether this guarantee will be lived up to&mdash;a question of protesting too much, perhaps.</P>
    <P>At the same time there are moderate Unionist people &mdash; not the followers of Ian Paisley &mdash; whose minds were behind the Unionist document &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; and others, whom I meet in the various all-Ireland groups I take part in, who feel that the time may have come for some sort of move and that &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; is not enough.  They feel the time has come to look at political solutions which may not mean the unending continuation of the Northern Ireland State as it is now and that negotiations should be entered into while there is still some strength left to negotiate.  We must try to hold out a hand to these people to show them that we too are willing to move.  If <Col N="1403" /> we expect them to make such an enormous move from their position we too must be prepared to move.  It is very important to remember that these people exist, not perhaps in very large numbers, but their numbers could be enlarged by wise policy-making, both by our Government and, one hopes, by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers also drew attention to the international reaction to the forum report.  This is an aspect that did not strike other people so much but which is very important.  The international press and various international agencies reacted very favourably to the report.  To some extent they put pressure on Britain to respond in a positive way.  Senator Rogers quoted from German newspapers which urged the British Government to respond to the fact that the Irish Government were willing to discuss the matter in an openminded fashion and were willing to move forward and that this should urge the British Government to move forward from their position.  Outside opinion, particularly from our EEC partners, is an important factor in the foreign policy of any country.</P>
    <P>I found the contribution made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs very understandable in the context in which it was placed.  It was shortly after the Brighton bombing and shortly before the November summit.  He was caught between these two difficult positions in that, in order to make a success of the November summit, he had to be very firm in his condemnation of the Brighton bombing. It was a pity, in a sense, that so much of his contribution was given over to this kind of condemnation of the Provisional IRA.  While I join with him in condemning the Brighton bombing and in condemning the attempts to kill or the successful killing of anyone, regardless of whether they are what is regarded as important or unimportant, we will not get far in solving the problem simply by condemning the Provisional IRA.  In some ways they are filling in where the rest of us have failed.  We must present a <Col N="1404" /> credible and real alternative.  The Minister dealt with this to some extent towards the end of his speech where he proclaimed the importance of democratic political values.  He is right about the importance of democratic political values.  The trouble is that it is not just that simple to provide a solution for this problem.  This was what Senator Robb addressed himself to in his contribution &mdash; the difficulty about consent and consensus and how one works towards this sort of consent.  He made strong reference to the difficulties of the nationalist minority in the North which are very real. Everyone should appreciate the very difficult position in which they find themselves. The Minister, in some of his speeches, made a practice of offering the protection of the Government to the nationalist minority in the North.  Sometimes I wonder what the nationalist minority in the North think about this. Just how far do they value the protection of the present Government in the Republic &mdash; by that I do not mean this Government but any Government from the time of not standing idly by in 1969 to protecting the nationalist minority now?  How practical is the protection they are offering? What would Irish unity on the terms of being absorbed into this State offer to the nationalist minority in the North?  My own experience, from talking to members of the nationalist minority, is that they would have many very hard questions to ask before they accepted unity on the terms of moving in this State. Some of their questions might be even harder to answer than some of the Unionists' questions.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan said that the question of unemployment was left out of the report.  The economic scene was discussed in the other documents that went with the report, so I would not go along entirely with Senator Ryan in saying that this was neglected.  Nevertheless, the position is that many of the sufferings of the unemployed and the deprived in the nationalist area of Belfast can, in a sense, be blamed on a hostile government.  They can sit there and say they would not be so badly off it they did <Col N="1405" /> not have the Brits pushing them around or if they did not have the army interfering with them, or did not have a hostile police force and so on.  There is a famous story of Parnell meeting a man who was breaking stones and saying to him &ldquo;if Ireland got her freedom you would still be breaking stones.&rdquo;  Supposing we do get Irish unity and these people are still unemployed, deprived and poverty stricken, who do they then blame?  Which Government do they turn on then and what will happen?  We must address ourselves to these kind of problems as well as to the problems of how to win consensus from the Unionist people?  It was rather disappointing that in the Minister's contribution he had very little positive to say about what we here in the Republic should be doing in order to progress the ideas put forward in the New Ireland Forum report.  I understand the position he was in and that in his political position there were certain things he had to say, but I was sorry that he did not go on further and try to outline what the present Government are planning to progress the whole concept as is set out by the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>As regards this evening's contributions Senator Robinson, as always, was perceptive and helpful in her analysis of the situation.  I agree very much with her about the importance of the process of the New Ireland Forum and the educational quality of the process that was undergone by all those who took part in the forum debates and those who were present at the various contributions made by those who gave evidence to the forum. I dealt with that myself at an earlier stage. This process of education and of critical self-examination is of vital importance if we are going to make the report become a reality.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson in saying that very little of this critical self-examination has got through the political filter to appear in the actual wording of the report, but nevertheless it is clear reading between the lines that there was a good deal of critical self-examination and critical evaluation of what our society was like here.  That did come across in <Col N="1406" /> much of the questioning and cross-questioning of the people who gave evidence, perhaps supremely so in the evidence given by the Roman Catholic bishops and the questioning of them by the various members of the forum.  One should note with interest in the context of what I said about the nationalist minority in the North that some of the most searching examination of the bishops in their attitude to, for instance, the divorce question was by Séamus Mallon of the SDLP.  This bears out what I was saying about the searching questions that the nationalist minority might ask us if we offered them unity on the terms of the State we have at present.</P>
    <P>I would agree also with Senator Robinson that it is difficult to pass a final verdict on the forum report.  The final verdict will not depend on what the report actually says but on what we do with it.  If we use the report with this self-criticism, with this analysis of our own society, and if Britain uses the report in the same kind of way in criticising their attitude to Ireland over the years and in trying to see what new moves they can make that are out of a different cast of mind than the cast of mind that they have exhibited up to now, the report will go down in history as something that was a seminal document, that was extremely successful, that was of immense importance in the history of this country and indeed in the history of the United Kingdom as well. But if we just sit back and say &ldquo;we did a very good job and this is putting forward some very worthy ideals which we accept in our minds but which we are not going to do very much about&rdquo;, the report and the whole forum will go down in history as being an interesting experiment but one which in the end led to nothing, perhaps a little like the round table conference that was held among all the parties during the period of the struggle for independence.</P>
    <P>It is important also, as Mr. Kevin Boyle and Mr. Tom Hadden point out in their article, to remember that we are talking about a complex of relationships between Britain and Ireland and not just alone the situation in Ireland.  Here again I would <Col N="1407" /> refer back to what Senator Robb said, that one might even consider the possibility of some kind of connection with the Commonwealth, which is no longer the British Commonwealth, and indeed the countries participating in it, interestingly enough, do so under a sort of external relations situation which was thought up originally by Mr. de Valera in the External Relations Act and which at that time was thought of as being very difficult for the Commonwealth to swallow but which they have now swallowed with regard to practically every country in the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>However, to summarise I will go back to where I began.  Like Senator Robb, I come from the tradition the Government are wooing.  I am not really sure from the debate if everything that I said was understood by all the Senators who contributed.  I feel very strongly that saying that everything will be alright and everybody will be looked after once we accept unity is not enough.  In this context I am sorry that Senator Eoin Ryan should have said the same thing over again, as recorded at column 1299 of the report. He said that what he was saying to our friends from the North was that there is no need for Unionists to fear a church-State link or to fear influence from the hierarchy and so on.  Again, he is saying that if they join us everything will be made alright.  But to Unionists in the North that is like saying &ldquo;put your head in the lion's mouth and after all you may find he has no teeth and will not bite your head off&rdquo;.  You must be prepared to draw the lion's teeth to some extent at least, so that if we are looking for consent and consensus rather than simply a military victory we cannot take this attitude of saying &ldquo;everything will be alright if only you join us&rdquo;.  We must be prepared to give our earnest intention by encouraging self-criticism of our own society, and change towards integration now.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the policies set out in the National Economic and Social Plan &mdash;<i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Dooge.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in order to give other people the opportunity to come in on this important debate on <i>Building on Reality.</i> I should like to refer in particular to the whole question of taxation.  There is a great deal of confusion about taxation.  The remark was made here this afternoon by one Senator that taxation was not necessary.  The Government very positively need a taxation arrangement whereby they collect money on the one hand and make the best use of it on the part of society on the other.  The Government effectively would be doing the housekeeping in that context on behalf of all the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of taxation which is relevant is that there is a gross misunderstanding as to what sector or section of society ought to be paying X, Y or Z. The figure was quoted here this afternoon also about it costing Irish farmers £40 million for the services of accountants. That figure is totally and utterly an exaggeration. The actual figure will be something like £10 or £12 million.  It is still a high figure.  Fortunately as part of this plan we will not have the need for a good deal of this expenditure, because as people will understand fulltime farmers with fewer than 80 adjusted acres will not have to keep accounts.  They will pay tax on their land on the basis of £10 per acre, which will not alter during the lifetime of the plan.  There is, however, one important group of farmers which must not be overlooked, those with an excess of 80 adjusted acres who may have borrowing problems.  They are not paying income tax now but when a land tax is introduced they will be paying tax and will not be <Col N="1409" /> able to set it against income tax.  I am very happy that there is no double taxation in the plan.  This is a very important dimension.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the yield from farmer taxation would be only £80 million. People should take account of the fact that the yield from taxation is based, and has been based, on what was there by way of disposable income.  People outside farming do not appreciate that we had three disastrous years in farming in 1979, 1980 and 1981.  Things improved in 1982 and in 1983 and the indications for 1984 are something similar.  Against this background farmers have borrowed heavily and have a meagre income, much lower than the average industrial wage.  I agree that people who have an income tax liability ought to discharge it &mdash; there are no two ways about this.  However, there is a misunderstanding between the farming sector and the non-farming sector regarding the whole tax area.  In urban-rural relations there is a need for better understanding of the other's problems and difficulties. The people in the country, including farmers, do not understand the difficulties of the PAYE sector and the PAYE sector do not understand the difficulties of the farming community.  The plan emphasises that taxation will not be increased and is to be stabilised.  PAYE workers are paying to the limit of tax.  It is encouraging to see as a very prominent point in the taxation part of the plan that there will be stabilisation of income taxation and also that income tax bands will be increased each year of the plan.</P>
    <P>There are two areas to which I referred earlier &mdash; unemployment and taxation.  I am satisfied that this plan, if given the opportunity and the co-operation of all concerned, can achieve results on these two fronts, as well as in other areas.  The plan is worthy of support and I hope that the House will give its full support to it when a vote is taken on it tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan is grey in colour and grey in matter.  I was amused at my colleague, Senator Hourigan, when he said that all was well during the period from when the Coalition Government <Col N="1410" /> took office two years ago &mdash; 1978, 1979 and 1980 were not good years in agriculture. It reminds me of the time a local person qualified as a doctor, his brother had a bicycle shop and when the people came in to get their bicycles fixed he would remark that nobody was dying. That is not the case with agriculture over the last few years.  The plan was protected and projected by the media in a very thick, clouded smokescreen in its introduction. Now the people realise that there is nothing at all in the plan to take any corrective measures in the three main areas of unemployment, crime and emigration.</P>
      <P>The emigrant ship will not stabilise unemployment.  This plan, as most people are aware, was a long awaited one.  It is a document which has disappointed me and my colleagues on this side of the House.  The plan is designed to secure a political objective, to bring the Government through a serious international crisis and to provide temporary unity within the Coalition Government. There is no job creation in it although this is the one area which our youth look for in the plan to see if there is a green light for the many thousands coming on to the unemployment register every year with third level education.  The figure of 200,000 seems to be accepted by the Government.  Some targets should be outlined for the reduction of this figure by about 40,000 jobs per year as against the number of people coming on the unemployment register in the same period.  In an atmosphere where we have a population explosion, there is no commitment or provision for additional services. Rather the plan is to cut back on the existing services instead of providing schools, health, education and the various other sectors that require additional capital expenditure to cope with the explosion of population that will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no capital investment for the IDA who have done such a wonderful job over the past two decades in promoting Ireland abroad and building advance factories. If we have the basis, the advance <Col N="1411" /> factory, and the personnel to do promotion work abroad such as we have experiences over the last decade, we will compete in luring industrialists from the States, from Japan and from other areas. We still have the incentive in some counties of a two-thirds remission of rates over a period of ten years to try to bring industrialists to our country.  The plan provides no additional capital for the IDA but curtails them by not giving them sufficient money.</P>
    <P>There is no rescue package for the small industrialists or businessman, and such people are going to the wall every day.  Businesses which have been trading for a long period are closing their doors due to the burden of taxation and other factors.  Something must be done to stabilise these traditional small businesses, each of which provides jobs for several people.</P>
    <P>The plan contains short-term proposals for setting up people in their own businesses, but I believe such businesses will be short lived.  These people are inexperienced juveniles in that field of activity, and I do not believe their enterprises will have any permanency.  I compliment the Government on trying to lure these people into self-employment, but I cannot see a future for that type of business. I would be glad if it worked because it would be a breakthrough in providing employment.  When one is desperate one reaches for anything.  The self-employed and the small employer should be protected in every way.</P>
    <P>There are no plans for education.  The capital programme for new school building is static and thousands of third level students are coming on the job market yearly, adding to our burden of unemployed. Unfortunately these young people are going abroad where there is no welcome in the employment field.  There are no job opportunities in Britain.  They are unable to go to the United States and the European Community has not yet identified itself as an area which could offer employment opportunities to our well qualified young people.  Emigration <Col N="1412" /> to foreign lands where no jobs are available is not an attractive prospect for any young boy or girl.  Anybody in public life knows families where four, five or six people are unemployed and they are desperate to get into any type of permanent employment.</P>
    <P>There must be taxation reform in order to give confidence to the PAYE worker. Such confidence is now lacking because he or she feels that the high level of PAYE is due to the farmers, the self-employed and those in receipt of social welfare.  PAYE workers feel they are being lashed by taxation in order to keep the social welfare system ticking over for their neighbours.  Each member of the community would be willing to pay a fair share of taxation if the system were reformed and made fairer.  That is not happening, and PAYE workers feel they are not getting their rights.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks are often the decision of blind academics who have no practical experience in the political field.  It is evident that cutbacks have not worked during the past two years.  Academics have a role to play, but experience must be the basis of Government decisions.</P>
    <P>There has been a cutback in the number of hospital beds.  In counties like my own if you become ill on a Friday, unfortunately you have to wait until Monday to get any hospitalisation.  That is the system.  My advice is, do not get sick on a Friday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The conveyance of patients to and from institutions is curtailed. The hospital capital building <Col N="1413" /> programme has been delayed by the failure of the Department of Health to sanction plans.  Now, they ask for an alternative plan and send the plan back to the drawing board to be resubmitted possibly in 1985 or in 1986.  Most of the things in this plan are projected for 1986 and 1987.  Who can say which party will be in office at that particular time?  We will have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>As I said, crime and unemployment are the two main problems facing the nation.  In spite of the fact that two out of every five houses in the city of Dublin will be broken into this year, there will be no additional garda recruits during the period of this plan.  I understand the Garda will be able to replace those who retire but there is no extra Garda recruitment to help curb the additional crime we are facing.  No overtime will be sanctioned, no matter how serious the situation is.  The Gardaí have to get permission to work overtime and by the time that permission is given by the hierarchy in Dublin Castle, the criminal has flown. That is the present situation.  These cutbacks are affecting the serious crime problems in this nation.</P>
      <P>May I refer to the Criminal Justice Bill?  This legislation is to curb crime and put additional people into our jails, but what we are doing is bringing some of them in the front door and letting somebody else out the rear.  There is no capital programme in this plan for expanding or building new jails.  We gave £12 million to consultants to prepare plans, but none of the jails is even in the process of being built.</P>

Unfortunately up to now it had not been financed to the extent he envisaged and we are well behind our target.  Most Senators are members of county councils and they know roads are breaking up because of a lack of investment and a lack of maintenance of existing roads which have to carry ever increasing tonnage every day.  We should have a bigger capital injection to meet this extra tonnage. There have been cutbacks in expenditure on roads over the last number of years and this year there has been a big reduction in the local improvement scheme because of the abolition of the environmental scheme.</P>

      <P>Next to crime and unemployment agriculture has a high priority.  In my view, anybody under 20 adjusted acres is not a farmer.  He is just existing on a non-viable holding.  I know many of them in the west who are barely existing and unless they have off-farm employment there is no way a family unit can exist.  For that reason they are ruled out.  The next category brings in the farmer with between 20 and 80 adjusted acres.  He is going to be penalised by the introduction of the £10 per adjusted acre. That would take in the majority of the small farmers in the country and most of them from my area.  Senator Hourigan mentioned that he was delighted there was no double taxation.  The big farmer with over 80 adjusted acres, with whom I am sure Senator Ferris is not associated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fine Gael always protected the bigger farmers.  They are again protected under this plan because the land tax can be offset in their income tax <Col N="1415" /> returns.  They will not be paying the £10 over 80 adjusted acres.  Senator Hourigan was right when he said the big land rancher who generally votes Fine Gael from now on will have to pay only one tax, he will not have to pay the £10 adjusted acre tax.  That is like turning on a tap, next year the tap will be turned a wee bit further.  It is the Government's intention to eventually drown them with taxation in the years that lie ahead.  This is only the thin edge of the wedge. Eventually they will be swimming in a taxation pond unable to meet their commitments.</P>

      <P>There is no western drainage.  A point was mentioned in the plan I was not aware of.  I understood that the western drainage package came from the EC.  Whenever it is abandoned it comes from the EC, but whenever it is to be reintroduced it comes from the Coalition Government.  It definitely is an EC western drainage package, we cannot get away from that and its reintroduction will be a decision of the EC, and not as a result of anything in this plan.  That is why I challenge that point. This is an EC decision which may come into effect in 1986 or 1987, or it may never be introduced again.  But it is in the plan.  If it is an EC decision how can the Coalition put it in the plan?  The same applies to the western package, the farm modernisation scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not so sure about that.  It is an additional £7 million on the farmers at present in addition to the £10 per adjusted acre.  We have the abolition of the Land Commission when we should be going further afield in the development of agriculture.  We do not know what they are going to do with the trained officials or what is going to happen in the future with regard to land mobility.  They are going around my area giving out tracts of bog they had in hand and giving out grazing rights on the hills throughout the country.  They are rushing to get rid of them before the Land Commission is abolished.  They do not know what will happen to them, but I take it they will come back to the Department.</P>
      <P>In 1981 or 1982 Fianna Fáil had planned to put £137 million into agriculture and this plan is going to put £73 million into agriculture in 1986.  Is that not a retrograde step with the inflation rate we have at the moment?  There is a reduction from £137 million to £73 million: that is what this plan thinks of the development of agriculture.  Taking into account the decline of money value over the period, it means that the State investment in agriculture over the period of this Government has been cut by three-fifths.  The Fianna Fáil four-year plan for agriculture has been dropped.  The farm modernisation scheme has been scrapped.  The Land Commission is to be abolished.  A totally negative attitude dominates.  It seems that agriculture is now regarded as incapable of making any worthwhile contribution to our national economic objective and the Government have now written it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are going to build a new runway at Dublin airport at a cost of £30 million.  Is there another border <Col N="1417" /> between the east and the west?  The airport in Connacht needs £3,500,000 for its completion and this Government have abandoned it.  The airport is needed to develop infrastructure in the west but the Government have rubbed salt in the wound by giving £30 million for a new runway at Dublin.  That is an insult to the people in the west of Ireland.  I know they do not vote for this Government: they did not vote in the Údarás elections where Fianna Fáil won two out of three and they did not vote in Donegal.  However, that is not the treatment that this Coalition Government should dish out to people on the other side of the Shannon. The west is awake, and that was shown recently.  It is a disgraceful situation where £30 million is put into an airstrip in Dublin airport while the Connacht regional airport is left unfinished.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the housing construction industry and the £5,000 that is going to lure people out of the happy environment where they have lived for so many years.

If there was capital investment in local authority housing it would help the building industry that is just about ticking over.

      <P>We have heard all about fiscal rectitude for the past two years.  For two years the Government have been telling us they were devoting all their energies to putting the public finances right but they have not done so. The foreign debt is over two-and-a-half times what it was three years ago.  This document stipulates that the current budget deficit will remain at its present level, namely, about 7.1 per cent of GNP not only for this year but next year as well.  On the revised GNP figures published earlier this year, the current budget deficit in 1981 was 7.7 per cent of GNP and on the basis of the decisions in the Government document, in 1985 the current budget deficit will be 7.1 per cent of GNP.  That is what fiscal rectitude is about.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to fisheries and forestry, to mariculture and the shellfish industry along the west coast.  There is nothing in the document about marketing or promoting mariculture or the shellfish industry and there is nothing in it about sea fishing.  With regard to afforestation, we had a programme of planting 25,000 acres a year.  That has been abandoned, but most of our forests that were planted in the forties and fifties are now maturing. There is no provision made in this plan for the marketing of the timber in our maturing forests.  We know what happened in Scarriff where we had a traditional chipboard factory.  Thousands of tonnes of this type of material are coming on the market.  There is no provision in this plan for marketing them or giving additional employment in that field. Neither is there anything for the shellfish industry or the mariculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the food subsidies.  The disadvantaged groups, those on lower incomes, those with large families, those living alone, spend a large portion of their total budget on bread, butter and milk. It is an insult to those people to give a reduction of 8p on whiskey and an increase of 8p on a loaf of bread.  No rich person would know what I am talking <Col N="1419" /> about when I mention a loaf of bread because it does not mean much to rich people.  Their loaves come in a different way.  They do not see them coming.  They do not go to the shop to buy them.  They are sent in at the rear.  The van drives around the back and the rich person never sees them arriving.  An increase of 8p on the loaf of bread may not mean much to a rich man but it means a great deal to the poor man or to the poor housewife who has to rush down the street in the early hours of the morning before the kids go to school to buy that additional loaf which she may not be able to pay for until she sees what is left in her husband's pocket.  In 1974 a pint cost 18p.  Ritchie Ryan, the then Minister for Finance, doubled the price of the pint from 18p to 36p.  That was the first time it caught up with and passed the price of whiskey by 3p.  Since then it has jumped to whatever people are paying for it now. I am taking one at the moment myself.</P>

    <P>This plan is a ball of smoke.  At a time when we needed good Government and leadership there was a crisis here which has been resolved but the crisis abroad remains with us.  Unemployment and crime are problems.  We have a further problem of emigration which had been stemmed by good Governments in the past.  It is now an accepted fact that <Col N="1421" /> 200,000 plus will be the accepted unemployment figure for the period of this plan.  For our youth, geared with third level education and looking to us for employment, there is no green light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>Like many others in the State I am disappointed with the plan.  Many people awaited the production of the plan in the hope that there would be something in it for them.  Alas there was nothing.  I do not think the targets &mdash; and they are very few &mdash; will be achieved during the period in office of this Government.  Most of the things that are supposed to be goodies will probably come during the reign of a successive Government which, I am sure, will come from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important feature of any economic and social plan is to bring it to full fruition.  Its implementation, therefore, becomes, as in this case, not only imperative but also a test as to how the targets were conceived and the use of statistical evidence towards attainment.  A plan on paper remains a plan on paper until full implementation. That requires monitoring.  It requires watchfulness.  Therefore the three year period proposed in the plan will be a period of watching over developments in all the specific areas named and acting accordingly in those areas where attention is required through lack of progress.</P>
      <P>I take the three year period as experimental, especially the first year.  This will be a test year, and there may be acid tests in there.  We should have fairly clear indications as to where we are going inside the first year.  On the other hand, assuming that flexibility is accepted &mdash; and I believe that it is &mdash; amendments or changes may be required as and when the necessity arises.  That is what I mean by flexibility, by watchfulness and by monitoring. This presupposes that consultation will, in the circumstances, take place with all concerned &mdash; employers' associations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and all the social partners involved in the various Government organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No proper appreciation, or indeed <Col N="1422" /> examination, of the plan is possible without taking into consideration the economic situation with which this country is now faced.  World influences, financial and otherwise, do have a far-reaching effect on economies like ours.  The idea that because the plan assumes certain developments externally for its success could be thwarted by this weakness, as these critics call it.  That may be so.  It is quite possible that external influences could weaken the plan.  But it has to be said that we, like other countries, cannot cut ourselves off from these world influences whether we like it or not. These are facts.  The plan is based on reality, and that is a reality.  We live in a specific type of world and that is part of the reality of accepting that this is how and why and where we live, unless, of course, those who talk of the inherent weaknesses &mdash; albeit, in any plan, not only in this one &mdash; out of the linkage with external influences have in mind a policy of self-sufficiency, an impossible philosophy in present world conditions.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at the USSR to see their dependence on grain imports from the USA and butter from Europe and those satellite communist countries which depend on financial borrowing from western bankers.  I say this because the philosophy of self-sufficiency is a main component of communist ideology and propaganda and on the face of it, given the self-sufficiency philosophy even in communist countries where they have complete control and can plan the economy, they cannot cut themselves off from external influences.  So much for that argument.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the plan is overcautious, not sufficiently radical to overcome our problems, unemployment, tax reduction and equity, development of natural resources and public enterprise. There are, I suggest and I insist, radical measures in the plan consisting of proper interpretation of the political philosophies of both parties to the Coalition. State enterprise gets a magnificent position to develop commercial projects with money applied, the market influence is attended to by substantial grants in aid, <Col N="1423" /> financially.  In other words you have the perfect solution out of a Coalition Government &mdash; an application to a mixed economy.</P>
    <P>Regarding unemployment it is quite wrong for this Government, or indeed any Government, to raise our people's expectations to a level where they are not attainable and thus cause avoidable disappointment and frustration.  They would be guilty of having conned our people.  All our public representatives should not stand for that kind of behaviour. Face the facts, face reality, tell the truth.  If we cannot get full employment say so, because anybody who tells the youth of today that they can get full employment is telling a lie and a big lie.  It is much better in the field of employment and unemployment to face facts, to spell out reality.  This the plan does.  It actually becomes workable because it spells out targets that are, in fact, attainable.  That is where the over-caution comes from, that is where the modesty is.  The plan does not say that we are going to the moon.  The plan simply cannot go to the moon, so we are not spelling that out in the plan.  It does not claim to bring about full employment.  It claims to bring about a measure of alleviation of the unemployment problem and it examines the unemployment problem in fair detail.  I shall use the expression &ldquo;long-term unemployed&rdquo; because it is the best indication that there is for people who are unemployed for over one year.  This is the accepted norm for long-term unemployed. It is worth noting that the <i>OECD Observer</i> in September said this:</P>
    <P>While the numbers of the long-term unemployed will fall when unemployment falls, there is a lag; moreover, since unemployment overall is expected to remain at its present level in the OECD area for the next 18 months or so, the short-term look-out for the long-term unemployed is not particularly hopeful.</P>
    <P>That is truth by people who face up to reality.  The malaise, I contend therefore, is a European one and notwithstanding <Col N="1424" /> the advances made out of the recession in the USA and Japan, Europe has failed and is currently examining why the failure, what is wrong in the European economic and social climate that Europe has failed while Japan and the USA have gone ahead.  Is it flexibility and the application of technological know-how?  Is it the acceptance on the part of workers of redundancy and structural change accompanied by humane efforts at supplying them with worthwhile work projects in their areas especially?  Europe will come up with the answers and we will benefit from the answers that Europe will produce.</P>
    <P>It is a European problem.  I can best indicate it this way.  The long-term jobless in France by the end of 1985, as a proportion of the unemployed figures, will be 45 per cent.  There is no claim in France for full employment.  President Mitterand discovered that when he took the reins of office.  The UK account for 40 per cent of the total unemployment figures, Germany 30 per cent.  Ours at the moment is 31 per cent.  This is facing reality.  It is only one indication of the depth and severity of our problem.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is the undesirability of the lack of work for the young. It has been claimed that the training facilities for youth result, in the main, in training for unemployment.  However true this is and in the present climate it is possible to admit that there is an element of truth in it, if not full truth, I favour what is sometimes called speculative training.  Speculative training is training without knowing that there will be a job at the end of the line.  Even though unemployed the young have acquired some skill and work experience also, which raises their chances of employment. I say that because, having carried my training knowledge from the USA into Northern Ireland, I am one of the founder members of the training and retraining projects in Northern Ireland as a member of the ICTU.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 the plan proposes more effective co-ordination at national and local levels at the behest of the Youth Employment Agency.  No one <Col N="1425" /> from the YEA can say that this is not a welcome feature of the plan.  I am conversant with the co-ordination they are talking about and I know how it will work. It is good, healthy and intelligent.  The estimated reduction in all these plans as put forward is 10,000 below the expected end of 1984 level.  Note that the plan, while it does not claim full employment, says that we are going forward.  We are going ahead.  It could possibly take another three or five-year plan to come to fruition, provided that Europe comes up with the answers as to why we did not make the forward progress made in the US and in Japan.  I trust &mdash; and I hope that there are many people like me even in the Opposition &mdash; that these forecasts will work out.  I welcome the measures proposed as being the only measures that could be proposed in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the question of taxation, a vexatious problem which causes us concern, we have not resolved the problem yet but I am inclined to think that we are on the way to tax stabilisation if not reduction, and eventual equity.  I welcome these measures as being consistent with fair play and justice.  The only problem in this arena seems to be one of impatience at the speed of application of measures to bring about full and acceptable equity.</P>
    <P>People who are looking for radical measures should listen to what I am going to say now.  One of the most important proposals in the plan by far is set out in paragraphs 3.61 to 3.67 where we can read a clear and positive development of the new role of State bodies in making a worth-while contribution to the nation, not a new concept but a more positive development to the role of making a contribution to the development of the nation.  More positive development is the key.  I understand and appreciate the value of State bodies, because for three or four years I was a director of the Irish Sugar Company and I watched with amazement and enthusiasm the extension of the development of the Irish Sugar Company into the whole engineering arena for export mainly.  After they had made their own machinery they exported <Col N="1426" /> to the continent.  In other words, I had that kind of experience in State enterprise. Paragraph 3.63 states:</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board has outlined a number of areas in which weaknesses must be tackled if existing State enterprises are to make, as they did before, a significant contribution to Irish economic development.</P>
    <P>Here there is not the attitude of &ldquo;let us eliminate these State enterprises because they are not fulfilling their proper role, they are not making profits and they are not commercial entities&rdquo;.  Here are corrective measures proposed, properly so. Some people call it public accountability. It is right and proper if the people who complain about the moderation and the modesty of the plan and its lack of radical measures will read paragraphs 3.68 to 3.71.  Here they would see a natural corollary to the new approach to public enterprise.  Paragraph 3.68 reads:</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will be a primary instrument in translating the Government's philosophy and approach to direct State involvement in industry into practice.</P>
    <P>Where are the people?  Have they read this plan?  Have they read that?  Have they read about how the cash will be forthcoming to assist these projects to be carried out by the NDC?  The NDC were called for for years inside the ICTU, and I presided at some of the meetings.  This is radicalism.  This is the interpretation of the application of two political philosophies to a mixed economy.  I should add that, as in paragraph 3.69: &ldquo;The Government will be ready to make funds available to the NDC for such projects as and when needed&rdquo;.  For the second time my advice to people looking for radical measures is, please to read these paragraphs.</P>
    <P>The areas referred to by Senators who have spoken are terribly important, but unless they are underpinned with a basic philosophy like the underpinning that we see &mdash; I will come to the private sector &mdash; there is little value unless you have a clear idea of where you are going and what you are at.  No doubt the NDC will <Col N="1427" /> examine the feasibility of industries based on our natural resources.  We will probably have a research department to carry out these exercises.  It is most gratifying to see these paragraphs referred to in the body of the plan.</P>
    <P>Grants are to be given to the firms who can export, provide substitutes for imported goods or supply the needs of exporters.  That is in paragraph 2.24. Access to capital for industry, especially venture capital, is contained in paragraph 2.29, and there is an endeavour to reduce industrial costs and bring down inflation rates during the three-year period.</P>
    <P>These are all intelligent measures.  Any Government would have decided on these.  It is not terribly brilliant, but this plan does not claim to be brilliant.  It claims to be practical in its application to the areas that require application of this kind of ideas.  The important aspect is that in order to finance these schemes and certain projects already referred to, cash provision for industrial grants is being increased by one-third.  That is a substantial increase in cash inducement in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with many of the other proposals in the plan but merely tried to look at the larger picture against its severe background.  To my mind the plan is workable, practicable.  All the people concerned, even those who may not like certain aspects of it, should decide that it is in the best interests of the people of Ireland that the plan has unstinted encouragement and assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read this document, I must confess that I never saw it as a plan as such.  It is not a plan for now or for the future.  It is more a set of objectives not spelling out clearly how they were to be attained.  The plan, as it is known, has really no clear targets for output, productivity or investment.  It was heralded as if it was going to end all the evils and problems of our country.  It is now being sold to the party faithful around the country.  I am always suspicious of such occurrences, that if something is not going well an effort is made <Col N="1428" /> to sell it.  Clearly it has not gone down as well as the Government had hoped.  I have noticed that there was no discussion with such interested groups as unions, farming organisations or employers.  We all remember that in mid-September there was a real fear that the Government might fall but that all changed on 2 October because this plan was introduced as a cosmetic exercise to cement the two main groups in Government.  The plan is a statement of aspirations and projections.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the most pressing problem we have is that of unemployment.  Despite what the last speaker said there is nothing worthwhile in the plan that will create what we know as permanent worthwhile jobs for our young people.  There is a reference to grants but it is not spelled out how, when or where those grants will come from.  We do not know how much is involved.  The summary refers to special action on unemployment and deals with a new scheme for social employment providing part-time jobs for 10,000 long-time unemployed people.  Later that summary refers to a new training and placement scheme for the long-term unemployed to give a chance to 2,500 per annum for a six months period each.  There will be more training but, at the end of the day, will there be jobs for the people concerned?</P>
      <P>It is my opinion that the plan pays mere lip service to this problem and is not remotely concerned with investment that may have the effect of creating jobs.  I would not be surprised if at the end of the period of the plan almost 250,000 people would be out of work rather than the country being in a better position as suggested by the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will be surprised that a plan of this nature, described by the last speaker as radical, has been welcomed by the FUE, the CII and the main farming groups.  That leads me to suggest that the plan could best be described as a bosses plan.  The Tánaiste made the point that no interest group must be allowed stand in the way of the implementation of the provisions of the plan but I should like to <Col N="1429" /> know what he had in mind.  I suggest that he may be referring to those who suffer most, those who are ill, the poor, those in receipt of social welfare benefits and the ordinary wage-earner &mdash; they are becoming fewer daily.</P>
    <P>With regard to the construction industry I should like to point out that when Fianna Fáil were in Government that industry did very well.  The Taoiseach at the Ard Fheis told his supporters that the Government were wiping the dust off the JCBs left idle by Fianna Fáil but the fact is that employment in that sector since 1981 when the first Coalition Government took power is at an all-time low.  That industry was never so depressed and there was never such a lack of confidence by the private sector.  The plan does not attempt to show how private sector activity in that industry can be revived.</P>
    <P>There are many dubious assumptions on which the plan may succeed or fail. For example, there is the assumption that there will be a fall in US interest rates and there is an assumption that there will be a fall in the value of the dollar.  It is obvious that the Government are hoping that there will not be a further recession in the US but economists in that country are saying that they expect a further recession in 1986, in the middle of the life of the plan.  What will the position be in regard to the plan if that happens? There is also an assumption in the plan that the public sector will accept the level of income increase mentioned.  I must point out that during the week the public service unions announced that they were seeking an increase of 15 per cent.  Consequently, the assumptions in the plan are dubious, to say the least and nobody is in a position to say that they will be successful.</P>
    <P>The area of health is vital to our people but the plan shows that over the next three years there will be a 5 per cent cut in real terms on the current side for Health and that the figure will be increased on the capital side.  I welcome the mention in the plan of prevention in the area of health care.  Deputy Haughey, when Minister for Health, in the late <Col N="1430" /> seventies, pursued that area with great success and I am pleased that the Minister for Health is doing likewise.  However, I was disappointed to read of the enthusiasm with which Deputy Desmond greeted the plan.  According to his first statement 3,000 jobs will be lost in the health area.  It seems to me that there is a lack of commitment to health right across the board by the Government. All health boards, irrespective of their political beliefs, have expressed grave concern about the cutbacks.  The only positive thing in the plan about health is the measles vaccination programme but that is not enough.  Each village, town and city will suffer from the effects of the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>In Athlone 14 months ago the Minister for Health announced that we were to get an orthopaedic unit in St. Vincent's Hospital there, but now the local health board has been told that to get this facility they will have to make cutbacks in other areas.  In spite of the fact that we got a firm public commitment by the Minister that there would be an orthopaedic unit in that hospital it appears that that facility will not be provided.  I hope I am wrong but I do not think so.  I was a super optimist when the Minister made the statement in the town but I am not too happy now.</P>
    <P>Members of health boards throughout the country have criticised the plan and pointed out that it will affect their services, hospital routine, ambulance services and so on.  I do not have to itemise the services that will be affected because they are well known.  I do not wish to sound dramatic but I am convinced that as a result of the cutbacks during the period of the plan people will die.</P>
    <P>The area of social welfare is vague in the plan.  What we have all now clearly noticed is that there is to be a tax on child benefits and on short term welfare benefits.  What kind of concern is this on the part of the Labour component of this Government for the poor and underprivileged?</P>
    <P>The part of the plan which has surprised and annoyed many people is that relating to the extension of the drinking <Col N="1431" /> hours which has been deplored, left, right and centre by the Press, churchmen and politicians generally.  An extra hour's drinking on a Sunday evening would be sufficient, but the extensions envisaged in this plan have clearly gone out of hand. Last week we had the An Foras Forbartha report dealing with car accidents in which they expressed proper concern that these new moves will not improve the figures they reported in this area last week.  I might repeat that, in dealing with this important matter, there was no consultation with publicans or the unions representing their staff.  Nor do I think for one moment it will do anything to improve the tourist trade.  I regard it as a retrograde step.  Even the most hardened boozer would say &mdash; and I have met many of them &mdash; we have sufficient hours of drinking; we do not need any more.</P>
    <P>There has been notice of a reduction in the price of whiskey while at the same time an increase announced in the ordinary basic food prices for the poor and under-privileged.  Any Government that allows food prices to increase while the price of whiskey is to be reduced I would suggest have not their priorities in order. Obviously the whole attitude to drinking would be influenced by education, parents and example generally.  But, in my opinion, the single, greatest influence would be concern shown on the part of the Government and Government leaders which, regrettably, appears to be absent.</P>
    <P>The question of farm tax in this plan is coupled with the financing of local authorities.  Many people are not sure what will happen <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Land Commission. We have been told it is to be abolished.  Yet, in this plan, we are told they have an important role to play. Reading the plan we are aware that the granting of relief on agricultural land will be reduced by the amount of farm taxation collected.  The plan further makes the point that legislation in regard to farm tax will provide for a right of appeal against the adjusted acreage determined and for a system of review.  Having mentioned the Land Commission and this <Col N="1432" /> right of appeal, we are aware that it took Griffith from 1852 to 1865 to create what became effectively the poor law system in this country.  In the counties of Longford and Westmeath the Land Commission still possess something like 7,000 acres with which to deal.  If there is the right of appeal available to everybody, naturally everybody will accept that right.  This means it could take five to ten years before this scheme that we hoped and thought would be ready for implementation in 1986 is initiated.  In that regard there is no specific detail as to what will be the amount of the tax involved, that it would be, perhaps, £15 in two years' time or, perhaps, £20 in four years' time. Who decides this?  For example, will it be an executive function of the county manager in the same way as it was with regard to service charges?  As the House will be aware, members of local authorities might decide on a rate of, for example, £50 for a service charge but, if the relevant manager says he wants £75, he will get it because it is his executive function. One must ask: will the same apply in this case?  At the end of the day will it be the manager who will say: I am not taking £10, I want £15 this year and £20 the year thereafter?  This has not been spelled out.  It is something that must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the roads programme for local authorities, which appears to me to be an extension of the Fianna Fáil plan for roads for the eighties.  Whenever the farm tax comes on stream, any other support grants from the Government will be eliminated.  Last year it was miserly in real terms, constituting something like 0.8 per cent.  There have been no discussions with regard to this matter with any local authority bodies, with, say, the municipal authorities or the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>This plan will cause many people many problems, in particular our poor and under-privileged in a very real, positive way.  The poor will be severely hit from almost every angle.  There will be imposed on them increases in taxes and rents. Rents of local authority housing have <Col N="1433" /> been another feature of this plan which illustrates the lack of concern on the part of this Government for the poor. Obviously I would welcome the £5,000 grant to a tenant of a local authority house on vacating that house to buy or build another.  But the elimination of repairs of local authority houses is to be deplored.  The plan accepts that many tenants of local authority houses are either unemployed or in receipt of social welfare.  Yet it is contended that the rents must be raised progressively to a level more commensurate with the actual cost of local authority housing, again constituting a tax imposed on the poor, social welfare recipient or under-privileged.  It is obvious to me that the Government want to ease the demand on them of capital amounts to local authorities, that they want to totally eliminate the building of local authority houses.  That would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The plan is riddled with new taxes, rents, higher rents, the reduction of local authority house maintenance, more charges for services, food subsidies being abolished, hospital services cutbacks and so on, not a plan to be welcomed by the poor or under-privileged who I believe will suffer very severely from its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the opening words of Senator Fallon when he spoke of this as not being a plan ahead but rather a set of objectives relating to the years 1985 to 1987.  If the Senator looked at Tables 7-1 and 7-2, the one dealing with current supply services expenditure by Ministerial Group and the other, the Public Capital Programme 1984 to 1987 he will have seen nothing but a revelation in terms of planning for the future.  Never before in the history of documents or plans produced by Government have we been given figures analysed on a Department-by-Department basis, giving projections of spending by those Departments and groups over the lifespan of the plan 1985-1987.  That is a very great step forward in relation to the next three years.  It takes, to some extent, the kind of excitement that goes on annually in <Col N="1434" /> relation to the preparation of the budget and to the statement by the Minister for Finance in relation to the budget out of conjecture.  It gives to the people a much clearer picture of what is ahead, and that is to be welcomed in these difficult times.</P>
      <P>I am fairly confident that this plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, is a serious and well researched document.  I need not recall to every Member of this House, though it may be necessary to remind some, that the Government approached this plan by first of all appointing the National Planning Board and receiving their report and analysing in detail the recommendations of the National Planning Board.  It published an industrial policy earlier this year in relation to the activities of the IDA, SFADCo, CTT and other agencies that are involved.  It sought to produce the programme for action in education which spelt out the picture as far as the Minister and the Department of Education are concerned.</P>
      <P>What this plan has done is to give confidence to people that not alone has it been published but in its publication we have a plan which has been analysed and researched properly.  It is on the table and is a production that should stand the test of time.  In the atmosphere in which this Government had to handle the plan, an atmosphere in which the unemployment position has disimproved by 40,000 since 1980, in a period when the serious balance of payments deficit still is with us, it is heartening that the Government, and the EEC as announced last night, predict a growth of about 2½ per cent in each of the next three years.  This has been exceeded this year but in the next three years if we can confidently expect growth of that order it is something that will give a fair number of people a stimulus in the future and a fair degree of optimism not alone towards the economy in general but towards employment in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of matters I would like to refer to in particular.  The first is the measure which the Government got under way in the last year, the Employment Incentive Scheme, which already in 1984 has brought 3,500 people off the <Col N="1435" /> unemployment register and into the private industrial sector in new worth-while projects.  The plan predicts that in the period of the plan some 30,000 will be employed in this area bringing to life a whole range of service industry jobs.  This has been the kind of development we have seen elsewhere.  Senator McGonagle spoke earlier of the OECD Report of September last which highlighted this kind of development occurring all over the world, certainly in the United States and Japan.  Here we have 3,500 immediately taking up the incentive offered by the Government in this area which is likely to produce 30,000 jobs over the next three years.</P>
    <P>All of us here are public representatives, most of us are members of local authorities and we know the position in regard to long term unemployment.  We know the effects on people, skilled people, people who have worked hard, not the others in society who have been attempting to cream off as much as they can but the people who have been industrious and hard working over the years, who have to face the unemployment problem and not be able to return to work.  The Taoiseach said in his opening address on the plan that it is a conservative estimate of the numbers he would hope to see involved in environmental works in different parts of Ireland, in the towns and cities.  In Dublin city it is very good news to hear that the 10,000 now without work, some of them would be available to do the kind of work that has been done recently by another scheme which is of a similar kind.  But to face seriously the issue of the long term unemployed, to give them part time jobs, to give the resources to the local authorities to get these people to work, are things we very much welcome.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators placed emphasis on the road construction programme. The fact that the increase in the plan is a 52 per cent improvement in grant aid in this area, the actual figure being £53 million with a 10 per cent increase in activity, is worth stressing, given Senator O'Toole's remarks earlier that the local <Col N="1436" /> authorities employ 4,600, mainly men in road construction.  They are to be augmented by a varying figure of the order of 5,000 in the years ahead in relation to this programme.  It is good to see that we are taking seriously the need to provide for road construction of the future to deal with by-passing towns, to ease congestion in city areas and the ever-increasing need to provide a good safe road system.</P>
    <P>While on roads, I will enter a caution relating to public transport.  All Governments over the last ten years have not faced up to the need to deal with the great problems of CIE, but this Government have done so.  I am heartened by the decision.  I was one of the members of Dublin City Council along with the present Minister for Labour who originally tabled a resolution about six or seven years ago in relation to the need to establish a Dublin Transport Authority. That now is being established.</P>
    <P>On page 63 of the plan we talk about the new Dublin Transport Authority and the need for legislation, which will be before the Oireachtas shortly, which will have a key role in the planning and operation of Dublin transport resources.  It will be responsible for traffic management in the Dublin area and become part of the reformed local government structure when proposals for reform are being implemented.  It is not sufficiently realised by those Members of this House and indeed the other House who are not in touch daily with the difficulties in Dublin city the degree of bungling and difficulty that every one of us in public life in Dublin faces in relation to transport.  We have, for example, in Dublin Corporation some three departments handling the transport area &mdash; the building of roads, the management of traffic and the planning of the city generally.  We have three Departments of State involved.  We have the Garda Síochána, we have Córas Iompair Éireann, we have so many organisations which need to be brought together with some element of cohesion by the people in the public area who are using the transport system, using our roads, being concerned about local safety measures and who should be allowed in <Col N="1437" /> in a representative fashion to argue the toss in relation to one proposal or another, or at least to have their public representatives there in a co-ordinated way.  It is very good news that we have now got to the stage of legislation on this.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the plan to provide a separate company for the provincial bus service.  My only area of doubt about reform measures in relation to CIE is on page 62, dealing with rail, which states that a package of measures would be implemented on the passenger rail side and that will not affect the existing carriage replacement programme.  It will mean that there will be no substantial investment in railways and that there will be strict cash limits on other expenditure. My concern here would be that although I am very glad the Government have faced up to a priority in relation to either roads or railways, the emphasis obviously is to be on roads in the future.  In this plan I hope we will have the understanding of the Government, and that the company to be set up to manage the rail system will have the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and this House in particular, in relation to ensuring that the rail system is kept in good order and that we do not allow the sort of thing which happened to our rail system back in the fifties to be incorporated into this retrenchment programme.  I hope we will sustain our rail links as they exist and that we will, to the extent that it is possible, ensure that moneys are provided to support the rail programme albeit on the basis of keeping them alive rather than developing them on the lines of the DART system in Dublin city.  When the economy is more buoyant I hope the rail system will not have been impeded in any serious way by the plans which are well constructed and understood as of now.</P>
    <P>Another area which will be heralded as a major step forward is the commitment in the plan to move the resources and emphasis in relation to industry towards marketing and new technology areas.  In this regard it is tremendous to see the allocation of money going to Córas Tráchtála in the next few years. The importance of exports is paramount <Col N="1438" /> to the country's future.  There is need to give the export performance of CTT a much greater hold in the public mind and to have it understood that in better marketing and design and in a better feedback from our export market lies the best future for the country.  In doing this the Government are going along the right lines.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister who will be responding to this debate to deal with the fact that of the total of Irish exports 46 per cent are bought in the United Kingdom, 29 per cent by the Dutch and only 11 per cent by West Germans.  I should like Córas Tráchtála to develop marketing centres in Europe.  I hope their plans will include availability of personnel for the smaller company in Europe, related to some form of percentage deal for the sales they are able to undertake successfully on behalf of companies whose products are very much to the forefront. Presumably those products will result in a feedback through CTT to the producer and be very useful towards the development of that product, its design, presentation and so on.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing, there are a number of areas in the plan which are very worthwhile and encouraging.  One that is worth emphasising is the £5,000 grant for tenants of local authority houses who buy a private dwelling.  In many urban areas &mdash; this certainly applies to Dublin &mdash; there are areas which are exclusively local authority areas and other areas which are exclusively private. This grant will encourage people who are tenants or tenant purchasers to move out of what are traditional local authority areas and move into a private area.  This will allow not just for mobility in housing but for a much greater mix of housing. Already this scheme is showing great promise. There is a lot of interest in it and I hope that it will have the effect which is intended.  It is not intended to move away from building local authority houses.  The programme provides for building 6,000 of these per year and hopes that as a result of the £5,000 grant, 3,000 houses <Col N="1439" /> from existing stock will be available for reletting.</P>
    <P>On page 114 of the plan the question of the management and letting of local authority housing is dealt with.  The plan suggests that the local authority statutory provisions be reviewed to ensure that the needs of particular categories of persons, such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled, the travellers and single parent families, will get due priority in the formulation of building programmes and the allocation of tenancies.  One category that seems to get very little attention in the drawing up of plans by local authorities, and it is one which has got a lot of attention recently in Dublin, is the small non-expanding family.  In the plans of local authorities and of the National Building Agency this particular category is often overlooked.  Predominantly housing seems to be built for families who will occupy three and four-bedroomed houses.  I examined statistics from last year in relation to the building programme of Dublin Corporation, which is the largest local authority in the country and builds 1,500 houses.  Some 72 of those were built for the families of the size which I have been describing. Very few houses, cottages or facilities of any kind are built for the small family which consists of one child, very often an adult child.  I am emphasising this point outside of the area of building maisonettes for the elderly, which is a separate programme altogether.</P>
    <P>There is also in the area of housing an item dealing with the refurbishing of houses for private renting.  This programme, dealing with houses in multiple occupation, is a farseeing one. Throughout our towns and cities &mdash; and it is not just because of the existence until recently of the Rent Restrictions Act &mdash; over shops and buildings which are very well situated and soundly constructed, there are large areas of space, unoccupied and unused, which could be used to very good effect.  It is good to see the extension of the type of incentive under section 23 of the Finance Bill, dealing with the building of purpose built flats, <Col N="1440" /> to include the refurbishing of buildings in multiple occupation.  This is to ensure that these buildings, which are often situated in central points in towns and in areas which are architecturally important and have a great deal of life ahead of them, can be used to rehouse people.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of areas in the plan which are pertinent to the future. The plan is well constructed, analysed and researched.  It is a plan that will give a great deal of heart to people.  Many people said it could have been produced months earlier but it was delayed because of the degree of attention and long hours the Cabinet gave to it.  This will bear fruit in the end when the Government face their turn at the polls in some three years hence.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be afforded the opportunity to comment on this plan. At the outset, let me state in all sincerity that when this Government announced they were preparing a national plan which they said would be geared specifically towards certain aims and objectives we were hopeful that at least they had finally come to their senses and had given recognition to the fact that this nation of ours was at a crisis point, that something needed to be done and done very urgently.  We had hoped that the warnings and the pleas of the various trade unions, of the Confederation of Irish Industry, of the National Vintners Association, of the Hoteliers Federation of Ireland, of the IFA, of the ICMSA and of all the other national bodies who had been endeavouring in the past two years, and especially in the past 12 months, to alert this Government, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in particular, to the real problem that exists had been taken note of.  We all looked forward at least with some enthusiasm to some type of positive action that could or would be taken.  If it was positive and constructive this action should and could be taken with the cooperation of all the organisations and indeed with the labour force, both employed and unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> We all recognised that any action taken would of necessity have to be immediate and with clear definition.  The plan before us fails completely in every respect to justify or fulfil any of our hopes, vague as they may have been among some of us.  Those of us who have memories of the performances of Coalition Governments in the past will realise that this plan reflects in every true sense the general background within the Coalition Government.  It was against this background that this plan was devised, compiled and concocted, a background of confusion and distrust, not alone among Fine Gael and Labour, but also among the people who supported these parties and who put their trust in them in the last General Election.  The plan was introduced with a fanfare of trumpets.  The entire exercise now seems to have achieved what I would consider its main objective, that is, in some way to bring a slowing down to the rift within the parties in Government and in some way to try to placate the backbenchers, especially within the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Taoiseach was quite right when he stated that the plan was prepared under most unfavourable conditions.  The country in general is fully aware of that.  Having read the plan, having listened to some of the debate on it and again reflecting on the state of the economy, the unemployment problems and the social problems, I am amazed that people who are supposed to be in full touch with reality can endorse such a document.</P>
    <P>Reality is one of the first words mentioned in the plan.  However, I can think of many aspects of the plan that will result in great hardship.  With regard to trade, industry and unemployment the plan is presumptuous in the extreme.  At the same time it is sending out clear signals to other areas, signals which should be the cause of great concern to many.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have so much in common with the small farmer have been concerned with the problems he has had of income tax demands, the aftermath of the removal of rates and to many the announcement of the imposition of a land <Col N="1442" /> tax that seems to many to be very minimal and easy to administer.  This proposal is welcomed by many people but when they look in depth into this plan they will ask who is to pay this tax.  Who is going to pay the extra 100 per cent that is to be generated from this tax?  It will be this very small farmer that we are all so concerned about but what is to happen to the money after it has been collected? This is a matter of concern to those of us who are members of local authorities. Nobody here can give me the answer but if this plan is implemented I am convinced that time will prove me right in what I believe will be the procedure.  When the local authorities collect this money the rates support grant will be dropped not just in accordance with the amounts collected but to a even lower level.  Local authorities will be told by the Minister to reimburse themselves by way of increases in local authority charges, whether for land tax, refuse collection or water rates or by way of other measures yet to be designed or decided on.</P>
    <P>That is the future facing the local authorities.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, can surely be accused of passing the buck to the local authorities.  I regret that the Taoiseach is not here as I would like to put to him that he and the Minister for Finance are ordering the local authorities to become self-financing, irrespective of the hardships that will be created by the withdrawal of the rates support grants which have been fully augmented by increases in the VAT rates over the past number of years, especially in the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>We were promised local government reform.  Is this what the Government sees as local government reform that was promised? Were the local elections postposned in 1984 so as to have the rates support grant pushed down to a minimum and the local authorities' charges pushed to a maximum?  If that is the case I certainly hope that this Government will get their answer if and when the local elections are held in 1985, if they are held at all.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> is a national plan but there is not a mention of cross-Border <Col N="1443" /> co-operation or development.  What has this plan to offer in the way of cross-Border developments?  If the Government were serious in producing a national plan which is supposed to look at least three years ahead, they must at least give some thought to the whole of Ireland. It is apparent that the Government are resigned to the fact that the north eastern part of the country is no longer worthy of consideration.  It cannot be termed a national plan.  It poses the question of all the hopes and aspirations of the allIreland forum which have been abandoned at this stage.  Some thought should have been given to the enormous cost of Border maintenance where both forces are costing the British and Irish Governments hundreds of millions of pounds annually to maintain an artificial boundary thrust upon us against the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Ireland.  I read in the paper recently that we prefer to spend hundreds of millions of pounds preparing plans to build new jails when we should be facing up to the reality as to why these jails are necessary in the first place.</P>
    <P>The local problems besetting this country are a cause of grave concern to many people.  There has been a 4 per cent cut in the health service over the past two years, which has stretched the health service to the limit.  I see that there is to be a further 4 per cent cut.  The Government must look into the health service and see where these cuts are taking place because there are areas which cannot bear the strain any longer.  There is a development <Col N="1444" /> and expansion programme with regard to the building of new hospitals and providing new facilities, but even in these areas there are cuts and have been for the past two years.  They have caused serious problems in many areas and have divided constituencies in two.  At the end of the day we must ask if we will get a better service than was there previously.  I doubt it.  The health services is an area where we must have goodwill, good working relationships, good staff and facilities.  I am very concerned with the halting of progress in regard to providing services for the mentally handicapped.  I come from an area where we have no facilities for adult mentally handicapped people. We have space, we have the goodwill but we have not got the staff because, in the interests of economy staff cannot be provided to look after these people.  If the Government are concerned about the welfare of the nation they should look into this area and realise that there is a need to provide services in the areas where we have a moral responsibility to cater for the less well off sections of the community.  We should use our conscience, make exceptions to the rule and provide staffing levels to provide a service. I have been harping on this for a few years now.</P>
