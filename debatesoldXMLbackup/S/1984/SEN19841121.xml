      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The continuing failure of the Department of Health <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the homeless to issue its report.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mark Killilea of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to finalise the contracts for the building of a new technical school for Tuam, in view of the deplorable conditions of the present school and prefab additions which leak from rain and are a serious health hazard to the pupils and staff attending.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Séamus de Brún of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to proceed with the building of the new vocational school already sanctioned for Castlerea, County Roscommon, to replace the existing school which is totally inadequate and seriously impeding the educational progress of the students in attendance there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> I regard all three matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Killilea's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator de Brún may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 3 and 7 in that order.  It is proposed that No. 3 would be taken at 3.30 p.m.  We would then revert to Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  It is also proposed that we take No. 7 between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. as there is one hour remaining for the Private Members' motion in the names of Labour Party Senators.  There is a request also from the Government that we should try to facilitate the passing of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency), Bill, 1984, which is currently before the Dáil.  They ask for agreement from the House that if it reaches us in time that we would try to facilitate its passing here today.  If that happens we would take it after No. 3 has been completed. It is also envisaged that No. 14, the Housing (Homeless Persons), Bill, 1983, which has been on the clár for some time, will be ordered next week.</P>

      <P>We are taking Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6 and 3.  We are taking No. 3 at 3.30 p.m.  I am not too sure how we could be expected to get to No. 3 at 3.30 p.m. if we are going to take No. 4.  Surely if we start No. 4 we will continue through it. What exactly are we going to do?  If we take No. 1, which is a First Stage, I presume that will not take very long and we will then go on to No. 4.  Are we going to interrupt No. 4 and go on to No. 5? What is the intention regarding No. 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together as they are all interlinked. It is not envisaged that they would be completed.  We are interrupting them to take No. 3 at the specific time of 3.30 p.m. because I have a Minister available <Col N="141" /> to take that item then.  As soon as we have completed it we will revert to Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  It may not be possible to finish them today, but if not, they will be completed next week.  Item No. 7 must be taken at 7 o'clock, which is the time allocated for its completion.  The debate on the EC Developments will have to be interrupted in order that item No. 3 may be taken.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House mentioned that Government business may come in.  If the Bill goes through the other House today will we sit late tonight to finish the Bill?  What is the intention regarding that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are totally dependent on the other House and when the Bill is completed and put before us, we will have an opportunity to take it.  If it does not arrive in time, we will not sit to take it tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that it will reach us and I am suggesting that if it comes to us in time, we will take it after item No. 3.  It would get preference over items Nos. 4, 5 and 6 which are not that urgent and which can be postponed until next week.  If the Bill comes from the other House today, it is hoped that the House will agree to take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has now been decided to give preference to item No. 7.  May I <Col N="142" /> ask the Acting Leader of the House when does he intend to take a most important item on the Order Paper &mdash; No. 13?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hillery made a very good point.  If the Bill comes from the Dáil today, the Labour Party should give way with regard to their motion because the legislation coming from the Dáil is very urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the comments of Senators from the other side of the House.  I have to set down an orderly timetable for legislation.  As there is one hour remaining for item No. 7, I suggest that we would take it between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.  Naturally, if legislation comes from the other House, it will take preference over any other business.  Because I am unaware of when it might come to us, it is appropriate that we would set down the Order of Business as I have outlined it.  I hope to get the agreement of the House that if and when the Bill on the protection of employees comes before us we will take it because of its urgency. This may set back the other business on the clár as agreed.  I apologise to Members on the other side of the House for the short notice but I am sure they appreciate the urgency of this legislation arising out of a directive from the Community. Although it has retrospective clauses enshrined in it, because of recent events it is proper that the legislation would be completed as soon as possible to protect the rights of employees who find themselves in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we are not going to break for tea.  If the legislation does come in, is it intended that we sit late tonight to conclude that business or will we sit tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a hypothetical situation and I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.  From discussions with the Whips and various Members it is preferred that we would sit late to complete our work rather than sit tomorrow because the times cannot be determined.  It is a matter for the House at a later stage to <Col N="143" /> recap on how we are doing.  It is hoped that when the Bill comes we will take it and finish it, even if it means sitting late tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>1984 is the year the European Community came to grips with the acute problems with which it had been beset for some time and took decisions which allowed it to move forward again.  The second half of the year is, of course, the period of Ireland's third term of office in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. All our efforts are being devoted to resolving the complex range of problems with which we were faced at the beginning of the Presidency.</P>
      <P>I will be reporting to the European Parliament on 12 December on the Presidency and I would welcome the opportunity at a later date in this debate of reporting to this House on the experiences of our term of office.  For this reason I will not go too deeply into the experience of our Presidency but will look at the major issues which have concerned the Community in 1984 as a whole.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the period under review covered a critical stage in the development of the Community institutions. The European Council, at Stuttgart in June 1983, recognised that a major negotiation should take place to tackle the most pressing problems facing the Community so as to provide a solid basis for its further development over the remainder of the decade.  This examination of Community policies was considered to be necessary so as to improve their effectiveness, and to determine the priority areas for new Community action. Central to this exercise were the questions of the future financing of the Community, the review of the Common Agricultural Policy, the reform of the structural funds, the development of new policies, enlargement and questions of budgetary imbalances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some progress was made at the Athens European Council in December 1983 there is no agreement on the overall package.  I should stress that the various elements involved in the negotiations were closely interlinked; member states <Col N="145" /> were reluctant to agree on solutions to some of the issues in the absence of a clear idea as to the shape of the final compromises on other items of direct interest to them.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year, therefore, the Community appeared to face a gloomy future; insufficient revenue was available even for 1984 to fund the Community's ongoing policies; no agreement was in sight on future financing &mdash; thus inhibiting the development of urgently needed new common policies; Community farmers &mdash; Irish farmers certainly &mdash; felt unsure and threatened by the possibility of severe controls in the dairy sector; the problems in the enlargement negotiations seemed daunting; the difficulties associated with the British and German contributions to the Community budget remained unresolved.</P>
    <P>The priority of the European Councils held under the French Presidency was to reach agreement on the range of issues identified at Stuttgart as being central to the reorganisation and development of the Community.  I need not remind Senators that the run-up to the Brussels Summit involved for Ireland a major campaign to ensure that our dairying sector would not suffer as a result of the Commission's proposals for a super-levy on Community milk production.  I will return to this aspect in a moment.</P>
    <P>At the Brussels Summit, agreement was reached on most of the items under discussion.  However, it was not possible to agree on two important issues: the control of milk production by a super-levy; and the British and German contributions to the Community budget.  Of course, the question which was of greatest interest to Ireland was that of the proposed super-levy on milk.  We should perhaps recall at this stage the background to the discussions at Brussels on the super-levy.</P>
    <P>For Ireland the Commission's super-levy proposal would have meant a cut in milk production of almost 14 per cent on our 1983 level.  This was clearly unacceptable in itself.  Moreover, if adopted, it would have ruled out future expansion in the dairy sector.  Following an unprecedented <Col N="146" /> campaign by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, myself and other Ministers, our partners accepted that we had a special case and responded accordingly.  We have discussed the substance of this response on a number of previous occasions.  I will confine myself, therefore, to saying that given the background of the Community's serious financial difficulties, the surplus situation in the milk market, and the considerable production cutbacks which other member states had to accept, the final arrangements achieved for the Irish dairying industry were remarkably favourable.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I welcome the report on the super-levy which the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation prepared and which sets out clearly and comprehensively the vital national interest involved for Ireland in this issue.</P>
    <P>In the overall agricultural context, the average price increase arising from the annual package agreed in March was approximately 2.5 per cent in Irish pounds when both the support price changes and the green rate adjustments were taken into account.  The overall gain to the agricultural sector was of the order of £250 million including the very substantial savings from not having to apply the super-levy on the same basis as most other member states.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on developments in the agricultural sector in the first half of 1984, I should add that, under the FEOGA guarantee section, Ireland received some £314.4 million from the fund, after allowing for charges collected and paid into the fund.  In addition, some £5.8 million was received, or allocated under the FEOGA guidance section.</P>
    <P>The agreements reached by the Agricultural Council at the end of March on the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy gave a new impetus to the efforts which were being made to complete the review of Community policies which had been requested by the European Council at Stuttgart in June 1983. A new mood of confidence, and of willingness <Col N="147" /> to compromise, was discernible in the run-up to the European Council at Fontainebleau in June.  This was reflected at Fontainebleau by the fact that agreement was reached on the issues which had remained outstanding from the Stuttgart package.  I might recall these briefly.  A solution was found to, perhaps, the most intractable problem, that of the British and German contributions to the Community budget.  As Senators are aware, this problem has been a major distraction for the Community.  It has affected the development and indeed the vitality of the Community in recent years.  While temporary solutions have, in the past, been arranged for this problem, it continued to resurface and overshadow the other issues facing the Community. Under the agreed arrangement the UK is to be paid a lump sum of 1,000 million ECUs for 1984; and, for 1985 and some years thereafter &mdash; so long as the Community's VAT limit is maintained at 1.4 per cent the UK will be paid 66 per cent of the gap between its share of VAT payments and its share of Community expenditure.  This arrangement does not strike at fundamental Community principles but represents a pragmatic arrangement to resolve a long-standing Community problem.</P>
    <P>The European Council agreed that the VAT contributions by member states to the Community budget should be raised from 1.0 per cent to 1.4 per cent by 1 January 1986 at the latest.  Moreover it was agreed that this rate may be further increased to 1.6 per cent on January 1988, by unanimous decision of the Council and after agreement has been given in accordance with national procedures. One should not under-estimate the importance of this agreement; it will enable the Community to fund its ongoing policies, meet the costs of enlargement and develop the new common policies which are urgently required to tackle the pressing social and economic problems which now confront the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the Community to <Col N="148" /> include Spain and Portugal is, as anticipated, one of the dominant issues of the year and of our Presidency.  Our objective has been, and remains, to complete these negotiations by the end of the year, thus allowing adequate time for parliamentary ratifications to take place so as to enable Spain and Portugal to join the Community on 1 January 1986.</P>
    <P>Portugal and Spain applied for membership of the Community in March and July 1977, respectively.  However, the progress of the negotiations over the next seven years was extremely slow, with the result that the Irish Presidency was faced in July with a situation where the most difficult and sensitive issues in the negotiations were still outstanding.  Inevitably, of course, in any negotiations, the most difficult issues arise towards the end.  The major issues outstanding at the start of our Presidency were agriculture, wine, olive oil, fisheries, industrial tariff dismantling and social affairs.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the European Council in March and June, to which I have referred earlier, had set 30 September as the target date for the completion of the negotiations.  However, even when this target date of 30 September was being set, it was appreciated that it would be next to impossible to achieve.  At the same time, the existence of this target date helped exert pressure on all concerned to advance the work as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I could, for a moment, put the enlargement negotiations in a broader context.  This deadline of 1 January 1986 for accession &mdash; and this is the deadline that really matters &mdash; is of vital importance for the Community in that two members states, the Federal Republic of Germany and, to a lesser degree, the Netherlands, have directly linked their agreement on increasing the Community's own resources as from 1 January 1986 to the enlargement of the Community, as from that date also.  The basic political and economic reality is, therefore, that the availability of increased own resources to the Community is directly linked <Col N="149" /> to enlargement.  Hence, the vital importance of this issue for the future development of the Community and its range of existing and planned new policies.</P>
    <P>As to the negotiations themselves there are, in reality, two sets of negotiations &mdash; that between the existing member states to agree on common positions to present to Spain and Portugal, and that between the Community collectively and each of the applicant states. The basic strategy of the Irish Presidency has been, as an immediate priority, to try to secure internal Community positions on all the major negotiating issues.  Until this is done and until the applicant states see what is on the table in all vital areas, it can hardly be expected that the final stage of real negotiations can be activated.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of this strategy, the Presidency has been trying to accelerate the negotiations by isolating and extracting the central political issues from each chapter and presenting these in short texts suitable for political consideration and decision.  Moreover, the Presidency recently decided to put forward a number of these central political issues in the form of a composite framework package, or mini-package, as it has become known. The thinking behind this approach was that the obvious spread of compromise and sacrifice involved, and visible, in a package would allow member states to make concessions more easily on issues of individual sensitivity for them.  An outcome of this approach was that, at the Council on 22 and 23 October, Community negotiating positions on four key chapters, olive oil, imports of sugar into Portugal, social affairs and the rate of dismantlement of Spanish high tariffs, were agreed on.</P>
    <P>An important consequence of the acceptance of this package is that the range of issues on which the Community has to reach internal agreement has now been significantly narrowed.  This will, in turn, allow for a greater concentration, and greater pressure to be exerted, on what are now the major outstanding problems, that is wine, fisheries and the arrangements to apply to the export of <Col N="150" /> Spanish fruit and vegetables to the Community and the import of Northern products into Spain.  I should add that it has already proved possible, as a result of the progress achieved during the past months, to sign a joint statement with Portugal, declaring that, as there had been agreement on a large number of chapters in the negotiations, it was possible for both the Community and Portugal to &ldquo;acknowledge the irreversibility of the process of Portuguese integration into the European Communities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Presidency has, in addition, called a considerable number of additional meetings and Councils, the most recent extra Council being, in fact, held yesterday. We have also held a series of intensive bilateral meetings, including a weeklong tour of all Community capitals undertaken at my request by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>Finally, in an attempt to clarify fully Portuguese and Spanish positions, the Presidency, with the Commission, conducted a series of discussions with the applicant states over three days in Brussels last week.  Our hope is that all these preparations will enable us to make a substantial advance in the negotiations at a three-day Council and meetings with the applicant states next week from 26-28 November.  But I do not by any means under estimate the difficulties &mdash; the very real difficulties &mdash; that still lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Wine and fisheries are turning out to be the most difficult and sensitive issues in the negotiations.  In this regard, I have already stated on a number of occasions that this Government will, as in the past, continue to defend and advance the best interests of Irish fishermen and the Irish fishing industry.  This is, and will remain, the national priority in the negotiations for us.  In this regard, the comprehensive report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation is timely and I welcome its publication.  I would also like to congratulate the chairman and members of the committee on the considerable amount of time and work which they put into this report.</P>
    <P>The remaining difficulties notwithstanding, <Col N="151" /> I still remain confident that we can still conclude the negotiations by the end of the year.  Already the status of the negotiations has been qualitatively transformed since July and as a result it is now possible, for the first time, to begin to think &mdash; albeit tentatively &mdash; in terms of the final framework agreement which might form the basis of the accession Treaty.  With maximum political goodwill and co-operation from all our partners, we can bring the final decisive stage of the negotiations, on which we have now entered, to an early and successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>A central area of Government concern, and of our foreign policy in the period under review, was the Community's relations with the developing world. There was considerable development of the Community's relations with Central America during 1984.  In January a delegation of the European Parliament visited a number of Central American countries while in June President Monge of Costa Rica was in a number of European capitals.  During his European visit President Monge met the Taoiseach in London.  The Taoiseach expressed his concern about the situation in Central America and informed President Monge that Ireland wished to assist both in a national capacity and as the forthcoming President of the Ten.  Since then, of course, these contacts have come to fruition in the form of the historic ministerial meeting which took place in San Jose, Costa Rica, in late September.  The San Jose meeting principally involved the Foreign Ministers of the Community and six Central American states, namely Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama but Spain and Portugal, on the European side, and the Contador countries, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela also participated.  I had the honour of chairing the meeting on the Community side.  The accession, I am happy to report, is generally considered to have been a considerable success.  Among other things, on the economic side, the Ministers agreed to enter into exploratory talks with a view <Col N="152" /> to drawing up a co-operation agreement between the two regions.  It is my hope that increased co-operation between our two regions will help to foster stability and peace in Central America in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Important developments also took place in our relations with the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific &mdash; or ACP &mdash; countries with whom we are contractually linked under the Lomé Convention. Negotiations for a third Lomé Convention from 1985 onwards got under way in earnest.  Three major ministerial negotiating conferences took place so that, by the end of June, the text of the new convention was clearly beginning to take shape.  Further progress had been made since then during the Irish Presidency and, I am optimistic that at a meeting with my ACP co-president, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea in Brussels tomorrow the negotiations will be concluded.  This will open the way for the signature of the new convention in Lomé in early December and will preserve a tradition inaugurated in 1975 by the present Taoiseach, of signature of the Lomé Convention by Irish Presidents of the Council.</P>
    <P>The new convention will consolidate what has been achieved in its two predecessors but it will also contain some innovations. Most notably it will place a new emphasis on the ACP area achieving self reliance through integrated rural and agricultural development.  The new convention will also contain a new chapter on the long term fight against drought and desertification which is presently ravaging many parts of Africa.  It is my fervent hope that &mdash; if we continue these kinds of strategies in our aid programme &mdash; terrible tragedies such as that which we are witnessing in Ethiopia today will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a special word about the situation in Ethiopia.  As you are aware, the Irish Presidency was instrumental in getting the Community to reassess its position on aid to that country. As far back as September the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, brought this tragic situation to the attention of the <Col N="153" /> other member states.  The Taoiseach, too urged his fellow Heads of State and Government to agree to more Community aid to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>No one, of course, is satisfied with the current situation.  Deputy O'Keeffe is in Ethiopia at the moment and will be making a report on his findings to the Council in Brussels next week.  The Irish people have responded magnificently to the appeals for relief.  We did not seek to score any points in our role as Presidency in securing more Community aid for Ethiopia.  It was simply our duty to do so.</P>
    <P>The dramatic famine in Ethiopia has been the subject of recent discussions in the Council.  In 1984 so far the Community has provided aid totalling 43.8 million ECUs.  On 6 November the Council adopted a resolution which recognised that this aid was still inadequate in view of the serious deterioration of the situation in Ethiopia.  However, the Council also noted with satisfaction that a new Community emergency plan had already been put into action for Ethiopia and certain other African countries suffering from famine.  This new emergency aid comprises: immediate aid measures amounting to 32 million ECUs, under which are envisaged the purchase locally of some food products and the transport internally by road and rail of up to 100,000 tonnes of cereals, the internal airlift of 4,000 tonnes of cereals, and medical, nutritional and other programmes; short term food aid actions equivalent to 100,000 tonnes of cereals with an estimated value of 25 million ECUs.</P>
    <P>In addition to this emergency aid, the Community has resolved to pursue actively long term efforts aimed at ensuring food security in Africa.</P>
    <P>Turning again to internal Community affairs, the European Parliament adopted on 14 September 1983 a resolution on the substance of a preliminary draft Treaty establishing European union.  This was a further step in a process which began in July 1981 when the Parliament resolved to take the initiative in giving a new impetus to the creation of European union.  This process culminated on 14 <Col N="154" /> February 1984 when the European Parliament adopted the draft treaty establishing European union, together with a resolution entrusting its President to submit it to the Parliaments and Governments of the member states.</P>
    <P>The draft Treaty is a document which in its intent and inspiration merits our full attention.  While inevitably there will be hesitations on the part of Governments with regard to certain aspects of the draft Treaty, it serves as a useful model for the Community's long term goal of European union and places on Governments the onus of seeking a real consensus for action to achieve that common goal.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the draft Treaty was the crowning achievement of the first directly elected European Parliament which completed its term of office in May.  That Parliament fully justified the faith invested in it as the democratically elected voice of the people of Europe. The second direct elections to the European Parliament were held in June.  While the fall in the percentage of the European electorate who exercised their vote from 62.5 per cent in 1979 to 57 per cent in the recent elections provides cause for some concern and points perhaps to the need for further efforts to publicise the activities and achievements of the Parliament, it must be acknowledged that the first directly elected Parliament greatly enhanced the standing of the Parliament as a leading institution of the Community.</P>
    <P>The decisions reached at the European Council at Fontainebleau in June represented a decisive breakthrough and enabled us to begin to give concrete substance to the launching of the Community to which the Heads of State and Government had committed themselves with the signature of the Solemn Declaration on European Union on 19 June 1983. The success of the Council enabled its members to address their attention once more to the further strengthening and development of the Community and the wellbeing of its citizens.  The Council took the view that the process of European integration should be pursued at two levels, that of Community policies and <Col N="155" /> institutions and that of measures designed to enhance the image and awareness of the Community among its citizens.  It decided to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs representative of the Heads of State or Government, the function of which is to make suggestions for the improvement of the work of the Community in all areas.  The Irish Presidency was asked to take the necessary steps to implement that decision and the Committee is now meeting under the chairmanship of Senator Dooge and is expected to submit an interim report to the European Council in Dublin on 3 and 4 December.  The Council also identified a series of practical measures designed to make the Community more relevant, responsive and meaningful to its citizens than heretofore and decided that a second <i>ad hoc</i> Committee should be set up for this purpose.  This Committee is now under way and I and my colleagues on the Council look forward with anticipation to its recommendations in due course.</P>
    <P>However, the credibility of all our activities, external and internal, depends on our overcoming our short term budgetary difficulties, that is until increased own resources come on stream. Senators will be aware that the budgetary shortfall in 1984 constituted a major crisis for the Community, with the prospect indeed of all payments ceasing by October of this year.  The agreement finally reached, which was based on refundable advances from member states, was a major success for our Presidency and has provided the vital breathing space necessary for the Community to seek a fundamental resolution of its budgetary problems.</P>
    <P>The 1985 preliminary draft budget was submitted by the Commission on 18 June 1984.  In this, the Commission envisaged there would be an increase in the Community's own resources during the period of the budget in order to provide the additional funds needed for its complete financing.  The budgetary process for 1985 has not yet been completed and the <Col N="156" /> Council and the Parliament are engaged in intensive discussions on the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the Community's priorities during the period under review was the completion and consolidation of the internal market and this has continued to develop under our Presidency.  This is one of the basic objectives of the Community, the creation of a genuinely common market, an objective to which this country is committed.  Progress has been made on the simplification of frontier formalities and in October the Council agreed on the introduction of a single administrative document for use in all trade within the Community.</P>
    <P>In the broad area of international economic relations the Community during this period was compelled to express its concern frequently at protectionist moves by some of its trading partners.  In particular, it was necessary to refute the allegation that problems in certain sectors of the US economy could be attributed to competition from Europe.  The Community also remained concerned at the trade imbalance with Japan and continued to press for market-opening measures in the Japanese economy to help redress the balance.</P>
    <P>This period coincided with the first year of full implementation of the agreement between the Community and EFTA which created the world's largest free trade area.  Trade has continued to improve and progress is continuing under the Irish Presidency on implementation of the programme set out in the Joint Declaration of April last.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that the current slackness of the world energy market and the consequent abundance of supplies, especially of oil, should reduce the public attention given to the Community's energy policy.  Nevertheless, the period under review saw consideration of, and decision upon, a number of important issues.  The Council of Energy Ministers debated the Commission's analysis of member states' policies and their relationship to the Community's overall energy objectives and asked for further in-depth study and discussion at official level.  The Council was able to agree on <Col N="157" /> the allocation of substantial funds to the energy demonstration programme, which promotes experimentation with new ways of producing and saving energy.  It also stressed once again that solid fuel, including peat, was an essential aspect of the Community's energy strategy and continued discussion of Commission proposals for financial aid to this sector.  It is fair to say that the Community remains conscious of the need not to be lulled into a false sense of security and is keeping the long-term goals of its energy policy in sight.  Nevertheless the budgetary difficulties of the Community as a whole have undoubtedly affected its ability to promote change &mdash; in this field as in others &mdash; as actively as we would like.</P>
    <P>A major review of the European Regional Development Fund was completed when a new regulation was adopted in June.  It will enter into force on 1 January 1985.  Under the new regulations the present system of fixed national quotas is being replaced by indicative ranges which involve minimum and maximum percentages of the fund being allocated to each member state.  Ireland will be eligible for a share of the total fund of between 5.64 per cent, which is guaranteed, and 6.83 per cent.  The existing non-quota section is being abolished. Financing on the basis of programme is being introduced on an experimental basis and will operate in tandem with the present system of individual projects. While the new regulation should allow greater flexibility in the implementation of Community regional policy, the fund's ability to bring about its objective of achieving greater convergence among member states remains limited by the low level of resources allocated.</P>
    <P>In June this year the Council adopted conclusions on a medium term social action programme.  In addition, resolutions were adopted on the contribution of local employment initiatives and action to combat unemployment among women, as were conclusions concerning technological developments and social change.</P>
    <P>Employment with particular reference <Col N="158" /> to the long term unemployed is a Presidency priority and the Council is at present examining a Commission communication and draft resolution on long term unemployment which it hopes to adopt by the end of the year.  Progress has also been made in such areas as combating poverty, the promotion of positive action for women and the exchange of young workers.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of transport policy, in which progress over the years has been disappointingly slow, it looked at first as if real progress had been recorded at the Council held in May.  There was agreement in principle on a whole package of road transport measures, including a first directive harmonising vehicle weights and dimensions, a graduated increase in the Community quota of road haulage permits &mdash; a move towards freer competition between hauliers &mdash; and on the allocation of funds to transport infrastructure programmes for 1983 and 1984.  The Council also set up two high level groups to consider medium and long term policy in the aviation and inland transport sectors; they are to report to the next month's Transport Council.</P>
    <P>However, the agreement reached in May has, in the interim, been called into question.  Final decisions could not be reached on key details and so the package &mdash; which had been agreed as a totality &mdash; was in serious danger of becoming unstuck.  As Presidency we have made considerable efforts to prevent this.  I am glad to say that at the additional Transport Council held on 8 November we were able to secure political agreement to a compromise solution; it should be possible, I feel, for the measures agreed in May to be formally adopted by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>This period saw one of the most important developments in the field of Community information technology policy, the adoption at the Council of 28 February of the Strategy Programme for Research and Development Technologies (ESPRIT).  This should make a major contribution towards placing European information technology in a position of technical equality with competitors <Col N="159" /> such as the US and Japan.  Ireland stands to benefit considerably from the pilot phase and the five year programme phase of ESPRIT.</P>
    <P>I would like now to review briefly the major developments in 1984 in the area of European Political Co-operation.  The Ten have welcomed the movement towards democracy in South America, in particular in Argentina.  On the other hand, the situation in Chile &mdash; where the authorities have taken no meaningful steps to restore democracy and where violent incidents continue &mdash; remains a cause of deep concern for the Ten.  The Ten have urged that the dialogue between the Chilean authorities and the democratic opposition should be resumed with a view to restoring democratic conditions there.  However, the situation in that country continues to deteriorate and recently the authorities proclaimed a state of siege which imposes yet another hardship on the Chilean people.  That development was recently deplored by the Foreign Ministers of the Ten in a joint statement on 12 November.</P>
    <P>The Ten have continued to express their support for the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful solution to the problems of Central America.  A significant development in recent months was the Conference held in San Jose, Costa Rica, at the end of September between the Foreign Ministers of the Community and the Commission, Portugal and Spain, Central America and the Contadora Group.  The Ten were pleased at the outcome of the conference.  It marked the beginning of a new political dialogue between Europe and Central America, which will be paralleled by an intensification of economic co-operation. In the joint communique of the conference the participants approved their support for the Contadora process as the best opportunity to achieve a peaceful solution to the crisis in Central America.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that tension in and around Nicaragua has been increasing in recent weeks.  I and my nine colleagues of the member states of the <Col N="160" /> Community during our political co-operation meeting in Brussels yesterday expressed our deep concern at this development and expressed the hope that the relevant parties will exercise the utmost restraint and that the Central American countries will soon reach full agreement on a final text of the Contadora Act.</P>
    <P>The Ten have followed closely political developments in southern Africa during this period.  The Foreign Ministers of the Ten on 27 February noted with satisfaction the Lusaka Agreement of 16 February between South Africa and Angola which provided for a disengagement of South African troops from southern Angola.  They also noted the understanding between South Africa and Mozambique which led to the signing of the Nkomati Accord on 16 March.  The Ten have expressed the hope that these agreements would bring about a climate of mutual confidence which would facilitate the implementation of UN Council Resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia.</P>
    <P>The Ten have continued to review development in South Africa, particularly the adoption and implementation of the new constitution.  On 11 September in Dublin the Foreign Ministers of the Ten issued a declaration expressing their concern at arrest and detention and sought the immediate release of those detained without charge.  The Ten considered that the violence and rioting in the black townships reflected, <i>inter alia,</i> the frustration of black South Africans at their deliberate exclusion from South Africa's political life and at the denial to them of adequate political means through which to express their grievances.</P>
    <P>In Asia the Ten remain deeply concerned about the continuing occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.  They called on the Soviet Union in their declaration of 27 March to respect the interest of all states and to renounce their use and threat of force.  Specific reference was made to Afghanistan in this context.</P>
    <P>The major developments in the Middle East during 1984 took place in the Lebanon and in the Iran-Iraq conflicts. Movement towards a solution of the <Col N="161" /> Arab-Israeli conflict was minimal because of the pending Israeli general elections held in July and the run-up to the Presidential elections in the US.  In Lebanon, a national unity government was formed and the Israeli-Lebanon Agreement of 17 May 1983 was abrogated by Lebanon.  In the Iran-Iraq war a UN team confirmed that chemical weapons had been used in Iran and there were extensive attacks on shipping in the Gulf.  On 1 June the Security Council called on all states to respect freedom of navigation in the Gulf.  An agreement was reached between Iran and Iraq on 12 June not to attack purely civilian targets and Irish Army officers serving with the UN have been attached to the teams monitoring this agreement.</P>
    <P>The Ten continued during the period in question to pay close attention to developments in the Middle East and to do whatever possible to help in finding solutions to conflicts in the area.  This has been reflected in a statement issued by the Foreign Minister on 2 February.  The Ten's policies and actions on Lebanon continued to be directed towards reestablishment of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that long-suffering country.  Ireland maintained its practical contribution to the achievement of this in the form of participation in UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, our belief that a solution must encompass the right of all states in the area, including Israel, to a secure and peaceful existence and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination was reaffirmed.</P>
    <P>The Iran-Iraq conflict continued to be a cause for concern both in the region itself and because of its possible wider implications.  The confirmation by a UN team that chemical weapons had been used in the war was a particular cause for distress.  We made clear our unqualified condemnation of any use of such weapons. The Ten continued to support efforts by intermediaries to bring about a ceasefire and a negotiated solution of differences between Iran and Iraq.</P>
    <P>East-West relations were strained throughout 1983 and have continued to <Col N="162" /> be tense in 1984.  In these circumstances, the Ten have made clear their determination to contribute to the improvement of relations between East and West.  They stated this early in the year and I re-emphasised it in speaking on their behalf to the UN General Assembly in September. The Ten hope that the recent high level contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union, which are a positive development, will contribute to bringing about a sustained process of constructive dialogue and a consequent improvement in East-West relations.</P>
    <P>In my address on behalf of the Ten to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September I stated in relation to disarmament and arms control issues:</P>
    <P>The Ten profoundly regret the suspension of the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on intercontinental strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate nuclear forces.  We consider that these vitally important negotiations should resume and be pursued actively with a view to reducing nuclear weapons to the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>In the same address I spoke also of the danger of an arms race in outer space and expressed the Ten's regret that bilateral talks between the two leading space powers have not yet taken place.  As regards the negotiations in Geneva of a convention to prohibit chemical weapons, I welcomed on behalf of the Ten the positive developments which have taken place this year.  I expressed the hope of the Ten that, despite the differences which remain to be resolved, it will be possible to move towards the conclusion at an early date of a convention to eliminate chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>The Ten continue to follow with close interest the evolution of the situation in Poland.  They welcomed the amnesty announced in July for the great majority of those who had received prison sentences for their political activities and those detained awaiting trial.  They recalled that it has consistently been their wish to return to a more normal relationship with Poland as actual developments in that country permit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The Conference on Confidence &mdash; and Security &mdash; Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe, known as the CDE, opened in Stockholm in January and is now in its fourth session.  The objective of the first stage of the CDE is to negotiate confidence &mdash; and security &mdash; building measures designed to reduce the risk of military confrontation in Europe.  It is envisaged that a further stage of the CDE would negotiate actual measures of disarmament.  The conference has been affected by the poor climate of East-West relations in recent times and little significant progress has been made in the work.  The Ten hope that agreement on a working structure for the conference will soon be secured since such an agreement could help to get effective negotiations underway.</P>
    <P>As a participating State of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Ireland has taken part in each of these meetings.  Moreover, during the period of the Irish Presidency Ireland has been responsible for chairing co-ordination of the delegations of the Ten and acting as their spokesman where required.</P>
    <P>Those, then, are the major developments in the Communities to date in 1984.  The Irish Presidency still has, of course, a tremendous amount of work before it.  I am confident, however, that with the full co-operation of our partners we can make further and decisive progress over the remaining weeks and, as a result, hand over on 1 January the chairmanship of a community that has been significantly strengthened during our six months of special responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive review of the year's activity in the EC.  However, it must be said that this year has not been a particularly good one for the EC.  At the time of the European elections in particular it was shown by the number of people who came out to vote that people had lost interest in what happens in the EC because of the fact that the Communities <Col N="164" /> have not been able to tackle the problems which beset the people of all the countries that comprise the EC at present.</P>
      <P>The main problem, of course, has been the failure to tackle the unemployment issue.  There does not seem to be any great emphasis in the Minister's speech on practical steps which are being taken or which will be taken to help resolve this ongoing problem.  There is mention in his speech that before the end of the year there will be a report which will possibly help the long-term unemployed.  There is one thing we can be assured of from the EC and that is that we will get plenty of paper and reports, but unfortunately there is no diminution in the number of people out of work.  The low rate of voting in the EC elections has shown that people have begun to doubt the value of this grouping.</P>
      <P>I think it right that the problems in Ethiopia should be mentioned in the Minister's speech.  We should dwell a little on how best we might help that particular country and the other countries surrounding the Sahara, the Sahel countries where desertification is growing at a pace which is phenomenal.  The thousands of hectares that have been taken over by the Sahara in the past number of months is frightening.  The problem in Ethiopia is not a short-term problem and is not one that can be really helped by the type of fire brigade action that is being given to it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that there have been fantastic efforts made throughout the Community on a voluntary basis and indeed by Governments to send out aid to that country but if we are to solve the problems of that area it is not fire brigade measures we need but an ongoing system of aid which will help to re-establish the agricultural basis which was there.  We will have to tackle the problem of desertification. If we do not tackle that problem we are going to have an ongoing problem of hunger in the world.  Everybody who has seen the pictures on RTE and the other channels has been appalled at the sight of babies and adults dying there. We could hear the sounds of death but if we could for ten seconds smell the death <Col N="165" /> and realise the poverty of that area we would really get down to trying to solve the problems of that area.</P>
    <P>For too many years we have seen aid given as a form of fire brigade measure but in Europe or in the developed world we have not looked at the real problems and we have not tried to really tackle them.  Many countries have given aid but basically the aid they have given has been to the benefit of the donor countries and not the recipient country.  There are too many developed countries who give a certain amount of development aid to the Third World but who insist that imports to these countries have to be purchased in the donor country.  Thus the profits on the manufacture of materials stay in the donor country and too little goes to the country which really needs the aid.</P>
    <P>The Community needs to establish projects such as Gorta are establishing in these countries.  We must establish projects which will give long-term hope and not just depend on fire brigade measures.</P>
    <P>I agree with the majority of people in Ireland who cannot understand why the mountains of food we have building up on a daily basis in the EC cannot be released.  I have heard an official statement that they cannot be released because if they are released the Community would lose the value that can be got when these products are put on sale in the international market at cut price rates.  I think in Ireland and in the other EC countries there would not be a dissenting voice if the food mountains were transferred from the ships and the warehouses throughout the Community.  Who is benefiting at present?</P>

      <P>The European Communities' normal sources of funding of customs duties, agricultural levies and up to 1 per cent of the VAT base of the Communities, are insufficient to meet all of the Communities' expenditure requirements in 1984. Member states have agreed to provide additional funds on an <i>ad hoc</i> voluntary basis to meet the shortfall.  The 1972 European Communities Act, which provides the legal backing for our normal contribution, does not cover voluntary payments, however, and so this new legislation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the legislation is as follows.  The Community budget as originally adopted for 1984 required funding of 0.998 per cent of the VAT <Col N="169" /> base of the Community as well as from customs duties and agricultural levies. Additional expenditure totalling £1,340 million proved necessary, mainly for agricultural policies.  Increases in the estimates for some receipts and internal Community balances provided an extra £618 million but alternative arrangements were required to meet the balance. Member states agreed to provide this by way of extra voluntary payments.  The Irish contribution is 0.86 per cent of the total extra payments, or £6.2 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to 1985, both parts of the Community's Budget Authority, that is, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, accept that Community expenditure next year must exceed the normal Community resources currently available, although as the budgetary procedure is not yet completed, the budget figures are not yet settled.  The Fontainebleau agreement provided for an increase in the VAT contribution to 1.4 per cent by the beginning of 1986 at the latest, and while we have been pressing for the introduction of the new ceiling in 1985, there is no agreement on this as yet. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the possibility of another voluntary agreement next year.  The adoption of this provision will confirm Ireland's willingness to supply the necessary extra funds in 1985.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I thank this House for finding the time this week to debate this measure and I commend the Bill to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be supporting this Bill, not perhaps because we believe that the Government arrived at this position but rather because it is essential to maintain agricultural spending to the end of this year.  This provision before the House arises because of the blockade by the British, the intransigent attitude which they adopted towards their own commitment to the European Communities. They have succeed in getting fairly massive refunds since 1983, again this year and a further one proposed for next year which inevitably means that the <Col N="170" /> supply of funds to the Commission as a whole to fund agricultural spending has been lessened and the restrictions which have been introduced have inevitably meant that the position in our own country has been changed very much for the worse.  However, we may object and I know the Government have put up stern opposition to the British attitude but unfortunately they have won on this occasion.  The tragedy of it is that part of the reason for the problems in relation to European Community funds has been many of the agreements which that Government herself operates in relation to New Zealand, etc.  We have not been able to get any significant changes in this which in its own way has contributed towards the problem.</P>
      <P>However, one has to say that she did have support from the German Government and because of the budgetary and financial constraints that are there, it is best perhaps got out of the way because we are obviously not going to succeed in getting an increase in the own resources, in the 1 per cent VAT which is supplied by the various countries in the Community towards the Community funds until the British refund questions are once and for all got out of the way.  We may not like this situation but it looks as if we are not going to be able to change it.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister in his reply to indicate how soon it is hoped to have this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement expire and when we can come back once again to a position of fairly realistic funding for the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One recent decision taken by the Council of Ministers, and which obviously comes within the ambit of this Bill, has been one of fairly significant political and economic import as far as this country is concerned.  It is in regard to a new system of discipline which is designed to ensure that the rise in agricultural spending will be less than that of the general European funds.  This has dire consequences for our country because we depend to a considerable degree on agriculture and because our agricultural exports and downstream processing play such a vital role in our economy, not only <Col N="171" /> for the farming community but for the many thousands of workers who depend for their livelihood on the processing and servicing of agriculture.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would indicate if there has been any consideration given to the special position of Ireland in relation to this new discipline in connection with these funds.  I believe it will have a very serious effect.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the super-levy will dictate Irish policy and European policy for some years to come.  It is essential that the other measures which were introduced prior to the introduction of the super-levy should now be disbanded. One of those, of course, is the co-responsibility levy.  It seems to me that that levy, which was introduced some years ago and was intended to decrease the amount of milk supply but did not have that effect should not be added as an additional burden to the super-levy at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to indicate if in the light of this agreement any formal arrangement has been made for the termination of the co-responsibility levy.  I would also like to ask the Minister in the context of this Bill if in the case of the other programmes, the Regional Development Fund, the Social Fund and the new structures policy, any further progress has been made in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Regional Development Fund is opeated by the Department of Finance. It seems to me that they have very little sympathy for the agricultural or farming area.  Would it be possible in the light of the restrictions on funds for agriculture generally to say whether progress could be made in directing the Regional Development Fund into food processing and into areas where we now have very substantial imports of foods which we should be able to produce ourselves and do not seem to have the basic resources in terms of research, processing and technological advance required?  We have referred to the variety of foods that have been imported into this country.  Each year the quantity seems to be increasing.  We are <Col N="172" /> paying only lip service to the problem. Are we really settling down to try to ensure that the funds which are available from Brussels &mdash; I know a considerable amount has been spent on roads and telecommunications &mdash; could if possible be diverted to same extent into the food processing area?</P>
    <P>I have heard Dr. Tom O'Dwyer on a number of occasions on radio telling successive Irish Governments that we are not actually taking up the full scope of these funds.  In other words, funds are available to Ireland from the Regional and Social Funds which we are not taking up.  It is very difficult to be arguing for additional funds when we are not, in fact, for some reason, technical or otherwise, availing of what is already available to us.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister in the context of the new structures policy which has been considered in Brussels, whether it is true that no further aid is going to be given to milk producers.  I mention this in particular in the context of the west of Ireland.  It seems to me that where farmers are totally dependent on milk production, have small holdings and are already committed financially and otherwise to milk production, consideration should be given in the new structures policy &mdash; where we understand the Commission is more sympathetic in the light of the super-levy &mdash; particularly to the small and medium-sized producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Bill is a technical one.  It requires and enables the Government to fulfil their undertaking to provide additional funding for the European Communities in 1984 and to make it possible for further payment to be made in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Smith, however, takes another line which I would like to follow up, that of us not taking advantage of funds which are made available by the European Communities.  We must, as a Government, make our contribution.  It is up to our Government, our Minister of the day and our public representatives to make cases for funding where it is <Col N="173" /> needed.  It would be a crying shame not to take up funds that are available.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, with nine other people we left Donegal to travel to Brussels.  It was my first time in Brussels, which I think is a shame, that a public representative at Oireachtas level has not been at the head of our European Parliament.  It was not so ordained at local level: it was not done by representatives of my party or of the Opposition parties as we have them in Donegal.  I would like to think those responsible were totally wrong.  I regret very much that I did not visit Brussels at least five years ago to educate myself.  All of us as Oireachtas Members should be educated and we in turn should attempt to educate our local representatives to go to make a case.</P>
    <P>One thing I learned on my visit to Brussels was something about the Regional Fund which will be applied from 1 January next year.  If my information is right, the total minimum amount of the fund available when the minimum allocations of the member states are added together would be 12 per cent below the 100 per cent and if the total maximum quota of each member state were used it would be 12 per cent above the amount available.  In other words, if each member state only took up its minimum allocation then there would be moneys left over.  Each member state cannot obviously take up the maximum and the result would be 12 per cent over the budget.  It is up to the Government and their Ministers on the advice of all the Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that we make applications for schemes so that we get, not just the minimum available to Ireland but the maximum available to Ireland and so that we will get our share of that &ldquo;floating&rdquo; 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of one place where I think the Regional Fund should and could apply.  We have a situation in one part of Donegal where the River Lennon needs draining.  The River Lennon is very low on the Office of Public Works priority list of drainage schemes. If I were to wait for that drainage to conclude then certainly I will not be <Col N="174" /> around and my children, if I am blessed with any, will not be around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an attempt to get funding for the River Lennon.  I am trying to draw the attention of the Minister to the need for funding the draining of the River Lennon in Donegal because &mdash; if you bear with me you will realise precisely why I make this case &mdash; if we are to wait until the River Lennon comes &ldquo;on stream&rdquo;, to use, not necessarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is funding &ldquo;to&rdquo; the EC we are talking about, not &ldquo;from.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>But if we do not make cases for funding &ldquo;from&rdquo; there will be no necessity to fund &ldquo;to&rdquo;.  The net result of this debate is that we will make funds available: I am looking for my share back again.  That is what the whole EC spirit is about, to put our funds together and to share them out where need arises and need arises in the River Lennon in County Donegal.  However I respect the Leas-Chathaoirleach's ruling.  We are technically making funds available today. We must at future times look for our return on the moneys that are made available. My main reason for speaking is the need for all of us to educate ourselves about the availability of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on record that the North-Western Health Board at an early stage appointed one of their personnel to deal specifically and directly with EC grants and affairs.  That has been a most <Col N="175" /> successful appointment.  In Donegal for a number of years we have been toying with the idea of appointing a person specifically to deal with EC affairs.  As yet we have not got the blessing of the majority of our councillors.  With regret, I admit that.  Our delegation to Brussels from Donegal, as we made our cases to the various people concerned with the various funds, was complimented because we had gone there and did not merely send a written submission.  They saw and knew that our case was genuine.</P>
    <P>Naturally I support the Bill that is making funds available, but I would ask the Minister when he is preparing whatever schedules he may be preparing for funds from the funds we are now making available, to keep in mind and make his fellow Ministers of State and senior Ministers in Government aware of the need for the draining of the River Lennon in County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just a few things on this Bill which, as the Minister said, is a technical Bill to deal with the question of additional payment to the European Communities.  First of all, the Bill must be put in the context of the recurring crisis in the funding of the Community which has been a feature of the Community over the last few years. This crisis has arisen because of two problems. First and foremost, the expansion of the expenditure of the Community, particularly in the agricultural area but not exclusively in that area, has meant that the 1 per cent VAT base used for the raising of a substantial portion of the Community funds has proved to be inadequate.  That has been a problem. The second problem has been the desire of some member states to change the rules which applied to them at the time they entered the Community.  It is important that we should examine very briefly both of those problems in seeing whether we should agree with Dáil Éireann in giving extra money to the Government, in concurring with Dáil Éireann that extra money should be provided by Dáil Éireann to the Government for the <Col N="176" /> purpose of discharging their voluntary obligations under European Community legislation.</P>
      <P>It would be the desire of most Irish people that the expenditure of the Community would increase and increase moderately.  It is also the desire that spending in the agricultural sector should be kept at a realistic level, not allowed to go completely overboard, but kept at a realistic level so that the many benefits to be derived from that policy are in fact derived from the policy, but at the same time, that it does not become so burdensome on the Community at large that there is a revolt from the non-agricultural producing members of the Community which has the effect of upsetting the normal growth pattern of agricultural income.  In addition, it is also true that the other expenditures of the Community in regional and social areas have expanded and we are in favour of that expansion.  It is inevitable, I suppose, that the bringing together of those two expansions should mean that the Community would, during the year 1984, find itself inadequately financed.</P>
      <P>It is right to say that there are a number of ways of tackling that problem and this is only one possible way.  The most obvious way was the way it was originally suggested, that the VAT rate which would be applicable and payable to the Community should be raised from its present ceiling of 1 per cent to a higher percentage, and that the Community should in that way finance the deficit. Some members of the Community felt &mdash; and I think we should go along with them &mdash; that careful scrutiny of the expenditure of the Community was wise before making that decision.  But other members of the Community in addition to that felt &mdash; this is something which I do not think we could or should share &mdash; that the rules which apply to those members should be changed so as to limit the contributions which they were making or about to make to the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the attitude of the British Government towards the funding of the Community must be specifically referred to.  Their attitude has been unhelpful and <Col N="177" /> has not reflected any commitment by that country to the Community itself.  The battle cry was joined by the present British Prime Minister who said that all that they were looking for was their own money back.  It was not their own money; it was the Community's money because they joined on the clear understanding that there would be a certain system of calculation of the contribution of each country.  That system has not changed. Therefore, all they were being asked to pay was their lawful club membership fee.  We may find that it is fairly typical of that country that once it gets a foot in the door it seeks to change the rules.  We will have an opportunity, I understand in the consideration of the wider motions on the European Community which are at present before us to consider this matter in greater detail, but I would like to say that the prospects of giving a rebate to the United Kingdom of 66 per cent of its deficit does not fill me with any great enthusiasm.  Therefore, I approach this problem and this Bill in the following frame of mind: I congratulate the Government on negotiating a deal which in the narrow interest of Ireland is excellent indeed.  We have done an excellent job.  This is all part of our milk super-levy deal.  With all its problems it is a superb deal and something which reflects great credit on the Government in general, and on the Taoiseach in particular.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I must add to that the view that in the consideration of this budgetary problem the whole concept of the European Community as a community has taken a hammering.  The idea has gone forward and has been propagated by the United Kingdom Government in particular that each country should get back from the Community a sum of money approximately equal to what it puts in.  If that is the basis of the Community we may as well not be in the Community at all because there will be no convergence of living standards throughout the Community if it is only a system of circulating funds within the Community, if we as one of the poorest countries on the periphery of Europe <Col N="178" /> contribute a certain amount of money every year and get back in return exactly the same amount of money.  That is the basic philosophy which is behind the United Kingdom approach towards budgetary matters.  I am afraid that by accepting that the Community at large has departed in a most fundamental way from the concept of the Community as a community.</P>
    <P>In the narrow Irish self-interest our Government have, undoubtedly, done the right thing and I enthusiastically support their decision to which we are about to give effect.  But I think the Community itself as a community has started on the slippery road of no longer being a community but being a system of circulating their own money back to their own members under various policy guises.  That is a very dangerous thing and does not encourage us to proceed further towards the unification of Europe.  That is a matter I will develop in the broader motions which will be before the House later on today and, I am sure, will be carried on the next time we meet.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself there is one matter I would like to raise on Committee Stage with the Minister.  It is not a very technical matter; there is nothing very dramatic about it.  There are two operative parts of this Bill section 2 (a) and (b).  I have no objection to section 2 (a) at all.  I am just telling the Minister in advance so he can get advice on this matter.  Section 2 (a) proposes to implement the undertaking that has already been given by the Government to give some £6.8 million to the Community in this year by way of additional voluntary Irish contribution.  However, I do not like the drafting of the next subsection, which gives the Government <i>carte blanche</i> to agree to any sum of money whatsoever in respect of 1985 without further reference to the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this Government or any Government which might conceivably replace it during 1985 would abuse that position.  But I think it weakens their negotiating position for a law to be already on the Statute Book which enables them to pay out any sum of <Col N="179" /> money they choose.  I do not think that is a good thing for democracy, nor is it a good thing for their negotiating position. One of the strongest cards the other members of the Community have played in the budgetary negotiations is the card played by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom when from time to time she said: &ldquo;I do not think I can get that through the House of Commons&rdquo;.  Therefore, she was able to say that she needed further concessions.  It would be no harm for our Government to be able to say at some time in the future: &ldquo;I do not know whether I can get that through the Dáil and Seanad&rdquo;.  What we are proposing to do is to say, &ldquo;Whatever you agree, lads, that is all right&rdquo;.  Privately I might say that is all right but I do not want to have it on the Statute Book that it is all right. I know it is there because a man with a tidy mind in the Department of Finance said, &ldquo;We will not only solve the problem for 1984 but for 1985 also&rdquo;.  If I know those gentlemen in the Department of Finance &mdash; whom I cannot criticise and I am not criticising &mdash; if it was necessary to include such undertakings up to 1997 they would be in the Bill as well, because administratively it would be very convenient for them to do that.</P>
    <P>Why should we allow any Government to make any commitment whatsoever without further reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  That is what we are doing in section 2 (b).  It is not that I think that this Government or any Government that would replace them between this and the end of 1985 would make any foolish agreement, but it is the principle of the matter.  It is that it is bad legislation.  In spite of what people might think, we are here to change bad legislation; we are not here as rubber stamps.  For that reason the Minister should reconsider the matter.  He should give further consideration to the question of whether paragraph 2 (b) is necessary.  If a situation arises during 1985 in which the Minister feels it is necessary to come before this House for approval of an agreement which has been entered into by the Government, no <Col N="180" /> doubt he will get the same ready response from this House and the other House as he is getting today.  For all those reasons and in order to strengthen the negotiation position of our Ministers I do not think we should put this <i>carte blanche</i> on the Statute Book.  It is important that we maintain the control by the Houses of the Oireachtas of the money which is being spent on our behalf.  It is a matter primarily for the Dáil in respect of the expenditure of money but we have a right, even if it is a minor right, to be heard in matters of public expenditure.  It is important that this point should be seriously considered by the Minister in the consideration of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who contributed to this debate for their co-operation. This is important legislation.  From a layman's point of view it means that the EC will not run out of cash before the end of this year.  If one considers its importance in the agricultural area it is vital to a nation like Ireland that this should not happen.  I would have to take note of what Senator Smith said about the importance and desirability of ensuring that we have a better system of financing in the future.  As the House is aware there is a proposal that the own resources, if I may refer to them as such, should be increased to 1.4 per cent of VAT and it is hoped that this will become operative at the beginning of 1986.  It appears to me that we will have to live at least another year, if not two, under the structure we have at present.  I would have to acknowledge that even one year is too long if we could help it, but this is a very complex issue.  Suffice to say that of the £1,340 million we are talking about £1,320 million is earmarked for agriculture of one kind or another.  That will give an idea of the importance to an agricultural country like Ireland of the legislation being put through this House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many other issues raised in the course of this discussion to which I would like to refer.  However, because of <Col N="181" /> the technical nature of this Bill, there will be other occasions here in the House when the wider implications of our position and our financing arrangements <i>vis-à-vis</i> the entire EC budget can be debated at greater length.  It is very important that this Bill go through the House today.  We are the net beneficiaries.  It is costing us £6.2 million but because of the special importance agriculture has in our economy it is of great interest to us.  There are many other aspects in which I would like to get involved but because of the type of Bill before us this is not the time.</P>
    <P>Finally, because the Bill will apparently wind its way through here today we will have a growth in agricultural expenditure in the EC because of the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements.  If this had not been possible to negotiate by our Government we would have great problems in this country particularly in November and December of this year.  It is against that background that I am very thankful to the House for their support of the Bill here today.</P>

      <P>I am of the opinion that it would strengthen our hand to be in a position to negotiate on the spot.  On the number of occasions that I was in Brussels at negotiations of one type or another I certainly believe that it would have been an impediment to us as negotiators not to have been able to do so.  I believe the Minister for Finance referred to this in the Dáil as well.  There are two sides to the argument, of course, but the brief of the elected representatives, the negotiators, no matter what Government they represent, will be to do everything humanly possible to bring back the best possible deal.  I would say to Senator O'Leary that that is a two-edged sword.  It could work for us but it could certainly work against us.  My view of it is that we would be creating a straitjacket arrangement for our negotiators and I am not sure that it would be in Ireland's best interest if we were to do that.</P>

      <P>In replying to the Second Stage debate unusually for him, the Minister, and I am not saying he was discourteous to this House, did not deal with some of the points which were made and which are normally replied to.  We do not feel we should give <i>carte blanche</i> to any expenditure without having been properly briefed on the impact of these decisions.  Leaving that aside, it is unbelievable that a Government would give prior knowledge to the Commission that they were agreeable to accept for 1985 terms which are before the House at the moment.  How could it be a helpful factor in future negotiations for them to know exactly what your position is?  We have been putting on pressure for years for an increase in our resources which has been held back mainly by the British.  If we are to have a longer term system and not be coming regularly to the Dáil and Seanad with these matters and if we are going to let the Commission and the Council of Ministers representing other countries know in advance that we are in agreement again with this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, <Col N="183" /> would the Minister explain to the Seanad how that could assist in negotiations?</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Smith, I want to make it very clear that the Government are absolutely opposed to the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and I have said so on many occasions.  We work progressively and at every opportunity that we can find, particularly now that we have the Presidency of the EC, to ensure that we have a more permanent financing arrangement.  I want to put it on the record of the House that that is the factual position.  In so far as what Senator Smith and Senator O'Leary are speaking about those are the actual tactics as such that are adopted <i>vis-à-vis</i> the negotiating strategy.  I would have to say, as all Members of this House are fully aware, that there are huge conflicting issues within the EC.  For obvious reasons it is very much in our interest that we get a particular system adopted by the EC and we will know exactly what we have to pay and that everybody else plays the game as the rules were laid down.  That is our position.  That is where we want to go.  The problem is that because of the various pressures there are, particularly on the agricultural budget, because of a shortfall, if this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement was not arrived at the position would become extremely serious, particularly for Irish farmers.  We have enough problems.  The negotiators did an excellent job in the circumstances to arrive at this position. Because of the contribution that we will be making to the EC it would certainly safeguard our interest.</P>

    <P>I must repeat, in case I might be misquoted or misrepresented in what I have said, that of course we want a particular strategy in the future that will ensure that we will not have to have this type of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  We want to do that in 1985 in every way we can.  We will put our full resources behind that particular objective.  I am being as frank as I can be on this, from the information that I have. We will do everything we can in 1985 to arrive at this set of circumstances but it is quite possible that another year will pass.  It is important to the Community <Col N="184" /> and it is important to Ireland that we have a set of circumstances whereby this type of thing need not happen in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying, that he, or the Department, or even this House does not accept and <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement but realising that we are beneficiaries it is imperative that we set about, even in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, to try to rectify the imbalance that has been created in the Community's budgeting arrangements.  I will deal specifically with Senator O'Leary's point on the section. In normal circumstances I would consider it to be improper to give anybody a blank cheque in negotiating for us but if we look at the three-year plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, there is no way that a blank cheque is available to any negotiator in this country to use in Europe or elsewhere, simply because the money is not available.  I would put it to the Minister that in our particular situation we have over the past ten years of our membership been beneficiaries, so that for every pound we put in, even on a blank cheque basis, we are likely to get £4 or £5 in return for it.  It is easy to negotiate on the basis that we are beneficiaries whereas if it was a deficit situation it would be different.  The main contributors to the Community, Germany, France and Britain, have that problem.  They maintain the structures of Europe not for any love of us but for the political unity of Europe. That is the only reason why they pick up the tabs and pay the bills, to try to maintain a political unity as a power bloc in Europe.  I will have more to say on that when I am contributing to the other motions we are discussing.  In this kind of negotiating situation a blank cheque is an advantage on the basis that for every pound we put up we are net beneficiaries and that should not weaken our case in any way.  I would accept the point that Senator O'Leary is making as a legislator. Possibly it is the wrong way to legislate in normal terms but in the circumstances in Europe where we in fact go with our cap in our hand, it is possibly the best way for us to negotiate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I failed to make the connections the Minister was making between the benefits which were accruing to this country in respect of the solution of the budgetary problem of the EC and the point that I was making.  Of course, we accept that the solution to the problems of the EC is to the long-term and short-term benefit of the country. The major portion of my Second Stage speech was taken up with hammering home that point.  I have no objection whatsoever to the permission which the Government is seeking to reimburse the £6.2 million which is our contribution. That does not answer the point that I am making.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that we are now giving public notice that our negotiators have a blank cheque.  Senator Ferris may say that that is all right because we are going to get back four times as much as we give in anyway.  But that might not always be the case.  If, for example, during the course of next year, instead of being asked to pay 0.86 per cent we are asked to pay 1 per cent that change would not require any further consideration by the Dáil or Seanad.  If, instead of giving the United Kingdom a refund of 66 per cent of its contribution it was decided to give a refund of 100 per cent of its contribution, that would also not trigger off a situation where the further approval of the Dáil or Seanad would be required. I am not objecting to our making the present arrangement in respect of the agreement that is now being made.  I congratulated the Government on making that arrangement.  Also, I am not suggesting that the same thing would not happen again and I would not offer the same congratulations next year.  But what I am saying is that we are going further than that and we are legislating in such a way that we are taking from the Oireachtas the power to control the expenditure of money.  That is primarily a matter for the other House and I do not understand why the other House allowed this Bill through.  I think it is unbelievable that they should agree to this variation of the power of scrutiny which is theirs, not ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> With regard to the argument which the Minister makes that our negotiating position will be strengthened, I think that is a Civil Service argument.  That argument could be made about anything.  Was our negotiating position weakened by reason of the fact that this Bill was not on the Statute Book in respect of the negotiations which have now been completed? I do not think our negotiating position was affected by the fact that the Bill was not there because nobody expected the Bill to be there.  We can rest assured that the other Governments and the British Government are not going to introduce legislation giving such powers without reference to their Houses of Parliament. It could have been included in one Bill but there could have been a subsidiary clause that any future undertaking would be the matter of a motion in the Dáil and Seanad, or at least would be the matter of a ministerial order which would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and would come into operation unless there was an adverse motion passed.  There are many ways of doing this, but still maintaining a degree of supervision in Dáil Éireann.  I am not happy but I have nothing further to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on one thing he says in relation to the EC.  The whole process of how own resources is developed is intricate and complex.  I cannot accept Senator Ferris's rather weak-kneed contribution.  We have consistently tried in this country, since we joined the European Community, to be as community-conscious as possible. We have taken many considerations into account in trying to be as European as possible.  But what exactly has been happening?  At the same time as we have been interpreting gross benefit to this country by the terms of our accession to the European Community there have been many disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now supporting a Bill which is necessary because the British have succeeded in getting a refund which was not part of the earlier negotiations.  At the same time, the surpluses in agricultural production which create the stress on the <Col N="187" /> European budget are partly caused by agreements which the British have maintained with colonial interests and they are not prepared to change that situation. We have also suffered in this country in relation to the comparison with many other European farmers in milk production. We asked that we be allowed to increase at least to the European average and we are not allowed to do that.  We argued against cereal substitutes being used in the Community and what do we find?  We find tonnes of gluten coming in from Thailand and called Third World imports.  The owners of these companies come from Germany, Holland and Denmark, people with real interests in the Community, but have these interests as well and are complicating and making this system more intricate and more complex and more difficult to manage.</P>
    <P>The benefits to this country can be exaggerated and I do not understand why we should have all the time to give in. We have had many changes in industrial areas.  We have massive food imports coming in here.  I do not think we should at all times stand aside and agree to terms cap in hand.  It looks as if agreements which have been reached in terms of having a different discipline in relation to agricultural expenditure for the future by the Council of Ministers are going to further threaten and diminish the flow of funds from the Community to Ireland because of our overall dependence on the necessity to further develop, expand, process and market our agricultural production. It is difficult to see why we should be so confessional in our approach.  We do not wish to push this matter to a vote but the Minister should take into account the reservations that we have about letting the Commission and the Council of Ministers know in advance what our terms are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly take note of the twist that this debate has taken.  It has been a very informative one. Like most other stories there are two sides to it.  I take note of the reservations but I still maintain that because of the <Col N="188" /> track record we have <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners we have done quite well under the old system in the sense that our negotiators were not tied or straitjacketed.  Perhaps there will be occasions in the future when it would suit us to do things the other way round. When that occasion comes, we will be talking about a different ball game.  As of now I believe we would be tying the hands of our negotiators because of the special position that we have there.  All I can say to the House at this stage is that the points that have been raised are uppermost in our minds.  The next year or two will be critical from the point of view of all the Governments involved, but particularly from ours.  There is an old saying, &ldquo;He who pays the piper calls the tune&rdquo;.  The people who pay more in than they get out have in the last two or three years become increasingly uneasy. I have to accept that some of them have more or less changed the ground rules.  It is true to say that because of the size and the muscle that countries have inside that club it is very important for small nations like ours to ensure that the rules are kept. In the next year or two I hope that the roles will be more clearly defined and that once we get over this <i>ad hoc</i> business we will know exactly where we stand. Because of the importance to Ireland of this measure it is very important that it gets a clear run through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was speaking about the situation in Ethiopia and I referred to the fact that there would hardly be a dissenting voice in Europe if the mountains of food that are stored throughout the Community were released on a once-off basis to help the suffering people of a large part of Africa, not just Ethiopia.  When one considers the cost of keeping the mountains of food in storage one can only suggest that the people who are benefiting most are those who are building stores for grain, meat and milk powder.  They cannot keep up with the building programme because as soon as one bay is built it is filled and they go on to the next phase.  There are about 30 million tonnes of grain in storage in the EC at present and it will deteriorate because it is not stored as it would be by a farmer or by a co-operative where it would be turned and the temperature kept right.  The value of the grain will not be maintained in these stores.  My real concern is that eventually this grain will be sold very cheaply, and more than likely it will be sold to a country which will use the grain and possibly in reselling it will foment more disorder in the countries of Africa because possibly they will use the reselling of this grain for the purpose of selling arms and armaments to countries in the Southern and Northern African countries.</P>
      <P>We must again look at the politics of aid to Third World countries.  The countries in the West, America in particular, are not playing the part that they should play, in some instances because of political considerations.  If they do not like the regime in power in a country they will not aid that country irrespective of the fact that people are dying there like flies. We must take politics out of aid to these countries.  There was a book published recently entitled <i>Give us bread not cake</i> and we in this House should say: &ldquo;give them grain, not bread&rdquo;.  We have the grain and it is deteriorating.  This is a scandal, and the people of Europe would not raise their eyebrows if this food was sent off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to the sending of food which <Col N="190" /> would only give a short term benefit to the countries concerned, we must have a massive transfer of technology to the countries which are under threat through desertification and famine.  Recently, under an AnCo training course, people were sent out to Louvain to help the monks in the Irish college there to re-roof their building.  Would it not be possible to send out the large number of very highly technically qualified people who are unemployed in this country to the African countries?  It would not cost very much to send them out there and it would not cost very much to keep them there to help in the technological development of these countries, particularly in the areas of irrigation and agriculture.  It would be a lot better to send out ten cows than to send out 20,000 tonnes of milk powder, because the cows in the long term would be of more benefit to the people out there.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are crying out to the Government and to the EC to get more involved and the people of Africa are crying out for aid.  This concern which I am expressing is not my concern alone but that of every person to whom I have spoken.</P>
    <P>I will get away now from the sad facts of the African situation and talk about some of the problems that have not been highlighted in the report.  There is a very small paragraph given in the report to the unemployment problem in the EC, and the only mention of change in this is that there will be more emphasis placed on local employment incentives.  Basically this means that the Community as a whole has given up on the problem of unemployment, because when they talk about local employment initiatives, they mean going along to the county council, the corporation or the local community and asking them to provide jobs for the people living in their own areas.  This is not going to solve the problem of unemployment in Ireland or in the EC.  Unless they stop producing the mountains of reports on unemployment and get down to providing jobs we will be continually coming in here listening to reports on <Col N="191" /> the EC which are totally aspirational and which give no help to the people who are crying out for help from the EC.  The EC is top heavy on bureaucracy and very low on action.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government over the next very short period in which they still hold the Presidency of the EC to put a sense of urgency into the units of the EC towards creating an atmosphere where young people could find that within the EC during the next few years there will be jobs and a future available for them.  People of the middle age group who have lost jobs in traditional industries should be able to hope that at some stage in the future they will be employed, not just on short-term useless energy sapping ventures such as have been suggested for them in the national plan and in various other plans which have been published in the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>Basically, the middle age group who have lost their jobs have been told that they will never work again but that there might be short-term educational and short-term work experience programmes made available to them.  In other words the EC has written them off.  We might be sorry in the future as this growing number of people, who have tremendous energy and who have over the last number of years taken from our educational system the value that it has given them, have a lot to offer this country but what they have to offer is being thrown away because of the lack of initiative from the EC.</P>
    <P>There is mention of an EC energy policy which is gearing itself towards more use of native fuel sources including peat.  I cannot understand why there has been no mention of our top quality coal that is available in Ireland and lignite which is available in the North.  There has not been any attempt to quantify what is available in the native fuel areas in terms of coal.  The technology to allow the use of low grade coal has increased vastly over the past number of years.  We have untold millions of tonnes of both high and low grade quality available in Ireland <Col N="192" /> which can be brought out economically, but unfortunately over the past number of years there has been a total lack of commitment, and there is no mention in the national plan of native fuel.  Because of the lack of policy from the EC and the Government the excellent coalfields in Ballingarry, County Tipperary, are closed down at present.</P>
    <P>British mining consultants have suggested that there are 29 million tonnes of coal in the Slievardagh seam.  The mine is opened and closed at various intervals because there is not an energy policy which will allow the development of that mine.  Rossmore, Castlecomer, Feroda and all the Leinster coalfields have been taken asunder because of lack of Government effort to provide a fuel which has excellent calorific value which could be an import substitution worth a huge amount of money.  When one considers that imported anthracite is costing up to £200 a tonne at present one can see the impact that mining could have on our balance of payments.  We have low grade coal in the coalfields in the Cathaoirleach's area in Leitrim which are being allowed to run down.  I keep stressing that if there is a genuine effort made at community level to try to bring in technology which could use the lignite which is in Fermanagh, South Tyrone, and the crow coal and low grade coal that is available in Leitrim, we would have a 32 county energy source which could play a massive part in getting rid of our importation of foreign fuels which are much worse in many cases than the fuel that is available from Leitrim even though it is called low grade coal.</P>
    <P>The report mentioned an attempt at unifying the transport policy within the EC so as to maximise the use of harmonising legal weights and dimensions.  Basically what this means is that we are going to have bigger trucks, bigger units, the 50 tonne unit is not going to be enough. We are going to have massive units and we talk about harmonising weights and dimensions to have a graduated move towards freer competition between hauliers. This is an attempt to wipe out the <Col N="193" /> Irish haulage system.  If you harmonise the weights to attempt to have freer competition we see that the cost of the Irish haulier's vehicle in terms of the import cost, plus VAT, plus the revenue take is much higher than in Britain.  His insurance is three times higher than that prevailing in Britain and his tyres and spare parts cost more than double the cost in Britain.  His road tax is more than four times the British road tax and nearly ten times what it is in other countries.  There is no way that we can have a harmonisation in the transport area unless we agree to wipe out our native hauliers; that is what harmonisation and a graduated move towards freer competition between hauliers in the member states will bring about.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that Spain will be joining the EC.  As I mentioned in the debate on the national plan, we are bringing in a state which has 17,500 trawlers, who have 70 per cent of the fish take of the EC at present.  We have 1,600 trawlers, and can we imagine the effect that 17,500 extra trawlers are going to have, not alone that but the fact that there are third country agreements between Spain and a huge range of countries? We should be very careful before we allow our fishing industry to be wiped out because of EC policy of bringing in Spain.  Whatever protection can be given to the Irish fishing industry should be given, and it must be a long term protection, otherwise there will not be a native Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East was mentioned.  The report stated that because the United States Presidential election was going on and also because of the elections in Israel very little has been done in the EC over the past months to try to do something to help that unfortunate area.  Mention is made of the Lebanon and the efforts being made by the Lebanese to re-establish a government which will be self-sufficient.  The Israelis are blocking every effort that is being made to have the area immediately surrounding Israel taken over by either the Lebanese army or the UNIFIL forces.  UNIFIL forces in the Lebanon at <Col N="194" /> present number 5,683 and it is reckoned that about another 1,500 are necessary if we want to have the area between what was the Haddad area of southern Lebanon properly policed.  The Lebanese feel that the UNIFIL forces could do this job if they were given the proper mandate from the United Nations to fulfil their role in the region.  They feel that the UNIFIL forces are the forces that are required in that area and not a multinational force such as has been suggested of the United States and possibly Britain and France.  In recent months we have seen the effects of a multinational incursion by these countries into the area around Beirut.  We have seen that it was not a peace keeping effort and that it created tremendous problems for the people of Beirut and the surrounding areas and exacerbated the problem in that area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the member states of the EC not to get involved in a multinational force.  By doing so they run down the value and efficacy of the UNIFIL forces who have done a tremendous job for many years under tremendous pressure from the Israelis.  The talks which have gone on for the past number of weeks between the Lebanese, the Syrians and the Israelis have been hampered at every step by the Israelis.  They are taking every opportunity to try to break down the talks so that they do not have to withdraw from the southern area of the Lebanon.  The pressure must be kept on by the United Nations and the EC to ensure that they get out of that area and let the Lebanese people rule Lebanon again.  It is the desire of both the Christian and Moslem people of that area that they should withdraw and until such time as true peace can be brought about to the southern area of Lebanon the UNIFIL forces should be brought in.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Iran-Iraq war, the EC must keep the pressure on to ensure that a just solution is brought about in that area.  Iraq has at all times over the past 12 months stated that it will abide by international agreements and that it wants peace.  We must keep the pressure on to ensure that the war does <Col N="195" /> not escalate, that Iran and Iraq will sit around the negotiating table to try to resolve the problems and that in doing so they will create for the areas of the Middle East and indeed for the whole world, a better climate which will take away the threat of a bigger and more widespread war.</P>
    <P>I hope that at the Palestinian National Council Meeting which takes place tomorrow in Amman, Jordan, moderate opinion in the PLO will prevail and that in doing so we may be able to get a negotiating position started in which the Israelis, the PLO and everybody else, but the Palestinians in particular, will be able to resolve the problems.  Israel must talk to the PLO if there is going to be peace in that area, and the PLO will have to recognise &mdash; and I think they do realise &mdash; that Israel is a state.  Even though its origins are highly questionable, it is now a legal entity and it will have to have a reasonable chance of living in peace with its neighbours.  We appeal to everybody concerned to see that progress is made in attempting to get these people to sit down together, the Israelis with the PLO, presumably under the auspices of the United Nations.  In doing so we would have a better chance of peace not only in that area but in the world.</P>
    <P>The situation in Europe has not been of great benefit to us over the past 12 months.  I will not deal with the agricultural part of this document, because that will be taken up by some of my colleagues. In the ten years since we joined the EC we have seen a certain amount of progress, but we are getting fed up with having these reports brought in here year after year and the same language used in every one of them.  There is no progress being made by the so-called brains of the bureaucracy in Europe towards solving our major problem, which is unemployment, towards transferring our technology to the Third World where it is badly needed.  I sincerely hope that when we get the 22nd report from the EC we will be able to stand up here and report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of these three motions together taking note of the developments in the European Communities since January 1984, the report of the Joint Committee on secondary legislation dealing with the application of the milk levy, and the report of the Joint Committee on the accession of Spain and Portugal leaves us quite a wide-ranging area which we can discuss <i>vis-à-vis</i> the attitude of the Senators in this House to the Community and its attitude both to those who hope to accede to the Community and our attitude to the Third World.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs for the wide-ranging introductory speech he made to comply with these motions before the House today.  Senator Lanigan mentioned three points, and before I deal with the report proper I would like to concur with some of the sentiments he expressed.  He felt that this motion allowed people to state their views on the lack of development in the European Community.  It would be inappropriate for me as the leader of my group in the House not to avail of this opportunity to express my concern at the lack of developments, particularly the attitude of the British Premier to all the work that was put into the Forum Report, if that can be taken as a development.  Certainly from our point of view it was a major development within the Community and we would have hoped for a better response and hope that in the future months and years there will be a more positive response in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to his comments on our natural resources, especially our mining resources.  He specifically mentioned Ballingarry which because of its vast wealth of mineral resources could benefit from European assistance to ensure that this country would avail of the benefits that could accrue to our economy if we manage to successfully bring that wealth to the surface and dispose of it.  There is not doubt that what he says in that regard is correct, and I have some knowledge of it.  To this day there are <Col N="197" /> people with a keen interest in the Ballingarry mines and Tipperary anthracite who are trying to persuade people who are willing and capable of putting money into the development of those mines to do so.  We must not be unmindful of the fact that the mining rights are owned by private individuals who are protected constitutionally in this country.  I hope that at some future date during election time politicans will have the courage of their convictions when it comes to the rights of the community and that benefits to the community will override other rights, especially the right to private property.  Where the private sector is not putting its efforts into the benefit of the community the community should have some rights to develop these assets for the benefit of the nation.  I hope that if we fail to attract private funding from outside this country to develop Ballingarry mines the Government will look at the possibility of asking the Community for this.  The Community has a special policy on the development of our energy resources and I hope this aspect will be explored if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also mentioned the Middle East.  He and I had an opportunity recently of discussing this major and tragic problem with politicians from various countries in Europe and from the Arab world.  I agree that there is a desire on all sides out there, possibly with the exception of Israel and Iran, to come to grips with the problem.  I hope that the Community and the Government who hold the Presidency of the Community will strive for further United Nations intervention in the area of the Middle East.  We hope that the major powers like the eastern bloc, the Soviets, and the Americans and other people with vested interests in that area will recognise that the United Nations is the obvious forum that would have international recognition to intervene in a peaceful way in the tragedy of the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Barry, in his wide-ranging speech dealt with many areas of concern.  I will try to be as brief as possible.  I think I am sharing the sentiments <Col N="198" /> of many Senators when I say that the Community today faces a crisis which threatens its own future and the future of its people.  With millions of unemployed people and with regional and social imbalances, uncontained I might say, the prospects for the decades ahead are bleak in the Community unless we make fundamental changes or unless we can influence fundamental changes &mdash; and ensure that they are brought about.  The Community has vast resources but in spite of these vast resources it seems to be unable to fulfil adequately its responsibilities to its own population and to the world at large.</P>
    <P>The general problems of the Community are reflected in Ireland particularly. The present high levels of unemployment were referred to by Senator Lanigan and I agree with him totally.  The EC seems to have failed to come to grips with the problem.  The question of redundancies and the level of poverty in parts of this country are all closely related to the structural issues which have been aggravated by the failure of the Community to introduce or apply effective policies in the areas of regional and social development and our own position being a peripheral one, both geographically and economically, to this crisis.  The people of every member state of the Community desperately need the restoration of hope for their future and for the future of their children.  The social dislocation and the human misery caused by present mass unemployment can no longer be accepted by any democratic process.  The central political priority is that a new prospect of meaningful employment must be offered to old and young alike.  We seem to have concentrated totally in recent years on the problem of unemployed young people.  We must not be unaware of the problem of people who are still capable of working effectively but who, because they are not in the 25 to 30 age group, tend to be forgotten.  They are vital national assets and we must not forget they have a major role to play.</P>
    <P>The Community itself now requires an economic re-launching if there is to be any hope in the future.  Unless there is an immediate and collective response to the <Col N="199" /> central crisis of today, the present appalling level of 12 million people out of work, which possibly could escalate to 20 million by the end of the decade, the Community will fall into further decline in the face of competition from the United States and Japan and other technological super-powers.  Jobs must be created through united and coherent economic action.  The common Community strategy must concentrate upon three main lines of action and they must be launched together and carried forward together.  There must be selective recovery of economic growth through state action in the Community, there must be restructuring of the economies based on technological advances and there must be a redistribution of work as well as wealth. In my opinion, the next decade will be crucial unless a sense of direction is found and a new strategy is implemented that will achieve these objectives.  I hope there will be the political will in Europe to ensure that that takes place.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the international political situation is grave.  The European Community has made a major input in many of these areas.  The arms race, the increase in nuclear arsenals, the conflicts I have mentioned in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Central America, southern Africa, the crisis in Poland, give evidence of the interventions of the super-powers consultation and of continuing threats to peace.  The plight of the Third World, which is the subject of a motion from the Labour Party to conclude this evening is an appalling plight for millions of people, women, men and children, who are all just struggling for their survival and dignity.  The poor nations are plagued by debts.  They are hit by declining world trade and they are shamefully neglected by wealthier populations who are now concerned exclusively with their own problems.  Confronted with all these facts, the Labour Party particularly recognise that progress and hope can only come through strong political leadership at every level within the nations and within the Community.</P>
    <P>We are aware that we need a European <Col N="200" /> Community but not just any European Community.  We must transform the commercial and technocratic Europe into a fraternal Europe of workers and people. I know that our colleagues in the socialist group in Europe are continuing to lead the battle in all the areas in which the European Parliament is competent to deal; I refer to the social areas, to economic, industrial and agricultural policies, to the fight against unemployment, the control of multinational companies, cooperation in the development of the poorer countries and respect for the human rights of the peoples of the world. We need support in extending and intensifying these activities and in making them more effective.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have developed policies along these lines within and outside the Community over a number of years and we do so on three main fundamental principles.  We recognise Ireland's particular problems and needs as a peripheral area and a less developed economy than those of the other member states. We want a critical appraisal of the Community's performance.  We need a commitment to the pursuit of alternatives to existing structures and policies.  We have worked consistently to ensure that there is a full understanding of Ireland's positive neutrality, particularly at a time of wide-ranging debate on the future political directions of the Community.  We in the Labour Party have always believed that the Community's purpose must relate to the fundamental needs of its people in terms of jobs, security and balanced overall development within a democratic and participative framework and to the great challenge of peace, justice and of combating hunger and need.</P>
    <P>The European Community has great natural resources and great traditional strengths of economic organisation and human skills which must be directed to fulfilling its basic purpose.  This has not been the case because unemployment has soared and national and social imbalances have not been offset by meaningful <Col N="201" /> policies.  The institutions in the Community have failed to measure up to the challenge of this difficult era.  We believe that the Community must now advance towards a new phase of development in which the emphasis must be changed from the dictates of purely competitive interests in the pursuit of social goals. With present and likely levels of unemployment and with increasing deep-seated structural difficulties, it is clear that solutions do not lie in the direction of outdated fiscal and monetary policies alone.</P>
    <P>The position of our colleagues in the European Parliament must relate directly to eradication of the fundamental causes of the present crisis which include badly distributed resources and a lack of democratic control of the key centres of the social and economic system.  What is now essential is the emergence at national and transnational levels of a coherent expression of other alternative policies.  The Community desperately needs a new approach in this area.</P>
    <P>We have adapted reasonably well to our membership of the Community.  Our experience has been mixed.  It is true there has been a necessary realignment of attitudes in all sections in the economy in the direction of an acceptance of wider opportunity and involvement.  Industrial efficiency has been ruthlessly forced on many firms.  In Ireland this has been particularly true since our accession and because of lack of protection for our industries, we have lost many of our native industries.  At the same time the total failure of the Community's policies in the critical area of regional development and employment has resulted in much hardship and sectoral infrastructural collapse. An official unemployment rate in excess of 16 per cent of the workforce in the Community is a poor advertisement.</P>
    <P>The Community is officially committed to the elimination of regional imbalance and inequality but with those kind of statistics I do not think we can sit in the Seanad today and say that it has done magnificent work.  With the kind of unemployment rates available to us and the present structures in the Community, <Col N="202" /> there is no doubt it has failed economically to alter the course of the poorer nations in the Community.</P>
    <P>Unemployment, not alone in the Community but in Ireland, threatens the very basis of our society but although the Community has not sufficiently offset the effect of some of these policies we still look to it.  It is obvious that we are unable for whatever reason to settle our unemployment problems on our own.  We can only depend on our Community partners through schemes and employment policies developed at Community level to try to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>Industry has been largely restructured with an emphasis on the new technologies. Whereas Ireland has benefited to some extent in this area, it does not compensate for the large loss of employment in other industries, particularly native industries.  While our development in technological areas has contributed to our overall economy, it has resulted in massive escalation of job losses and social dislocation, particularly in the area of food processing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, dealt with agriculture. There is some controversy about the application of the milk levy and it is appropriate at this time to comment on that.  There is some doubt in people's minds as to how the application of the milk levy will affect the Irish producer. A document from the Department on 31 March 1984 stated that where Italy and Luxembourg will get quotas above their 1983 level, Ireland will get a 1983 production level plus 4.63 per cent and for future years the quantities will be reviewed annually with Ireland having priority in regard to increases.</P>
    <P>For some unknown reason &mdash; I have not yet seen the terms of the agreement that was reached in Europe &mdash; I understand that it was based on production figures and not on estimated production figures which, of course, the Minister could only use at negotiations because at that time we were only estimating what would be our total production.  To be penalised by the Community as a whole for estimating production, to word the <Col N="203" /> communique to say that we were entitled to 4.63 per cent on our 1983 level of production and to be penalised for the difference would be most unfair.  It would cause widespread problems in the dairying industry in this country.  I hope the Minister when replying to this debate will confirm what efforts he is making to ensure that the original agreement is adhered to.</P>
    <P>The previous Bill was a technical one which allowed us to put in additional funds to overcome the problems that have arisen.  We have always played according to the rules.  Senator Smith referred to a previous contribution of mine.  I agree in a way that we have always been too good a European country and have never fought our case on the basis of our national interest.  Our experience of other countries in this connection should be a lesson to us from now on.  It is obvious that if we want to get something we will have to go in there with the gloves off.</P>
    <P>Our future in the Community will be under threat in the next decade unless recognition is taken of our very special place, particularly in the area of agriculture. There have been some benefits but in reality they were superficial.  We have had enhanced market outlets and some financial gains.  For one period I suppose the financial gains could be termed to be huge in comparison with anything the agricultural community had faced before that.  Taking the overall actual earning capability of the farming community over the three or four years towards the end of the seventies, it was just as well there was a European Community to help them to top up their income; otherwise, most of those engaged in agriculture would be out of business.  All of us recognise the importance of agriculture to our economy and anything we can gain from membership of the Community particularly in the area of agriculture will be welcome.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that more is not being done in the development of our processing sector when we look at the amount of agricultural imports much of <Col N="204" /> which could be produced by the agricultural sector at home.  There will be a Bill before the House soon about potato marketing, and that is a step in the right direction.  We cannot over-emphasise the importance to the housewife of home produced horticulture, of packaging, processing and presentation.  If that can be done efficiently there is no doubt in my mind we can balance in some way many of our food imports.</P>
    <P>On regional and social policies, the benefits have been very small but admittedly they have been significant.  They have contributed to our infrastructure and to some of our social programmes. There has been, however, an inherent lack of regional and social balance in the Community and this is reflected in Ireland.  We have fallen further behind the other developed areas since 1973 particularly because of our peripheral location. Our adherence to the EMS in 1980 was not paralleled by any correct domestic policies in regard to inflation or interest rates.  They moved out of line with the rest of the Community, and compensatory elements that were in the EMS package have been seriously inadequate for Ireland's needs.  Although most people at the time felt that it was the correct thing to do, because Britain refused to enter the EMS there is no doubt there have been disadvantages for this country with the break of the link with sterling.  Progress in the promised development of new policies in the Community for consumers, for the environment, for social advancement, for industry and energy, to name but a few areas, has been very slow, entirely due to the lack of political will in Europe.  I call on our Members of the European Parliament &mdash; unfortunately my party are not represented at that level now, although we have many colleagues in the Socialist group &mdash; to use all their power within the next five years to ensure that there is a political will on the part of Irish Members to have a proper development of these new policies to deal with our infrastructure, industry and our social needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> Our own integration into the Community has offset the country's traditional relationship with the United Kingdom.  Ireland has achieved a genuinely independent status in the Community and in all its institutions.</P>
    <P>The subject of neutrality was also touched on by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In the considered context of our neutrality we seem to be under constant pressure nowadays within the Community and at times we seem to be dominated by the major NATO countries, including the nuclear powers.  Membership of the EC has concentrated attention on the meaning and practice of our neutrality in a new and significant manner, particularly in the process of European Political Co-operation.  The Labour Party regard our neutrality as fundamental to their policy stance in all matters of international relations, including our membership of the European Community. Our neutrality must not be compromised.</P>
    <P>Our view of neutrality is of a positive philosophy of political action for justice, peace and progress in the world, and this has been clearly set out in a number of policy statements from the Labour Party over recent years.  It is the position of our party that the largely pragmatic basis of our neutrality should be strengthened by a firm acceptance of a non-aligned position in world politics and the refusal to contemplate involvement in any form of military alliance.  Above all, there can be no question of Ireland becoming aligned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or any military organisation.  Neutrality should include a whole range of approaches to the main issue of international politics.  In particular, it means that there must be a total commitment to the pursuit of <i>détente</i> and world peace, a rejection of any form of involvement in the sordid armaments trade which has brought so much misery to the world for the sake of financial progress and a positive contribution to the necessary process of world development.  Only a country which is clearly seen to be independent of the entanglements of military alliances can play an acceptable role in the struggle for a new international economic <Col N="206" /> order.  This has been stated and has been confirmed by all our colleagues in Europe.  Our particular neutral situation has been accepted even by our colleagues who are members of NATO.</P>
    <P>There must be a major attack on mass unemployment, and it must concentrate on the lines indicated in the introduction to &ldquo;Relaunching and Restructuring of the European Economies and the Distribution of Work and Wealth&rdquo;.  It is important to remember that there are people in Europe as well as profits.  Within this growth for potential, there must be room for Ireland's case.</P>
    <P>It is important for us that there be a defined regional policy and an industrial policy that will deal with all the problems of our under-developed country.  It is only in the area of the development of regional infrastructure that foreign industry can be coaxed to come here to set up industries to create jobs, whether it be in the food processing area or in the area of technology.</P>
    <P>Although the CAP is a fundamental policy of the European Community, the only policy that it has, we recognise that its reform is essential.  The fundamental principles of the CAP which are contained in the Treaty of Accession must be recognised. We must also recognise that there are current problems that must be solved, such as the super-levy.  We must also take into account the development status and the potential of member states.  The principle of Community preference must be respected.  This was dealt with by Senator Smith when he mentioned the import of cereals and other commodities.  If the Community showed a preference to its own producers that there would not be such distortions of the MCAs and, therefore, we would not have the problem of cereal substitutes, New Zealand butter and all the other problems which create problems for us as a major producer of these commodities.</P>
    <P>The CAP has a special role to play in the area of food because what is lacking is a comprehensive Community food policy.  We should have that policy if we are to strengthen and advance the labour intensive food processing sector.  There <Col N="207" /> must be a balanced agricultural and food sector development programme which would enhance employment and add value throughout the country and all the rural areas of the Community.  Whereas membership of the Community was welcomed by the vast majority of the people, those of us who opposed it did so on the basis of the terms of accession.  As socialists we are basically European and can work in close conjunction with our colleagues in Europe.  Although we fundamentally disagreed with some of the terms of accession because of the strain put on our industrial policy, having achieved terms it is a pity that the stronger nations in Europe now use their cheque books to alter the terms of their contribution to the Community budget.  This has created the problem which all of us are faced with and particularly for Ireland who hold the Presidency of the EC.</P>
    <P>The accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Communities is another problem facing us.  We welcome their assession to the European Communities. We welcome them too, because they have socialist governments in power.  The larger the Community the more power it can wield in world affairs and the more influence it can make either on the Eastern bloc nations or on the American nation.  It is important to have Europe united.  In the accession of these two additional countries &mdash; particular in regard to Spain, and Senator Lanigan referred to this &mdash; it is of paramount importance for us to ensure that the terms agreed on Spanish accession will take into account our special position in regard to the protection of our fisheries.  Nobody is in any doubt about the problem that could be created if our fishing waters were open to all and sundry and particularly to our colleagues in Spain.  We have evidence in recent times of the disastrous consequences that could have on our fishing stocks.  It is imperative that this particular aspect of the accession of Spain be dealt with in a manner which will take into account the special position of our mariculture and our fishing industry.  Ireland would be failing in its duty, holding the <Col N="208" /> Presidency of the European Community, not to make this point adequately known to our colleagues in Spain, welcome as they are in the Community.  By the end of 1986 &mdash; which is the Minister's deadline for accession &mdash; I should hope that these problems will be sorted out but it is important that we set them down as problems.</P>
    <P>In the past we have played a major role as a member of the Community.  We have made a major contribution, we have a neutral voice there which is welcome in Europe and we are a developing nation which should be welcomed in Europe. From our past performance we have, if anything, been gentlemen in Europe. The time is coming when we have to be tougher if our national interests are to be protected.  That does not make us bad Europeans.  If Mrs. Thatcher can dictate the policy to suit her own membership of the European Community and remain outside the EMS &mdash; which is abhorred by most other member states &mdash; then we should be tougher in our attitude for the protection of our national interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in this debate.  First of all I would like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the very extensive review that he has presented to this House of the European situation.</P>
      <P>Looking back on our years of membership of the EC one would find it hard to judge whether we have benefited or not because there are so many problems at present, both here in our own country and throughout Europe.  We have millions of people unemployed throughout Europe and here at home in our own country in spite of all the grants and all the incentives that have been paid over the years we have in the region at present of 215,000 or 216,000 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look back to the early seventies when we entered the EC we entered with great hope because we felt that for the first time Ireland was breaking away from the traditional market of Britain and that we were getting entry into an expanded market of something in the region of 250 <Col N="209" /> million people.  Naturally, because we were starting from a very low base, particularly the farmers who were starting from a very low base, indeed we did benefit during those years.  But in recent times we have seen a great change in the European scene.  We have the mountains of butter and dairy products of all kinds built up.  We have seen the mountains of beef built up and now we are witnessing the lakes of wine.  It says very little for the European system that this should be allowed to happen particularly at a time when so many millions on the other side of the world are dying of starvation. During the week this has been brought home to us very forcefully.  The EC at present should be doing more to eliminate the hardships that those living in the Third World are faced with.  They should be making greater efforts to get rid of those butter mountains and those sugar and beef mountains that are costing so much in storage around Europe.  I cannot understand why some system could not be devised that would help to eliminate that problem and bring relief to the starving millions in Ethiopia and the other African countries.  I hope that we will use our Presidency of the EC to ensure that some positive contribution is made towards eliminating the problems which those people are faced with.  They cannot hope to eliminate those problems on their own.  Seeing that we have such vast quantities of surplus food stored up, it is only right that it should be distributed to those people and save them from the horrible death that has been staring them in the face now for some time.</P>
    <P>It has been stressed here tonight that we have been good Europeans.  Indeed we have.  Right from the very beginning we have tried to stick by the rules and play the game fairly.  But the time has come when we have to take off the kid gloves and go in there fighting and think more of our national interest than perhaps we have done in the past.  We now have serious problems here at home.  Our counterparts in the EC are not going to solve those problems for us unless we go in there and highlight those problems and make sure that we get our share of the <Col N="210" /> cake when it is being divided.  We have a situation in farming where you have great uncertainty because of the levies that have been imposed here at home and in Europe.  We have fought the case of the super-levy in this House and in the other House and indeed in every hall and at every crossroads throughout rural Ireland. We have tried to highlight the dangers to our dairy industry of this levy at all times.  Indeed, we have given every support we possibly could to our Ministers and to the Government in their efforts at fighting this levy.</P>
    <P>We were told at that time that the effect of the levy would not be so serious. But everybody now agrees &mdash; and indeed you do not have to be a dairy farmer to understand it &mdash; that the effects of this levy are going to be disastrous for our dairy industry.  Farmers over the years have had their herds built up.  They have provided themselves with facilities for milking and so on.  They have built cowbyres, milking parlours and so on.  In the past few weeks many of those farmers were told that they had supplied their quota and that they would have to get out of milk.  That is the stark message that is being dictated to those farmers at present.  I have seen some of my neighbours, people who have had themselves organised for dairying over the years, having to go out in the past few weeks to purchase calves in order to use up the surplus milk that they now find that they have on hands.  Those people are not organised for feeding calves at this stage: they are organised for dairying; they are organised for the supply of milk.  It is very unfortunate that they now have to get out of the industry that they found themselves organised for and go into something else.</P>
    <P>I shudder to think of what is going to happen next spring particularly when western farmers try to buy calves from the south.  They will have to pay a very high price for those calves.  If so many more people start rearing calves are we going to find ourselves in a situation next November or October where there is going to be a surplus and where there is <Col N="211" /> going to be a very poor price for those animals?</P>
    <P>We have the same situation in beet.  I see farmers who have grown beet and who have been encouraged to grow beet to keep the Tuam sugar factory open. They now find that they are only going to be paid £5 per tonne for some of the beet that they have produced.  Many of those farmers have rented land in order to grow that beet.  Now they find that they are going to be paid £5 per tonne on anything over a certain quota.  That is very discouraging.  That is something to which our Minister should apply his talents in Europe.  That is where the fight for the levies will be made.  I know it was a good year for beet.  It was a good year for potatoes too.  We have the same situation in potatoes where they are being sold at the moment for about £50 or £60 per ton.  But the Minister and the Government should learn from the experience of this year.  They can see now how detrimental the application of those levies can be to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>We are being told that next year a levy will be imposed on producers of grain. Where can farmers go?  We all talk about encouraging young people into agriculture, but any young farmer who has been reading the papers or listening to the news for the past few weeks certainly would not be encouraged to go into agriculture. Nobody can tell him at this time what is the best line of agriculture to go on.  We have the EC telling us to get out of dairying.  Levies and quotas are being applied in the production of sugar beet. Next year they will apply to the production of barley and other cereals.  I do not know where our young farmers are going to face.  More and more people are leaving agriculture.  This would be all right if there were jobs in industry or in the public service for them.  But, unfortunately, that is not the situation.  Those young people have to rely only on the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>When our Ministers go to Europe to negotiate they should bear these facts in mind.  Far too much time has been spent on the fight over the British contribution. Each summit meeting for the last two or <Col N="212" /> three years has been held up fighting over the British refund.  A lot of time has been wasted, and I hope for all our sakes that that problem is now over and done with and that the heads of state can get down to tackling the serious economic problems now facing the Community.  I hope that our Government and our Ministers will be alive to the problems we have to face here at home.  Even though we want to apply the rules and remain within the regulations we must be conscious at all times of our own problems at home.  The protection of our national interest should be of paramount importance at all those negotiations.</P>
    <P>Today, in a Bill of this House, we provided additional moneys for payment to the European Community.  I suppose we are one of the first to do this.  We all appreciate that the European Community cannot function unless adequate money is provided for it.  There are lots of demands on the funds under the Common Agricultural Policy, the social schemes and so on.  We will play our part, and the legislation we have put through this House today is an indication of our desire to help in providing the money so that the schemes that are so necessary for the young people of Europe can be implemented.  I hope that the problems confronting Europe at present can be resolved.  I hope our Government can tackle the serious unemployment situation that exists at present.</P>
    <P>Many of our young people are convinced that there is no hope for them in the present set-up.  There is no sign of the jobs we all hoped would be there for them, and they are becoming disillusioned.  It is sad to see that at present approximately 10,000 or more young people have been leaving our shores in search of employment in other countries.  Many have gone to Saudi Arabia, America and any place they foresee a future.  We should be striving to employ those young people.  They have cost the State quite a considerable amount of money in education up to this. It is up to us as legislators and our counterparts in Europe to try to help them to get the jobs they are entitled to in their own countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> I will finish with those few remarks, and I hope that our Ministers will bear our national problems in mind when they are negotiating in Europe.  I hope that over the next couple of years we will see some impact being made on the serious problem of quotas, subsidies and levies and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak on item No. 6 on the Order Paper which is a very important item.  I am sure that discussions arising from this report relating especially to the enlargement of the EC will have serious implications for the Irish fishing industry.  There is no question whatsoever but that the entry of Spain will be very damaging to Irish fishing.  When we joined the EC the prospect was held out that substantial benefits would be available to Irish fishermen.  The Common Fisheries Policy was expected to give markets and guaranteed prices for fish which would ensure survival and further development of the fishing industry.  It took the Common Market six years to reach agreement, and after it all fish prices have fallen and costs have increased out of all proportion.  Fuel, fishing, fishing gear, vessels, wages and other expenses are so high that the result in many cases is that people in the fishing industry are worse off now than they were when Ireland joined the EC.  Many have been forced out of the business.</P>
      <P>The enlargement of the Community now being proposed cannot be helpful when we bear in mind that the Spanish fleet will be 70 per cent of the Common Market fleet when Spain and Portugal join.  I do not know if people realise the size of the Spanish fleet, and I hope the Government and especially those negotiating on behalf of Ireland will bear in mind the enormity of the Spanish fleet and the threat it holds for Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Spanish fleet consists of 17,500 vessels representing 750,000 gross registered tonnes and 110,000 fishermen. They operate mainly off the north-west coast of Spain and across the west coast of Ireland, nearly into Castletownbere.  One need only look at the number of Spanish boats that have been brought in here for <Col N="214" /> illegal fishing over the past number of years to see how dangerous it will be to Irish fishing when these two countries gain access to the European Community. There is a lot of illegal fishing and the Irish navy have been stretched to the limit to control it.</P>
    <P>In 1983 nearly £2 million in fines was collected for breaches of fishing laws, and the Spaniards were the greatest culprits as far as illegal fishing was concerned. There is no hope of controlling the Spanish fleet, and I am sure the Government and the Minister responsible realise this. The accession of these countries to the EC will not improve our export market of fish.  While I realise that the consumption of fish in Spain is the largest <i>per capita</i> fish consumption in Europe &mdash; £40 annually as against £12 in Ireland &mdash; total fish landings in Spain for 1983 were 1.1 million tonnes against Irish landings of 200,000 tonnes.  Spain imports 27,000 tonnes of fish per year and exports about 200,000.  The markets in Spain are tied up in previous agreements and Ireland will have no prospect of exporting fish to the British market.  There will be no gain for Ireland with Spain's access to the Common Market as far as the fishing industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>What are the Irish Government doing for the fishing industry?  There was a rescue package promised some months ago for the Irish need; it has not materialised. Where is it?  Is it held up by the Department of Finance?  Will there be less money for development with the entry of these two countries to the EEC as money for development is likely to be shared with the inevitable result of a decrease in the money which would be available to the Common Fisheries Policies for the development of the Irish fishing industry?  Where is the Government White Paper which was promised some time back?  The Irish Fishermen's Organisation are disappointed with the way the Government and the Minister are treating the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the Minister the Irish Fishermen's Organisation pointed out that they could see no merit in the EC Commission proposals and are of the <Col N="215" /> opinion that they are mainly intended to boost the Commission's own power and glory.  In addition, all the advantages were with the Spaniards.  The proposals are for nothing from the point of view of the Irish fishing industry.  It was again pointed out to the Minister that all the North Sea species have been blocked off through the operation of total allowable catches and quotas and that a similar situation could be brought about off the Irish coast.  With regard to all species which have not been traditionally fished by any country a total allowable catch in a quota system should benefit Ireland in that its location and economic requirements could give it a major share of the stocks concerned.  The IFO delegation argued that the Irish are net losers in fishing matters all down the years, and it appeared clear that the main consideration in Government thinking was to gain a net advantage in national terms if it meant sacrificing some sectors.  In the Chairman's report at a meeting of 21 September 1984 he said the proposals already put forward by the IFO are for the best basis so far for a solution to the problem.  The proposals were originally put to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy O'Toole, on 1 May last, but no indication of his attitude had since being received.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter and something that should be treated with more urgency by the Minister responsible for our fishing industry.  There was reference to the Spanish accession in the same report.  It said:</P>
    <P>There has been a response to our request to meet the Minister for Fisheries but so far not from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss the Government policy towards Spanish and Portuguese accession.</P>
    <P>The present needs of the Irish fishing industry were emphasised at both the emergency general meetings and total opposition was expressed to any vessels from these countries being allowed fish inside EC limits.  Yet despite the magnitude of this issue, there is total lack of <Col N="216" /> information regarding Government and EC policies in the accession negotiations. I appeal to the Minister of State who is responsible for fisheries and forestry to meet the people who are concerned about the fishing industry and let them know the position and provide them with the information.  They are entitled to that and should get it.</P>
    <P>Being in the rural area and fairly familiar with the farming community I would also like to refer to the super-levy which is the matter for discussion on item No. 5.  There is a lot of confusion among farmers. They do not know whether they should produce more milk or whether they should stop milk production at the present time.  Letters are being received from the co-ops by farmers telling them how much they have gone over their quota.  It is very late to be telling them now.  The greatest blunder of all time was the furnishing of the wrong amount of milk, 58,000 tonnes, that we produced in 1983.  I quote from the report of the Joint Committee:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it urges the Government and in particular the Minister for Agriculture to pursue corrective measures with all means at his disposal including reports to the European Court of Justice to indicate Ireland's claim to a quota based on the actual 1983 milk deliveries.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are very disappointed, and especially dairy farmers, that such a mistake should be made, and what puzzles them entirely is that no one seems to know who is responsible for the mistake, whether it is the Minister or the Department or the Central Statistics Office and they seem to be getting away without any reprimand at all.  Such action is giving a licence for other mistakes to be made which could be as serious and may be more serious than this which is going to cost this country up to £50 million over the five-year course if it cannot be corrected.  I also read in the report, page 19, that a specific reference quantity may be granted to young farmers setting up after 31 December 1980.  This is something that should be made clear, and I <Col N="217" /> think it is something that should be made more public and more information should be available to give these young farmers encouragement in farming.</P>
    <P>Our quota was based on the 1983 supply of milk.  Articles 3, 4 and 5 relate to the provision for dealing with certain categories who are designated special cases and are therefore eligible for special consideration in the allocation of individual quotas if their 1983 supply was less than that of 1981 or 1982.  The report says that arrangements for these cases are at present being finalised in consultation with the farming and co-operative organisations. I know cases where because of the very bad weather experienced in April, May and June of 1983 the actual 1983 quotas are less than those of 1982. I would like to see these arrangements being finalised so that the farmers concerned would know of them and would not be over penalised.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are also asking me about the cessation premium.  This is something that farmers would like to know, the conditions and what grants they will get if they cease milk production.  Our forestries are in production and thinning operations are being carried out but our export market seems to be actually nil. This is a worrying factor especially for employment.  I should like an export market to be developed so that we can continue our forestry programme and ensure further employment in that area and also the usage of our waste land which is suitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by endorsing what the previous speakers said, especially Senator Ferris, that it is time to take off the kid gloves; our gentlemanly approach has gained us nothing.  We will have to fight hard and ensure that we get our rights in any EC negotiations.</P>

    <Title>Aid for Developing Countries: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the need for an aid programme directed towards developing countries that excludes military aid for oppressive regimes as a principle and that has no structural disadvantages for aid-receiving countries and asks the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advance this view as part of an integrated foreign policy at home, in the European Community and at the United Nations and further calls for a full report on the Irish and European Community's response to the food problems and famine in several African countries.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator M. Higgins).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to support the motion tabled by the Labour Members and to avail of the opportunity to discuss in this House one of the most important and urgent problems facing the entire world and not just this country.  I want to remind the House that this motion although it is being discussed against the backdrop of the food crisis in Africa, and that will form part of my contribution as it has of the contribution of other speakers, is one <Col N="219" /> which calls for a thought through policy on development aid.  It notes the need for an aid programme which is particularly geared towards the needs and the aspirations of developing countries and which recognises the role that Ireland can play, both as a sovereign country and also within the European Community and the United Nations.  It calls specifically for an aid programme of a structured nature which will not have any built in structural disadvantages for aid receiving countries and which will not have any built in component of military aid for oppressive regimes, that this would be a principle of it.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise these aspects of the motion because we are discussing it against the backdrop of the public awareness of the effect on men and women and particularly on children of the very severe drought and famine in Africa.  As other Members of the House and indeed Sena-for Michael D. Higgins in proposing this motion emphasised, this is not an instant or a new problem.  This is something that those working in those countries have been warning about.  We, as Members of both Houses, receive regular bulletins from Trócaire and other agencies on North/South issues.  I have one here for June 1984 specifically on Africa's food crisis, specifically spelling out to us the short-term and long-term causes of the particular drought in Africa and the food crisis that has emerged and that we are aware of in our sitting rooms through television and which has provoked such a reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to focus at this stage on that reaction.  There is no doubt that the imagination of every man, woman and child in this country has been gripped by the severity of the famine and the deaths and the deprivation of the situation in Africa. There is not a school, a resident's association, a tenants' association or women's group that is not doing something for &ldquo;Ethiopia&rdquo; or, more broadly, for Africa. That is a very generous, emotional response.  Of itself it is important as a very short-term reaction but it could fizzle out very quickly.  Memories are short.  The media do not keep on covering issues <Col N="220" /> which have already been given full media coverage.  The media as a whole does not regard dire poverty as being a media event in itself.  We have enough poverty in this country that goes unnoted, and that is not a matter that captures the attention either of the media or indeed of politicians.  This is a short-term response.  It is one which we must seek to harness and seek to structure more than has happened before.  What has happened, and it is extremely important, is that the attention of the public &mdash; every man, woman and child &mdash; has been captured. There is an audience now for the need for a different and much more accelerated and extensive approach to a development policy and to aid programmes which are based on a well thought out and well structured development policy. In that regard I would like to turn to the conclusion of the report of the Brandt Commission.  That report was discussed and debated in this House when it was published, and it was recognised as being a landmark in the sense of drawing attention through the composition of the Brandt Commission and perhaps also through the personality of Willy Brandt, the chairman of the Commission, to the urgency of addressing this area.  The report concluded with these words:</P>
    <P>Whatever their differences and however profound, there is a mutuality of interest between North and South.  The fate of both is intimately connected. The search for solutions is not an act of benevolence but a condition of mutual survival.  We believe it is dramatically urgent today to start taking concrete steps without which the world situation can only deteriorate still further, even leading to conflict and catastrophe.  It is in a spirit of concern but also of hope that we have formulated the proposals contained in this report.</P>
    <P>There was that phrase, which was emphasised, coming from the Brandt Commission at the time of the mutuality of interest between North and South, of the linkage between the developed world and the needs and aspirations and the condition of developing countries but it is <Col N="221" /> something which somehow has been dodged or evaded or laid aside in subsequent discussions where the North-South dialogue has taken place.  There is an unwillingness by the North, by those of us who are part of the developed world and in this context, Ireland is privileged and fortunate enough to be part of the developed world &mdash; there is a reluctance to see that linkage, to understand that mutuality of interest and in particular, to come to terms with the extent to which we, in the developed world, if we accept accountability for our actions, in many areas worsen the situation in developing countries.  We aggravate their problems. We lessen their capacity to address the very real economic and social problem which they have.  This is something which must be faced up to and must be faced honestly in seeking to develop an aid programme and a development policy which will achieve the kind of justice and fairness and better balance in the economic resources of the world to which we aspire when Members of this House speak on this subject.</P>
    <P>Having put the situation in that way, I have to ask how exactly do the developed countries have a harmful effect on the economies of developing countries.  One basic way in which we can and in many ways do this is by halting or slowing up their process of industrialisation or their process of developing their basic industries, of adding any value to those industries, for example, in food processing or in any other sector, by restricting the exports they can send to the developed world.  That is why it is important in this motion that we draw attention to Ireland's responsibilities within the European Community and in a broader context to open up this dialogue, to take very seriously the difficulties that are created by the restrictions on trade for the under-developed and developing economies.  It makes sense.  It is not a complicated point.  There are really two main ways in which underdeveloped economies can start to industrialise.  The first is to begin processing at home either the agricultural or, if the country is fortunate enough, the mineral commodities, which at present <Col N="222" /> are exported in an unprocessed state. There is no value added.  The country does not benefit as much.  The value is added later by the developed countries. This does not help the usually very substantially growing population needs of the underdeveloped country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the approach that could be adopted is to start some manufacturing activities which are related to the particular country, for example, textile production. That happens to be one of the areas where developing countries seek to establish a manufacturing base and use that to penetrate the other countries.  Of course, their labour is cheaper, and indeed the women provide a very substantial proportion of that cheap labour, but nonetheless it is an attempt to build up their economic base.  Yet we, as the European Community, have a very sophisticated system of trade barriers which we employ against imports from developing countries. There are some chinks in it but still it is one of the difficulties which these countries face.</P>
    <P>The developed world has sympathy for developing countries particularly when we see on television the pictures of dying children and dessicated human beings reduced to that level of poverty, deprivation and human suffering.  Of course we have sympathy, but how does that affect our lifestyle, our deployment of resources, the world's deployment of resources? Is it not a shocking fact of life from which we cannot run away that the resources of the world are so inequitably distributed and so unfairly at the disposal of the developed world?  We have what can only be described as a decadence that has to be approached and criticised in a very fundamental way.  We have problems of milk super-levies arising from milk mountains in a European Community context.  We have before this House today a report of the potential impact on this country of a super-levy being imposed by the European Community to penalise a higher rate of production of milk. That is a very real problem, and the impact on dairy farmers and on particular regions of Ireland is not be be underestimated. <Col N="223" /> All these problems have to be fully appreciated, and it is necessary to acknowledge them in their fullness, because they, nonetheless, have to be viewed within the mutuality of relations on which the Brandt Report laid emphasis and on which, I hope, in our debate on this motion we will also lay emphasis.</P>
    <P>That is one kind of relationship, the economic relationship with developing countries.  Another relationship referred to in this motion is the shoring up of oppressive regimes, the willingness of the developed world to turn a blind eye not on individualised acts of oppression but on a continuous and sustained oppression against whole sectors of a population.  We had an opportunity to debate the United States approach to Central America and to a number of countries there in the context of the proposal to enable President Reagan to address the two Houses of the Oireachtas last June, and many of us were able, at that stage, to query some of the values and some of the basic assumptions in the approach to countries, particularly in Central America and the Philippines.  But this is another aspect, the enormous profits which are made by providing military armaments and equipment to developing countries, the shoring up of oppressive regimes through the provision of military aid.  This is something which we must face up to and take a very clear policy stand on here in Ireland in developing our approach, which will then determine what kind of aid programme we will be embarking on.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is difficult, in the 15 minutes allocated, to try to reach a rounded and comprehensive position. Basically, I was very pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, when he contributed to this debate, made it clear that there will be a very full opportunity in this House to discuss the Government approach to development policy. The importance of this is that we have a very conscious Irish public now, helped <Col N="224" /> by the involvement of many volunteers from Ireland in various development agencies and bodies such as Comhlamh which organise series of lectures during the winter and fora for discussion of these issues.  We have now a very aware, sympathetic and basically generous public opinion, but we lack a fully thought through coherent structure on our development policy and we also lack a cutting edge on it.  In the context of the EC. Ireland should be getting a name for itself in the context of the EC's policy towards developing countries.  We should be very difficult, we should be demanding of the EC a very different kind of approach. Therefore, that is why I would hope that we will have a further opportunity to discuss this in the context of a Government motion when we will not be so constrained for time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I have to say will be repetition of what other Senators have said before me.  This motion is indeed very timely, because the real horror of what is happening in the Third World countries has been brought home to us on our television screens and indeed in our newspapers in recent times and the response of the Irish people to that horror has been nothing short of magnificent.  I am referring to all the agencies and to the Government as well who have done everything possible to relieve the situation in Ethiopia.  It shows the innate Christianity and humanity that is in the Irish people.  Having said that, it is important that people should have their minds directed towards the underlying problem, not towards the symptom which is what we are seeing at the moment.  The problem is the problem of the difference between rich and poor which is with us in our own country and in other countries but which is at its starkest in the difference between North and South, between the developed world and the under-developed world.  I will quote from an article by Fr. Martin Tierney in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently, and we ought to be very much aware of this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a myth abroad that aid is a <Col N="225" /> way of helping to lift Africa out of its poverty.  Not true.  Aid, in particular food aid, is about keeping people alive for the present.</P>
    <P>That is the real message we are getting at the moment.  We are only, in a way, putting our finger in the dyke, because what we are doing is pouring water into a bucket which has a hole in it.  We are not coping with the problem, and famine and poverty and deprivation will continue and worsen in Africa unless something is done to help these countries to develop and to be able to help themselves.</P>
    <P>In the seventies the commission chaired by Brandt and the Brandt report made it clear that unless something was done to help the developing countries the consequences would be that poverty and deprivation would get worse in the Third World and that, not even from a humanitarian or Christian point of view but from a self-interest point of view it is important we should help these developing countries. Of course, when these pictures which we see on television disappear and when the papers begin to talk about other matters, the tendency is for people to forget about the problem of Africa until the next famine comes along.  This is the problem, because it is not an urgent matter which affects us in our daily lives and therefore people tend not to feel that they have to put pressure on the Government to increase their aid to Third World countries.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency in the past to think that we have to look after our own problems first and then think about other people.  There are a number of facts which people should be aware of and be made aware of at present.  One of the facts is that there is the disparity between the developing countries and the developed countries.  If you draw a line across the 35th degree you will find that above that line 30 per cent of the world's population lives.  They own 88 per cent of the world's wealth.  Ninety-eight per cent of that 30 per cent are literate.  There is one doctor for every 900 people.  The Northern world is responsible for 87 per cent of the world's energy consumption, <Col N="226" /> 91 per cent of all exports, 85 per cent of all armament production and 82 per cent of the world's general production.  That is the developed countries.  Below the line, where the poverty exists, there are 70 per cent of the world's population. They own 12 per cent of the world's wealth, 30 per cent of them are literate, there is one doctor for every 17,000 people.  Only 40 per cent have access to safe drinking water.  The southern world is responsible for 13 per cent of total energy consumption, 9 per cent of all exports, and 15 per cent of armament production, 18 per cent of general world production.  Thirty per cent of the world's population is living at the expense and because of the exploitation of 70 per cent of the world's population.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other factors to which I would like to bring your attention. First of all, there is the fable that world hunger happened because of things that are beyond the control of the world, things like climate and because people in the Third World are not quite as intelligent and are not able to help themselves. The fact is that people go to bed hungry in the Third World because of the inaction of the governments in the developed world.  World hunger is caused by social injustice and social inequality, it is not something that happens by chance, it is caused by exploitation because in the developing countries cash crops are the important thing, they are important because it is a cheap source of food for the developed countries.  So that the rich can get richer and the poor have to be exploited even further.  It is not a case of something that cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>The problem of hunger in the Third World can be resolved.  It can be resolved by a gunuine commitment by the other countries in the world, particularly the super-powers, to stop spending billions of dollars on arms, to stop exploiting these countries as a cheap source of food and to ensure that the proposals of the Brandt commission are adhered to and that 1 per cent of gross national product in every country is given to development in the Third World so that we need never again see the scenes we have seen in <Col N="227" /> recent times on our television screens.  It is an indictment of all of us.  It is an indictment of the super-powers but we need not really blame the super-powers if we are not prepared ourselves to put the pressure on.  That pressure can be put on by neutral countries such as Ireland. We can insist, we can make noises, we can insist that our Government and our Government in turn can insist in the UN and where it has influence that other governments should meet that necessary commitment to help development in the Third World and to help to prevent the atrocious conditions that human beings, 70 per cent of the world's population, are forced to live in.  That is something to which our Government should give priority, and the people of Ireland should not forget about the Third World when it is less in the public eye than it is at present.  Now is the time for people to commit themselves to pressurising their politicians and, in turn the Government to act and to continue to act in order to ensure that social justice is available in Third World countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to add my voice to the debate on this important motion.  Not often enough do we have an opportunity in this House to raise issues of development co-operation which concern largely only a few Senators who are usually vocal on this topic.  I am very pleased that in common with the heightening awareness outside in the community more people than would normally contribute on debates of this kind have been adding their voices, and their feeling has been one of passion and conviction.  I welcome the increased numbers who have taken part in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are considering this against a background of the most tragic dimensions. The flickering images which we see on our television screens have touched the heart of every person in Ireland.  The public response to the tragedy in Ethiopia has been fantastic.  We can all be proud of the unbelievably generous response of the Irish people.  To date something in the region of £4½ million has poured forth <Col N="228" /> from a public whose hearts have been touched by what they have seen.  We have a folk memory in Ireland of famine.  That too must help in our willingness to respond to a tragedy of such vast dimensions in Sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>The motion before us is a complex one. It is a composite motion.  It is extremely difficult to tease out its different elements and to do justice to each of the sections in the motion.  I would particularly like to deal with the food problem in Africa. That is the topical one.  It is the one which concerns the vast majority of people.  Aid is one thing, as Senator Rodgers has said. It is necessary and proper and correct that food aid in the face of the appalling dilemma in Africa should be forthcoming in great abundance.  It is particularly tragic to see a once proud people humbled and begging and to feel that they must be depicted as dying and in an emaciated state before all of us.  It is right that there should be a gut feeling on all our parts that we would want to help relieve and alleviate this tragedy.  Short term aid, which is what food aid is, will not solve what is an intractable problem.  We must realise that.  Aid is always about survival, it is not about development.</P>
    <P>One of the good things that has come from this motion is that we are going to be given an opportunity early in the New Year to place our development aid policy on the table and discuss it and analyse it, examine it in its totality since its inception and decide where it is going.  The shape it is taking and where we would like to go.  It is true to say that the ordinary people in the street who are parting with their hard earned cash in such generous fashion &mdash; more and more of them are beginning to ask what is all this about, how has it happened, why was it allowed to happen, what are we going to do to prevent it happening, what are the solutions? It is fitting that this House should take part in the kind of debate that is so necessary, particularly in view of the fact that we have a ministry for development co-operation and that we have a Taoiseach who got the whole thing off the ground and who is personally deeply committed to development co-operation <Col N="229" /> and that in a climate of economic recession, the like of which we have not known in Ireland for a long time, it was still found possible in the National Plan to include a section on development co-operation and that while we might not be able to meet our UN target and there might be some slight reduction in our contribution nevertheless our own problems are not going to prevent us from proceeding apace and doing what we can to relieve the plight of Third World countries. Already other tragedies and disasters are pushing Ethiopia and the food situation in Africa off the front pages.</P>
    <P>We have seen the Eastbourne tragedy and the tragedy in the west of Ireland where three young men lost their lives. These are all newsworthy; they touch our hearts and they are replacing the Ethiopian situation.  Something will replace it tomorrow and something else the next day.  But the experts in the field say that this tragedy is going to worsen, and that is a very sobering thought. Despite the fact that we are giving and that aid is being poured in, there is an ongoing problem because the soil erosion is going to continue, drought is going to continue and they need technical assistance and a vast programme of development. Our aid programme is largely based on humanitarian values, which is right and proper and good, but, as Senator Robinson said, it is time for us to hone that policy, it is time for us to give it a sharp cutting edge and it is time for every man, woman and child in this country to be convinced of the value of what we are doing.  In many ways the public are ahead of the politicians in this. The politicians should challenge the public now and say to them that if they want us to increase development aid it means that they must take from this programme or that programme, but we must be prepared to do it because the Irish people have shown that their hearts are in the right place.  In this instance politicians should give firm leadership and continue implementing the programmes which they have to date.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one particular idea which was brought forward by the President <Col N="230" /> of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, Mr. John Barry.  He had a proposal to make and it is a good one. It received very little publicity when he made it, largely because it was competing with many other items for newspaper coverage.  He, like the IFA and many of the farming organisations as individuals and as bodies, is deeply concerned about the imbalance of resources in our world and in the Third World, and they are seeking ways of making their contribution. Mr. Barry is particularly aware, of course, of the co-responsibility levy, and there are ten measures in all in their allocations in the 1985-86 milk year. There is a total figure of 545 ECUs.  There is a section No. 10 under the title &ldquo;Other Measures&rdquo; when they are budgeting out their 545 ECUs.  There are 19.5 ECUs under a heading &ldquo;Other Measures&rdquo;, and this is money held in reserve to be allocated to specific programmes if developments in the markets require additional funds or for other needs which may become apparent during the period of the programme.  To my way of thinking, and Mr. Barry has proposed this, 19.5 ECUs should be, forthwith, allocated to the food aid programme in Africa.  In Irish punts it amounts to £14.62 million.  He has pressed the EC Commission on this. He has contacted our own Commissioner, Mr. Richard Burke, and he has solicited the good offices of all these people whom he felt would give this measure a push in the EC.  I would like to think that as part and parcel of this motion this idea could be incorporated. It is worth exploring.  It seems that there is a subhead there equal to 19.5 million ECUs and it should be considered very strongly that this would be devoted to what is apparent to all, a world crisis of unimaginable content.</P>
    <P>The situation has been building up over a number of years and that is one of the particular tragedies.  Many people spoke on development co-operation in this House a year and 18 months ago, and all of them although not prophets, alluded to the fact that this was on the cards and was going to happen.  The real tragedy and the one the people in the Community <Col N="231" /> cannot understand is how, when so many people knew that this was inevitable, it was allowed to happen.  There is something immoral about that and there is something wrong.  It tells all of us something about our values and about the reasons why we choose to trade as we do and choose to group as we do and choose to ignore, until we can no longer ignore, appalling human suffering, degradation and dire tragedy.  That is inexcusable and unforgiveable, and I hope that it will never happen again and that there will be an outcry and an outburst of indignation that such a thing can happen.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the seventies the 39 countries which make up sub-Saharan Africa have been experiencing a steady decline into deeper poverty.  This drought that has been talked about has been going on now for about three years.  But even before the drought, food production in Africa had been falling and grain output per head was declining by 2 per cent per year since 1970.  This decline in economic activity and food output has been accompanied by rapid population growth.  The World Bank recently pointed out that if this trend continues <i>per capita</i>, production of food in 1988 will be the same as this year even if 1988 has normal rainfall. We cannot say we do not know about the dimensions of the future problem because all the experts and all the people who can read the signs and portents have indicated to us very clearly that the problem is going to get worse.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems of the region stem from climate and soil conditions.  It has been widely known for many years that there are large areas in Africa which are vulnerable to drought and famine because of the precarious dependence on rain-fed agriculture.  In Ethiopia a prolonged famine killed an estimated 200,000 people between 1972 and 1974. Almost a year ago there was mounting evidence of large numbers of hungry people migrating in search of food and this, of course, throws up another human problem, that of refugees, displaced persons who are finding that they not only have a problem of hunger but that they <Col N="232" /> are displaced, unwelcome and unwanted wherever they find themselves.</P>
    <P>The Ethiopian Government have been appealing to foreign governments for emergency food since 1982 and they used their own stocks of food to meet the needs of the growing numbers of people affected by drought and other calamities. The emergency food supplies will save many lives.  The bales of Foxford blankets which were rolled down the tarmacadam of the airport in Addis Ababa will keep many people warm.  However, we must ask why can Africa no longer feed itself? There are several reasons.  One of the important reasons is that many African Governments have allocated only a small proportion of their budgets to agriculture. There has been insufficient research into improved crop varieties and growing methods.  Foreign aid donors have not always understood how to help small scale farming and have too often supported large scale export oriented schemes with little impact on food production.</P>
    <P>One necessary step must be to ensure that small farmers have access to land or the goal of adequate food production will not be met.  But access to land will not be sufficient so long as the problems of a shortage of foreign exchange continues, because farmers also need imported fertilisers, pesticides, farm implements and spares as well as fuel for irrigation, pumps and tractors.  There is so much that can be said about this, because food and energy are increasingly inter-related, and if energy prices rise so does the cost of imports and the direct use of energy in agriculture causes food to become more expensive.  It is a vast problem and I am unhappy that there are only 15 minutes in which to explore one tiny element of what is a composite motion.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we have another opportunity which has been promised to us early in the new year, without the constraints of time, the Members of this House &mdash; and they are happily a growing number who have shown interest in development co-operation &mdash; will have an opportunity to thrash out with the Minister the elements of our policy for <Col N="233" /> development co-operation.  That is something I very much look forward to.  I am pleased to have an opportunity on this occasion to express my admiration and appreciation of all that the Irish people have done, my pleasure at seeing that development co-operation matters did not slip out of the national plan but were firmly in it and I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, when he returns from Ethiopia, a first-hand account of what the situation is like there and what suffering Irish aid has been enabled to alleviate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are emphasising the need to give to the Third World in much the same way as we talk about forgiveness.  We have not looked at the other side of the coin, which in terms of forgiveness is asking for forgiveness.  Is there nothing we have to change about ourselves and about our own country in the context of the total resources of the world if we are going to be able to share within the context of the ecological balance of natural resources in the world so that the Third World may in fact have some equality with us?  This morning on RTE radio I listened to two people from the Burren, two English unemployed people who arrived here with no job.  One was a sculptor and the other worked in craft.  They built a round stone house over two years.  They managed to scrape together enough to buy five acres of rocky land and they are almost self-sufficient.  But what is more important is that their life style had changed.  They had come to terms with themselves and their environment and there had been a spiritual regeneration inside them which left them contented, <Col N="234" /> well-integrated people living as they did.</P>
    <P>All I am saying is that if we are going to help the world in general people in the West will have to reduce their consumption and change their style.  It will not happen with affluent people like ourselves, but the new generation are changing. It is necessary, therefore, to consider encouraging a return to asceticism and away from materialism as the guiding force in life.</P>
    <P>We need to place more emphasis in our life and particularly among the religious in relation to silence, solitude, reflection, retreat, and, dare I suggest it, fasting?  I thought one of the great things that happened in recent times was the appeal from the Catholic Church for a period of fasting.  We need to look very seriously at the role of vegetarianism.  I cannot quote the figures, but apart from the reverence for life that that implies, we know now that to feed an animal which you then slaughter to eat takes up much more of the vegetable resources of the world than if you eat the vegetable protein without going through the animal process on the way.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about a development of a reverence for life we are talking about development of reverence for marine life as well as for animal and human life.  Therefore, we should emphasise the need to reject all unnecessary killing.  We need to think what is our basic need in relation, not only to the resources that exist but in relation to the resources as they will affect the lives of the generations to come.</P>
    <P>Are we living just on borrowed money and on borrowed time?  I do not think we are, but we are certainly doing it in the context of the generations ahead of us. We need, therefore, to define need much more carefully in relation to people where they are living in a community rather than to have that need continually dictated by remote pinnacles of centralisation which kindle expectation that cannot be met for the 8,000 million people in the world and furthermore hold on to the power which results in the entrepreneurial colonialism to which Senators have referred and which denudes the <Col N="235" /> Third World of resources and creates these great debts which they cannot pay back to the West.</P>
    <P>Above all, we need to look, in Ireland as much as anywhere else, at marginalisation. It is no good us rolling up blankets, filling the planes up with food and sending them off to Ethiopia if we are not genuinely concerned at what goes on and doing something effective and prepared to communicate with those who live in Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Ballymurphy, the Creggan, the Bogside and parts of the Waterside.</P>
    <P>Attitudes, therefore, will be increasingly important as we move into the new era of high technology if we are not going to destroy ourselves.  We should emphasise that while it is right that we should find a new politic for distribution, it is also right that we should consider how much of our consumption we might be able to reduce so that world resources can be shared with the world's people. Otherwise we face a simple choice, apocalypse or transformation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Senators who have contributed to this motion moved by myself and Senator Robinson on behalf of the Labour group in the Seanad and which is so generously supported by Senators of all parties in the House Senator Ferris, in seconding the motion, drew attention to striking statistics, for example that 1978 saw the death from malnutrition of thirty million children under the age of five years.  The thrust of this motion is not only to make it possible that children would survive but that they could live towards adulthood in conditions of dignity and sufficiency. That issue has been addressed by many Senators.  Senator Ferris mentioned the 35 per cent unemployment rate which is characteristic for under-developed countries. He mentioned the absolute poverty of so many people in the Third World and the imbalance in resources which is reflected in the consumption pattern of the world to which Senator Robb made reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mark Killilea in a generous <Col N="236" /> contribution made many references in support of this motion, for which I am very grateful to him and to the Fianna Fáil group in the House.  He mentioned in particular the whole question of the situation of countries without a food production capacity.  That is a very fair point, because it is a very often neglected aspect in debates on development strategy. Many countries who will never have food production capacity are very much militated against in imbalances in the terms of trade which have affected their foreign exchange.  For that reason if you take a country like Senegal where 75 per cent of the export earnings come from peanuts, or Chad where 80 per cent of the exports come from raw cotton, there is a very real point here and we see and can elicit an immediate point, that the problems of the Third World are not contained within their own boundaries but within a wider structure of world relationships that involves patterns of trade, aid and debt relationship.  This is a very important point.  There is no doubt that while our hearts are moved by the immediate threats of famine, the real test is whether we are willing to move from this criterion of compassion towards a criterion of justice.  I am unhappy about using the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; because in the pursuit of justice many different political philosophies and ideologies are locked in conflict.  I am only making the point as an emperical historical statement after listening to this debate that nobody can explain the death of children from malnutrition or the whole question of famine in terms of the countries or the continents that are involved.  What is important is a qualitative shift in the political relationships of the so-called developed world and the undeveloped world.  We have said in this House last week and today that we support such a shift.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge made reference to something which is of great importance, because his contribution had a more than ordinary significance in so far as he is involved in a technical capacity in relation to analysing the threat of drought.  He is the living embarrassing presence of the fact that in the seventies one scientific <Col N="237" /> commission after another had predicted the droughts in Africa and the food shortages that would affect that continent. This was insufficient to move the political structures of the world.  An old French novelist used to say &ldquo;How much blood must flow out under the door before people will believe that a murder has been committed&rdquo;?  I made reference in moving this motion to the fact that one could draw parallels between the lack of interest in human rights generally until the great revelations at the end of the Second World War when it was revealed what people had done to each other in the concentration camps.  People felt that they had encountered a base line in human behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for congratulation, and I did so in moving this motion, that the Irish people have singularly excepted themselves amongst the European Community. It is wonderfully reassuring in relation to their generosity.  It is important that we would have a political consensus that would harness that and turn it into a positive response in relation to overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that I have made a number of very specific proposals.  The Minister will have the support of my party in restoring the national target towards reaching the United Nations target in relation to overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>I also made a proposal that the White Paper which is forthcoming and which is very welcome will include a structural analysis from which arises a great number of questions.  Separate from our other commitments in the international political arena we should analyse correctly the reason how we have undeveloped many of the countries that are now in trouble. This is the moment, intellectually and morally, for people.  Do you believe that there are two separate worlds?  I made reference to this in moving this motion. When I was a student in the National University of Ireland at Galway, people spoke of developed countries that had the capacity to develop and undeveloped countries which lacked resources, lacked <Col N="238" /> achievement orientation, as if you were starting a car.  It was as if there were two separate worlds.</P>
    <P>In coming to Senator Robb's contribution, there is some evidence that we are beginning to recognise the problem.  We live on one planet and on one world.  In terms of the history of economics and sociology we must realise that in condemning over the centuries primary commodity producing countries to low prices we are condemning them to poverty and that in insisting on retaining the structure of international debt regulation agencies such as the World Bank, the Inter-American Bank we are not responding to the credit needs of Africa.  Equally in relation to trade, arrangements of the so called developed world are exclusive of the possibility for making export earnings from any of these countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a technical example of that in the countries which are above the category to which Senator Killilea referred.  Countries which have been possibly able to produce food, for example, through the use of new fertilisers, those based on photosynthesis, for example, would be obviously applicable, but it is likely that they will be patented and sold to that part of the world for profit rather than allow them to be transferred as a profit free technology.</P>
    <P>Senator Charlie McDonald made a very important point to which I have already referred, the vulnerability of an economy that is dependent on a single crop.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan raised the question of the immoral concentration of spending on armaments.  We know, for example, through UNICEF's report on the state of the children of the world in 1983, that there were four major developments &mdash; oral rehydration therapy, heat resistant vaccines, growth charts and forms of family planning which could make a major impact on the number of children who are lost in the first three years of life. While this technically became possible, first the aid froze and then it began to drop and we went on to reach the immoral norm of having created three to four tons of nuclear destructive capacity <Col N="239" /> for every man, woman and child on the planet.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson emphasised the point I made in relation to the structure and nature of the problem.  That is the question.  It is easy to give in a way, and we have given an extraordinary amount. What is important is that we make the leap towards realising that we are at one with the world that we are seeking to assist.  We should move on towards a structural analysis and a recognition that we have to move towards that in our policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers spoke of North-South relationships and I agree with her even though I had said quite frankly, that the Brandt report was in many ways a pathetic Western philosophical document towards solving the problem.  It was good and it was accepted.  It had two principles, firstly, self-interest in that we could regenerate our own economy while helping them and, secondly, it has some kind of moral appeal.  It was a very weak document in that regard, far short of any ideological major shift in relation to North and South but even it has been forgotten.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia made some very valuable suggestions in relation to the question of being able to assist within the context of the European Community and emphasised the point of moving beyond humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robb.  I could sense a certain unease as he spoke of marginalisation, spiritual regeneration and ecological balance, concepts which are not normally used within the discourse of transacted politics in these Houses.  I want to support him in using these concepts because he is right.  In having a comprehensive overseas development aid strategy he is developing the concept of oneness.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that the basic principle of this motion is that our development aid policy which we will debate in January should be comprehensive and address itself to the structural principle.  Senator Robb is absolutely <Col N="240" /> right.  If we accept oneness and global responsibility that it is a very important sense of development.  Let us think about this.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying, would it not be very schizophrenic if we needed to be moved by great poverty in a distant way and we were unable to respond to poverty at home?  My reason in moving the motion, as I have said, was that in taking the hurt of the world into ourselves we grow as a people and in our growth we become better able to respond to the deficiencies at home.</P>
    <P>The principles of this motion are: that we have a policy that is comprehensive; that it accepts structural analysis of development aid policy; that development aid policy be not a disadvantaged area within foreign policy in general and that once we have established these principles they be prosecuted with enthusiasm and rigour within all the fora in which we are represented. Lest it be thought that I was ungracious &mdash; the reason I have not referred extensively to the speech of the Minister of State is that I have found it one of the most positive speeches in the development aid debate in some years. I very much appreciated the Minister's presence in the House last week and the manner in which he has carried this issue forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank you, Sir, for allowing me to <Col N="241" /> raise this matter and to thank the other Senators who also had a motion before the House for this evening, for giving way to me.  This motion concerns a serious situation which has developed in Tuam regarding vocational education.  The situation is that the vocational school is in a terrible condition.  In this connection I should like to state some facts which may be hurtful but they are factual.</P>
      <P>I shall, first of all, go through the history of the school so that Senators will be aware of the facts.  In 1974 the Department of Education attempted to have a simultaneous development at the vocational school, Tuam, and the Christian Brothers school in Tuam with a common block to be shared at each school.  It was known then as the Thurles Plan.  This attempt was very unsuccessful.  On 10 February 1975, County Galway VEC made official application to the Department of Education for a new school.  The VEC subsequently submitted a schedule of accommodation for schools on 14 May 1975.  In succeeding years, Athenry, Kilronan and Loughrea made official applications for new school extensions.  The results of their applications were as follows: Kilronan got a large extension; Athenry got a large extension and Loughrea got a completely new school, notwithstanding the fact that their applications were made later than the Tuam application and also notwithstanding the fact that we have the greatest need because the Tuam school has the greatest number of prefabricated classrooms in County Galway, which is the second largest county in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 the Department of Education requested the Galway Vocational Education Committee to establish a priority list among the four schools in the county where development was needed.  A problem arose at this particular stage because of the local political input in the VEC by the local politicians on it.  The committee were reluctant to do this and said that planning for all four projects should go ahead at the same time.  That was a piece of day-dreaming.  As a result of the committee's unwillingness to establish a priority, the Department wrote to the committee on 30 September 1980 proposing <Col N="242" /> to commence planning for the vocational school in Tuam and the vocational school in Portumna.  The Department's letter stated: &ldquo;These schools have the greatest proportion of students in temporary classroom accommodation&rdquo;.  That is an acknowledged fact.  The committee at their meeting on 21 October 1980, by a majority decision, decided not to accept the Department's proposals and instead voted to proceed with planning for Ballinasloe and Gort.  This is where the local polities of County Galway came into play and Tuam was deprived.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that there was a time in the history of our country when Fianna Fáil controlled Galway County Council.  On the occasion of the election in 1979 we failed to secure that majority and we had only one representative appointed from the county council to the VEC.  Sadly, one can see the politics that were being played as regards vocational education, but not played by Fianna Fáil. The Minister is well aware of the facts.</P>
    <P>Members of the school management board met Deputy Boland, the then Minister for Education, on 27 October 1981, at the official opening of the Athenry extension to express their plight and to ask that the Government intervene. On 2 June 1982 &mdash; the years are very important here, and the dates also &mdash; the Department proposed a new school for Tuam in a two-phase development. At the time this was not acceptable for a number of reasons.  The requirement was that the old school be refurbished and a new extension built across the road which is the main Dublin-Tuam road &mdash; and is quite a distance away from the main offices.  After discussions in the town, I led a delegation to the Minister, then Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, who agreed with the suggestions we had made that we should have a full new complex &mdash; the first desired request.  On 30 July &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will verify all those matters for the House &mdash; a letter was received from the Department of Education allowing planning for a new building to proceed.  On 8 October 1982 a planning and briefing meeting took place between the local architect and his team and the Department of Education's <Col N="243" /> design team.  This is normal practice when plans are about to be drawn up.  On 17 January 1983, permission from the Department of Education to proceed with the outline sketches was granted and on 23 May 1983 the outline plans were submitted to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The delay between the permission to proceed with the outline sketch plans and the submission at that time was due to the fact that the Department insisted on the use of a turf-fired central heating system, which was unacceptable to the school management board for various reasons.  Negotiations on the matter took many months.  On 20 February 1984 permission from the Department to proceed with the next stage of the planning, namely the preparation of the developed sketch plans, was granted.  On 1 June 1984 the developed sketch plans mentioned already were submitted to the Department of Education, and after five months we are still waiting for the Department's approval to proceed to the next stage, namely, the seeking of tenders. This is where the matter rests at this particular moment with regard to the plans for the new school.</P>
    <P>Tuam is a very famous town for teaching and is renowned throughout the country. I do not have to elaborate on that. Tremendous progress has taken place in all the many schools in the town and I shall give the House the opportunity of appreciating that fact.  The Mercy Convent school has two new extensions; St. Jarlath's College has a new extension and a second extension has now been sanctioned; the Presentation Convent is a new school and the Christian Brothers' school is a new school, but in the vocational school there are 11 prefabricated classrooms which have far exceeded their original life-span.  I shall deal with this particular aspect, as speed is what I expect from Minister Creed.  I know that he is an understanding man and I hope he will appreciate that this is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>We have 11 prefabricated classrooms in an incredible condition.  They are dilapidated; the frames of the schools are <Col N="244" /> actually rotting; the roofs are sagging and water is coming through the roofs and down through the wall panels.  The classrooms during school hours are filled with every type of utensil they can get to gather the water dropping down from the roof.  They have basins, buckets and plastic containers of all description scattered all over the classrooms.  There is rain on the desks.  But far more serious than that &mdash; and I want to bring this home to the Minister &mdash; the wall panels are so wet that the electrical works, that is the junction boxes and the plugs, are highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>We have another new scourge just arrived now &mdash; vermin.  On account of the decayed condition of the prefabricated dwellings vermin have easy access and it is a major problem today in that school. I say this because five months has gone by and there is no word back from the Department.  We are waiting to advertise for tenders.  I plead with the Minister here to go back to his Department tomorrow morning, to sanction those matters and get them out urgently as a matter of extreme urgency.  I do not believe that any Senator here or even this Government would expect children, parents and teachers to work in those conditions.  If there is any sense of heart left in the Department I hope they will use every means to finalise this as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Parents will not send their children to school soon and that will be a major tragedy.  Then we will have the new angle added to it, namely because of the dwindling numbers at the Tuam vocational school I am afraid we will not have to build a school at all.  That is a serious situation.  I said here last week &mdash; and Senator Bulbulia is here this evening &mdash; that I am afraid that this Government are not in love with vocational education and I had Tuam in mind when I said it.  I am putting it to Senator Bulbulia, that if she had children going to that school she might hesitate to send them.  I want a positive and complete answer this evening. For the sake of the vocational school in Tuam that has suffered agony for so many years I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="245" /> respond to me in a most positive and exact way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Senator Killilea on behalf of the vocational school in Tuam.  I had occasion a number of times to go on deputations to three different Ministers for Education over the past number of years, and each time the importance of this school was stressed.  I know that it is a very slow process in getting plans prepared and everything else but, as Senator Killilea has rightly pointed out, the situation is deteriorating all the time and it is very hard to expect children to attend a school in that kind of environment.</P>
      <P>From what he has said also it can be proved positively that vocational education is the Cinderella of the Department. All the other schools in the town, which is a thriving prosperous town, have got extensions over the years and a considerable amount of money has been spent on them.  The case has been made time and time again for a new vocational school but yet we still are left without our school. The number of children attending the school has increased dramatically in the last few years and the results at exam time have been tremendous when you consider the environment in which the teachers and the pupils work.  For that reason it is very important, particularly where we have an industrial base such as the sugar factory and the other factories that are located in Tuam, that we have the vocational school there.  The training young boys get in the vocational school in mechanical drawing, carpentry and everything else is of great advantage to them in later years when they seek or get jobs in those factories.  For that reason I would plead again with the Minister to give sanction to the school and to start the work immediately.  All the plans are ready.  The Department know what is needed.  They know the urgency of the situation there.  I would just merely plead with him to give sanction and to allow us to go ahead with this school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose first to deal with the report available to me on the Tuam vocational school and I propose <Col N="246" /> to reply to the points raised by the two Senators.</P>
      <P>My Department have approved the planning of a new vocational school at Tuam to provide 350 places.  In the long term the accommodation will include 17 teaching spaces, a special room and general classroom, a library and physical education facilities and other ancillary accommodation.  The existing accommodation has 16 classrooms, of which nine are temporary and prefabricated. Conditions at this school and at the other vocational schools in the County Galway VEC's area have been the subject of discussion between the committee and my Department for the past few years. In 1980 the committee were asked to assign priorities between four of their major school proposals to enable architectural planning of at least two of these projects to commence as soon as possible. The four schools were at Gort, Tuam, Ballinasloe and Portumna.  In connection with this request to the committee to assign priority, I should explain that in the case of a capital programme of that magnitude for second level school buildings where at the moment we have about 400 projects of one kind or another, it is necessary to arrange the programme on a basis that will take into account the flow of financial expenditure and revenue available for the various projects in hand in each financial year.  The administration of the programme as approved must take account of the dates of completion of programmes already under way and the dates of final payments for building projects already completed. Authority for the placing of new contracts may be given only with due regard for the incidence of payments arising from the contract as well as the resources available in professional and administrative staff to deal expeditiously with claims for payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the unwillingness of the committee to set priorities in their area, the Department proposed to the committee towards the end of 1980 that the architectural planning of Tuam and Portumna projects be initiated as these schools had the greater number of students housed in temporary accommodation.  However, <Col N="247" /> the County Galway VEC decided to proceed with the planning of the Ballinasloe and Gort projects first.  The Department agreed to this and indicated that the position regarding Tuam and Portumna would be reviewed in 1981 as part of an overall review of priorities at that time. As the result of the review of 1981, it was decided that Tuam would be included among the projects for which architectural planning could commence in 1982 based on an anticipated enrolment capacity for 350 students.  Planning of the project is proceeding on the basis of a completely new school on a new site across the road and a short distance from the existing school.  However, as some of the existing permanent accommodation is suitable for retention in the short term, it is proposed to build the new school in two phases.</P>
    <P>Phase one will replace the temporary prefabricated accommodation and will commence construction as soon as planning has been completed.  A decision as to when the building of the second phase will commence to replace the existing permanent accommodation considered to be sub-standard in the long term will be made in the light of our available resources at that particular time.  Examination of the developed sketch scheme for the project is completed and the County Galway VEC will be advised on the preparation of the next stage, that is, the detailed design stage, not the bills of quantities.  The question of seeking tenders will not arise until later when the bills of quantities have been submitted and found to be in order.  Otherwise, the planning is proceeding as quickly as our resources allow.</P>
    <P>As regards the condition of the existing accommodation, both permanent and temporary prefabricated, I must point out that the maintenance of the building is a matter in the first instance for the committee.  What I want to say here is that as far as the maintenance and repair of existing accommodation at the vocational schools is concerned it is a matter for the local county VEC.  As I do not intend to take up the political scene in County Galway I am not going to get <Col N="248" /> involved between the politicians there, but I accept from the Senators that the situation in Tuam is rather serious. Unfortunately we have 400 other applications as well dealing with the provision of extensions or replacement of vocational and second level schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea said that in 1975 an application was made for a new school in Tuam.  I am in office only for the last two years but I must say that one of the things that has concerned me more than anything else is the number of prefabricated buildings erected at post-primary and primary schools.  It was a shortsighted programme.  Prefabricated buildings should be erected only in the event of some emergency that could not be catered for under conventional type building.  We have many calls on our resources.  We have 400 post-primary applications and over 800 primary applications.</P>
    <P>With regard to Tuam, the position is that we are within two weeks of returning to the Galway County VEC to ask them to prepare the next stage, which is the detailed design stage.  If the Senator can get his committee or county VEC to produce that to us as quickly as possible the next stage is the bill of quantities which we will be asking them to prepare and submit to us.  This is a detailed operation and will not be done overnight either by the county VEC or the Department of Education.  If the bill of quantities is submitted to the Department it will be necessary to have a detailed examination of the proposals set out in that programme.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the urgency of the matter.  I have discussed it today with some of my officials.  It is not ready to go to tender at this stage and it could be some time yet before it is ready.  It requires the co-operation of the county VEC in Galway and of my Department.  I will have the matter examined as soon as County Galway VEC return the detailed design plans to me.  I will have them examined as soon as possible and seek the bill of quantities for the VEC.</P>
