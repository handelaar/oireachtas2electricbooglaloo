      <P>It is proposed, as was foreshadowed yesterday, that we should take items Nos. 1, 2, and 3 on the Order Paper and that item No. 3 should be taken not later than 3.30 p.m. today.  I might say that there was, as Senators know, a misunderstanding in regard to the motion, item No. 1, but we will devote an hour-and-a-half to it today and complete the debate at a future sitting.  It is also proposed that there should be intermission from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock.</P>
      <P>In speaking on the Order of Business, I would like to say a few words of tribute to our former Clerk Assistant, Mr. Martin McMahon, who has received promotion and accordingly will no longer be with us.  I thank him for his work in the House and his work in the office and the manner in which he has always been helpful to Members of this House, not only to those of us who are responsible for its business but also to individual Senators. I would like to welcome his successor, Mr. Kieran Coughlan.  I am confident that when his turn comes to leave us he also will have earned our tribute.</P>

      <P>Like the Leader of the House, I would like to pay a compliment to Mr. Martin McMahon who is leaving us.  At all times he was very courteous to Members of the House and fulfilled his <Col N="1356" /> duties in an excellent manner.  I am sure that in the future in his new position he will have a more intimate knowledge of the Members of the House and that he will carry out his new functions in as excellent a manner as he has in the past performed his duties wherever he has been asked to perform them.  Again I would like to welcome Mr. Kieran Coughlan.  I am sure we will have an amicable arrangement with him and that he will carry on the traditions of the House as they have been carried out by the people who sat in that chair before him.</P>

      <P>I join in the tributes to Mr. Martin McMahon and congratulate him on his promotion.  The Members of the House might not be aware that over the past months he devoted a good deal of time to trying to ensure that this House had the facility of broadcasting through the medium of RTE.  He put much work into that, and that work should be continued in consultation with RTE.  There is a desire by the Members of this House to have its proceedings broadcast, and Martin McMahon has gone a long way towards overcoming some of the snags that were involved in doing that.  I hope that that work will be continued.  I would like to welcome Mr. Kieran Coughlan to this position.  I have worked with Kieran when he was secretary to one of the joint committees of the House.  I have always found him a most efficient and co-operative member of the staff, and I hope his stay with us will be fruitful and pleasant. I welcome him, and his is a familiar face at this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to register my very deep regret for the misunderstanding that occurred here yesterday, and to thank the House for its sympathetic approach to the problem which emerged, because neither myself nor Senator Brendan Ryan attended to debate the motion which had been kindly put on the Order Paper for yesterday.  The Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, telephoned me last night and I was glad that he was at least supporting the part of the motion which deals with non-violent action.  I <Col N="1357" /> was almost surprised because I felt that Members had been very much inconvenienced.  I can only repeat what I have said, that there was a misunderstanding and I deeply regret my part in it.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask if it would be possible to clarify whether it will become customary to sit on Tuesdays and Wednesdays or Wednesdays and Thursdays.  It is extremely difficult for some of us to organise our week to fit in with the regular routine for Seanad business.  Previously it was Wednesday plus or minus Thursday.  In this session it seems to have started on Tuesday sometimes and gone on to Wednesdays.  It is difficult to plan if one is not certain in advance of the weekly routine.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of sitting days, I would say that it is the intention that if it is anticipated that the House will sit for only one day, that that sitting day should be Wednesday.  As Senator Robb said, it was the custom when we were sitting for two days, to sit on Wednesday and to take the second day sitting on Thursday.  I received a large number of representations that this was unsuitable to Members.  Many Members indicated that they would prefer Tuesday and Wednesday.  That is the reason why in this new year we have gone over to Tuesday and Wednesday sittings.  In order to resolve this matter, because we would all like to be certain on this point, I will arrange for a small questionnaire to be sent to Members, and I think Members in this case will wish to abide by majority preference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill with a strictly limited purpose of enabling a housing authority, at their discretion, to take account of persons resident outside the authority's functional area in assessing housing needs and also to build houses for and to let houses to such persons.  It will overcome the difficulties and confusion that have arisen in relation to the letting of some local authority houses and other local authority housing functions following the Supreme Court judgment in the case of McNamee <i>versus</i> Buncrana Urban District Council (Reference 117-1983).  In that case the court ruled that the council are not entitled to house people who are not resident in the functional area of the council.  The plaintiffs, who were applicants for a house from Buncrana UDC, sought a declaration that the council were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in purporting to allocate houses to persons residing outside the council's functional area.  The High Court granted the declaration sought on 8 March 1983.  An appeal to the Supreme Court by Buncrana UDC was rejected on 30 June 1983 and the decision of the High Court was confirmed.</P>
      <P>In considering the case, the Supreme Court had regard, in particular, to the provisions of sections 53, 55 and 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  Section 53 places a duty on housing authorities to assess, at least every five years, the housing needs &mdash; accumulated and prospective &mdash; of their functional areas.  Section 55 imposes a further duty on authorities to prepare a building programme having regard to the housing needs of their functional area and taking account of certain statutory objectives.  Section 60 obliges authorities to make a scheme of letting priorities for the letting of houses having regard to certain statutory primary objectives. These primary objectives relate mainly to the elimination of unfitness and overcrowding and the housing of persons in need of housing who cannot provide it from their own resources.  In delivering the judgment the Chief Justice said in relation to these provisions and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, it is quite clear that these <Col N="1359" /> various duties and obligations so imposed on housing authorities, applied to each housing authority in relation to its own functional area, and, having regard to the housing needs of that particular area.</P>
    <P>Concluding the judgment the Chief Justice went on to say, and I quote again:</P>
    <P>I do not think the Buncrana Urban District Council are entitled to house people who are not resident in its functional area.  The duty of the Buncrana Urban District Council is to allocate the houses, which they have provided, in accordance with a scheme of priorities which enables them to house suitable applicants who fit within the designated categories and who reside or are domiciled within the functional area of the Council.</P>
    <P>As interpreted by the Supreme Court, sections 53, 55 and 60 of the 1966 Act would put undesirable restrictions on individual local authorities in the execution of their functions in assessing housing needs and in the building and letting of houses.  The sections would hinder housing authorities in entering into mutually advantageous arrangements between themselves for the housing of applicants in a particular locality in the most speedy, economical and convenient way possible. They would give undue importance to the sometimes random effects of local boundaries on the rehousing prospects of needy families.  They would also cause difficulties for the inter-transfer of tenants between housing authorities, and could, in some circumstances, conceivably be construed as placing restrictions on the making by a local authority of loans for the purchase or building of houses.  Furthermore, it is right and proper that comprehensive assessments of the future housing needs of any particular area should be able to take account of, and provide for, any anticipated migration from outside the area.  I am, therefore, satisfied that there is need to amend the provisions of the 1966 Act which have given rise to these problems and anomalies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The present Bill expressly enables a housing authority, to such extent as they consider appropriate, to have regard to persons residing outside the area of the authority in the assessment of housing needs and in the building and letting of houses.  This is being done in the most straightforward manner possible by simply providing explicit powers in the three sections concerned enabling a housing authority:</P>
    <P>(a) in assessing the housing requirements of their functional area under section 53, to have regard to the prospective demand for housing from persons residing outside the area who are likely for any reason to come into the area;</P>
    <P>(b) in preparing their building programme under section 55, to have as an objective, the provision of houses for persons residing outside their functional area; and</P>
    <P>(c) in making a scheme of letting priorities under section 60, to have as a primary objective the provision of houses for persons residing outside their functional area who are seeking accommodation within the area and who are not in a position to provide it from their own resources.</P>
    <P>I should stress that these are enabling provisions and that the extent, if any, to which they are used by any housing authority is entirely at the discretion of that authority.  They do not compel a housing authority who decide otherwise to have regard to persons outside their functional area.  Basically, this Bill seeks to do no more than to restore the position to what it was widely considered to be prior to the Supreme Court judgment. These new provisions are being given retrospective effect to remove any doubts about the validity of any past actions taken in good faith by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, therefore, facilitate improved co-operation between housing authorities in the provision and letting of houses and the arrangement of transfers. It will give those authorities who are undertaking joint schemes to meet the <Col N="1361" /> housing needs of particular localities greater flexibility in making the most advantageous arrangements for the letting of such houses.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I should say that there is now a fairly widely recognised need for a more fundamental review of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966 which relates to the provision and management of local authority dwellings and which includes the three sections now being amended.  This review is already under way in my Department and it is my intention now to press ahead with it as quickly as possible and to have new legislative proposals formulated.  One of the main objectives of these proposals, which I would hope to be able to present to the Houses of the Oireachtas by about midyear, will be to provide a better legislative framework within which the question of homelessness can be tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>However, the object of this Bill could not await these more extensive proposals.  I am satisfied that the problems flowing from the Supreme Court judgment are such as to require prompt amending legislation to restore the position.  Action on these lines has been sought by a number of local authorities and the Bill had the support of all sides in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success in his new portfolio in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is a very limited Bill, if I go over the border in trying to make a point I will get back to the Bill as fast as I possibly can.  The Bill arose out of the McNamee-Buncrana case and the ruling of the court was that the duty of a local authority is to decide on the allocation of homes which they have provided in accordance with the scheme of priorities which enables them to house suitable applicants who fit within the designated categories and who reside or are domiciled within the functional local authority area.  I want first to compliment the housing administration authorities throughout the country on the way that they have operated the 1966 Housing Act.  I do not <Col N="1362" /> presume to be a judge in the McNamee case but it would appear to me that this was a case of somebody having a chip on the shoulder.  Since no other person has challenged the Housing Act by bringing a case before the courts it would seem that our housing administrators did a very legitimate job in regard to the applicants before them.</P>
    <P>The housing for the first time of people from caravans and camping sites and in poor housing conditions needs administration on a humanitarian basis in order to get the best results.  My county has excellent local authority housing administration, as is the case in most counties. We have housed many hundreds of people and the 1966 Housing Act has not come into question.  One county medical officer wanted to house every itinerant in Mayo.  All an itinerant family had to do was to get two hazel sticks and some canvas and move out the road and then the county medical officer would recommend them for inclusion on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>In urban areas in Mayo people on housing lists are genuinely waiting to be housed, and people coming in from other counties and from outside the rural area qualify for housing within those urban areas.  The Bill is intended to prevent this practice.  The situation has its pros and cons.</P>
    <P>With regard to the jurisdiction outside the local authority functional area, what will the entitlement be under the Bill? People return from England and the United States and they find themselves in a local authority functional area.  Some of these people are fairly well off, others not so well off.  They apply for accommodation in old people's homes, for instance, and for ordinary tenancy of local authority housing.  The administration dealing with these cases should be able to handle them within their own formula for allocation of houses, but where does the functional area of a local authority end?  Does it go over the Border into the Six Counties or across to Great Britain?  Does it go into another county? We must have a definition from the Minister on what will now be the functional <Col N="1363" /> area of a local authority in the provision of rented housing.</P>
    <P>I understand that the retrospective clause which the Minister speaks about will cover all applicants who received houses and applicants who did not receive houses and who may be thinking of bringing actions against the local authorities concerned.  I would like the Minister to explain what he means by &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success.  Housing is of prime importance to human beings and to their happy residential living in our community.  Good housing means contentment.  The Minister is sensitive enough to know that and also that any available moneys to meet the housing needs that our population explosion will bring about in the years ahead must not be static but must continually be increased.  We have not got the increase in this year's budget that we would like to have got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, to this House in his new capacity as Minister for the Environment.  I wish him well in his new post.  I have no doubt that he will show the same dedication in this Ministry as he has shown in previous Ministries which he has held.  This legislation is indicative of the kind of progress he wants to make.  I congratulate him for responding so quickly in a legislative manner to the problem that has been created by the findings of the High Court which were later upheld by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas should legislate for the needs of the people.  If the courts at times find that legislation enacted in the past shows some deficiencies, it is our duty to respond with the correct legislation.  This enabling Housing Bill, 1983, does that.</P>
      <P>People's need for houses is the most predominant factor, the overriding factor that any local authority who are a housing authority should look at, irrespective of where people live or work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been reminded by my colleague, Senator Michael Higgins, that people have a constitutional right to be treated <Col N="1364" /> equally, particularly by the Government as the overall, responding authority with responsibility for providing finance.  Irrespective of where the person lives, it is where the need is and where it can be met at the quickest possible time that is important.  My county council in South Tipperary, which borders on Waterford and Limerick, have ignored county boundaries in the past because we have looked at people's needs rather than where they resided, temporarily or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is important that a person, not the Supreme Court or the High Court, should decide where he should be housed.  People themselves have a right of choice and often that choice is based on family and work reasons.  In County Limerick, for instance, where it adjoins County Tipperary at Galbally and Lisvernane, two housing schemes are in progress.  The parishes in that area ignore the county border and the county council have also ignored it.  We have housed people from Galbally which is technically in County Limerick and we have housed them in Lisvernane in County Tipperary. We have housed them in places in which possibly their parents originated and where work is available.  People have a right to choose where they live.  Any restrictions put upon housing authorities to house people only within their housing jurisdiction would be an infringement of people's rights.  The fact that this legislation is retrospective puts out of the question that any lettings that we might have made in the past could be found to be unconstitutional under this decision of the courts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for responding so quickly, particularly as housing lists have been held up resulting from the court decision.  Think of towns such as Navan, with a population of possibly 4,000 and almost 7,000 people living on the border.  In Ennis, the Leas-Chathaoirleach's area, many people are living on the county boundary with Galway and Limerick.  I have no doubt that the housing authority in Ennis would respond to the needs of people, wherever they live, if they want to live in the area. <Col N="1365" /> I am sure you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, would welcome them as part of your electorate on the voting register.</P>
    <P>There should be a free movement of people and local authorities should assist that.  They should match the challenge demanded of us by providing houses.  It is appropriate on this Bill to congratulate the Minister on announcing in the other House an increase in the SDA loans and income limits to encourage people to provide their own houses through their own ingenuity.  Assistance given by the State in that direction is a welcome feature of the Minister's enthusiasm for the Department he has inherited.  I congratulate and thank him.  I have no doubt that this legislation will get a speedy passage through this House so that it can become law and make all former and future lettings of county councils the responsibility of county councils.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, to the Seanad.  From my long association with local government I consider this to be the most important portfolio.  I sincerely wish the Minister well.  Once again we find how removed from everyday living and the problems of people that some of our legal people are.  If they were dealing with housing and giving homes to people as elected representatives on all sides of the House do, I am sure they might understand the dreadful problem more clearly.  For that reason the decision given in the recent court case might not have been as stupid as it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not apologise for saying it.  For the Acting Chairman to pull me up when I was criticising a court decision that stopped our council giving out 44 keys in his home town was very brave.  Some of those people have been waiting for approximately two months for <Col N="1366" /> their keys and their homes because of this court decision.  I had a most unusual human situation last week when we had to take a family into our home because the mother is expecting twins in a week's time.  I had to move her temporarily out of a horrible caravan into my own home and try to fix her up in another place. Her house is ready for occupation but she cannot take up residence because of the result of the court case.  It has created difficulties for us as a local authority, for Senator Ferris and other public representatives.</P>
      <P>I am happy to support this legislation. I am not surprised it was brought in with speed by the Minister.  This is a necessary legislative measure to resolve the position as a result of recent events.  I do not think the Housing Act, 1966, should have been interpreted in the way it was.  That Act was good and worked well, as Senator O'Toole said for a long number of years and for many local authorities.  I am now in the position that I cannot refer to the court case although the Bill has been introduced as a result of the court case. I am totally confused.</P>

      <P>The court findings if allowed to stand would only create a further division between urban and rural people.  At a time when there is a need for a united stand on everything this would have the wrong effect.  As a member of Ennis Urban District Council I am aware that we must first house the people within the immediate boundary of that council but we always have housed people in need.  I understand that the giving of the houses is the executive function of the county manager.  In Ennis we have a very good system.  A meeting of the top health officials, the county manager, county secretary and town clerk is held first and the housing list prepared. Politics do not play any part in it.  At that meeting all information on the need of a family to be housed is processed.  It is a very good exercise and is probably similar <Col N="1367" /> to procedures operating in many constituencies.  We always finish up with the right people getting the houses and flats.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on the record of the Ennis Urban District Council.  I may be going outside the scope of the Bill but I am proud to highlight our record of 238 houses to rent, 100 private sites, flats for newly weds, 65 units for old people and houses for the disabled and so on. Some Members said single mothers were not being housed in some constituencies and it is nice to know that we have done that in Ennis and in County Clare.  Of course, we nearly always do the right thing in Clare.  We have housed one-parent families &mdash; we housed five such families &mdash; and we have also housed seven unmarried mothers.  It would be a great exercise if the people in the legal world knew how rough it is to house needy people.  Local representatives know the cases of people who need homes and that is why I have always had very strong views on the real situation.  It may create a lot of hassle for us but we have an advantage after serving on local government when we rise to national level.  It is a definite advantage when one is looking for a house for a constituent.  Families will talk to the local representative and that person will know their problems.  I am aware that other county councils operate this system.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the record of county councils.  Will the Minister give his blessing soon to our CPO for Ennis in his Department since December 1983?  It is not very long there but he should examine it.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the Dáil on 14 December, as reported in the Dáil Official Report at column 1979 said:</P>
      <P>Basically, this Bill seeks to do no more than restore the position to what it was widely considered to be prior to the Supreme Court judgment.  These new provisions are being given retrospective effect to remove any doubts about the validity of any past actions taken in good faith by housing authorities.</P>

I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with this review and the formulation of legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement.  It is correcting the wrongs that were done.  I would not expect anything else from the Minister. I thank the Minister for listening and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, to the House in his capacity as Minister for the Environment.  We had some dealings with him in Cork some time ago when he was Minister for Labour and we were very impressed and encouraged by his coolness and calmness.  I am confident that he will continue in that manner as Minister for the Environment.  He has my heartiest congratulations, and I hope that he will be Minister for the Environment for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have a Bill of this type before us this morning and that particular urban councils are saying that people outside their areas do not get priority and courts are prepared to uphold that.  It is unfortunate that urban councils are not prepared to give priority to people outside their area.  If we did not implement this Bill, we could have urban councils not building any houses for a long time because of this court ruling or because of the view some of them take that they do not have to accommodate anybody outside their own area.  Some urban councils could suffer because of this.  To be honest and reasonable about this, if I felt they were thinking that way I would let them suffer the consequences. It would be very narrow and bad minded of members of local authorities or urban councils to say that only those living within their district areas should get accommodation.  If would be unfortunate if we had people thinking that way or going by the book.  As other Senators have stated, this does not prevail in other <Col N="1369" /> parts.  I would be sad if I learned that Cork Corporation were not prepared to accommodate a person because he or she lived across the bridge in Douglas, an area that is in the centre of the city but is governed by the county council.  I would be annoyed if there was a ruling to the effect that the corporation would not build in the county area because it was not part of their property.  I am glad to be able to report that there is great co-operation between Cork Corporation and Cork County Council in the provision of accommodation for the less well-off.  Both authorities adhere to a list of priority cases.</P>
    <P>In recent years quite an amount of work has been carried out in those areas, and we are proud of that.  I am chairman of the housing committee of Cork Corporation, and I can state that we have not been so far ahead in the task of accommodating people in need in 20 years.  All members of that authority are sincere when it comes to drawing up a priority list.  I am glad the Minister announced that there will have to be a review of the 1966 Act to take account of the housing needs of the less well-off. However, I must question whether we are doing the correct thing with regard to providing accommodation for the less well-off.  There are areas where we should be doing more, and some of those we are accommodating could accommodate themselves if they were given proper assistance.  That would enable local authorities to provide more accommodation for those in most need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Without questioning the decision of the court I should like to say that it was unfortunate that the case had to go before our courts for a decision.  I am anxious that the Minister outline his views on urban councils who adopt such a narrow minded opinion in regard to housing people.  I appreciate the Bill is specific on this point, but I should like to know how many authorities were wrong in the past and did not accommodate people who may have been entitled to it.  Are there many people who should have been accommodated?  Can people now claim that they were entitled to be accommodated <Col N="1371" /> by local authorities?  If we were to broaden the debate on this issue we could have very strong arguments on this.  Senators might identify areas where people should not be accommodated or where priority was given to them wrongly.  In some areas, as Senators and local representatives are aware, people got priority over others.  Consideration should be given to every application and priority given to the less well-off in our society. I am glad the Minister said he is prepared to ensure that a larger review will be made of the Housing Act, 1966.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to express my appreciation on the congratulations and good wishes which Senators extended to me today on this, the occasion of my first visit to the Seanad as Minister for the Environment.  I would also like to thank those Senators who contributed to the debate on this short but nonetheless necessary Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening speech this Bill has a strictly limited purpose.  It aims to clear up the confusion and overcome the difficulties which housing authorities have experienced since the Supreme Court judgment in the Buncrana case and to restore the position as it obtained prior to that judgment.  The power of housing authorities to take account of the needs of persons residing outside their functional area in the building and letting of houses is, by virtue of the amendments being made now, clearly written into sections 53, 55 and 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  Apart altogether from the particular shortcomings in these sections of the 1966 Act which the Buncrana case brought to light, there is, as I said earlier, a need for a general review and overhaul of Part III of that Act which, after all, is now almost 20 years on the Statute Book and was drafted in the context of a housing situation which in some respects was quite different from that now prevailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted, however, that there is a need, in the meantime, to clarify the position arising from the judgment if the prospects of many families in urgent need of housing are not to be damaged.  Otherwise, <Col N="1372" /> long established practice adopted by some housing authorities in considering applications from persons not resident in their areas would have to be discontinued.  In the past many county councils have housed persons residing within urban districts in the county and vice versa because such arrangements were seen to be the most advantageous way of looking after local housing needs. There should be no impediment to local authorities wishing to enter into mutual arrangements best suited to local needs and circumstances.  We are ensuring by the provisions in the Bill that such arrangements can continue.  Furthermore, I would hope that it will encourage authorities to co-operate more effectively in providing houses in the speediest and most efficient way possible for applicants in greatest need.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked me to clear up the distinction of the functional area of housing authorities.  Under the Housing Act, 1966 county councils, county boroughs, borough corporations, urban district councils and, for very limited purposes, town commissioners are the housing authorities.  In other words, the administrative area of each local authority is their functional area for housing.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole called for more money for local authority housing.  I should like to tell the Senator that a sum of £211 million is being provided to fund the housing programme in 1984.  There are at present about 8,500 houses in progress by local authorities throughout the country &mdash; almost 1,000 more than at this time last year and the highest number for years.  Completions last year reached approximately 6,100 houses &mdash; about 400 more than in 1982.  Furthermore, direct employment on the programme has increased by 500 to some 6,300.  Although the increase in the allocation over last year is less than the anticipated rate of inflation the Government considered that a capital allocation of £211 million for 1984 would maintain the programme at present levels when allowance is made for such factors as the effect in 1984 of the increased competitiveness in tender prices during 1983; the substantial increase in the 1983 capital allocation will <Col N="1373" /> continue to be reflected in output next year and the new cost control procedures together with improved house designs. These do not imply any reduction in the standards of the houses or of the accommodation provided.  However, they do aim to curtail excesses and cut out unnecessary frills.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to return the situation to what it was prior to the McNamee case taken against Buncrana Urban Council.  It is generally agreed that this is what most councillors, and councils, want in order to have flexibility in the provision of local authority houses. It does not, and it was never intended that it would, have the effect of making local authorities go beyond their functional areas in order to look for prospective tenants for houses.  It is introduced in order to maintain the practice of the past, to house people in need whether they were inside or outside their functional areas but made application to a particular urban council or county council.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed and for their good wishes to me.  The need to pass the Bill as speedily as possible is obvious because a number of councils are awaiting our deliberations today and hoping that the Bill will be passed so that they can get ahead with the letting of houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The retrospective provisions of the Bill would operate to remove any doubts about the validity of any past actions taken in good faith by housing authorities.  If a housing authority in the past housed somebody from outside their area no question can be raised as to the validity of what the council did.  It was never the intention that the 1966 Act should have been applied in the restrictive way that the court decision has brought about.  The retrospective provision is to ensure people who may be nervous that because of the result of the case they are now not validly tenants of <Col N="1374" /> the particular local authority in which they are now residing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be worried about whether a local authority would have the right to transfer a tenant from one urban council or other local authority area.  Are they allowed to transfer tenants without counter transfers?  In other words, can we transfer a tenant in Dublin to Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as I said, brings back the situation to what it was before the MacNamee case.  If a council decide on a transfer, that is their decision, and that was their decision, as I understood it, before the case was taken.  It is not introducing anything new.  Local authorities, from my experience of being on two of them, will probably not consider transfers from such a distance, but there could be circumstances when a person from a particular area would have to move to Cork to work, but felt he had a claim to housing in his home town and would want to make that claim.  The example given by the Senator is not the usual one, which is somebody living just a mile or two outside the functional area of the council and wishing to make an application for that other functional area.  It must be considered, as it was in the past, by the council to whom he applied for transfer and in the end it would be the decision of the manager whether the transfer would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean that a County Dublin man applying for a transfer <Col N="1375" /> fer to Cork would be considered on his merits, and it can well be that each set of applicants sets its own standard of entitlement.  You could get a person in Dublin applying in Cork.  He would be coming in as an applicant and it would be the administration in Cork who would decide on whether, in accordance with the standard of the applicant in Cork at a given time, he would be housed and that he would be eligible for application. He would have to go through the same format as if he was living in County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the position.  The purpose of the Bill is to return to local authorities the flexibility they had to consider all applications on their merits, given the list of criteria that is set out for meritorious applications for housing, and we all remember what they were: overcrowding, unsuitability of housing, people living in caravans who sometimes cannot get a site inside the functional area and who may move up the road a little bit outside it.  They are entitled to be considered, but the whole idea of the Bill is to return the flexibility to the urban and county councils and borough councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation, but the rulings of local authorities are that they must consider each application on its merits.  There are unfortunate situations &mdash; I do not want to hold up the passing of the Bill &mdash; involving transfers of tenants from one local authority to another, and we must remember we are talking only of transfers of local authority tenants.  Should we recognise the tenant as a tenant of a local authority or should we recognise him as a tenant of the State?  That is the problem.  That person does not get the right to be regarded as a local authority tenant already.  We are not giving priority to people who are in dire need of transfer from one area to another because of compassionate or disability grounds, and so on.  I find it very hard to understand that some local authorities are not prepared to give priority in this area.  Could it be noted by the Minister that these things <Col N="1376" /> must be recognised for what they are, that we must give some consideration to people who are already tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has a point.  Not all local authorities operate in an even-handed fashion and, perhaps, when I said on Second Stage that I was having a review of the 1966 Act the problems he puts forward about the actual decisions and complications that arise with certain councils could be looked at then, but for today and in connection with transfers, every person who resides in a local authority area in the State, irrespective of what part of the State he is in, is in a local authority area and this Bill gives authority to councillors to consider a transfer application from another local authority area.  It goes only as far as has been the case in the past.  It gives power to a council to consider an application and to make proper judgments on the merits of the application as against other applicants they have before them.</P>

    <Title>Activities and Financing of CIE: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the activities of CIE and the arrangements for financing that organisation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Dooge)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an opportune time to have an in-depth look at the activities of CIE and, as the motion says, the arrangements for financing that organisation.  CIE, as a State body are probably an organisation that have had more people looking at them, delving into them and writing about them than any <Col N="1377" /> other organisation in the State, and no conclusion has emerged as to the role that CIE should play in the organisation of transport communications within the State.  The Minister in some way has decided that in future the social element will be considered to be 50 per cent of the board's revenue or 33? per cent of the board's expenditure, so in a sense in this year the social element to some degree has been set down.  How was that figure reached?</P>
      <P>It seems that since CIE have been looked at for so long it would be virtually impossible within the short length of time that the Minister has looked at this problem to be able to come up with a definitive social element within the operation of CIE.  In the formulation of financial policies for the coming year and, as the Minister said, for years following that, the plan does not give any total expectancy of return to profitability, so I wonder how in one sense is he able to quantify the social element and then say the plan does not give a certainty of profitability under the new scheme?</P>
      <P>I accept, as the Minister said, that a new positive and aggressive commercial ethos will have to be developed within the company.  It seems to me that in 1984 it is time somebody decided such an ethos should be developed.  I wonder why this commercial element has been missing from the company for so long.  The debate so far seems to have tended towards nit-picking on various problems that individual Senators have come across rather than looking at the importance of CIE's contribution to the economy in terms of the large numbers of workers they have.  The Minister gave a figure of 16,000.  I am not sure exactly what the figure is.  The numbers employed there are dispersed right throughout the State to give to local economies a large part of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, there has tended to be in the past number of years a rationalisation programme which has tended to take away from smaller towns the employment given by CIE and has concentrated the employment factor in the bigger cities.  I do not think this was a plan which should have been allowed to <Col N="1378" /> develop and I do not see that CIE have in any way improved their operations because of it.  In this motion we have to discuss the public operation of transport and the private element.</P>
    <P>Senator Kirwan in his contribution cast the aspersion that the private sector totally had milked the transport system of all available profitability and then went bankrupt.  It is very hard to see how a company could milk the system, take all the profits and go bankrupt.  There must have been other reasons why privatisation did not continue at the rate which I would consider to be necessary.  One of the major inhibitions on privatisation was the fact that there was regularisation, by which people who were running old-fashioned steam engines back in the thirties were given road traffic licences based on the weight of their steam engines.  After that, it was virtually impossible to get a road haulage licence: you had to purchase a licence from one of the holders. Over the past number of years there has been an attempt to deregularise the situation, or to give to private firms more rights or more opportunities to involve themselves in road haulage.  There was a Bill recently which did just that.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the very bad relations between management and workers in CIE.  There are many reasons for this.  I feel that in CIE the workers would tell you that the distances from them of management and from the board to management are totally excessive and could not give the workers any degree of stability in their jobs or any confidence that the board or the management of the company was giving to them what they needed to do their jobs in a fit and proper manner.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that at times industrial disputes have not taken place in CIE which could have been avoided if the trade unions operating in CIE had consulted their workers or members.  Over the past couple of years it would seem that the development of a system of worker-directors in CIE has given to workers at least some contact with the board.  Anybody who listens to the worker-directors speaking on the problems of CIE would see that not alone <Col N="1379" /> have they the interests of the workers at heart but equally they have at heart the continuity of CIE in a viable and worthwhile manner.  It can be said by certain people that these worker-directors are very narrow in their attitude towards the operations.  Because they are closer to the ground than management or directors of the board they do seem to have what the people are saying to them at heart and equally what their co-workers are saying.</P>
    <P>Until there are better staff relations in CIE we will have continuing problems. The figure that was quoted yesterday was 50,000 work days lost in CIE in 1983 which was ten times the national average. Obviously somebody will have to sit down, whether it be the Minister or an internal commission, to work out exactly why those days were lost.  Is it because there has been a lack of contact with or loss of confidence by the workers in their management?  Is it because the workers have lost confidence in their trade unions?  Is it that the trade unions do not see a future for their workers in CIE?  Is it that there is total lack of confidence by all elements in CIE to overcome the problems that they have?</P>
    <P>It would seem that lack of confidence is a major element in management-worker relationships.  When it is boiled down, the board members of CIE are not known to the public and in many cases the management of CIE are not known to the public, but the bus conductor and the bus driver are known to the public, and the man driving the truck delivering goods is known to the public.  The people working on the trains are known.  They get the stick though it is not often realised that they are working in harrowing conditions.  Any driver who has to work a full day in Dublin city, goes to work in the morning and is working in very bad traffic conditions all day.  Then some person gives out to him because a bus is five minutes late.  This is not conducive to him to sit down and distance himself at a trade union meeting from the problems that he has.  One of the major things that has to be done in CIE is a major review of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> Of course the public do not get from management the type of information that is needed.  It is virtually impossible in places to find out at what times trains and buses will run and parcels can be delivered.  There is a need for a better information service from CIE, and I do not mean a PR exercise.  One thing that they seem to be great at is in providing a PR expert for every situation.  He glosses over the problem, goes back to his office, sits down and says, &ldquo;I have done a very good job,&rdquo; but nothing has been done to help the public.</P>
    <P>This year we have each Department in Government fighting a case to get a share of the nation's finances, and it will be extremely hard for CIE to get the type of money that they need to run their operation in this new, positive and aggressive way.  The health boards and the Department of the Environment are roaring for money.  Where is the money to come from?  It will come from the taxpayers' pockets.  What we have got to do is to ensure that every penny that is spent in CIE will be spent in a positive manner, because the public's perception of spending is that money is being spent in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about rolling stock and the maintenance of the property of CIE in the coming year is that too much of the moneys on the capital side are to be expended on the electrification scheme for the greater Dublin area and on 64 new carriages for mainline trains which will not do very much to upgrade the mainline rail system.</P>
    <P>Reading some of the newspapers recently one would imagine that the trains in Ireland had never been cleaned, that they are filthy always.  I travel by train quite a lot and in general it can be said that Irish trains and buses are as well maintained, considering their age, as any system in the world.</P>
    <P>When we look at the situation around the country, it is a problem when we see much of this year's capital allocation going into the electrification of the Bray to Dublin line which, it would appear, will never make a profit.  Of course, if we take the social element into account and if 50 per cent of CIE revenue will be <Col N="1381" /> subsidised by the Government, it can be taken as a social input.  Therefore, it is a mistake to say that the Bray-Howth line will pay its way in the sense that we are going to take that 50 per cent of the revenue of that line as social revenue which will not come out of this commercial ethos element.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that we should be discussing electrification.  I saw that beautiful new set of stamps that are being brought out this year which shows the Dublin to Kingstown railway.  One of the things that was said in the first-day cover is that it was among the world's first railways, that it was the first railway to be opened in Ireland.  It was the first railway ever to build an engine for its own work when it built the &ldquo;Princess&rdquo;.  The 23-piece stamp set features the engine &ldquo;Princess&rdquo; and train approaching Blackrock.</P>
    <P>I travel a lot in that area and that engine approaching Blackrock is one thing, but when we get the newly electrified railway, and the trains are passing by Blackrock every five minutes, I hate to think what will happen to anybody who is on the sea side of the railway gates near Blackrock College, right back into Westland Row.  I think there are 17 road crossings.  At present in the mornings it is virtually impossible to cross those lines. If you are to have a system with a train passing every five minutes, there is only one way people will be able to get from Strand Road, Sandymount, from Ringsend, from the sea side of Lansdowne Road &mdash; to use public transport, which may be the object of the exercise.  If everybody in that area have to leave their cars at home because they cannot drive across the railway lines it will mean that they will have to use the new train.  Of course, that is grand if they are only going to Dublin, but if they are trying to get out of Dublin they will have problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that a greater number of people used the buses in Dublin in 1983 than in 1982.  If one looks at the state of the motor industry in Ireland and the cost of keeping a motor vehicle due to tax, insurance and everything else, it is quite logical that people could not afford to use their cars any more.  Indeed there are more cars being <Col N="1382" /> sold without new cars being bought than the other way round.  This is one of the reasons why there was extra traffic engendered in 1983 over 1982.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has been most noticeable in 1983 over 1982 is the greater number of buses leaving Dublin city every Friday evening for places all over the country, and indeed coming back late on Sunday night and early on Monday morning.  These private bus companies are giving a service to the public which CIE have not done, and because of the constraints placed by union regulations and so forth they cannot do it.  I feel that CIE should decide to leave that type of business to the private operators, who do a fantastic job.  I meet those club buses very far down the country.  They go down on Friday night and they can be used on Saturday to bring shoppers back to Dublin, they go back down the country again and the club again brings them back to Dublin on Sunday night, leaving County Mayo or maybe Kilkenny or Cork.  They go back to Dublin at a reasonable hour on a Sunday night so that connections can be got by people living in the suburbs and they will have had a good weekend at home.  Alternatively, they can leave very early on Monday morning and get into Dublin at 9 o'clock.  That type of service can be done best by the private bus companies.  If one looks at the overall transport system and the difference between CIE and private hauliers and private bus companies, one of the major things he will notice is the adaptability of the private companies.</P>
    <P>School buses were referred to.  A school bus in CIE is a school bus and is not allowed to be used for any other purpose.  Generally speaking, the work of a school bus finishes in the morning at 10 o'clock and in the evening at approximately 6 o'clock, only working from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock, and for the remainder of the day it is not used at all. At weekends it is not used, and during the long summer holidays it is not used, whereas with the private operator you will find that the school bus is being used as a school bus in the morning, it is being used for other social purposes which CIE are not providing in smaller towns around <Col N="1383" /> the country &mdash; it is being used as a commuter transporter during the day.  On Sunday it is being used to provide transport, which is much more reasonable than CIE, for matches, social functions or whatever.  Of course, it will be used for driving a large number of people at night to bingo halls.</P>
    <P>Ambulances drive patients to clinics at times when CIE school buses are not being used.  People talk about cutting down on public expenditure.  You have ambulances, taxis, every form of transport, bringing people to clinics which are at set times on set days, and you have school buses lying idle.  It is a public disgrace.  I cannot see why a system cannot be arranged whereby school buses could be used to better advantage.  In the school bus system I feel the best service is being given by the private sector but they are managed by CIE.  The Department of Education finance the school bus system but CIE manage it and in the main private companies run it, which leads to duplication which is totally unproductive and unprofitable.</P>
    <P>CIE's place in material handling has to be analysed very carefully.  CIE do a fairly good job.  Somebody said that CIE should get into warehousing and distribution.  Any railway station which has a commercial end to it has a warehouse. There is no difference between a railway station with goods in it and a commercial warehouse down the road.  There is not the adaptability in CIE regarding the transporting of goods that one has in the private sector.  There should not be conflict here.  There is a place for CIE and for the private sector in material handling.  The private sector, through the liberalising that has taken place over the past number of years, have played a major part in the transportation of our manufactured goods, of goods generally and in the export of goods.</P>
    <P>It was said yesterday that it was a shame to see at most of the meat factories, and other factories around the country which are exporting goods, that it is mainly foreign vehicles which are transporting these goods.  Foreign vehicles <Col N="1384" /> are doing most of the transporting because the cost of providing transport has gone up enormously over the past number of years.  The initial cost alone of the smallest vehicle capable of doing a trip to the Continent with a container behind it is probably in the region of £75,000.  This is one reason why we see so many foreign vehicles.  When one considers the cost of tyres, insurance, tax, and replacement parts, there is no country which does not pay less than we do for one of these vehicles.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this is the tax element involved.  The amount of tax taken by the Revenue Commissioners is too high.  There is absolutely no way one can foresee a future for the transporters of exports unless there is some change.  If a person is using a vehicle and containers mostly on export business his company tax should be the very same as if he were an export company.  The profits he makes should be taxed at the 10 per cent company export profit rate rather than the internal company profits tax.  If this were done it would at least ensure that even though the input into the motor vehicle would still remain above the level of our European and British competitors at least if profits were made these profits would only be taxed at the export rate. Let us be fair about it.  There is no way our exporting companies could stay in business without the transportation of goods to markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the enforcement of common European regulations.  In 99 per cent of the cases these common regulations should not apply in Ireland.  We do not have the roads and we do not have the same length of very good roads they have in other countries.  There should be a more liberal attitude with regard to the regulations on the tachograph here. Under the regulations a man who is sending a load to Cork has to have two drivers. When driving on a motorway in England, an autoroute in France or Spain, or an autobahn in Germany, the length of time the driver spends on the roads is less, and his average speed is greater.  Therefore his driving is reduced and he has not to stop after the statutory limit that is there at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> Liberalisation gave an opportunity to private individuals to increase the number of their vehicles but you can only increase the number of your vehicles if you have the cash to do so and have the returns from the business.  The way Irish business has gone in the last couple of years, the cost of the inputs into the enormous cost of trying to purchase new vehicles have inhibited people from increasing the size and type of transport they have available.  Even though we have had liberalisation there have not been a great number coming in to create problems for those already in the industry.</P>
    <P>There are development which are helping to cut down the overall cost in the sense that own account transportation is getting smaller and the companies which were transporting their own goods are now depending more and more on road hauliers because the capital cost of the vehicles, the maintenance costs and the labour costs have gone too high. Every company who have to deliver goods of their own manufacture should carefully look, before purchasing a vehicle, at the economics of bringing in an outside haulier, whether that haulier be CIE or a private haulier.  The importance of the road haulage system cannot be over-emphasised.  The cost of double handling, if we use CIE, of taking goods from the factory, bringing them to the railhead, shipping the goods and taking them off again is so high that in 99 per cent of cases it is more economical to do a factory to warehouse or a factory to customer single delivery.</P>
    <P>The amount of money the Department of the Environment are providing this year for capital projects is £6,000 less than it was last year.  This means that the maintenance of our roads and making new roads is slowing down to an enormous degree.  This means increased costs for the transporters of goods.</P>
    <P>The role of other State agencies has to be taken into account when we deal with CIE and their financing.  CIE have to depend on the Department of the Environment as have every other group who use the roads.  Anybody who does a lot <Col N="1386" /> of driving will notice that in the past 12 months they had more left-hand front and left-hand back punctures than was the case previously.  This is because of the state of the verges and the potholes on the off side of vehicles.</P>
    <P>CIE have a major role to play in our economy in regard to tourism.  In certain areas, because of the lack of finance and a lack of knowledge of what tourism needs at present, CIE are not doing for this country the job they were set up to do and which we expect from them. Throughout the Continent at present there is an ever-increasing number of young people travelling.  They tend to use public transport, particularly the trains. There is an argument that these people do not spend money in the countries to which they go.  It is a false argument because no matter where they go, they have to eat and if they are travelling they will use some sort of transportation.  It is not the money that they spend while they are in the country as young students that is important, it is the amount of money that there is a potential for them to spend when they leave college or get into the work area and into what is considered normal tourism.  If they have travelled throughout a country and enjoyed it as youngsters, they tend to go back to that country.</P>
    <P>CIE will have to look at the possibility of tying in more closely with the inter-rail system in Europe to provide the type of transportation that these people can use. There is no use telling people to come to Ireland and use the student's rate or buy a tri-monthly ticket if they cannot get by train from Rosslare to Limerick without having to wait, perhaps 12 hours, or even 24 hours.  A large number of these people come in through Rosslare.  Rosslare is an area which as a tourist entry point will have to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>For a number of years CIE have been trying to get money to complete the facilities in Rosslare and have not as yet been successful in doing so.  Unless the money to develop Rosslare is forthcoming our tourism base there will drop.  This applies to the facilities available at the port for passengers and ships, the facilities for getting away from the port and the provision <Col N="1387" /> of proper information about the tourism potential of the country in terms of cheap travel.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of controversy about the closure of lines.  There are a number of lines under threat in that area &mdash; the connecting line between Waterford and Rosslare and down to Limerick Junction.  There have been various plans put forward over the years about what would happen in that area.  We have not yet co-ordinated the traffic plan from Rosslare to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Over the last few months we have seen the controversy about the role of the hotels within CIE's ambit.  These hotels have been run very well by the people who operated them.  From time to time, these people did not get support from CIE.  It will be interesting to see if CERT will do any better in terms of getting the necessary capital that is needed and in getting promotion from CIE from outside the country.  There is absolutely no reason why tourist promoters, whether they are working totally for CIE, Bord Fáilte or for any other State enterprise, cannot jointly bring tourists to Ireland.  It is incredible that they cannot fill four hotels at least to an 80 per cent capacity basis for 12 months of the year.  If it is not within the capabilities of CIE to do that I cannot see how they could have the capability to run a transport system of any size.</P>
    <P>There will have to be more than just constraints put on CIE in terms of subventions and a stated social objective if they are to succeed.  There will have to be co-ordination at all levels within CIE to give back to the workers the confidence they need in this major industry. There will have to be co-ordination between the role of the board of CIE <i>vis-à-vis</i> the deplorable personnel problems they have.  In terms of the problems that are encountered by CIE and other people involved in transport in Ireland, there will have to be a co-ordination of effort from the Departments of the Environment, Finance and Transport to see how we can have a better transport system which is workable, whether it is run by the private or public sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> We will have to give workers back security in their jobs and encouragement to meet the public and not constant harassment from all sides whether it be here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the streets or whether it be from management at the top level who seem to be as far away from them as the 1884 Dublin-Kingstown railway is from the Dún Laoghaire-Dublin new railway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are debating this motion because it is one of the most relevant motions to come before this House in my short time here.  The Minister said in his opening remarks that the activities of CIE impinge upon virtually every citizen every day of his life. Whether it be through public transport, in terms of commuter transport or commercial transport, all citizens daily have some experience of CIE.</P>
      <P>We are faced with the problem that rightly or wrongly there is in the country at the moment a tremendous lack of public confidence in our national transport authority.  That is something that worries all of us and is something that is to be regretted.  It must worry us because when confidence does not exist in a body such as CIE that body cannot thrive.  If the people had a clearer understanding of CIE and their activities some of that confidence might be restored, and that organisation might be able to develop more quickly and constructively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to talk about CIE in isolation.  When we are talking about the public transport body we have to be aware of the other methods of transport, whether it be our road system, internal air system, harbours, canals or the various other modes of transport within the country.  One of the big problems of CIE is that they tend to look at their own activities in isolation.  CIE have forgotten that they are not living in the 19th century when the national railway system came into existence.  At that time there was an automatic monoply.  Road transport was impossible for commercial purposes, airways were unheard of and there was no organised system of transport except rail transport.  Very rapidly from the 1840s and 1850s onwards we saw a development <Col N="1389" /> of rail transport for commercial and passenger purposes.  The monoply came into existence automatically.</P>
    <P>With the development of the road system, the arrival of the motor car and lorry and now the articulated truck, the development of internal airways and the growth of our motor car numbers, the system has changed radically.  CIE have not adequately appreciated that fact. That begs the question &mdash; do we have an overall transport policy which considers all of these aspects?  That is the question Government have to ask and answer.  The Government are basically the transport policy makers and CIE are one of the means by which that policy is to be implemented.  With considerable constraints on resources we have to ask ourselves the question, can we afford a first class rail service, a first class road service and a first class bus passenger service all at the one time?  Should the State be saying that our resources should primarily go into one area as distinct from the other areas? At present we are spending our resources within all of these areas and we are getting the worst of all worlds.  In this sense CIE must not be seen as some form of protected national sacred cow.  They must be seen as having a place within the overall system of transport.  I would like to get the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <P>Transport, like all other systems of communications, is vital for infrastructural development.  Some of us live in parts of the country where we have a very weak infrastructure.  I am referring to the west in particular, the part of the country I come from, the Leas-Chathaoirleach comes from and the Minister of State comes from.  We have poor and inadequate roads, and a railway service and a bus service that could be improved.  So far as that part of the country is concerned the Government must grasp the nettle and must decide where priorities lie in ensuring that our citizens can at least have one solid system of transport. Until that is done, CIE playing their role in the whole system of transport will be a little bit like a rudderless ship, moving without direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the social aspect of public transport and the priorities <Col N="1390" /> in that regard which he determined in June 1983.  The social element must vary depending on the social need.  When you have a weak communication infrastructure there is a very high priority need for public transport.  Therefore, CIE must look very carefully at the service they are providing to the people in the west.  CIE commercial traffic in the west is declining rapidly.  One reason for that is that it is regarded as extremely expensive, inefficient and caught up in red tape and bureaucracy.  As far as commercial traffic is concerned a completely new approach is required by CIE.  An aggressive selling policy and a business approach are required.  CIE must get out to the business and the commercial communities and respond to their needs.  The response to the needs of the business and commercial communities in the west in the eighties is very different from the response which was required in the sixties.  Despite some innovations I do not think that CIE have adequately responded to the needs which exist and which they can satisfy if they approach them in a more aggressive and businesslike manner.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the rail service to the west.  I can only describe it as utterly deplorable.  We had the opportunity of reading in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 31 January 1984 an article by Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien describing a rail journey to Sligo.  It was appropriate that the article should have appeared while we are debating this motion.  If one goes down to Heuston Station to catch the train to Westport, as I frequently do, one advantage of the present system is that one does not have to look at the signboard to see the platform number one is departing from.  One simply has to look at the trains available at the station and one will see the gleaming supertrains, lined up and ready to steam off in every direction except the west.  One will see the one remaining dirty looking cattle-truck type vehicle ready to transport those of us who are travelling to the west.  That is what it can be descibed as and that is what it looks like.  It is appalling that those of us who live in a remote region within an inadequate infrastructure should be subjected <Col N="1391" /> to the worst trains.  The train to west Mayo frequently has carriages without lighting, broken windows and doors and inadequate heating.  Whether the heating is too hot or too cold one is always in danger of catching some kind of flu. The dining facilities vary but are never dependable and the toilet facilities are best not used.  That is spelling out the stark facts of what CIE provide for those of us who use the passenger service to the west.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say yesterday that in terms of capital expenditure during the coming year CIE are arranging for the construction of 124 new carriages.  It certainly warms the cockles of my heart to realise that the rolling stock will be improving.  I am worried that as soon as these new carriages are available the people in the west will be told that we are getting the old Cork carriages, the old Limerick carriages or the old Kerry carriages but we will not get new carriages.  We will not be getting new engines, new dining cars or what we should be getting, namely what those travelling to other destinations in this country at the moment are getting.  It is high time that CIE ensured a certain equality of service for travellers to all parts of this country.  The train to the west is like &ldquo;Wanderley Wagon&rdquo;.  It is quite an exciting journey because you do not know what you will encounter on board.  The only thing that makes the experience bearable is the courtesy, service and kindness of the CIE staff on the train.</P>
    <P>The bus service is also inadequate.  The inadequacy in that regard again reflects an unbusinesslike approach by CIE.  I speak from a limited, parochial experience.  In the west Mayo area recently we had certain changes in bus timetables and in changing these timetables CIE have never had regard to the needs of the people who will be using the buses, or to where the buses are going, or why they are going there.  Certain buses travelling on pension days have been removed.  Certain buses travelling at times appropriate to bring people to services have been removed and in return <Col N="1392" /> we have buses travelling at times which are of little use to anybody and in consequence the bus service is not used.  In due course we will be told by CIE that if the service is not being used it will be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The rural bus service can and will be used if the service is provided at a time to suit the commuter.  The commuter is a consumer of a service and the service must be available at an appropriate time. In this regard also aggression and a businesslike approach is required of CIE.  If CIE have no interest in commuter services between small villages and small towns then they should tell us so and allow the private operator to provide those services.  If they are interested in providing the services they must get out, they must sell themselves and they must provide the services when they are required.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the schools buses.  It is appalling that these are used for limited purposes only.  There is tremendous capital investment here and that investment is left idle outside school hours.  These buses could be used for weekend purposes, for conveying people on special shopping expeditions to the larger shopping centres, to sports events and to all kinds of special events. A bus or a rail carriage should be kept moving at all times and I cannot see any justification for leaving capital equipment such as this static when it can be used beneficially.</P>
    <P>In this regard I want to refer to a controversy which recently arose in west Mayo.  CIE, who, I understand, control the transport of disabled children to schools for the disabled, are not willing to allow disabled children to be accompanied by a protector or a guide on these buses.  This issue received an amount of national publicity recently and I would like the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that CIE investigate it.  I believe that the disabled in travelling to schools on public transport should be accompanied and protected.</P>
    <P>These inadequacies in our public transport system are very damaging for a number of reasons.  In the west they are stifling industrial development.  They are <Col N="1393" /> preventing the use of the service by ordinary commuters and they are doing tremendous damage to our tourism.  We in the west in great measure are dependent on tourism and we find that the public transport authority do not make adequate services available to ensure that tourists can get in and out of our region easily or be transported with ease within the region.  In this regard, and in reference also to the school buses, I was appalled last summer to find that CIE were not able to provide tours for tourists within the Mayo-Galway region and that this service was provided very well by private operators.  That is despite the fact that many school buses which could be used for this purpose were lying idle.  As I have said, aggression and a businesslike approach are required.  Capital equipment in the form of buses should be used at all times and that is one example of proper use not being made of it.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my remarks I referred to a certain lack of public confidence in CIE that in great measure has been brought about by the uncertain industrial relations situation within that organisation.  That may not necessarily be the fault of CIE.  It may be the fault of successive Governments who have not grasped the industrial relations nettle, but the fact that industrial relations within CIE are much worse than the national average certainly begs some questions.  The unofficial strike last August which resulted in one man virtually holding up public transport within the west of Ireland is an indication of that.  The bus dispute in Dublin in the heavy shopping days immediately after Christmas was another indication.  While our trade unions have a great responsibility and while we may have different views as to whether that responsibility is discharged, there is also a responsibility with Government and with CIE to see that industrial relations within CIE are improved.</P>
    <P>Confidence in CIE can be restored in very simple ways.  I refer in particular to the condition of the railway stations. There was a time when travelling by rail was an exciting experience because one passed through very pleasant and well-decorated <Col N="1394" /> stations with attractive station gardens and a pleasant atmosphere. When one arrives at a railway station now one usually sees a drably painted, ill-decorated run-down building, and I cannot see why the youth who are being employed under various schemes from the point of view of work experience cannot be retained by CIE to maintain station buildings properly.  Such small matters convey a certain image to the public and that in turn can have a very definite bearing on the confidence which the public will have in a body such as CIE.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that CIE have a very definite role to play but they must be seen as a virile and vibrant organisation, taking their place within the overall transport arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper that Seanad Éireann should debate CIE, their financing and all the problems related to them.  As a nation we fall down when on the one hand we expect CIE to provide a social service which we do not support to the extent it deserves, and on the other hand we object to subsidising them.  Certainly we object to the volume of subsidising which has increased dramatically over the years.  I do not profess to have the answers to the problem of CIE, but then over the past decades experts and consultants have not solved the problem either.  In fact, it has worsened as the years progressed.  We all know that we are living in the era of the car.  Almost every home has a car and that in itself is clearly a deterrent to use of the public transport service and is adding to the problems of CIE.  Competition on a very wide scale from private enterprise in the transport of goods is adding to the problems.  We are in a very tight situation and one that is very difficult to solve, but solved it must be.  As a small nation we cannot continue to subsidise to the extent that we are doing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps now is an opportune time to examine the concept of not just a railway policy but a transport policy that would be of benefit to the nation.  It could be done easily enough from within the Department.  Surely they have at their <Col N="1395" /> disposal volumes of reports of all sizes and types from consultants.  They have the NESC Report and the famous &mdash; or infamous &mdash; McKinsey Report which cost, I believe, £0.5 million.  They have the Department committee reports; they have enough information to enable them within the four walls of that Department to produce a policy which would succeed and would be of benefit to the nation as a whole.  We just cannot go on subsidising CIE to the tune of over £100 million.  The subvention in 1978 was something less then £38 million.  Two years later, in 1980, it had increased to £80 million and now it is a little over £100 million.  It is time to cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; and to put a stop to this provision for future years.  Certainly any subvention given must be spent wisely and well by CIE.</P>
    <P>If reports such as the McKinsey Report call for many difficult decisions to be taken then they should be taken.  I believe that some of the McKinsey Report could be implemented and would be of tremendous benefit, even though it would be opposed bitterly and strongly by varying groups and particularly unions.  Industrial relations in CIE, particularly as regards the busmen, are appalling.  The ordinary man in the street cannot understand the attitude of one particular union in CIE. They seem to call strikes at the first opportunity and to hell with the consequences afterwards.  It is most unfair and unjust.  We should examine the reports available and the information which we have on countries such as Switzerland, which is probably the only country in Europe with a rail system that pays its way.  We should also examine the systems in Sweden and Scandinavia where travel by rail seems to be very attractive.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few local matters.  A new CIE station is being built in Athlone on the east bank of the river. It is planned to open this station in the near future, certainly within a year or two, and to close the existing station on the west bank.  Reasons have been given for this.  CIE are in such difficult financial straits, the taxpayer is continuously providing a subvention, the Government and all Governments have been over-generous <Col N="1396" /> over the years to CIE.  Despite all that I will never be able to appreciate the capital outlay on the building of this new station on the east bank of the River Shannon and the closing of the present station just across the river which has served the company and the people of the midlands very well for longer than I can remember.  The people of Athlone cannot understand the thinking of CIE, neither can the people in CIE in the midland Athlone region understand or appreciate the thinking behind this problem.  I know that a new bus station has been built close to the old one.  I do not think that is sufficient reason why what has been a perfectly good station serving the people well &mdash; many Senators in this House have passed through Athlone regularly and they would have to say that there is nothing wrong with the station there &mdash; should be closed in the future. I hope that CIE are not implying that CIE will stop on the east bank of Athlone, they will not go further over the River Shannon to Galway, Westport, Roscommon or wherever.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention rail freight transportation and in particular the question of safety.  I know CIE have a plan if a catastrophe should occur.  I am talking in particular about the rail transport of dangerous substance to Asahi in Killala.  Most of the towns through which this dangerous substance is brought, mostly at night time, have a plan to deal with a possible emergency and Athlone has a plan whereby the Army, the Garda, the local authority and CIE are involved should anything untoward happen.  We all hope that no such thing will ever happen, but it is important from time to time to have a thorough scrutiny of the safety measures.  This would be in the best interests of everybody.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the hotels.  Senator Lanigan said that CIE in some way had let down the hotel people. Perhaps it was not so; maybe the people of Ireland let them down because they did not use the hotels and if hotels are not being used by the people of the nation then closures will occur.  I and my family spent three summer vacations in the CIE hotel in Rosslare.  I found it extremely <Col N="1397" /> pleasant with excellent staff.  At the time of the bombings in the Gresham and the CIE hotels in Rosslare, Killarney and Galway, I happened to be unlucky in that the room in which I was staying with my family was bombed out by &ldquo;the freedom fighter from the North&rdquo;, as he was called at that time.  The attitude of CIE to me and my family and to all the other guests was excellent indeed.  They appreciated the fact that our holiday had been upset and they went out of their way to make things pleasant for the rest of our stay.  I hope that these hotels continue to flourish and if the people of Ireland use them then obviously they will flourish.</P>
    <P>CIE might consider a weekend special family rate which would be welcome for families who have not got cars.  People who live perhaps 80 miles from Salthill, County Galway, might like, on a fine Sunday, to buy a family ticket and go for the day to a place like Salthill, or perhaps to Dublin, or wherever.  It would bring extra revenue to CIE.  The limited use of school buses is a disgrace.  Here is an area where extra income can be found.</P>
    <P>The problems of CIE are huge.  I have asked for some national policy that could be formulated from within the Department.  I sincerely hope that something worthwhile will come out of this debate and I know that the wish of the Government, and the Irish people, who are the taxpayers, is that subventions of the size we have been making will stop once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening address said that everybody speaks of CIE in either good or bad terms and more often than not in the latter context.  Most people living in rural Ireland cannot take them in any context other than the context of complaints because of the type of service they provide.  Therein lies the greatest problem that CIE have as a company.  They have too many irons in the fire, they are a jack-of-all trades and, unfortunately, it is becoming more evident that they are master of none.  They are never shown to be successful in any of the operations in which they are involved.  The recent off-loading of the hotel enterprise, as Senator Fallon has <Col N="1398" /> mentioned, was necessary because the board of management of CIE with the problems of transport, freight and so on, could not successfully operate hotels which constitute a very rapidly changing scene in the commercial world of today. The managers and staff were doing fine promotional work and Senator Fallon said that the people of Ireland might have let down CIE in many instances, but the people of Ireland were compelled to let down the hotel side of it.  The ordinary Irish person or the tourist coming into the country could not, unless on a package tour, go into CIE accommodation because it was too expensive.  A CIE hotel standard lunch does not compare favourably in price with what other ordinary, commercial and private hotels charge.  With that and their involvement in passenger rail traffic, rail freight, urban passenger traffic, rural passenger traffic and school transport it is obvious that CIE are too unwieldy an organisation to operate successfully on all of these bases. If we are to stop complaining about CIE we must give them a chance to operate the things they know best how to operate or provide the services they can provide, and off-load some of the other millstones that are around their necks.</P>
      <P>Yesterday it was said here that school transport was profitable.  I believe that waiting in the wings are many commercial, private bus operators who would dearly love to see the day when CIE will off-load the school transport system into their hands.  It could be operated more flexibly than it is under CIE's hand at present.  When their bus inspectors have to use their very important time to come out and measure down to the last yard the distance between one catchment area to a school and another, no organisation could really carry on on a profitable basis providing that type of service.</P>
      <P>Many of the operations I have mentioned should not be taken globally under the broad heading of CIE, but should be taken away from CIE and put into private hands.  I do not call for the complete dismantling of CIE.  They have a function and let them fulfil it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any business person wants to travel from Galway to Dublin to do a day's <Col N="1399" /> business and travel down again he cannot do that effectively by public transport.  In that respect CIE have fallen down.  If they have a market research system within their company it must be outdated; certainly it is not efficient.  In the commercial world today orientation is completely towards marketing.  CIE have fallen down completely on the marketing scene.  I cannot for one moment see why 50-seater buses will travel many of the rural by-roads on a regular basis with only four or five passengers.  CIE must know that the number of passengers availing of that service regularly are very few.  I realise there are problems in negotiating with the unions, but it is time for unions, employees and management within CIE to stop the terrible rot of having 50-seater buses going down the highways and by-roads of rural Ireland when a mini-bus could operate such a service.  Many of the people availing of the service have free travel and it is good that the service is there to provide transport for them, but it is ridiculous to see a standard service operating with only a few passengers on the bus.  There is certainly a need there for negotiation with the unions.</P>
    <P>County Galway has taken a hammering through closures.  Ten years ago buses would leave Portumna for Dublin, Limerick and Galway on a daily basis. None of those services now exists.  The only service that exists is a once-weekly from Galway and anybody who would be forced into availing of that service would be taken around Woodford, Loughrea and Athenry and it goes higgledy-piggledy right off the course and could not be described as an efficient service.  The planners of routes have been mentioned several times in the debate.  I believe that they do not want to implement an efficient service.  To justify the closure of the Limerick to Sligo train service CIE ran parallel bus services, and that can be seen in their timetable schedule.  In other words, if a train was leaving Limerick for Sligo, they encouraged the road passenger service by providing a fast bus service, say, between Gort and Galway, running parallel and nobody would use the train <Col N="1400" /> service while a more convenient parallel service was available.  Competition within CIE between road and rail, could not be expected to be in any way profitable.  Such parallel services were unjustifiable.  Is anybody in CIE co-ordinating a plan for passenger services?  If there was, such a thing could not happen.  The only reason it was allowed to continue was to justify closure because of lack of passengers or freight for CIE.</P>
    <P>CIE have been said to provide a social service.  I cannot see how it can be so classified with the charges they are demanding.  A one-way ticket from Galway to Dublin today would cost something like £18.  A reduction of charges and fares across the board would attract people to use public transport.  Road traffic is heavy, the roads are deteriorating and the cost of motoring has escalated.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the social element involved in CIE and the services the company provides.  I was pointing out that while the need exists for that social element the services cannot be described as such because of the fares being demanded from the public.  The Minister during the course of his address suggested that CIE should develop the commercial ethos.  CIE is strangled in some way or other within its limitations from doing that.  For example the transfer of freight goods from a small station in any part of Ireland to Dublin involves a lot of paper work and many demands on the personnel involved and at the other end there are some trappings.  It would be very difficult to justify the commercial transfer of that item throughout the country with the duplication of receipts, identification and so on.  If a simple way is not found for such transfer CIE will also lose out on the freight services.  While we have the clear advantage of other door to door methods of delivering freight in the country, and in many instances more rapidly CIE cannot compete in that line either.</P>
      <P>There are other social elements involved in this.  If we take Dublin on a Friday evening, or if we take any part of the west on a Sunday evening, we will find that CIE is being outdone, and very blatantly outdone, by the private operators who can provide a service, mainly civil servants in Dublin who want to return home for the weekend.  They can do so at one-third of the cost that CIE do a similar journey for.  Those services are more flexible than CIE's in regard to times and routes.  Have CIE carried out market research at all to see why they are losing out on this very commercial aspect of transport for one section of the community at particular times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very opposite is the case in country areas where people want to come to Dublin on Saturdays.  Private bus operators &mdash; some of whom are not licensed but get over the legal aspect by organising trips on a club basis &mdash; can bring passengers to Dublin and back again for something like £5 of £6.  CIE's charge for a similar service would be something in the <Col N="1402" /> region of £20.  While we can say that that is so on the one hand for the private operators and demand similar things from CIE, CIE cannot in their present position do that or provide that kind of service.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to give subventions to CIE, or to increase them as the need arises year after year, it is time a halt was called and we should ask CIE to look at the biggest problem it has, which is its relationship with the unions.  Today we heard a comment on the rate of absenteeism within the CIE work force.  It is probable that the company cannot control that or demand any improvement without some sort of a walk-out, sit-in or whatever.  Most people say that busmen would leave their buses and ground everybody in Dublin city at the drop of a hat, for any excuse, but I do not believe that is completely true.  There is practically no job satisfaction at all in what workers are asked to do.</P>
    <P>Senator Kirwan, a former employee of CIE, outlined the very unsociable nature of the employment in many instances. CIE must come to terms with this and acknowledge in negotiations with the unions that there are different demands on the workers involved compared to many other types of employment in the semi-State sector.  There are great limitations.</P>
    <P>When we talk about commercial viability within CIE we must take note of the fact that despite the many closures throughout the country CIE still have, and retain &mdash; they are paying very high rates to local authorities &mdash; vast properties.  Any commercial operation could not and would not maintain such property and pay for it while it is not serving any purpose and is unlikely in the future to be of any use.  For example, many years after the spur line from Attymon to Loughrea was closed because of lack of use CIE still retain the line.  They have not maintained it.  The buildings were sold recently.  It is a pity that they were sold because the west of Ireland steam preservation group wanted them.  CIE have co-operated as far as possible with that group in restoring that line and the preservation group have been in constant <Col N="1403" /> contact with the company.  Credit is due to CIE for helping that group.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that many of the buildings which were so important in that instance have been sold.  It is unique that those buildings have been sold while in many other areas property has not been sold and is left lying derelict and costing money.  That property is in need of maintenance and the company must meet the great demand for rates.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for the Government to demand from CIE commercial viability while at the same time they ask them to maintain all services they are now involved in.  The onus is on CIE if they are to get out of that situation and not be classified, as they have been, as one of the greatest white elephants we have in the State with regard to financial losses, to create greater rapport with their workers and make sure that they are competitive.  Unfortunately, CIE are not competitive and in order to be maintained the company must demand more and more from the State's resources.  In other countries fares were reduced to attract people to use the public transport service.  CIE should do some research on this and introduce a pilot scheme.  The classic example is that when the division took place in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into two semi-State organisations, An Post and An Bord Telecom, the first thing An Post did was to encourage people to use the postal service with the penny letter.  We all know the great response there was to that.  One of the first things CIE should do, if they are going to start a new era, is to have one pilot scheme on a fairly general route and reduce the rates to see the response of the public.  Then we will be able to judge whether there is a real and genuine resistance towards the high fares CIE are now charging for any and all of the services.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look closely at the off-loading of some of the services that CIE are providing.  The company cannot justifiably in this day and age handle freight efficiently, particularly the type of freight being transported within the country.  CIE cannot hold on to that <Col N="1404" /> business on a commercial basis.  If we want the company to hold on to it we have to be prepared to back them up with financial assistance.  On these grounds we cannot complain that CIE are not doing it when they cannot do it without substantial Government subventions.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his speech yesterday complimented CIE.  He is very much in the minority when he compliments CIE.  The people who work and operate in CIE are the ones who have to take all the blame as regards the inefficiency that obtains within the company.  It is very unfair to the workers who operate the services that they should get all the criticism from all sides about poor carriages, trains being late, trains not arriving at all and trains not leaving on time.  All criticism is focused on the personnel in the local station or along the lines.  The whole system within CIE is wrong.  The system whereby they continued to accept down the years increases in their losses without taking corrective measures to try to offset the loss of millions of pounds to the Exchequer.  No other business, big or small, would be able to run on the same lines as CIE.  It is all right to say that they can compete but they must give a service.  Yesterday we heard that the plum bus routes were being taken up by private operators. After years and years of experience CIE should have brought their operations down to a fine art.  I am totally against decisions being taken in Dublin for small stations down the country.  A station master in his own catchment area should be allowed to run the business of that catchment area effectively and be responsible for it.  Only when questions regarding the overall requirements of additional transport, whether for freight or passengers, are raised should he have to apply to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I heard of an incident where an ordinary water tap failed to work.  The washer of that tap was gone.  Local officials had to get in touch with the regional officer who drove more than 60 miles to the location of the tap to have a look at it with another official.  They drove back 60 miles again and within about two months that tap was repaired.  That job <Col N="1405" /> could have been done by a local plumber if the station master was in charge of his own catchment area and his own station. That is the type of administration that exists in CIE.  Local officials have no control.  For example, if there is a delivery of Guinness and of cigarettes from Carrolls of Dundalk for a publican living in an isolated area, the CIE truck is unable to carry those cigarettes to that publican because he is bringing Guinness for the Guinness Group in Dublin.  Those cigarettes must be transported again on another day.  That kind of set-up is completely unrealistic.  No organisation could survive with such a system.</P>
    <P>The operations leave much to be desired.  CIE do not carry freight any more; they are not interested in it any more.  Most of the people have changed to private hauliers or general hauliers for their freight.  That has been lost to CIE who had a very lucrative freight business. It does not cost very much to run a special goods train to any location.  The cheapest way of transporting goods is by rail.  CIE have lost all this business to licensed hauliers.  That is a pity.  CIE do not tender for county council work in the different counties.</P>
    <P>Very little is left in the freight business for CIE.  They are not interested in cattle haulage, furniture removals, or the transport of artificial manures.  The tonnage in that field has increased considerably but it is all being transported now by road by private hauliers.  Tar which once came by rail is now being transported by road. The result of all this is that there has been 20 per cent reduction in the number of people employed by CIE. Employment figures would increase if the company continued to expand.  The only way they can do this is to operate the company on a regional or county basis with one official responsible.  At the moment nobody is responsible for anything that happens in CIE and one has to look to Dublin to seek the answers.  Dublin does not have the answers and the buck is passed from one person to the other.  Millions of pounds are being lost during the process.</P>
    <P>The day has come when people can be attracted to a public passenger service if they are given a fast and comfortable <Col N="1406" /> train at a cheap rate.  People would use the trains if fares were reduced.  When that happened some time ago all trains leaving the west and other parts of the country were full.  A reduction in the rail fares would keep the trains full.  In 1974 the Westport-Dublin line was promised a super-train.  The Minister's speech states that some coaches, dining car and generating vans will be coming off stream this year.  I am delighted to see a Minister of State from the west present.  He has problems in Sligo with the Sligo train and I am sure he knows what I am talking about.  At least some of the Sligo trains are much better than the one that operates to Westport.  Cork got a super-train almost 20 years ago and most of the routes to Limerick and Galway have also got super-trains.  The train to Westport leaves much to be desired.  One could get a mobile sauna bath in the morning leaving Westport because of the steam and condensation in some of the carriages. That occurs because of the way the heat and steam rushes through the carriages early in the morning.  One is not dry until one reaches Claremorris or Castlerea after the sauna.  The people of the west deserve more.  They are not getting much at the moment.  I appeal to the Minister of State, who is from the west, to do something this year to give us ten new coaches on the Westport-Dublin train, with one dining car and one generating van.  That is due since 1974 and I appeal to the Minister to give it the priority it needs.</P>
    <P>CIE are a national transport company. I agree with Senators who said that the private bus operators are getting the plum routes and leaving CIE to do the outlying, isolated ones.  That is something we will have to live with and try to compete with.  Where it is found that a route has not attracted passengers a smaller bus should be used.  If the routes and times were governed by the local station master he would run the buses at the best times and thereby compete with private operators.  I have no doubt that he would make the routes pay.</P>
    <P>Our school buses are very old.  There is some regulation to the effect that when a bus is over 20 years, it is no longer <Col N="1407" /> roadworthy.  Most of the buses used in the school transport scheme today are nearing that time.  Indeed, some have gone past the 20-year mark.  More money will have to be made available for replacements.  They can only last a certain length of time.  Some of the old maroon or red coloured buses are still in operation.  They should be replaced as they are well over the 20-year period.</P>
    <P>CIE have lost the freight business and it would be very hard to capture it again. I do not believe CIE are interested in carrying on that business any more.  They are not making any provision to give a service in certain regions.  Recently, when I travelled by CIE through Athlone, I noticed there was some development taking place on the east side of the Shannon.  The terminus station is on the Roscommon side of Athlone and some major developments are taking place on the east side of the Shannon there.  I would like to ask the Minister for what purpose is this development taking place?  Is there any intention of curtailing the service to the west and have the service finish on the east side of the Shannon rather than cross over the Shannon? I want to issue a warning that if that is in the pipeline, and if CIE management in Dublin are planning in the backrooms drawing-boards for that type of development I can assure them that is when the real people from the west will sit up and come to Dublin to ensure that that will not happen.  There is a development, it has not been spelled out for what purpose this new station is being provided &mdash; it seems to be a new terminal on the east side of Athlone &mdash; and I hope the Minister will tell the Seanad what type of development is envisaged in work being carried out at present.  Most people do not know what the purpose of this work is.  There is a doubt in people's minds that it may be used as a terminal for the east rather than a terminal for the west.  The trains may not be going across the Shannon in the years that lie ahead.  Will the Minister please reply to that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I had intended to say about CIE has already <Col N="1408" /> been said by other Senators.  The main theme expressed is one of dissatisfaction. It is the duty of public representatives to express the views of the people with regard to public services.  If an opinion poll was undertaken to ascertain what the public in general think of the services provided by CIE I think there would be a high vote of disapproval and dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>One of the major causes of dissatisfaction with CIE is the frequency of strikes within the company.  I am not going to apportion the blame to management or the unions, I do not know enough about it to be in a position to do that.  It is time that somebody got down to finding out what is the cause of the lack of harmony, of the friction, what is the cause of the massive loss of work days.  We were told yesterday that 50,000 days were lost since 1982 due to strike action.  That works out at an average of three days for every worker in the service.  We must take into account the huge amount of inconvenience these strikes cause to the fare-paying public and the amount of dissatisfaction they generate among taxpayers who see themselves contributing enormous sums of money year after year to maintain a service only to see it break down, very often at a time when services are most needed.  Strikes are very common during the Christmas and the holiday seasons.  In addition to causing dissatisfaction among the fare-paying public strikes militate against the development of tourism.</P>
      <P>There are responsible leaders in the trade union movement.  Some of them speak irresponsibly at times, the few rather than the many.  It is the duty of management and unions to come together and work out a formula that will ensure the maximum continuity of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After disputes wage increases, when granted, are made retrospective.  That should be borne in mind by workers before they go on strike.  We have a mechanism set up to see that justice is done.  People should be under an obligation to go to the tribunals or courts and to abide by their findings.  If they are not satisfied with the way things are done at <Col N="1409" /> this level an attempt should be made by the Oireachtas to amend the constitutions of these tribunals, to add to their functions, or whatever is necessary in order to ensure continuity of a dependable service so that a person can wake up every morning knowing that public transport will be there to take him or her to work and home again that evening.  It should also assist people who come to visit the country and who need to travel to the provinces for accommodation.  Too often that has not happened and this has given us a bad image abroad.  It has militated against the development of tourism in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This matter has assumed such proportions that it is the bounden duty of the top people on both sides to say this cannot continue, that the public will not tolerate it much longer.  It is their duty to come together and by a process of reasonable argument and discussion work out a formula that would ensure that these strikes will not recur so regularly.  Sometimes they occur for the flimsiest of reasons.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had a strike that arose from a dispute about who should change a bus wheel.  That had a great effect on the minds of taxpayers who are contributing up to £100 million a year to keep the services on the road.  It has an effect on the fare-paying public who believe that the fares are excessive but who would probably be more content to pay these high fares if they could have a reasonable expectation of continuity of service.  There is an obligation on the people at the top on both sides to come together in the realisation that this will not be accepted much longer, that they have that duty to the public, they owe it to those who pay the massive subvention to keep them on the road.  If that is not done, if it can be seen clearly that it will not be done, then I believe it is time that more scope for development was given to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>There are countless examples of private enterprise providing a good service to the people in areas where CIE do not provide a service.  That in itself is a condemnation of how the CIE services work: these private enterprises are providing a <Col N="1410" /> great service and they are making a reasonable profit as well as giving employment and earning a living for themselves.  When private enterprise services were developed these opportunities were there for CIE but they did not take them &mdash; CIE apparently did not care whether people wanted to go home for weekends or not.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan spoke about the service provided by private enterprise who bring buses to Dublin at weekends, to take people home and leave them back on time for work on Monday morning. That service was there for CIE to take up and develop but they did not do it.  If people could not get off from work an hour or two before finishing time to catch a bus at Store Street, or wherever, and if they could not make arrangements to be back on time for work on Monday morning by using the ordinary public transport, then they did not go home at all. Private enterprise saw that young people from provincial Ireland working in Dublin want to get home regularly, they saw there was a market there and they provided it and are providing it, to my knowledge at much less than half the fare CIE would charge if they attempted to provide the same service.</P>
    <P>That is a condemnation of CIE.  It probably arose from a refusal of workers to work late hours and so on.  Private enterprise came in and now collect young people in Parnell Square and other areas at roughly 6 o'clock on Friday evenings and bring them home, and the young people are using this service.  An operator I know personally collects a bus load of people in Parnell Square, takes them home to east Cavan and provides cars or smaller buses to take them from his Cavan terminal to their homes three or four miles away, and this is done at a very very reasonable fare.  It operates on Friday evenings and on Sunday evenings or Monday mornings.</P>
    <P>That opportunity was there for years but was not taken up by CIE.  If it had been taken up and developed at the same level as private enterprise can develop it, it would not be necessary for the taxpayer to contribute as much to keep CIE operating.  But because of CIE's lack of initiative <Col N="1411" /> and will to go out and look for work, the contribution by the taxpayer increases year after year.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan drew attention to the fact that these private bus owners provide services for GAA and other clubs on Sundays to take supporters to venues which are some distance from the clubs' home towns.  They do this at very reasonable fares and CIE could not compete because their charges would be too high. This is another example of the value of private enterprise and lack of initiative or determination on the part of people to look for business.  A company may be secure and subsidised by the Government.  If they go into the red the debts will be written off or they will be paid for by the State at the end of the year, and the company can continue to operate the following year as if they had been in the black.  While that tendency is there there is not the desire or dynamism to go out to get more work and make an honest effort to give a good service to justify the company's existence and, above all, to be worthy of the continuing support of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>CIE's timetables very often do not suit passengers.  I know of cases where CIE buses come into the main centre of a county from rural areas.  Very often people come in to visit patients in a hospital which is a mile or so outside the town.  They cannot spend even the briefest time shopping if they want to catch the bus home.  Some consideration should be given, especially on recognised shopping days and on hospital visiting days, to provide a service which would enable people from outlying areas to come into the town, visit the hospital, have a reasonable time for shopping and still be able to catch the bus home.  Slight adjustments in the timetable would enable that to be done and give the sort of satisfaction to the people that they are entitled to and are paying for but which they are not getting at the moment, directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which has drawn attention to the failure of CIE to measure up to expectations is the development of firms of private carriers.  I refer to a rather <Col N="1412" /> recent development in provincial Ireland where they have parcel collections by private people.  They take these parcels to Dublin and collect parcels for the return trip.  I know a number of people who are operating a thriving business in this way.  This was there for CIE if they wished to take it and were anxious to look for work.  If they had the conviction that if they were not getting work they could not survive they would be more prepared to look for work.  CIE cannot, <i>ad infinitum</i>, count on the taxpayer to pay through the nose for their lack of enterprise or efficiency.  These points should be placed before the people most closely associated with the development of CIE and taken in the context that what is being said in this House today is, in my honest opinion, a sincere reflection of what the public outside think.  If the public outside are thinking this, then it is time the bosses got down to some thinking about the public and see in what way CIE can give a better service to them and fulfil the role they were intended to fill the day the board were established, and in what way they can meet the changing circumstances of life in the country.  It should have occurred to CIE that with a growing migration of young people to Dublin for work they should have been providing a new service for them.  They should do whatever possible to take them back on Sunday evenings or Monday mornings and take them to their homes on Friday evenings.  That trend of mass movement from the provinces to Dublin for work has been going on for some time but as far as I can see CIE have done nothing to meet it but private enterprise has.</P>
    <P>The common argument being put forward by protagonists in the Córas Iompair Éireann system is that in addition to providing the transport needs of the community they provide a social service, that they put on transport to sparsely populated, remote areas where there is no hope of a profit making service being operated.  That is their stock-in-trade argument, and it is true to a degree. Because it is true to a degree it has been recognised by successive Governments and that has been the reason prevailing <Col N="1413" /> at the Cabinet table for the State subvention to CIE &mdash; to provide a social service by running buses into sparsely populated areas that are not likely to yield profits. I admit that this is very necessary, but the fact that CIE did not seek development in the other areas that I have drawn attention to proves conclusively that they are too inclined to sit back and say, &ldquo;We are all right; we are assured of State subventions if things do not go well during the year.  We are all assured of our jobs; we do not have to be successful; all we have to do is to maintain it as it is and we will all get our wage packets and our increments when they are due, and if increases are not up to schedule we will go on strike.&rdquo;  That is the approach, and the people are fed up with it.  The country cannot afford it and somebody has a responsibility to do something effective about it.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to one or two points which could be described as local issues.  I am not happy with the tours organised by CIE for tourists because they concentrate too much on certain parts of the country to the neglect of others.  In the lakeland district of Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Fermanagh, we believe that we do not get a fair deal in tourist promotion.  We have something to offer.  Anglers and people who enjoy pursuits of that kind feel that we have an unrivalled attraction.  That applies to Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, parts of Roscommon, Westmeath and Meath.  There are not many trips, if any, organised by CIE to cater for people who would like to visit those parts of the country.  Many people who would visit there do not because there is no reasonable transport system to take them there.  Instead they visit the parts of the country that get about 90 per cent of our tourists, that is, the south-west and up the west coast.  The rest of the country, with its own attractions that appeal to many people, does not get the support it should get.  To a degree, CIE are responsible for that.</P>
    <P>My last point is purely local, the CIE bus depot in Cavan town.  It is an old building in an advanced state of decay.  If it were not for the dedicated attention by the CIE employees in that town it would <Col N="1414" /> have become completely dilapidated before now.  We have been hoping for a number of years that CIE would build a new bus station there, as they undertook to do some years ago.  There is no immediate sign of that happening.  If you were to judge from the correspondence from Dundalk, which is the central area, it was more likely to happen three or four years ago than it is now.  The recession has been blamed for all our ills &mdash; it is responsible for some of them, but not all &mdash; is of course being blamed for the fact that we cannot get the bus station we are entitled to.  The bus station in Cavan pays its way. It does a great deal of business and in my opinion we should have the new station built.  I ask the Minister, if he has some influence with the people of Dundalk, to see that this urgent matter will be attended to in the near future rather than the distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the final remarks of Senator O'Brien, it would be fair to say that Cavan was fortunate to have a man there who was in total sympathy with their situation in 1980.  I am in total agreement with him on his stance that CIE tours seem to be going everywhere in Ireland except to the lakeland district.  We all know from the songs, &ldquo;Doonaree&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Seven Wonders&rdquo; and so on, that we never get a crack of the whip when it comes to CIE tours that are so very important to the hotel industry which was severely hit over the last three or four years.  The area is totally dependent on fishing in order to survive.  I support Senator O'Brien in his appeal to the Minister and the Government to keep in mind that not alone do we not get CIE tours but that many people unfortunately are going across the Border for their week-to-week shopping and business is so severely hit there that it is unbelievable that people can survive, not alone in the tourist business but in other lines of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This being the 150th anniversary of the coming to Ireland of the railway, I wonder, if the founders could come here now and look at the railways they set up, what their comments would be.  If tourists came to have a look at the famous West <Col N="1415" /> Clare railway, where the Percy French beautiful song originated, they would discover it does not exist at all.  It was a bad day for Ireland from a tourist point of view when railways like the West Clare were demolished.  There was a railway line around the beautiful Ring of Kerry and I often noted, while driving those roads, that it would be a wonderful idea if we could re-open that Ring of Kerry railway line.</P>
    <P>As a frequent traveller on the rail system from Dublin to Mullingar, I wish to say something about the Mullingar-Longford-Sligo link.  The Minister of State is very familiar with this train.  It is not a super-train.  As far as I know, other railway lines in Ireland have got supertrains and we are one of the last to get one.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that in no way could he say that the Dublin-Mullingar-Longford-Sligo train is a comfortable one.  I travel home on that train on Friday evenings and the cold in that train is unbelievable.  The windows are left open or are broken.  It is more suitable for a goods train than a passenger train.  It is no encouragement for anyone who would wish to use the rail system more often.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended a seminar in France and I had occasion to use the line from Marseilles to Cannes and from Cannes to Monte Carlo.  Some of our top officials in CIE should take a trip over there. They, also, are losing money but they can give a terrific service, including a service at the railway stations where there are clean, heated rooms and various facilities are available up to 12 midnight. In modern days this is the service we have to give our young, educated population.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien put his finger on it when he was talking about the services private enterprise can provide for our people going home from Dublin at the weekend.  Every Friday, around Parnell Square, you can see up to 20,000 people going home from there on buses.  While Senator O'Brien does not mention figures I know for a fact that the cost of travelling on those buses put on by private <Col N="1416" /> enterprise is as little as 30 per cent of CIE's charges.  They are delivering these customers to their crossroads if not to their doorsteps.  This is what CIE will have to look into and they will have to make it a more personal service because today you are in the market of selling.  It is a buyer's market today and if you can give a service at a competitive price you will get the customers.  There never were as many potential passengers available to travel by train or by bus as there are at the moment.  We have a young population and the cost of insurance for motor cars and maintaining and running those cars, let alone to make the repayments on them, is so high that it is far more suitable for them to have a convenient service at the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>A point I would like to make, which seems to me a very sensible point &mdash; I am talking as a former bus driver with CIE &mdash; is that around the country we see big 43-seater buses driving on routes with six and seven passengers daily.  We do not see this just on one day but every week from Mondays to Thursdays in particular.  I fail to see why CIE, who have all the data to provide them with information about routes around the country, cannot consider running a mini-bus service which would cut down on the cost of wear and tear and fuel consumption.  Every type of cost would be cut.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that CIE should do away with any route because there is a social obligation, as is well known, to provide a service for the underprivileged, especially for those people who are living in the remote parts of our island.  When we see big 43-seater buses driving around Ireland with six or seven people in them and we have many mini-buses that could drive around at approximately 25 per cent the cost of the diesel it takes to run these big buses, it does not make sense. In areas like this the Minister should ask his officials to see if this is possible.  Will the Minister ask CIE to improve the train service from Dublin to Sligo because it is deplorable?  I know what I am saying is true because I travel that line.</P>

      <P>I wish to <Col N="1418" /> place on the record of the House my thanks to the many Senators who participated in the debate.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity yesterday and today to hear virtually the entire debate on this motion.  It has confirmed the belief I have held over a very long period, coming to the Upper House as a journalist and subsequently on occasions as a Minister of State, that the general relaxed atmosphere here and reflective approach is very suitable to a debate of this kind.</P>
      <P>Many of the Senators had the opportunity of bringing to the House the benefit of their own experiences with CIE and also, of course, their own expertise in a whole variety of fields and, in addition &mdash; probably the most supportive thing of all &mdash; bringing to the House a reflection of what their constituents are saying.  I often think that pollsters and people who make soundings of public opinion could, in fact, save themselves a lot of money from time to time by just picking out a suitable cross-section of Senators and of Dáil Deputies &mdash; I am not saying this in regard to party political matters as, for instance, in this morning's papers &mdash; and, generally speaking, they would get a very accurate reflection.  We have had the benefit of that reflection during the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members, of course, did not confine themselves to the narrow or small issues but ranged over many of the very important wider issues which have to be considered in relation to CIE, general policy matters and long-term future.  Senators looked at such issues as the role of CIE and transport in Ireland and in our economy, whether the services provided generally represented good value, where, overall CIE were going, the level of direct State support for CIE and the adequacy or otherwise of the moneys now being made available to them.  The message came clearly to me that there is wide support for a realistic policy, where CIE's role is defined as clearly as possible.  The board must demonstrate their value to the community and the Government must bear their responsibilities in relation to CIE.  There is clear agreement that provision of a level of financial support <Col N="1419" /> for the social aspects of transport must be within the limits of what the taxpayer can afford to pay.  Understandably, I do not agree with everything that was said here. I am not including the Sligo train in that general statement but opposing views have their value also and often help to generate solutions to problems which are more generally acceptable.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to specific points raised during the course of the debate.  I will tend not to dwell so much on points where Senators agree with Government policy in relation to CIE or on specific points which fall for examination by CIE, but to answer questions raised and in giving general information.  One common theme was the need or capacity for the improvement by CIE in terms of finances and operations.  In this connection, Senator Hillery made an interesting case for the gradual privatisation of CIE's road passenger and road freight services.  It was a theme taken up by many other speakers, particularly as regards road passenger services.  We appeared to get two sides of the picture.  On the one hand, an appealing prospect of private operators busily competing, holding down costs, giving improved services and all at less cost to the consumer and at less cost to the taxpayer; on the other hand, we had Senator Kirwan painting a contrary view based on the unfettered competition of the private operations in the twenties. Senator McGuinness came along to give what might be the outcome of both those approaches.  I believe that our objective must be to provide within our limited resources the best possible public transport system regardless of whether it is public or private.</P>
    <P>The present legislative framework covering road passenger transport services was devised in the thirties to meet the conditions, naturally, of that time.  It has served us well but conditions have changed considerably since then. CIE through their road passenger services and despite the competition of the private buses and private cars, are still the largest bus operators in the country.  However, we must also recognise the resurgence of private bus companies <Col N="1420" /> which have become a force in the market place in the last ten years.  The possibility that private operators could have a larger role in passenger transport is something that we can no longer afford to overlook. We must be prepared to consider other possibilities also.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear and that is the need to review the restrictions in road passenger legislation which is now over 50 years old.  The Minister has initiated a comprehensive review of the 1932 Road Transport Act which, when completed, will provide a clear basis on which future policy in this area can be developed.  On the road freight side the Minister has been considering for some time recommendations on liberalising by the Transport Consultative Commission and is in the course of seeking Government approval for this approach to the issues raised by the commission.</P>
    <P>In summary there appears to be scope and a need for competition in public transport.  These matters, however, are complex and we must be careful to ensure that a situation is created where the level of investment and involvement in transport is commensurate with its role in the economy.</P>
    <P>Before passing on from the subject of privatisation of road passenger services, I should point out that there can often be something of a contradiction in the arguments put forward in the road passenger service area.  Indeed, that contradiction was manifested in Senator Hillery's overall approach yesterday.  He wants to preserve the railways subject to a review of services while giving free rein to the private sector on the road passenger side. The issue of the railways, which was raised by a number of Senators, is of particular importance since it is the railways which require by far the largest element of subvention.</P>
    <P>The losses being sustained by the railways bring me back again to the question of trying to define the social element in our public transport services.  This is a question which was raised by quite a number of Senators who asked for specific information in that area.  Senators, like all public representatives, must have a big interest in such a definition.  They <Col N="1421" /> mentioned relevant factors both in terms of hardship &mdash; some examples were given &mdash; to people who would suffer without particular services and in terms of present or potential passenger demand.  Certainly these are criteria to be considered.  However, our experience has been that it would be exceptionally difficult to quantify scientifically the social element of public transport services in such terms or on a basis that would be universally acceptable especially in the short-term. In these circumstances, therefore, the Government have adopted the only practicable alternative open to them.  This has meant defining their commitment to the maintenance of social service, not in terms of specific services but rather in terms of what Government can at the maximum afford to pay.  This, as already mentioned, is the basis on which the Government approved the subvention formula which, as the Senators know, gives CIE a subvention of the lesser of 50 per cent of revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure.  It is, of course, not ruled out that at some time in the future we may need to go into the social role of CIE in a more fundamental way.  Overall, I think the definition as outlined by me there and the general approach by the Minister and the Government will be beneficial to CIE and also a very clear cut recognition of the social element involved and that, of course, will continue to be involved.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of CIE's role in the freight market. Senator FitzGerald saw it as an area which could be developed usefully by CIE and Senator Ferris yesterday also touched on this aspect in connection with the exports from our meat factories. CIE's role in the freight market has changed very considerably over the past ten years or so and this was alluded to in many of the contributions.  Throughout the seventies there was very considerable reorganisation of and investment in the board's freight operations.  By and large, at present CIE's freight business is in the transport of bulk traffic such as Guinness, cement, mineral ores, fertilisers and dangerous bulk substances.  One form of traffic mentioned by Senators was the <Col N="1422" /> board's sundries rail freight which at one time was quite substantial.  Indeed, in this area there has been a dramatic change. This part of CIE's business declined through the seventies from something in the region of 200,000 tons to approximately 60,000 tons, a very dramatic change indeed.  This dramatic decline occurred mainly on account of competition from private sector road operators and also mechanisation of labour intensive activities.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey Report naturally figured very largely in the contributions as it must do in any general debate on CIE. It is in relation to the freight aspect of CIE's operations that McKinsey have made the most definitive proposals. Looking at McKinsey the most important point to remember about the report is that it is not an instant solution to immediate problems.  In fact, it takes the long-term perspective, an approach supported here by Senator Cregan amongst others.  The report addressing as it does the major long-term policy issues clearly requires mature consideration.  The new subvention arrangements are designed to give the Government and CIE the freedom from immediate financial crisis to consider the longer term issues raised by the McKinsey Report.</P>
    <P>A final point on the McKinsey Report that I think I should stress is the fact that the report did not recommend the closure or attenuation of the railway but presented a number of options as well as those in relation to complete closure.  I have noted the considerable reservations expressed by Senators Ferris, Kirwan and others as regards implementation of the McKinsey recommendations.  As I said a moment ago, McKinsey made a number of recommendations and presented a series of options without a specific recommendation in relation to the railways.  We must not be afraid &mdash; indeed it follows from the contributions here &mdash; to study the issues raised by McKinsey and having taken account of the views of the various interests concerned take any decisions which may be necessary in the long-term interest of the community, the development of the economy and the management of the State finances.  These <Col N="1423" /> should be our criteria.  The Minister made it clear in opening the debate that he has still to finalise his recommendations to Government and these will be made shortly after he has heard from the new chairman of CIE.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon raised the question of the development of a new national transport policy.  There is a great deal of confusion about this idea of an overall national transport policy and a great deal of loose and, indeed, facile thinking. People who refer to the need for a national plan or a national policy do not seem very anxious to say what exactly they have in mind.  It has to be remembered that while the transport industry is subject to a reasonable degree of regulation, the country's transport services are not all in State ownership nor are they under direct State control.</P>
    <P>When we talk of a national policy is it suggested that there should be greater central and public intervention in the transport industry?  Is it, for instance, envisaged that the State should determine which transport modes should be used for particular journeys in different types of traffic?  Those who apparently advocate an extension of State direction of transport and travel must face up to these questions.  The publication of some new form of plan will not in itself eliminate the losses on the railways, or improve the quality of transport services, or in some way serve as a panacea for all transport problems, problems which have defied and continued to defy solutions in almost every other country in the world.</P>
    <P>The new subvention arrangements for CIE make it clear that there is no lack of policy planning as far as the transport area is concerned.  The Minister since his appointment in late 1982 has devoted an enormous amount of attention to this area.  We are seeing the fruits of it and will continue to see the fruits of it in the very near future as he crystalises and finalises ideas and takes them to Government.</P>
    <P>Not unnaturally I share the concern expressed by many Senators from the west of Ireland about the quality and <Col N="1424" /> quantity of CIE services through the area.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Fallon raised the question of development work being carried out at Athlone station.  This development is part of the general development work being carried out by CIE.  I am sure that Senators will appreciate the need for this development, having regard to the inefficiencies involved in operating two railheads in a town the size of Athlone.  The developments, which are subject to the availability of capital, also take into account the need to reorganise transport facilities over the Athlone area.  I can allay absolutely the fears of Senator O'Toole that the improvement works being carried out in Athlone &mdash; I can assure the House as well &mdash; implies any sort of a withdrawal across the railway bridge of the Shannon or, indeed, across Custume Bridge or otherwise, from the west of Ireland.  In that respect, I am sure that Senator Andy O'Brien, who was complaining that his bus station was not being looked after in Cavan would be delighted if works were proceeding there.  I understand that CIE have a project planned for the bus station in Cavan and there is no doubt that, like many other things throughout the country, it is affected by the pressure on capital expenditure and this has prevented its development so far.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also &mdash; we have the personal experience of many Senators &mdash; told us of the rather interesting experience of being able to avail of a mobile sauna bath between Westport and Claremorris on his way to Dublin.  I can assure Senator O'Toole, lest he might have any apprehension in that area, that CIE have no intention of imposing any extra charge for this particular luxury on his way to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The new carriages being built at Inchicore will go a long way towards removing many of the complaints that we have and, hopefully, complaints we have about the western train going to Senator Cassidy's town and terminating in the capital of my constituency.  However, there will remain concern about transport services generally within the Connacht area.  In this connection Senators raised the possibility that CIE would get better results using <Col N="1425" /> smaller buses and a more flexible approach to services.  I sympathise with that view but I am not sure that it is valid to the extent that it would produce the result that many contributors thought it would.</P>
    <P>The suggestion about smaller buses is made because Senators acknowledge that in many cases mere handfuls of passengers are being carried on existing services.  This is the real problem that even the privatisation of the service or, indeed, the use of smaller buses, cannot resolve.  The difficulty is if the passengers are not there.  One does not need to be an economist to see that business without customers cannot survive without some special arrangements.  The CIE subvention is designed as that type of special arrangement.  However, we must not delude ourselves into believing that it can be stretched to cover every case of every hardship no matter how deserving.</P>
    <P>The question of school buses was also raised by a number of Senators.  The prospect of fleet replacement and the use of school buses at marginal cost for other purposes were among the issues touched on.  I share many of these concerns as, indeed, I am sure does the Minister for Education who is directly responsible for the school bus policy.  I have no doubt that the issues raised here will be considered by Government when consideration is being given to the replacement of the school bus fleet.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the House shares my concern and the Minister's concern about industrial relations in CIE.  Senator O'Brien based virtually his entire speech on this aspect before turning to a number of the local areas in his Cavan-Monaghan area.  The views expressed in the House are indeed but a reflection of the views expressed by many outside this House and outside CIE.  It is clear that public patience is fast running out.  I can assure the House that the Minister has made clear to all levels in CIE the need for improvement and he continues to impress on all the urgent need for a rapid and a big improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>On a small but very important point raised by Senator Fitzsimons, the question of the availability of CIE annual <Col N="1426" /> reports.  I can tell him that the reports for 1980, 1981 and 1982 were held up because of a problem associated with accounts of the hotel section of the industry and the CIE hotels subsidiary, as the Senator may be aware.  That has now been resolved and I am glad to be able to tell him that the accounts are being printed and will be ready for presentation to both Houses of the Oireachtas in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Durcan's remarks about the difficulty for the disabled travelling by CIE.  This is something which I am sure many Deputies and Senators have come across in their constituency work, perhaps not altogether in as acute a form as it came up in the particular case that the Senator mentioned and that received some national publicity recently.  The best procedure for me in this case is to forward a copy of the debate to the chairman of CIE and no doubt he will consider many specific operational questions raised by Senator Durcan and others in the course of this debate.  Generally speaking, because of the value of the debate as I see it, both the personal experience, the general experience and also the advice given, it would be very wise if CIE had a very close look at the entire report of this debate.  I often fear that in political discussions of one sort or another, in our discussions within the Houses of the Oireachtas where great ideas are made available by a variety of people bringing an enormous amount of expertise to bear on them, that they are never read by anyone.  One of the values arising out of this debate is that the report should, in fact, be read very carefully by the people who make the policy and by people who work for CIE.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat my thanks to Members of the House for presenting their criticisms and also, let me say their praise of CIE in many cases for a variety of things, and the proposals and approaches to change.  I admire their frankness even where I would find difficulty in agreeing with them on policy issues.  The debate means that the Minister will have the views of Senators on the record of the proceedings of the House as an input into his consideration <Col N="1427" /> of the long-term future of CIE and related matters.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, appalled at the continuous proliferation of nuclear weapons, concerned at the impact in particular of arms expenditure on the poor of the world, determined to do everything possible to contribute to the resolution of the war in Ireland and recognising the growing acknowledgement of non-violent action as a form of resistance, calls on the Government to pursue a policy of positive neutrality committed to anti-nuclearism, nonaggression and support for the oppressed of the world.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I would first of all like to say to the Senators who are here and to those who are not here that it is a mark of statesmanship never to be mean. After the misunderstanding of yesterday it is a tribute to my fellow Senators that they are prepared to have this motion debated today.  I regret very much, as does Senator Ryan, the misunderstanding that occurred and in particular that the Minister was inconvenienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very complex and inter-related motion.  There is too much in it to be debated in the time available.  Nevertheless, it brings up some of the difficulties of independent Senators.  In the motion we are dealing with neutrality, an anti-nuclear <Col N="1428" /> stance in the world, ecological problems and the questions I have alluded to of the war in Ireland and peace-making throughout the world. Before I go any further, lest there be any doubt about where I stand in relation to wording, in particular in relation to the amendment, I have here a book written by a fellow Ulsterman, Professor J. C. Beckett, <i>The Making of Modern Ireland,</i> which I am sure some Senators and even some people in the Public Gallery, under the chairmanship of an excellent tutor, have read.  It states and I quote:</P>
    <P>An English civil servant of the sixteenth century, writing gloomily about the state of Ireland, found support for his pessimism in a proverb: &lsquo;It is a proverb of old date, that the pride of France, the treason of England, and the war of Ireland, shall never have end.  Which proverb, touching the war of Ireland, is like alway to continue, without God set it in men's breasts to find some new remedy that never was found before.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that there is a war in Ireland.  I believe that as far as this century is concerned what is almost a hundred years' war started with the rising of the Ulster Volunteers.  You may not be aware that 25,000 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition were brought through the town of Larne in the year 1914.  There was a response immediately by a further bringing of arms into Howth in Dublin and the tragedy is that so many of those volunteers, on the grounds that Home Rule would be delivered to Ireland at the end of the 1914-18 war, went to France and died together, men in arms fighting at that stage for a common cause.  Since then we had the 1918 general election.  It was quite clear from that that one side thought that majority rule should be OK &mdash; that was the Irish Republicans &mdash; and another side thought, &ldquo;No, we want majority rule for ourselves&rdquo;.  They were the Northern Loyalists.  Somewhere along the line majority rule became confused with self-determination.  We had a treaty which, to quote a Presbyterian minister from the town in which I live, represented a form of Home <Col N="1429" /> Rule which the devil himself could not have invented, a treaty which down here was seen on the one hand as a denial of the right to majority rule and on the other hand as a compromise.  It dissatisfied us all.  There was a civil war here from which I would maintain you have not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>You should all know the rest of the history, but in case you do not I have here what have been in my attic for 15 years, 13 bottles.  I returned to my home on 15 August 1969 with those bottles and in each of them was a bullet.  The bullets were taken subsequently for analysis. Since then if you look at the situation in the North of Ireland what do you find? We find a casualty rate which has reached proportions which if exterpolated into Britain would mean somewhere in the region of 75,000 people killed and three-quarters of a million people as casualties.  Therefore, I do not use the term &ldquo;war&rdquo; inadvisedly.  Perhaps if I have time I will be able to return to the point I made at the start from J. C. Beckett's book that some fundamental change of heart will be needed in Ireland if we are even to come to terms with what is involved in order to resolve it so that you people in the Public Gallery will never again know or experience Irishmen fighting Irishmen in the name of some mythology or some cause, that we will be united in common cause.</P>
    <P>We have now got a new dimension to violence, the global dimension.  When we are referring to violence we must think of its global dimension, of its local dimension and of the violence that we all have inside ourselves in relation to our unresolved conflict.  The greatest irony of this century was that on 26 June 1945 the United Nations Charter was signed.  On 24 October 1945 that Charter became enacted.  Between those two dates, on 6 August, the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT, and 65,000 people were killed.  Since that date we have in the world accumulated between the USSR and the USA no less than 13,500 megatons or 13,500 million tons of TNT.  When we look at the build-up we ask ourselves what this deterrence is all about.  Within four years of <Col N="1430" /> the Hiroshima bomb the Russians had developed their bomb.  Then the Americans exploded the 15 megaton device at Bikini Atoll.  Then the Russians exploded a 60 megaton bomb.  Up to that time these bombs had to be delivered in long-range aircraft by human beings.  The Sputnik in 1957 heralded a new age of rocketry by which we could destroy populations by remote control.  The intercontinental ballistic missile was the next development.  It was estimated by Robert McNamara, who is responsible for strategy in the United States, that 400 of these would be enough to annihiliate one-third of the Russian population and two-thirds of her industry.</P>
    <P>Not long after, the thing escalated even further.  We have had the philosophy of mutually assured destruction since then. We had the development of anti-ballistic missiles.  We had a response to that by way of producing more missiles to get through the anti-ballistic screen, the development of decoys to deal with the anti-ballistic missiles and, finally, the most macabre development of all, the use of the anti-ballistic missile to deliver a nuclear missile.  The neutron bomb speaks of the philosophy, destroy life but preserve what man made as his memorial when there is no life left to appreciate it.</P>
    <P>It has not stopped even at that.  As recently as last year President Reagan, at a cost of $650 billion, brought forward a new programme of MX missiles which are specially mobile devices which can move the MIRV systems from one place to another and so, perhaps, produce some means of secondary response after initial attack.  No one can convince me that deterrence is a philosophy that makes sense.  It is like, as I said at a nuclear rally in Belfast, two men up to their knees in petrol fighting over who will strike the first match.</P>
    <P>You say Ireland will never suffer these things, we do not have the bomb.  Look at what happens when one explodes a one-megaton device at 6,000 feet above the earth's surface.  Within three seconds winds travelling at 200 miles an hour are to be detected within a three-mile radius. Not long afterwards, winds still travelling at 40 to 50 miles an hour can be detected <Col N="1431" /> some 20 miles away.  If you look at the fire of the explosion, you will be blinded, and you will get second degree burns, that is burns that require skin grafting on unexposed surfaces of the skin, nine to ten miles away from the explosion.</P>
    <P>Then you have the effects of radiation, not only immediate effects but the effects of fission products and dust that is sucked up by this enormous fire-ball into the stratosphere and the troposphere.  It does not matter whether the bombs are dropped in Moscow or New York, the effect will be the same for either if our madness allows us to go down that road. As far as the effects on you and me are concerned, you will have acute radiation, if you survive to begin with.  You will recover from that and in three to four weeks later it will return.  What does radiation mean?  Anyone who absorbs more than 5,000 rads &mdash; the physicists among you will know what that means &mdash; will die.  Within a mile of a megaton explosion you will get 10,000 rads.  Supposing one is far enough away to get fewer than 5,000 what will it mean? Ulceration of the body linings, bleeding from the cervices, sterility, baldness, leukaemia, cataract, cancers, particularly of the bone, malformed children, genetic mutations.  When we are talking about genetic mutations we must remember that if a recessive gene is affected it may not produce its weird manifestation in that generation.  It may be a number of generations before two recessive genes come together to manifest the abnormality which has been created by the mutation at the time of radiation.</P>
    <P>E. P. Thompson when lecturing in Dublin last year made the point that the peace-making movements in Europe were beginning to have an effect.  So great was their effect that the Americans were now thinking of systems which would be launched from the sea.  He made a further point.  The programme would involve the production of 6,000 Cruise missiles based at sea.  Ireland could no longer be spared from being part of the nuclear network. It is now thought that the Keflavik - Slyne Head - Mount Gabriel - Dublin - London radio network is in some way connected <Col N="1432" /> to the possible detection of the Tupolev 46 bombers, backfire bombers which could fire on Britain from 200 miles to the west.  Whether we like it or not then, we also are in the nuclear war zone.  That is why neutrality becomes important.  It is why passive resistance has also become important in a politically violent world.</P>
    <P>Let us look at our neutrality.  From the origins of this State, neutrality became a completely understandable assertion of its independence.  Let us look at the way in which the late Eamon de Valera distanced himself from the articles of the Treaty, the way in which Ireland developed its selfconscious neutrality during the last war.  Along with that, Ireland established a place for itself in the League of Nations.  Ireland also entered the United Nations in the fifties and has established its own independent role there.  Ireland is an independent member of the European Economic Community. Therefore, the old reason for neutrality no longer exists.</P>
    <P>There is a danger of making of neutrality, like so many other things in Ireland, a sanctimonious virtue.  We have heard Senator Michael Higgins talking in this Seanad about the possibility of creating an abortion-free zone.  I have mentioned that in medical terms, when you cannot be bothered, you want to pretend that there is no problem, you put on the chart NAD &mdash; nothing abnormal discovered.  Nuclear-free zone, abortion-free zone, divorce free zone, nothing abnormal discovered.  We can export our problems if we wish but do not let us think that we can export this one.</P>
    <P>Therefore what we are to do with our neutrality becomes more important than ever.  Are we to use it for a positive purpose throughout the world to bring the world to its senses?  I maintain that we can do that, provided we see neutrality as part of a political philosophy which starts with ourselves and which sees in passive resistance the greatest defence that the people of Ireland, if they can ever become united, can offer to any offensive invasion from outside.</P>
    <P>Let us unite with the non-aligned and other neutral nations of the world, the Switzerlands and the Swedens.  Let us <Col N="1433" /> form a network of positive neutrality, let us use the tremendous influence throughout the world of the Church networks to introduce the idea of positive neutrality everywhere, to challenge centralism wherever it is found.  In that context Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the great Soviet writer, has said when he was writing to the Soviet leaders about the need to decentralise the Soviet Union, that the centralisation of all forms of life of the mind was a monstrosity that amounted to spiritual murder.  We must take back responsibility for our own lives, for our own country, and in unifying this country create a message that can go out from Ireland to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Lest you feel that the Unionist population will not listen, it is from Britain that we recently heard from Colonel Johnathon Salford, Deputy Director of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Britain, and from none other than Lieutenant-General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley who was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces for Northern Europe, that a neutral Ireland was of far greater benefit to the defence of western Europe, let alone the defence of England, than an involved Ireland, particularly an Ireland at peace.  Our neutrality is tied up with the need to create unity and our unity will mean nothing unless we are neutral.  Furthermore, if we are not neutral, if we are aligned and become a pawn in the power-block game, this will become a very important element in the destabilisation of the country before a settlement and will remain an element for subversion and destabilisation in the aftermath of such.  I would implore the Minister to take the advice of at least one Senator that Ireland should espouse a philosophy of positive neutrality.</P>
    <P>Let us try to tie this up with two further elements.  We have mentioned the effects of the nuclear bomb.  We have mentioned the build-up, the need to stop it, the place for positive neutrality.  Let us also remember that nuclearism is related to that other great issue at present, the ecological challenge.  Never has there been greater pollution on earth or such worry about it as in recent times.  Since last <Col N="1434" /> October various articles in the English newspaper <i>The Times</i> about the pollution from Windscale have revealed that 0.005 of a microgram &mdash; which is too small for my mind to register but it may be all right for yours because you can understand these things and I do not &mdash; is enough to produce a lethal dose from plutonium, yet radioactive waste is being poured out of Windscale, to quote <i>The Times</i> at 2,000,000 gallons a day.  What is the half-life of plutonium?  It is 24,000 years. We read about mud with 100 times the amount of radioactivity is should have. We read about seaweed with 1,000 times the radioactivity is should have.  We read about slicks arriving on the shore between St. Bede's and Eskdale and we ask ourselves what about County Down?</P>
    <P>The ecology movement is a movement of your time.  It is the new green party.  It is the pro-life party of tomorrow.  If we are going to be truly pro-life we must develop a reverence for all life, animal, vegetable, human and maritime.  In that lies the kernel of the question if mankind with its 6,000 million people is going to survive.  Are we to have a philosophy that respects and affirms life and rejects the death slope on which we are placed at present?</P>
    <P>When I read the House that quotation from Professor J. C. Beckett's book I was thinking about our concept of self-determination.  Loyalists in the North of Ireland talk about the self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland.  Irish Republicans have talked about the right to self-determination of the people of Ireland.  The United Nations affirm their covenants on human rights in both, that self-determination is a human right.  How can a fundamental human right be such a recipe then for conflict rather than for the resolution of the conflict if the two sides in a warring situation are using it to sustain and to justify their conflict?  The reason, I would maintain, is that the right to self-determination is not an unqualified right.  The right to self-determination must always be related to the achievement of consensus.  The founding fathers of democracy and the Latin scholars among Senators may have read of Herodotus who in describing Cleisthenes' <Col N="1435" /> concept of democracy said democracy was about taking the people into partnership.  Where there is a feeling of partnership &mdash; in other words where there is consensus &mdash; then and then only do the majority have their rights, but where there is not a feeling of partnership, as today in Northern Ireland and in Ireland as a whole, where there is not this feeling of consensus, then majority vote may become majority rule which is not democratic if it is not based on trust and partnership.  Therefore, fellow Senators and young people, we must ask ourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, I offer my apologies.  We must ask ourselves if we can find in models elsewhere something that might be applicable to us in Ireland.  Look at Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Yugoslavia, the south Tyrol where you have autonomous regions inside autonomous provinces in part of a settled whole.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister, who was not here when I moved the motion, for coming after I so inconvenienced him yesterday.  As I said, the mark of a true statesman is that he has no meanness.  It would have been easy for Senators and easier still for the Minister to have decided, as there was this misunderstanding, that we should not have this debate. Therefore, I must thank him for coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is another dimension to our world problems.  Wherever there have been splits in consciousness, be it between reformation and counter-reformation, Islam and Christendom, Hindu and Islam, Judaism and Islam, where these have been developed in violence and have been almost sealed in their blood, no political solution on it own will produce an enduring solution.  It cannot deal with the psychological and spiritual by-products of the violence, the guilt and the falsehood which are immediately part of any violent action.  We need something further and I suggest that what we need is our holy men throughout the world to <Col N="1436" /> be courageous, imaginative and, for the sake of mankind and to redeem mankind for good feeling rather than bad, to step forward and stop talking about forgiving and to start asking for forgiveness.  As a Protestant Irishman standing in the Seanad at this terrible time for Ireland, but, equally, at a most anxious time for the whole world, I have no hesitation in saying that one thing my tradition has to ask Catholic Ireland for is forgiveness for attitudes which it showed towards Catholic Ireland in its history which sought to diminish, and at times to despise, our fellow countrymen.  I have said this before and I have said it on television.  I cannot implore people enough to ask themselves how will they expurgate the guilt that keeps the falsehood running which keeps the violence going from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence and conclude by imploring all to realise that I did not use, nor did Senator Ryan in supporting the motion, those words &ldquo;the war in Ireland&rdquo; inadvisedly.  I have tried to indicate why I feel there is a war in Ireland.  There are two wars.  There is a war in the North and there is the unresolved element between London and Dublin.  We cannot solve one without solving the other, they are interwined.  Unless we face up to that and stop using the Northern one to divert us from the other one we will go nowhere. As an Ulsterman in Ireland, and as a man proud to be an Irishman wherever I travel in the world, I hope and pray that I will see in my lifetime the end of that war referred to in Beckett's book so many centuries ago but we will not see it unless we apply ourselves to a peace-making, positive neutrality philosophy which takes into account the local issues, the national issues and the global issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Robb, I wish to record my great regret at the series of misunderstandings which led to my absence yesterday.  I apologise to Members for the misunderstandings and I am grateful to the Minister, as Senator Robb said so well, for being statesmanlike, to the Leader of the House and the Cathaoirleach, for facilitating us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> It is very difficult to follow Senator Robb on this or, indeed, on many other issues but what I would like to reiterate is the great need for a moral position on nuclear weapons, the great need to cease using political questions and considerations by Churchmen in particular and by Christians and religious people in general, to avoid confronting the moral horror of nuclear weapons.  This lead should not have to come from lay people like myself or, indeed, the Minister or anybody else.  The fundamental highlighting of the moral issue of nuclear weapons is a matter for those who are given the responsibility of teaching and explaining religious faith.</P>
    <P>It does not appear to me, as I have said so often before, that we have anything like the same detailed explicit expounding of Christian teaching in the area of nuclear weapons and nuclear warfare and the so-called idiotic, crazy, insane logic of nuclear deterrents as we have had on certain other issues in the recent past here.  Christian people are entitled to have their consciences challenged and questioned on this issue as on any other issue because fundamentally, and before all else, the question of nuclear weapons and nuclear war is a moral question.  The moral question is, can they ever under any circumstances be right?  I have no problem in answering that question because once the political considerations &mdash; and these are enormous &mdash; and the fears of the oppressor or the potential attacker &mdash; and these are also enormous &mdash; are separated from the moral question there can be only one answer and that is, no, no, no, nuclear weapons can never be used.  There could never be circumstances under which the use of those weapons against any society or any country could be justified.  There is no greater good which could justify it.  There is no lesser of two evils choice which could ever justify it.  Therefore, if we are to be consistent as Christians, the logic of that is that if we believe what we claim to believe then those whom we would claim to be our enemies must understand that we would never use those weapons in which case we might as well forget entirely about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> In that regard, having listened to Senator Robb's detailed and frightening account of the consequences of nuclear warfare, I can only regret &mdash; I am sure it was not deliberate &mdash; the apparent attempt by our Civil Defence agencies to more or less suggest to us the night after &ldquo;The Day After&rdquo; was shown on television that we really were not threatened by nuclear war, that we would probably escape with the less unpleasant consequences.  They are fundamentally, totally and categorically wrong.  If there is a nuclear war we will be victims the same as the rest of the northern hemisphere will be victims.  We cannot escape.  The statistical possibilities are so extreme, the likelihood of such devastation to the whole mechanisms of communication is such as to guarantee that the guidance systems of nuclear weapons will be completely cockeyed.  The fact that Windscale obviously will be a major target, and it is only 70 miles from Dublin, will guarantee it.  There is no logic to our Civil Defence philosophy and if the same amount of money was to be spent in educating our people about the fears of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear weapons to the world we could eventually develop a highly articulate and sensitive public opinion which would guarantee a very high level of concern about foreign affairs issues.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to deal exclusively with nuclear weapons on this issue.  The motion is, regrettably, long and complex because the issue is long and complex and there are inter-related issues.  The issue of world development and the issue of world oppression and the issue of world poverty are directly related to the question of armaments.  It has been estimated that 40 billion dollars would probably provide basic shelter, basic food, basic nutrition and basic medical supplies for all of the oppressed of the world.  It sounds like a huge sum of money until we realise that it is about one-twentieth of what we spend annually on armaments. There is not in any way a question of us not being able to afford to deal with the problems of injustice, oppression and poverty in the world.  We have the resources at our present levels of development to deal with oppression and <Col N="1439" /> injustice.  The problem is whether we will use those resources in the way they are intended to be used.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Commission estimated that on average one tax dollar in six in the world is used for armaments expenditure.  It is worth recording some of the figures produced in the document of the Catholic Commission on Justice and Peace on disarmament and development. They stated that the cost of one jet fighter would build 40,000 village health centres, that a half year's military expenditure would provide the basic needs of the entire world for ten years and that half a day's military expenditure would fund the entire World's Health Organisation's malaria eradication scheme.  Most, or a large number, of our chemists, physicists, engineers, and nuclear engineers in particular, are devoting their energies to military research.  Arms expenditure is also highly inflationary and it is not, contrary to many suggestions, a particularly efficient creator of employment.  The United States Department of Commerce has estimated that if the equivalent expenditure that is being spent on armaments in the United States was to be spent on education it would create two and a half times as many jobs.  There is no logic to the suggestion that the armaments industry is somehow a creator of jobs.  There are other more human, more necessary and more important issues to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was going to quote from the Brandt Commission because it makes one important point which should not be left out. On one occasion when I quoted this Report, when Senator Dooge was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he reminded me quite rightly that the Third World countries could in no way be excluded from the criticisms of arms expenditure.  It is one of the great tragedies of the world that the expenditure on armaments among Third World countries has increased faster than the expenditure on armaments elsewhere.  That is a question we are entitled to put to those countries and ask, why, again and again.  The Brandt Commission suggest that one of the reasons is a fairly sophisticated selling <Col N="1440" /> job being done by the wealthy countries of both East and West.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, one has to refer in passing to some suggestions that we are now beginning to try to cream off some of the funds that are available for defence expenditure around the world.  Our attempt is to co-ordinate our standards with those of the United States Department of Defence &mdash; I do not care whether it is the US or the Soviet Defence Department &mdash; and there is the suggestion that we will, without much thought, endeavour to create employment and wealth here through the armaments industry and that raises serious moral questions.  It would have to be, as it has been traditionally here, a Quaker who would resign his job in Waterford when he discovered that his employers were involved in the armaments industry.  It seems that the only section of the whole Christian church which has retained the original Christian conviction to peace and non-violence are the Quakers, or the Society of Friends.  It is impossible to separate, or to make a moral distinction between international drug trafficking and international arms trafficking.  One is as destructive, one is as amoral and as inhuman as the other.  We have no more right to be involved in arms industries and arms expenditure that we have to be involved in international drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb mentioned the controversial reference to the &ldquo;the war in Ireland&rdquo;.  His reasons almost explain it. I have an additional reason for using those words: that is to call into question the whole use and suggestion of the legitimacy of war, that somehow war is a more legitimate operation than some of the things that are done on occasions in other places.  War, of itself, is obscene.  There cannot be any gradations of war that are more or less acceptable.  All wars are obscene whether they have legitimacy or not, whether they have the support of all populations or not.  All wars are wrong and where violence is used, however mindlessly or however ruthlessly to achieve political ends, that is war.  There is no such thing as a noble or heroic war. The fact that hundreds of young conscripts <Col N="1441" /> had to be executed in the First World War in the trenches to persuade all the other conscripts to fight for their noble causes ought to underline that fact. There are very few willing heroes in war but there are many frightened conscripts in every war, frightened out of their wits.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the question of neutrality, I should like to say that this country has quite rightly denounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  It has quite rightly denounced the oppression of the people of Poland.  I wish we would, with equal conviction, denounce the terrorism that is being perpetrated against the population of Nicaragua by the United States Government.  That is the only word to describe it, terrorism in an attempt to destabilise a legitimate, good, caring and socially progressive Government in the economic interests of the United States. That is what positive neutrality means.  It means being willing to stand up for the truth in the world, to be able to stand up for values that we hold to be important irrespective of the great interests that are questioned by our commitment to those questions.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have to be so brief on an issue like this because so many questions arise.  A question that is worth raising here is why the heroes that we commemorate so vigorously are the ones who used violence on our behalf?  Why is Michael Davitt less a hero than Patrick Pearse?  Is it because he had the good fortune not to die for this country?  It was Michael Davitt who contributed so much to the liberation of the people of this country, so much in a method which did not resort to or use violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the commemorations and the history books underline in great depth those who died on our behalf.  I suggest that those who failed to use violence on our behalf are implicitly pushed down in the pantheon of Irish heroes.  Apparently, it is because of their recourse to non-violence.  I am <Col N="1442" /> not saying it is deliberate but I am saying that it is part of psychology and we would need to look at it.</P>
      <P>All of what I said would be assented to by anybody anywhere talking about disarmament.  I regret in a special way that when the United Nations' recent conference on disarmament proposed a scheme of education of the general public on the issue of arms limitations and disarmament that we, as a Government and a country, failed and refused to make any voluntary contribution to that scheme, allegedly because of the state of our public finances.  That, of course, is an important issue.  However, poverty-stricken, under-nourished India contributed. Arid, under-developed Mongolia contributed.  Norway contributed.  The much feared Soviet Union contributed 1.8 million rubles.  Bangladesh, Burma, Nigeria, Uganda and Vietnam all contributed to educate public opinion. We have decided to increase our defence expenditure by £30 million this year, 13 per cent over last year, 5 per cent above the rate of inflation, and we claim we could not contribute anything to the disarmament of the world.  It is not that we are poor in money but that we are poor in ideas.  I begin to wonder who is poorer, ourselves or Bangladesh.  At least they have a sense of the real issue that faces the world, the frightening threat of armaments.  When will we get our priorities right?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;resolution of&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;conflicts, and recognising the need to direct resources to the tasks of development, emphasises the need to pursue a policy of positive neutrality and opposition to nuclear armaments and calls on the Government to support development policies in solidarity with the oppressed of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the sentiments of this motion are, I think, shared by all Members of Seanad Éireann.  Unfortunately, to my mind, some of the language of the motion <Col N="1443" /> gives rise to difficulty largely because of its looseness.  What this amendment does is that it seeks to sharpen that wording, to produce an amended motion which should receive universal support in this House.  If I had been drafting a motion <i>ab initio</i> I would have drafted it somewhat differently but those of us who have put down this amendment have sought to avoid a wholesale replacement of the words of the motion and so the amendment is in the form in which it is.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb indicated that we have in this motion a complex of a number of issues.  This is creating a difficulty for all of us.  It created a difficulty for Senator Robb who had 30 minutes to find his way around that complexity.  The rest of us have only 15 minutes to do so.  Consequently, we cannot deal with all aspects of it and it is difficult to deal more than superficially with some of them.  There are a number of points that I would like to touch on.  I have heard Senator Robb, and Senator Ryan, on the question of the use of the term &ldquo;war in Ireland&rdquo; in a resolution of Seanad Éireann.  I cannot agree with them on this particular point. Senator Ryan makes the argument that all wars are wrong and because what is being done in Northern Ireland, and less often in this State, is wrong, we are free to call it war.  I am afraid that we will fall into a propaganda trap if we in this House use terms such as &ldquo;war in Ireland&rdquo;.  It will be interpreted by ill-intentioned people as if we are prepared to give belligerent rights to terrorists in Ireland and that I am not prepared to do this.</P>
    <P>Because of the complexity, I would prefer to talk about the global dimension of this problem.  On this, I agree with a great deal of what has been said.  Senator Robb said that deterrence does not make sense.  This has been the position of successive Irish Governments.  On our behalf successive Taoisigh and Ministers for Foreign Affairs have said this in the appropriate forum, that deterrence does not make sense, that deterrence is making less and less sense as armaments are built up and as we have creeping into this discussion the idea that it might be possible to talk of limited nuclear war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> The amended motion, equally with the original motion, condemns the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Let us be clear that we should deplore all aspects of proliferation.  The original narrower meaning of non-proliferation meant that no more countries were to be nuclear.  This is now referred to as horizonal proliferation.  We can well be proud of the work of the late Frank Aiken in bringing about, along with other like-minded people, the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  But what we have heard of this evening is what is sometimes referred to as vertical proliferation, an increase in the number of nuclear weapons, even in the countries that have nuclear weapons, an increase in the sophistication of these weapons, of the launching systems and of the guiding systems.</P>
    <P>The goal of the United Nations set down in 1961 is general and complete disarmament.  This was set down over 20 years ago.  We can look back at those 20 years and if we look at the future we can say it would take at least 20 years to achieve general and complete disarmament.  Indeed, here I do come back to a parallel with the problem of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  Our question here is, what is to be the first step?  Let us worry about first steps rather than last steps.  The arms race continued during those 20 years.  Indeed, there has been a sort of a positive feedback whereby the increase in armaments on both sides has now become not merely a consequence of international tension but a cause and a creator of international tension.  It is this whole situation which is feeding on itself to produce the intolerable position we have today.  We must continue at all times to urge practical steps &mdash; first of all, a slowing down, then a freezing, then a reduction and finally, a complete abandonment of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>This position has been stated well on our behalf and I pay tribute to successive Governments for the manner in which they have put disarmament to the forefront of their concerns at the United Nations and at other security meetings. In the Seanad we have an opportunity to support that policy of four elements: a substantial reduction of nuclear weapons, <Col N="1445" /> a negotiated moratorium on strategic nuclear weapons, a comprehensive test ban treaty and, fourthly, measures to avert the militarisation of outer space. The latter is something we supported and was proposed originally by the Soviet Union.  We have shown our real neutrality here in that we have taken up something which could reasonably have been said to have been originally a propoaganda ploy, a weapon being used by the Soviet Union against the United States.  However, in this particular issue of the militarisation of outer space, our Government were able to see that this was part of general disarmament and to support it.  When we talk of the horrors of nuclear war neither should we neglect the other aspects of disarmament.  This could well give rise to a further debate. Our record is good on matters such as the use of chemical weapons.  We have played a leading part here.</P>
    <P>In the motion and in the amendment proposed there is a reference to the resolution of conflicts.  When we look back over the past 20 years, since the first UN declaration on disarmament, we have seen in the world over 50 major wars.  We look around the world at the moment and we can see up to 50 armed conflicts, both major and minor, most of them minor.  It does appear as if there has been a complete failure by the U.N.  Let us look at that failure.  I would suggest that the failure has not been in the principles the United Nations have put forward or, indeed, in the institutional framework, but in a lack of political will arising from a lack of trust.  Here we see on the global scale the same problems that we can see on a smaller scale in the northern part of this island.</P>
    <P>There is a heavy onus on anybody proposing alternatives to the stand that our Government have taken to prove that these alternatives will do anything more to shift the position of the super powers, because that is the only way forward. Declaratory resolutions will get us nowhere.  Of course, declaratory resolutions and non-violent demonstrations can help in the movement towards changing the minds of the super powers if they truly reflect public opinion and they are <Col N="1446" /> balanced in their approach, but they are no substitute for constructive action within the United Nations and in other fora.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to other terms that are in the motion.  There is reference in the motion as well as in the amendment to positive neutrality.  In December 1981 this House debated neutrality.  It may well be that we could debate it again some time during this year, but unfortunately any deep debate on neutrality cannot really take place within the confines of this complex motion.  Neutrality is a legal concept and its meaning has now grown in common use well beyond its original and true meaning.  When we go on to positive neutrality, we find it being used in very different senses.  Some people use the term' &ldquo;positive neutrality&rdquo; in a rather technical sense to describe cases such as Austria in which neutrality arises in the context of the Austrian State Treaty of 1955.  Other people use the term &ldquo;positive neutrality&rdquo; to mean an active policy as against a passive policy of neutrality.  I gather that what Senator Ryan is putting forward is this sense of an active and balanced policy of neutrality and in that sense it certainly has my support.</P>
    <P>Our policy of neutrality is an active one.  We have played a positive and constructive role that would not be open to us if we were not neutral and using our position of neutrality actively.  We certainly are not indifferent.  At times within the United Nations context we have used sanctions against countries condemned in UN resolutions even though this would give rise to displeasure on the part of powers which are in other matters our friends.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to talk, in the few minutes that are left to me, about the problem of the use of global resources.  I agree entirely with Senator Brendan Ryan that one of the most horrible features of the armaments race is that it does involve the diversion of resources.  Not only is the arms race dangerous in itself but it is wasteful and an unjust diversion of the world's resources.  I have been concerned in my scientific and engineering work in recent months with the problems of <Col N="1447" /> drought in Africa.  I see clearly the situation whereby some 22 out of the 34 countries in Africa have experienced a long, continued drought situation and I look at the misery which arises from that situation and contrast that with the amount of the world resources devoted to armaments.  Millions of people throughout the world are being denied an elementary human right while this mad expenditure goes on.</P>
    <P>On the question of development aid, this indeed could be the subject of a separate debate.  I hope that the House will have an opportunity to debate this question rather fully either on the basis of a Private Members' motion or a Government motion.  There are many things we could discuss here.  To me, development aid is aid to the development of individuals, of human beings.  It is not the sale of machinery or the imposition of institutions.  This is the sense along which our policy has largely moved.  It is a way in which it could be continued and perhaps intensified.  The position of Ireland in international discussions has been clear.  I want to congratulate our Government on calling for global negotiations, for real constructive dialogue rather than the exchange of statements.  Such a continuation is urgently required.  I will finish by reminding Senators of the title of the Brandt Report which Senator Brendan Ryan referred to.  The title of the Brandt report was <i>North/South &mdash; A Programme for Survival.</i>  The survival to which the Brandt Report referred was not just a survival of the developing countries; it was a survival of the whole world.  What we have been talking about here is the survival of the whole world, which is one world, and for that we need disarmament and we need real development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I want to express my appreciation of the sponsors of the motion which made it possible for us, by proposing an amendment, to tease out some of the important issues that are involved and that are contained in the motion.  My response, and I agree with Senator Dooge in this, is that <Col N="1448" /> it is necessary to anticipate interpretation of some of the words in the original motion.  That anticipation has not been acknowledged and the clarification suggested in the amendment, I hope, will be accepted in the spirit in which it is offered.  I want immediately to recognise the integrated nature of the contributions that have been made, particularly by Senator Robb.  It seems to me that Senator Robb is pursuing a principle of integration.  It is rarely that we can speak about there being a mentality of violence and a mentality of peace.</P>
      <P>In the brief few minutes available to me I do not intend to move away from what I think are some important points of principle that need to be established. One of the problems that face us is that in having a comprehensive approach within international affairs that can recognise that tied together with the threat of war and destruction is an economic structure that regularly condemns people to death.  Tied together with both this political and economic horrific stage of development to which humanity has descended is a structure of mind.  It is most important to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>It is not too fanciful to suggest that if you live in a world that accepts that as normal, as an inescapable fact that cannot be answered or avoided, you live with the possibility of global destruction.  Inevitably &mdash; it is not an abstract point &mdash; it reduces the commitment to other life sustaining activities that are far short of such a global catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go much further with some specific points in relation to what Senator Robb has suggested.  If you are to move away from the mentality of war and the economic and social thinking that sustains it, you have to come to terms with building and indentifying the bases, both nationally and internationally, for an alternative structure of peace.  It would be fanciful to suggest that the existing relationship between the developed and the undeveloped world in any way could be regarded as an appropriate economic base for evolving a new peace.  Even in the best intentioned aspects of economic thinking of the developed world, where it seeks to establish development cooperation <Col N="1449" /> and development policy, without much examination one can see that sometimes it does not give the appropriate levels of aid.  Even where it gives aid, it excludes people from trade.  Even when it discusses technology transfer it often stops far short of the generosity which is required to allow people to develop in their own way at their own pace to provide for their individual needs.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers referred to the 6,000 million people who will comprise the world population before the end of the current century.  It is important to bear in mind that this increase in population will take place in parts of the world where people have little prospect of living past the third decade.  For example, in 1978, 30 million children under the age of five years died from malnutrition.  Figures are only too well known, and now it has become counter-productive to stress that 40,000 children die every day.  Of these 40,000, 7,000 could be assisted immediately should resources be made available for such innovative techniques as oral rehydration therapy and so on, and the new forms of vaccination that are now possible.</P>
    <P>What we have seen at a global level is that when technology became available for saving the lives of children, the super powers' contribution overall to aid was in fact falling, first reaching a plateau about 1979 and falling in all the last two to three years.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the commitment of the Labour Party to this question, and to take up some specific points.  Our commitment has been to an integrated approach that sees the economic issues of development inextricably linked with the wasteful expenditure on armaments. I do not want to put a tooth in it: how can we listen to presidents and heads of states, the most powerful in the world, use terms like human rights, development and democracy when they preside over war machines that far from reducing threats to all of us are expanding daily? I refer to the super powers equally, but in my personal view I think the United States at present represent a more serious threat to peace.</P>
    <P>In relation to neutrality, I think there <Col N="1450" /> is an advantage in this resolution that we should bear in mind.  It is sometimes suggested that we have had a position on neutrality that was perfectly acceptable and that now somehow or another it is being chipped away and we will have, rather like a tattered coat, a lesser version of it.  I claim that, looking at the history of the Labour Party's views on neutrality, I have already suggested that the Labour Party's concern about neutrality was expressed by James Connolly in 1914 as President of the Irish Neutrality League. Many other statements were made by the Labour Party.  For example, at the international Socialist Conference in Berne in 1919 Tom Johnson asserted the position of the Labour Party.  In 1928 he emphasised these points.  My predecessor, Michael Keyes, in 1941 told the annual conference of the party in his chairman's address:</P>
    <P>As a neutral country we have no war aims to declare, but neutrality itself is an important aim.  It has been the aim of the Labour Party from its inception. We proclaimed it in Parliament, in party conferences and in election manifestos.  We proclaimed it when others who applaud it today were discussing the conditions under which the country might participate in a European war.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this to make the point yet again that in relation to the position of the Labour Party our acceptance of the concept of neutrality is not hedged around with conditions and in our party conference document in 1975 we went on to specify what we mean by positive neutrality.  Senator Dooge was correct to ask what people mean by concepts such as positive neutrality and active neutrality. It has been the position of the Labour Party since 1978 that we believe in prosecuting neutrality as a concept internationally, initially through increased contacts with a neutral group of nations and then by a more positive approach and later adhesion to the non-aligned nations of the world.</P>
    <P>We believe also it is important that if you say you are going to be neutral you must understand that to achieve this &ldquo;mind of peace&rdquo; which Senator Robb is <Col N="1451" /> indicating you must build it as part of the normal experience of people, that is, that there should be an educational programme that can explain and allow to be debated what the different versions of neutrality are.  It is important also, should it be necessary &mdash; and it is a contentious suggestion but it is the position of my own party &mdash; that the principle of neutrality must be regarded as something that should be protected constitutionally.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion before us.  In a curious way I see the logic behind the approach that the proposals intended.  It is that at the end of the day the regularity with which people can kill, the regularity with which people can remain silent and support killing, in itself is an example of a diseased mentality in which fear has corroded people and has immobilised them into giving support for the loss of lives.  It is a courageous thing to reach into the darker part of ourselves and try to identify that fear that either allows us to give overt or tacit support to the taking of lives.  That fear at individual, social and collective levels within nations is something that is simply amplified at international level.  When I look at the proceedings of international conferences I have detected in recent years the weariness with which some of the offerings are put forward, as if language itself had become bankrupt of meaning, where tyrants speak of human rights, where people speak about human rights in Central America, as President Reagan has done, while deploying ships to blockade a country that wants to pursue its independent path to development.</P>
    <P>In the amendment there is an important word and I hope its movers will take it up in the spirit in which it is offered.  It suggests that we support development policies that are in solidarity with the oppressed of the world.  This recognises the sovereign right of the undeveloped countries both to see, establish and pursue their development path separate from any forms of dependency or leanings on people who may be donors to them in relation to trade, aid and assistance.  It is the building in of that principle we have been so often asked for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> I am glad the Minister is here because we have tangible things we can do.  The negotiations for the third Lomé are shortly to be resumed and we must always remind ourselves that sitting across the table will be the representatives of ten nations, the average to lowest income of which is hardly ever below 6,000 dollars, and that sitting across the table will be 70 nations the average income of whom will perhaps not reach 300 dollars a year.  The ratio is 20:1.</P>
    <P>I favour the development of a debate about the quality of mind that sustains oppression and violence in all of its institutionalised forms, and let me say, even controversially, it was at the heart of colonisation in its thrust, when you produced in the colonised the fearful corollary of what was your own tyrranical impulse.  It is necessary now that this be broken, and this is where Ireland is so important.  Before we write ourselves off and say we are only a small country, and of course we are terribly dependent on industrialisation strategy and on the location decisions of other large industrial countries &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; there is no limit to the moral achievement which a country like Ireland can gain.  I am not lifting the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; out of the world political.  I think that in a curious way we have been shocked by the possibilities of global warfare.  I want to remind this House of what is fundamental.  If you look at the history of human rights you will find that it took the death camps in the Second World War to make people establish declarations in which they said we will never sink to that level again.  It was at least a part of the atmosphere for human rights declarations and evolutions.  We have been seeing regular famine, regular hunger, child malnutrition, the right to bomb countries.  Nicaragua was referred to by Senator Ryan. It enjoyed only a brief three years of democracy in a century of dictatorship. They have been told: &ldquo;Our strategic <Col N="1453" /> interest requires us, no matter what you do, to make you bend the knee because you are our backyard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take the thinking behind Senator Robb's motion which is that when we have abolished backyards, when we realise that we jointly live in either peace or fear, then it is appropriate to begin at home and to look at the fear that has given us the horrific loss of life in Ireland, North and South, and to look at the fear that we can do so much to eliminate, however small we are, at international level.  I hope the principles of this discussion will be brought to fruition by the Minister in the negotiations to come particularly in relation to aid and trade.</P>

      <P>Since there is an amendment down which enables statements to be made by me and by the Chairman of the Labour Party the Minister thought it more appropriate that he should listen to a number of Senators and that he should make his contribution relatively late in the debate.  He hopes to be with us when we resume the debate and to comment on the points we raised.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that I would show support for the amendment on this side and that if the Minister wishes to reply now I would be given an opportunity at a later stage to speak.  That is purely a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to refer to that splendid address from Senator Robb.  It was frightening, knowledgeable and sincere and it showed that he has an obvious hatred of violence.  Unfortunately it is much too complex a problem to take on this amendment and deal with just one part of it and to deal with the North of Ireland in the few minutes that are available <Col N="1454" /> to us.  I congratulate Senator Robb on all the things he said.  Amazingly in 30 minutes he was able to cover so much ground and deal with so many things.</P>
    <P>To deal with the many Irish problems, not just alone the North of Ireland, as we are talking about it at the moment, one has to go away back in history.  I recall when President Kennedy was here.  He said many significant things but there was one thing that he said in Galway that stuck in my mind.  That was that what really amazed him since he came here was the fact that what happened 100 years ago was only yesterday as far as the Irish people were concerned.  I remember noting that indeed he was so right.  Senator Robb covered many things including that most tragic part of our history, the Civil War, and certainly one never wants to re-open Treaty debates in this or the other House.  There were many tragedies of that Civil War but the greatest was that it has kept so many good men apart for far too long.</P>
    <P>The issues in the North of Ireland are historical and national and local.  It is so difficult to deal with them.  Fortunately we have at present the New Ireland Forum.  It is difficult to find a word to describe what I feel for the Forum.  There will be results from the Forum, and in speaking of the Forum, I express the hope that it will bring about a change of attitudes, open discussion and meaningful dialogue.  I have heard so far, and as far as I can see, the end result will be a very good one.  It will be difficult for me in this House, when I am referring to the Forum, not to say that this House takes particular pride in the fact that one person has put much work into it and in my view is responsible for the good that has come out of it &mdash; I am, of course, speaking of the Clerk of the Seanad who is also a major figure in the administration of the Forum at present.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the easiest motions and amendments ever to come before this House, to speak to.  One could cover it in a single sentence and say the thought of nuclear warfare is so terrible that it must not happen.  There is not a person in the world who would not say it <Col N="1455" /> must not happen.  Recently some young people representing Ireland were in Russia and as it happened my daughter was one of them.  She told me that the biggest fear of young people and the one thing they wanted to talk about in Russia was the threat of nuclear war and the fear that they had in regard to it.  I am quite certain the same fear exists in the young people of the US and of other countries.</P>
    <P>What is it that makes one race better than the other?  Each one distrusts the other, each one builds up more weaponry, each feels it has to equal the other in the arms race, or pass it out.  What type of money is it costing?  I am not concerned about the actual money figures.  I am concerned about the amount of money that could be used otherwise.  I have a figure which I think is taken from a speech made by the Minister.  He used a figure of more than one million US dollars being spent worldwide every minute for military purposes.  One thinks of Mother Teresa, for instance, and all she has to cope with and all she is trying to do and the love she preaches and the love in her work but she cannot cope with the terrible problems where she is, the starvation and the disease and unwanted children.</P>
    <P>A person could paint a most horrible picture.  If somebody only decided to spend in The Third World, the money devoted to armaments look at the beautiful picture one could paint of people receiving what they had never received before, what they do not understand exists in the world.  They do not realise that there are things beyond the bare necessities.  They do not understand these things because they never had them.</P>
    <P>Yet the enormous amount of money being spent on destroying the world which could be used for such wonderful things throughout the world makes one sick.  Why do people do it?  People say that nobody will ever press the button, that nobody will ever start a nuclear war, <Col N="1456" /> that they are not that mad.  People are mad and in my time I have known of two madmen, Hitler and Stalin, two powerful world leaders.  People say madmen can never get into power.  There were two of them in our time.  They were not the only two.  Madmen get into positions of power.</P>
    <P>People say that this cannot happen.  Of course it can happen.  One can only pray that it will not happen.  It is the most frightening thought.  The picture painted by Senator Robb was so terribly frightening and the reason it was so frightening is that it is true.  All through the ages there were wars, some in the name of religion.  All through the ages up to the present we have had wars in the name of religion.  In the Lebanon, right through the Middle East, you will find them.  They include the Crusades.  When Christ was on earth all He ever did was to preach kindness and good and non-violence, and yet everything is done in the name of religion.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb said if the neutron bomb were used nothing would be left; that the purpose of neutron bombs is to destroy people and only leave what was made by man.  He was not quite accurate: all that would be left would be what God made because that we cannot destroy.  I can give the size of the bomb that was used on Hiroshima.  One bomb today would destroy one million Hiroshimas.  Today, there are sufficient nuclear weapons to bring about the end of life on this planet. When that war is over &mdash; please God it will never happen &mdash; I do not know where it will end, I do not know whether it will be defending the walls of Jerusalem or what, there will be no parades and there will be no medals and there will be no winners because there will be no people.</P>
