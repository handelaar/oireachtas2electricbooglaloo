      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It is not anticipated that No. 1 will take a great deal of time and it is proposed that No. 2 be taken until 4 p.m.  At that time we should resume discussion on the Report Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.  The hope would be that that Bill should pass all Stages some time this evening.  Might I add, in regard to No. 2, that if the debate on the Report of the New Ireland Forum is not concluded, it will be resumed on the next sitting day.  We have agreed to four-and-a-half hours' time, but there was general agreement that we could be flexible on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has made no statement here this morning and due to the fact that I raised queries on both Second and Committee <Col N="1076" /> Stages, I believe that if we are entrusted with the duties to legislate, we have the responsibility to ensure that any legislation enacted through this House should be fair and just.  While I am entrusted with that duty I intend, as a Member of the Seanad, to ensure that this will be done and, as far as I can see fit, to influence any legislation that is enacted here.</P>
      <P>For instance, I queried if there were in the Act in-built safeguards whereby groups or individuals performing works for non-profit or works of a charitable nature would be protected and exempted under the main provisions of the Act.  So far, the Minister has failed to satisfy me, at least, on this issue alone.  I queried certain aspects of this Bill under whose main provisions I feel certain that anomalies exist.  If such measures are not included in the Bill, then I feel obliged to term the legislation as it stands as being socially unjust and therefore unacceptable, to me anyway.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us has not clearly defined the categories of people or groups mentioned on Second and Committee Stages which could or would be protected. Worse than that, it has clouded the issue and has raised doubts, in my mind and in the minds of many other people, as to who would or could be guilty of a criminal offence under the Bill. Also, statements made by the Minister and at least one eminent speaker from the Government side of the House left the matter to the discretion of the courts to decide who would or would not be guilty of such an offence.  What has happened, in fact, is that in trying to introduce what we all agree is much needed and urgent legislation, this Bill has failed to properly define or segregate the hardened criminal from the ordinary law-abiding citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister proposes to do is to give <i>carte blanche</i> to one single organisation to go after and get, by any means they see fit, what they might feel or maintain should be their share of the stakes, even to the extent that people feel or might feel that their constitutional rights are being infringed.  For instance, if people manage their affairs in business in <Col N="1077" /> a proper manner in their own premises, having paid for a radio and television licence for their own personal comfort and use to which they are entitled and in doing so are deemed to be in contravention of this Bill, are they not entitled to feel that their constitutional rights are being infringed?  I will give you an example of what I am referring to and quote part of a letter from a firm of solicitors who issued such a demand to a publican who has&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to rule you out of order but actually what we should discuss on this Stage and the last Stage is the text of the Bill.  Keep that in mind.  I am not saying that you are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep that in mind. This very short quotation should have a bearing on the text of the Bill as it stands. I quote one sentence:</P>
      <P>We note you state in your letter that the radio and television are used for News and Racing only, but the evidence of infringement obtained does not support this assertion.</P>
      <P>This is the particular point&mdash;</P>
      <P>Furthermore, News and Racing items are commenced with and ended with advertising and musical jingles which are very valuable copyright, the property of our clients.</P>
      <P>The thin end of the wedge comes in then&mdash;</P>
      <P>We trust you will now accept the terms of settlement offered in our letter of the 23rd ultimo without recourse to proceedings.  Please note that unless these terms are accepted in full proceedings will be instituted against you without further notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quotation is from a copy of an original letter from a firm of solicitors.  It was suggested that people had the right to go to court and defend themselves, which every citizen has.  I maintain that we should not enact legislation that gives these people the right to bring others to court for a matter such as this, especially as RTE are already paying almost half a <Col N="1078" /> million pounds in copyrights annually.  I wonder will this Bill, if it is passed, be referred to the courts to test its constitutionality? I maintain that the constitutional rights of the citizen are being infringed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go back to the drawing-board, to get his priorities right to segregate the good guys from the bad guys and to introduce a Bill that will deal properly with the problem for which it was originally intended, or at least for which purpose we were led to believe it was intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few queries to put to the Minister.  I was mainly responsible for ensuring that we would have an opportunity to discuss this Bill today as the Committee Stage was taken on 13 September last.  I contemplated the possibility of putting down an amendment to the Bill, but I advised the Minister and his Department of my views on the matter and suggested that the amendment should come from the Minister.  I received a letter from the Minister which tells me that there are technical difficulties in phrasing the amendment that would be necessary to deal with the difficulties I foresaw and which I believe exist.  I am satisfied, having brought the matter to the attention of the Minister and his Department, that I have discharged my duty.  This is one of the issues on which I would like the Minister to comment.  I am satisfied that should my fears prove to be well founded, we can have an assurance that the situation will be taken in hand by the Minister or by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I re-echo a lot of the points made by Senator Lynch.  This measure started as a narrow-based one solely to deal with the video pirates but it developed implications that are far beyond that field. These implications passed unnoticed in the other House, but here we can take credit for having identified these weaknesses. It is a matter to be put on record, in fairness to the Minister of State and the senior Minister in the Department, that these weaknesses were accepted as being there and the Minister, by bringing in amendment No. 6, dealt with one of <Col N="1079" /> those weaknesses.  I want to acknowledge that it is to the credit of both Ministers that there was a willingness to look at these particular weaknesses.  The one thing that emerged from this measure is that, narrow-based as it was and despite the further implications that developed as it progressed, it has provided an opportunity of raising the difficulties to which copyrights have given rise to.</P>
    <P>My concern has been mentioned more than once in the discussion on this legislation. If I am interpreting correctly what I heard, I could summarise it as follows: the responsibility of the Minister in bringing in the legislation, is solely and entirely to protect the right of copyright owners. That I do not accept.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we would be in conflict with the principles on which our legislation is based but if we regard our duty as being confined to the protection of the interests of one particular side on any issue, and if we totally ignore the interests of the other side &mdash; because there is another side and that other side was accepted in the 1963 Act &mdash; I would hope that the House will be reassured that the legitimate interests of all people, be they owners or users, are recognised and that there is a willingness to protect these rights.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill should now go through.  It has presented the opportunity of bringing to light deficiencies, anomalies and the problems that exist in copyright law.  I believe that as a result of our discussions in this House there will now be a willingness on the part of the Minister and his Department to look again at problems that may arise in relation to some aspects of this Bill; I believe that &mdash; and again I am sure the Minister will give me an assurance on it &mdash; the appeal procedures prescribed in Part V of the 1963 Act will be used by the interests for whom they were intended only if for any reason weaknesses emerge in the operation of this measure.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance that there will be a willingness to look again at this whole issue of copyright law.  We have got that clarification as a result of the discussion we had here; we have got <Col N="1080" /> clarification in relation to the appeals procedures of Part V; we have got ministerial amendment No. 6; we have got the opportunity of highlighting difficulties, deficiencies and anomalies which Senator Lynch has already been referring to and we have got a willingness on the part of the Minister and his Department to look at these difficulties.  What we now need &mdash; and we accept that it might not be possible in this limited legislation to cover adequately the matters that concern us, is an assurance that the door is open and that the interests so affected will find a willingness on the part of the Minister and his Department to come to their assistance if such need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to answer some of the queries Senator Lynch raised but I did not think, in accordance with Seanad Standing Orders, that it would be proper to do so on Report Stage.  I was waiting for the Fifth Stage to make my comments.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Senators who contributed to this debate and I appreciate their constructive criticism and statements which they made.  This is an amending Bill and I was at pains when introducing it to say that it was an amending Bill; I did not pretend it was to be a major reforming Bill.  We are in the age of high technological change and we are trying to keep abreast of the changes as much as possible.  In this case, we were trying to close certain loopholes and increase penalties.  Senator Dooge was anxious that the Bill would have far more wide-ranging scope than we thought possible when we were introducing it.  Perhaps on another occasion it will be opportune to bring in a wider Bill, but that is a matter for future consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate a number of issues were raised.  One was dealt with by way of an amendment in relation to the publican's position and as a result of the matter being raised in the House by a number of Senators, particularly Senator Howard and Senator Lynch, we were happy to accept that amendment. Another matter raised was the operation <Col N="1081" /> of Part V of the 1963 Act.  The Controller of Patents has a part to play and can be approached by interests involved in this area.  It should be understood that his functions are not functions in relation to price and that there is a distinction between prices and the function of the Controller of Patents.  Matters of price are of course proper to the National Prices Commission and the Controller of Patents has distinct and separate functions, but functions which are there, and he is open to approaches from interested parties within the context of his powers under Part V of the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this Bill is onesided. It is closing loopholes in relation to proper questions of copyright and the protection of copiers.  On a number of occasions Senators criticised the Performing Right Society because of the manner in which they go about their activities.  My understanding of the matter is that the Performing Right Society is recognised by the courts as acting on behalf of certain copyright owners and that they have a legitimate interest in representing those copyright holders in the protection of their copyright. I have been at pains to stress to the House that it is always open to people who are prosecuted or summoned by the Performing Right Society or anybody else to state their case in court and to challenge any case in court.  That action must be taken in order to protect one's own rights and if the case is not contested in court, then one can have very little defence other than perhaps a crib that what has been done is wrong.  The courts are there for both sides.  They are there both to protect the copyright owners and the rights of individuals in law.  That should not be misunderstood by individuals.</P>
    <P>A matter of interest which was raised by a number of Senators, among them Senator Hourican and Senator Lynch, was the question of the playing of music on field days or at charitable functions. This matter is covered adequately in the Copyright Act, 1963, section 17 (8) and (9).  Subsection (8) reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> Where a published sound recording is caused to be heard in public &mdash; (a) at any premises where persons reside or sleep, as part of the amenities provided exclusively or mainly for residents or inmates therein, or (b) as part of the activities of or for the benefit of, a club, society or other organisation which is not established or conducted for profit and whose main objects are charitable or are otherwise concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare, the act of causing the sound recording to be heard without the payment of equitable remuneration to the owner of the copyright subsisting in the recording shall not, subject to the provisions of the next following subsection of this section, constitute an infringement of the copyright subsisting therein,</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) is relevant and states:</P>
    <P>The immediately preceding subsection of this section shall not apply &mdash; (a) in the case of the premises mentioned in paragraph (a) of that subsection, if a special charge is made for admission to the part of the premises where recording is to be heard, or (b) in the case of any such organisation as is mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection, if a charge is made for admission to the place where the recording is to be heard, and any of the proceeds of the charge are applied otherwise than for the purposes of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I think that the exemptions in the Bill in section 17 (8) and (9) are relevant to the comments made by the Senators and indicate quite clearly that there is an exemption from the payment of fees in respect of copyright in these certain and quite clearly defined situations.  That should meet with the concerns expressed by the Senators in regard to fetes or charitable functions or whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <P>In relation to the amount of the fines and to the approach in relation to minor offences, it was properly expressed by Senator O'Leary that the fines outlined in this Bill are maximum fines and that in a court of law a justice would take account of the circumstances of each case.  Obviously only very serious infringements would warrant higher fines.  I hope in replying to the Fifth Stage that I have answered as many as possible of the points raised by the Senators.  I am fully aware of their concern in the matter and I fully accept that the comments they made were helpful to me in amending the Bill and also perhaps enabled me to clarify the remaining points in regard to charities.  I want to thank the Senators very sincerely for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I asked <Col N="1084" /> if the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, would be guilty of infringement of copyright if he used a loudspeaker to play music, as most of us do during a general election campaign.  According to the Minister's statement I would be exempted because I play traditional music, but I do not think the senior Minister in the Department plays traditional music only.  The Minister is introducing legislation which would make him guilty of a criminal offence under the Copyright Act unless he so informs or pays copyright on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one is in breach of copyright if one breaches the copyright.  As politicians we must ensure that we play music like &ldquo;Arise and follow Charlie&rdquo; or whatever and if we want to play music outside a church or during election campaigns we must be careful to ensure that the music we play is not subject to copyright payments.</P>

    <Title>Report of The New Ireland Forum: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> The following motion was moved by Senator McGuinness on 12 September 1984:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Report of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the Report of the New Ireland Forum and accompanying documents as forming an important contribution to any resolution of the political issues posed by the division of the island and as providing an authoritative basis on which the realities of the political, economic, social and security problems can be considered and resolved.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Dooge.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate if for no other reason than to bring it to the notice of the nation that England, and its Prime Minister, have taken such little notice of the Report of the New Ireland Forum.  I thank sincerely the members of the Forum and staff who assisted them throughout the deliberations.  We now have an important statement of constitutional nationalist opinion.  Senator Dooge, the Leader of the House, when speaking on this debate, seemed to think we would get great results.  He quoted Mr. James Prior, but I do not share Senator Dooge's optimism with regard to what Mr. Prior said on leaving the North. Senator Dooge when speaking on this debate in the House said that Mr. Prior, before leaving the North said that the Dublin Government were still going on about this United Ireland business.  I do not know where Senator Dooge got the view that Mr. Prior, having left the appointment, had great hopes that a lot of things were going to happen.  In column 74 of the Official Report of 12 September, Senator Dooge said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>nobody should be allowed to quote individual paragraphs from the Forum report because taking an individual paragraph out of the Forum report may <Col N="1086" /> lead to misunderstanding, may lead to dangers of emphasis falling in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>Yet in column 78 of the Official Report of the same date Senator Dooge went on to say:</P>
    <P>The whole point is that the model of joint authority does not affect our sovereignty.  These words are, I think, and I certainly hope, words that have been carefully chosen.  It may well be that the only immediate way forward is through the question of Joint Authority...</P>
    <P>While Senator Dooge says that we should not opt for one model he has opted for the model he would like.  Maybe I misunderstood the esteemed Senator, but, again, maybe I did not.  Our purpose is to make certain that whatever course we take will, in the end, give us the reunification of the island, a sovereign State equal in all status to all others, organised to provide for the social and cultural betterment of all our people &mdash; I deliberately use that phrase &ldquo;all our people&rdquo; in my contribution &mdash; and contributing in our international relations with every other worth-while movement for human betterment.  I am keenly conscious of the fact that winning political independence would not mean economic independence in the same degree.  I also understand quite well that we would have to move cautiously to see if we could all work together.  By &ldquo;work together&rdquo; I mean North and South.</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil we will at all times help the restoration of the unity of Ireland. Before our entry to the EEC I had to be clear that it would not damage the prospect of the eventual reunification of this island.  Irish unity by agreement for the benefit of the ordinary people who comprise this island, North and South, must be the desire of all in the same way as we desire freedom because it is that alone that will bring happiness to us.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil took a stand on this matter a long time ago even though in recent times in other places some people were confused.  I was never confused at any <Col N="1087" /> stage and I am a long time a member of my party.  When we talk about the unity of Ireland we were talking about a 32-county Ireland by peaceful means.  I repeat that this was to be achieved by &ldquo;peaceful means&rdquo; because one has to be so careful nowadays.  People do not read what one says but read between the lines. I am quite clear in what I am saying and if other people are confused it is their tough luck.  Nobody can with confidence predict the future but surely we can define the future we desire.  As elected people we have that responsibility.  Without apologies to anyone we should make reference to the sacrifices that were made in the past by people who thought it was for a 32-county nation that they were paying the great price.</P>
    <P>I have stated one of the aims of the party which I am lucky to be a member of and I will now quote the late Eamon de Valera, who, when speaking on a radio broadcast to the United States on 12 February 1933, to mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, specifically rejected the federal model of the United States and said:</P>
    <P>Ireland is more than a political union of states.  It has been a nation from the dawn of history, united in traditions, in political institutions and in territory. The island is too small to be divided. It does not need and cannot afford two Governments.</P>
    <P>Senator Catherine McGuinness in her opening speech said very definitely that she did not want any other Member of the House to stand up here and say what a great person she was.  In her absence I pay a tribute to Senator McGuinness although she asked us not to do so.  She is an excellent Senator.  She is a wonderful and very sincere friend.  Therefore, I listened with care to her contribution and I was a little bit upset &mdash; perhaps she was not aware of what she was saying &mdash; that she was not at times happy with our attitudes down here.  I find this a little bit strange.  I want to put this on the record of the House that some of my greatest <Col N="1088" /> friends, and Derry's, in Clare are Protestants. In our long years of service together in voluntary organisations, on school boards and elsewhere we never thought they were any different from us. Perhaps I took Senator McGuinness up wrongly, but I thought she was saying that we would have to have a lot of changes down here or that there was a difference between them and us down here.  I would argue that point with Senator McGuinness.  That is not so and I am speaking from long years of experience.</P>
    <P>I understand quite well that young people today do not have strong feelings about the Forum because they have much more on their minds.  Indeed, I include not alone young people but a lot of other people also.  They may not have the feeling some of us have; a united Ireland may not be so important to them as it is to us. Of course, after the magnificent document last night they will probably start thinking in positive terms again.  The Coalition Government have done a marvellous job in giving jobs to everyone so perhaps they will take a look again at the way in which we think of a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>Senator Robb in his contribution mentioned our neutrality.  I want now to raise the question of our neutrality in relation to the findings of the Forum report.  Ever since our neutrality found such forceful expression under Eamon de Valera in the war years, we in the South cherished our neutrality.  These days in the world of nuclear weapons we hear a lot about the importance of our neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a purely practical point of view the question has to be asked, how would our neutrality be affected by the three options in the Forum report?  In my view it is clear that any sharing or lessening of our sovereignty &mdash; as envisaged in varying degrees in the federal and joint authority options, particularly the latter one &mdash; would lead to a weakening of, if not doing away with, our neutrality.  Under either of these options you could hardly have <Col N="1089" /> one part of this country &mdash; that is the Six Counties &mdash; remaining in NATO while we in the South remain neutral. Accordingly, it would be unworkable. The setting up of any structures under either of those options would mean that one of the sides would have to compromise: either the Six Counties would have to withdraw from NATO and join us in our neutrality or, more likely, we in the South would have to surrender out neutrality and join NATO and I do not think that is on.  If we can believe press reports our neutrality at the moment can apparently be bartered to some degree with the British Government. Of course we only see little snippets of that but obviously it has been discussed.  Let the people of the country take that issue up and we will see.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, one can see, from a purely practical point of view, that the unitary State offers the best protection for our neutrality, and problems associated with shared sovereignty do not arise.  As a unitary State the sovereign Government would have little difficulty in responding to the desire of the vast majority of the people for the retention of the neutrality of this nation.  For these reasons, as well as neutrality, should there be any negotiations other than for a unitary State?  When we are talking about neutrality and the three options of the Forum there is only one which would be consistent with our stance while remaining neutral.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Forum reached one clear political conclusion, that the structures of a political unity which the Forum would wish to see is a unitary State, achieved by agreement and consent. This conclusion was subscribed to not alone by Fianna Fáil but also by Fine Gael, Labour and the SDLP.  There is no use coming here weeks afterwards and saying that we were the only ones who said the unitary State was the option which was agreed.  I could go back to the option of a federal Ireland and to the other option.  I do not know the answer and I am sure my colleagues here in the House do not have the answer to this awful problem.  In public and in private <Col N="1090" /> and at every place where I got a platform I have made one request, namely, that no matter how long it takes, the British should announce their withdrawal from the North.  They should withdraw the army from the Six Counties of this nation. I cannot understand, with the murders and the killings by both sides, by everybody who uses a gun or uses violence, why there is not some announcement of withdrawal, even in 20 years time.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about subversives and about people killing and shooting and sadness and death &mdash; we have heard quite a bit about it here in the last few days in another Bill &mdash; there are two sides in the Six Counties who are creating the problem.  To me the person in British uniform who uses plastic bullets is as wrong, as bad and as deadly an enemy to the whole country and to peace in all our times as any of the other people of violence.  The urgency of making political progress has been recognised by the New Ireland Forum.  The Nationalist parties have expressed this, but alone they cannot resolve this awful conflict.  Britain must act decisively and must act now to avoid further sadness and death.  I only hope that there will be some response from the British Government, but I do not hold the hope that some of my colleagues in this House hold about a positive response from the present Prime Minister of Great Britain.  While she is there, I do not feel that we will have any announcement or any positive reaction to a very worthwhile, magnificent exercise and the report here before us today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of discussing this major and very important report in this House.  It is regrettable, for whatever reason, that there has not been more discussion and more debate throughout the country on it because it is not really a report that has to be looked at and studied by the British and by the Northern Unionists.  There are many things in <Col N="1093" /> the report that ought to be studied carefully by Irish Nationalists because this report, in effect, is a reassessment from today's point of view of the current situation and where we go from now.  That is what is important, particularly to those of us who have to live with the tragedy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The inital cynicism which greeted the establishment of the New Ireland Forum in some quarters was quickly set aside as the work of the Forum progressed and its significance became apparent.  From the very beginning, however, it was welcomed by those of us who had worked for fundamental political change in Northern Ireland and had seen our efforts negated and frustrated by a combination of British indifference, British lack of courage and, at times, by downright stupidity, by total Loyalist intransigence and by the continuing vicious circle of violence and counter-violence.  We recognised it as a major Irish initiative with real potential to break the serious deadlock in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fact is that since the setting up of Northern Ireland &mdash; and, God knows, Northern Nationalists are more aware of this than most &mdash; intransigent triumphalist &ldquo;loyalism' has fed off intermittent doses of violent and verbal republicanism and all the while injustice flourished and the problem became more intractable and Northern Nationalists, the main victims of the failure to resolve the British-Irish problem, continued to suffer.</P>
    <P>For 50 years successive British governments ignored the injustices to which Northern Nationalists were subjected, hiding behind the pretext that Northern Ireland matters could not be discussed at Westminster.  During the current crisis&mdash;now 15 years old, I might add &mdash; apart from a brief period in the early seventies, Britain has failed to face up to its responsibilities and despite the desperate and deteriorating situation in the North and all the human misery and suffering that it has brought to both traditions and with its serious implications for peace and stability in the whole of Ireland, the only British approach to the problem was one of containment, of <Col N="1094" /> reacting to events, of increased dependence on military offensive and emergency legislation pushed to its most dangerous and its most extreme.  That approach now has reached a situation where the courts of law are being used as a weapon to defeat terrorism.  In the conflict-ridden society of Northern Ireland the result of that approach was entirely predictable. It has made an already grave situation considerably worse.  Nationalists are now totally alienated and Unionists are more insecure and more fearful than ever before.</P>
    <P>It was against this background and given the failure of the sovereign government responsible for Northern Ireland to reassess its basic policy that the New Ireland Forum was set up with the cooperation of the constitutional Nationalist parties of Ireland.  It could not have got off the ground without the full cooperation and the goodwill and determination of all those parties and I would like to pay a tribute to all the parties in the Forum for the goodwill and determination they clearly showed.  It was aimed at ending the dangerous political stalemate in Northern Ireland and beginning the dialogue necessary for political progress towards a lasting solution.  It is important in studying this document that we keep in mind that that was the aim of the document.  It represented the greatest challenge that has faced Irish political leaders since 1920 because that was the challenge of finding, despite their historical differences, and there were basic and deep differences which divided them, a common approach, an effective approach, a totally new approach which could lead to practical progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  The Forum report and the impact which it has made is evidence that the Forum parties rose to that challenge.</P>
    <P>The first and immediate impact was on international and indeed British opinions, and let nobody under-estimate the importance of that.  Major newspapers in America, Britain and Europe called for a British response to what they considered to be a significant and generous <Col N="1095" /> contribution by Irish Nationalists towards a resolution of the Northern conflict.  Typical of that reaction were comments like this one which I quote from a West German newspaper, <i>Frankfurter Rundchan:</i></P>
    <P>If Irish politicians are capable of far sighted planning why can the British not also be so capable.  The British should be no less strenuous in their efforts to secure a peaceful future of the suffering population of Northern Ireland for whom they bear responsibility than their neighbours across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Britain's <i>Financial Times</i> called on Mrs. Thatcher to make an Irish settlement a priority for the next four years, and there are few of us in this House who would not say amen to that.  <i>The Financial Times</i> continued:</P>
    <P>No British policy will get anywhere if it is half-hearted and low on the political agenda.  Mrs. Thatcher has an opportunity denied to almost all her predecessors.</P>
    <P>That opportunity, as we know, refers to the Forum report which we are discussing here today.  The fact that major opinion makers internationally were commenting in this vein was in itself a considerable breakthrough for the Forum.</P>
    <P>The report is the result of a detailed examination of every aspect of the present conflict, economic, social, legal and political.  It represents the consensus view of Irish Nationalists, a view which has been reached not only after consideration of Nationalists' viewpoints, but also after consideration and examination of the views of those diametrically opposed, the Northern Unionists.  I know that elected representatives of Unionism did not come to the Forum, but those who did, nonetheless, forcefully, clearly and courageously articulated the views of those people who differ from us in aspiration. It is not surprising therefore to find that <Col N="1096" /> the report shows a hitherto unprecedented understanding on the part of Irish Nationalists of the Unionists' point of view and a generous acceptance of their equal and legitimate &mdash; and I stress both those words &mdash; rights.  This is set out clearly in Chapter 4.15 and in the necessary elements of a framework for a solution contained in Chapter 5.2.  I will quote from Chapter 5.2 two elements which are necessary for a solution.</P>
    <P>(4)  The validity of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities in Ireland and the democratic rights of every citizen on this island must be accepted; both of these identities must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable, political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection.</P>
    <P>(5)  Lasting stability can be found only in the context of new structures in which no tradition will be allowed to dominate the other, in which there will be equal rights and opportunities for all, in which there will be provision for formal and effective guarantees for the protection of individual human rights and of the communal and cultural rights of both Nationalists and Unionists.</P>
    <P>That is a generous acceptance by Nationalist Ireland of the full and equal rights of Unionists to their rights and traditions.  Whether we agree with them, like them or would prefer that they were not there is beside the point.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the spelling out for the first time by Irish Nationalists of the real meaning of Irish unity and of the need for agreement and spelling out what they mean by agreement, is even more important. I will quote again from Chapter 5.2:</P>
    <P>Agreement means that the political arrangements for a new and sovereign Ireland must be freely negotiated and agreed by the people of the North and the people of the South.</P>
    <P>That must clear away the myth that Irish unity means oppression of Protestants <Col N="1097" /> and a denial of their rights within a green Gaelic Catholic 32-County State.  If there is anything that has been more aggravating to those of us in Northern Ireland who are proud to call ourselves Irish Nationalists, and who are proud to say that we would like to see this country united, and that it is the only way in the end which will bring lasting peace and stability to this island, it is the failure in the past of Nationalists &mdash; and I include all Nationalists, not just Southern Nationalists &mdash; to spell out what precisely they mean by Irish unity.  That failure was counterproductive in that it allowed Irish unity to be interpreted by others, people perhaps who are not wholly, to put it mildly, sympathetic with the idea of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>In the past Nationalist parties always agreed on the aim of Irish unity.  The only debate seems to be as to who was the firmer in their support of Irish unity.  I have heard little debate of how Irish unity is actually to be brought about, and it was because of this misconception and this failure to spell out Irish unity that we had to listen to British politicians, and indeed Unionist politicians, telling us that Irish unity was a taboo word, something you should not mention, something to be said in hushed tones.  I am glad that once and for all the Forum document has swept all that out of the way and we can now talk about an Irish unity in agreement with our fellow Protestants in the North which will be generous to their traditions and which cannot be forced and must be brought about by agreement, and their agreement is essential.  From now one, it is up to us to persuade them and to win that agreement.</P>
    <P>The report correctly points out that whilst Northern Nationalists were the main victims of the failure of the 1920 settlement, it has also failed the Unionists in whose interests it was intended to work.  It is undoubtedly true that the power and the privilege that they enjoyed under the Stormont régime was bought at a very high price indeed.  They also suffer from the instability and the insecurity in Northern Ireland and their lives are blighted by fear.  A series of articles <Col N="1098" /> currently in <i>The Irish Times</i> must bring that home starkly to all of us &mdash; how tragic their situation is and the situation particularly in which the Border Protestants find themselves.  That is a situation that the Forum report and the work of the Forum was aimed at bringing to an end.</P>
    <P>In its historical analysis the report points out, as I have already said, that Northern Nationalists have been the principal victims of the failure to resolve the conflict.  That of course is quite true.  They have been excluded from participation &mdash; perhaps I should say &ldquo;we have been excluded from participation&rdquo;&mdash; treated as second class citizens and denied legitimate expression of our identity.  They have suffered from Unionist misrule, from British neglect, suffered at the hands of those who would pose as their liberators whilst in reality creating conditions which contribute to worsening their situation. They have suffered violence from all sources, British, Loyalists and so-called Republicans.  They have been exploited by violent and verbal republicanism and harassed and intimidated in the name of law and order.  Quite frankly, they have come to the end of their tether.  They are not interested in ideological cant and political posturing.</P>
    <P>What the Nationalists want in Northern Ireland is positive action by the British and Irish Governments which will lead to a real change in their situation, and that is what the Forum report calls for. This report can and must play an important role in bringing about that change. The change can be brought about when the British and Irish Governments together, as the report suggests, face the realities set out in Chapter 5.1.  Whereas I accept what Senator Honan said about various options in the report, I do not think that the options in themselves are that vitally important, and it is quite natural that some people will have a preference for one rather than another.</P>
    <P>To me all the options may meet the realities and the unchangeable parts of that report are those realities.  You can say what you like about your opinion of certain ways of doing things, but what <Col N="1099" /> you cannot do is change the realities. Therefore, the important part of the report is the part that spells out those realities in Chapter 5.1.  With those realities are proposed elements for a solution in the part which follows in Chapter 5.2. Those elements must be the basis for any future negotiations to resolve this problem.  Irish Nationalists, in this document, have faced up to all the realities, including those that are uncomfortable from a traditional, Nationalist viewpoint. It would be, to say the very least, counter-productive if the British Government failed to do likewise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the requirement which states the need to accept the validity of both identities and to provide for &ldquo;equally satisfactory, secure and durable, political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection&rdquo; for both traditions, it is clear that fundamental and radical changes in British policy will be needed if that requirement is to be met. Let us remember that the basis of British policy has in all respects been heavily weighted in favour of the Unionist tradition. Nationalist equality cannot be achieved by tinkering about with present structures.  The recurrent message in the report is that Britain must face up to her responsibilities, that Britain must act and must act urgently.</P>
    <P>In a speech the Tánaiste made at the weekend he has given us some indication that he feels hopeful.  I hope for all our sakes that that is correct because it is five months now since the publication of the report.  During those months a series of events has deepened further the alienation of Nationalists and has totally eroded their confidence in the judicial system and the security forces.  I have referred to this before in the House and I have stated my concern about it.  Since the publication of the report, events like the remarks of Justice Gibson in another acquittal of an RUC man in Belfast court, further evidence of irregularities in police files which dealt with those shoot to kill incidences that I mentioned here before, the police conduct culminating in the killing of Seán Downes in West Belfast in <Col N="1100" /> August, all of those things have led to a total collapse of confidence in the judicial system and in the security forces from the point of view of Nationalists.  In any society, that spells danger for the community as a whole.  In these circumstances, whereas other people may have expressed impatience with the British I would as a Northern Nationalist who lives in Northern Ireland say that any further delay is dangerous and irresponsible, I do not choose those words lightly.</P>
    <P>Finally, it would be a tragedy if, as a result of any further British delay, the realism and the determination shown by the authors of this report and the unity of purpose from which it derives its main strength, its importance and its impact, should be lost.  It would not be the first time that British tactics had divided and conquered us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can be said as a factual statement that the existing political systems in Ireland have evolved from the 1920 Constitution arrangements by Britain which resulted in the arbitrary division of this country.  From this division we know that two groups in particular found that their interests were not accommodated.  We had the Northern Nationalists and the Southern Unionists. In so far as the South is concerned it can be said that the electoral and ordinary parliamentary arrangements to cater for the Southern Unionists have been extremely successful.  The Northern Nationalists were not so well catered for and were the real losers.  They have been denied their basic rights and political expression of their Irish identity.  We had created two sections of the community in the North in system based on sectarian loyalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saddening aspect of this is that since 1920 successive British Governments have almost, perhaps totally, welcomed one party rule in Northern Ireland, that rule to be exercised by and on behalf of the majority Unionist population.  The identity of the Nationalist Northern Ireland people has been totally disregarded.  As has been said by other speakers, for over 50 years the <Col N="1101" /> Nationalists have been excluded from any important decision-making.  They have lived under a system of exclusive Unionist power and privilege and have suffered systematic discrimination.  The position now is that both sections live under the shadow of sectarian politics and the fear of domination of one tradition by the other.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the father of the late Frank Maguire, the senior Mr. Maguire, lived in Athlone town and his son was born there, he gave me the official reply from the then Minister, Mr. Callaghan dealing with the discrimination that I referred to earlier.  This information gives details of the population of County Fermanagh for 1961 from the official census. It showed Catholics numbering 27,432 and Protestants at 24,109 totalling 51,551.  In the administration of County Fermanagh for that period a mere 52 Catholics of the total of 588 were of the Catholic belief.  Surely this is discrimination at its worst?  A further figure which he gave me at that time was that in 1962 30 houses were allocated in a town in County Fermanagh which is 98 per cent Catholic but not one was given to a Catholic; two of the tenants were brought from Belfast and were single.  Catholics living there in very bad housing conditions, overcrowded, almost in hovels, were excluded.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that this situation of fair play for the Nationalist people in employment, housing and in other areas of their life brought about and started the civil rights movement, the civil rights marches that took place in the late sixties. This was a non-violent campaign.  It was an effort on the part of the Nationalist community to end discrimination in the areas of electoral rights, housing and jobs.  This Forum was established for consultation in a manner which would bring about lasting peace and this would be achieved in a new Ireland through democratic means.</P>

I have been frustrated on numerous occasions when inviting the Minister to explain to us how those who are detained under these provisions and are not charged can have their interests protected in the way that the courts clearly can vindicate the rights of those detained and charged.  I have not had much of a response to those requests from the Minister.  It would be very helpful if the regulations which the Minister will bring in under section 7 would contain an instruction to include a written list of the reasons why somebody has been detained and the reasons for their detention.  That written information should be supplied as a matter of regulation. <Col N="1103" /> If such a commitment were given it would not be necessary to have it in the legislation.  If there is to be proper care of people in custody, by regulation they should be informed why they are there and how long it is proposed to detain them.</P>

      <P>As the drafter of the amendment I beg the indulgence of the House to make a minor amendment to the amendment.  The amendment refers to a &ldquo;person arrested pursuant to this section&rdquo;.  That should read &ldquo;person detained&rdquo;. It was brought out clearly earlier that there is no provision for arrest in section 4.  With leave of the House I propose to amend that word.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment, as clearly stated by Senators M. Higgins and B. Ryan, is to ensure that persons detained under section 4 will have the fullest opportunity to know the context under which they are being detained, that they will know the time of the arrest, the offence or offences in respect of which they are being detained and that when being brought to a Garda station they will be handed a statement in writing of the offence or offences for which they are being detained.  In section 4 we are allowing for persons to be held for questioning for an initial period of six hours with the possibility of extending it for another six hours and that a person would be told the period for which he may be detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may seem unnecessary to write this into the legislation but it is one of the real concerns in relation to this section because there is a possibility of the provisions being more onerous than intended by <Col N="1104" /> Members of the Oireachtas when considering the legislation.  As other Senators have said it can be very frightening, disorientating and very difficult for people who are not hardened and seasoned criminals accustomed to being in Garda stations, not to know how long they will be held there and will be unsure of the surrounding circumstances.  When a similar amendment was being discussed on Committee Stage I pointed out that we have the analogous situation in section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act which has meant that there have been occasions when persons properly arrested under section 30 are only told they are being arrested under section 30 and are not told for which offence under the section they are being arrested and may not be told for how long they will be detained.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible for the garda in charge of the station when the decision to detain persons under section 4 is being made to say for exactly how long the persons will be detained, it should be made very clear to such persons that they can be detained for up to six hours.  It seems obvious that this would always happen, but there is no guarantee that it would happen.  If persons are told that they may be detained for up to six hours, at which point there may be a decision to detain them further, at least the persons so detained would know the full context of being detained, that they are not put into a room with somebody asking them questions without knowing that, and are more likely to be in a position to avail of the safeguards and protections.  It is extemely important that we ensure that these safeguards and protections will be availed of and fully drawn to the attention of persons so detained.</P>
    <P>In particular, it is more likely that persons who face the possibility of being held for six hours, and that they may be held for a longer period, may wish to have access to solicitors.  They will be informed they have a right to do so, but it is much more likely that they would wish to avail of that right in full measure, particularly young persons who would also wish to have contact with parents or guardians. In order to ensure that the safeguards <Col N="1105" /> continued in the section will work in practice it is extremely important that we are satisfied that the procedure will work so that persons detained under section 4, who in effect are being detained for questioning, will have every possibility of knowing the offences for which they are being detained and for how long it is proposed to detain them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the period of detention would be a standard thing: I would assume that in some instances a period of much less than six hours would be sufficient for the purposes of investigations. In this respect the section refers to the person's arrival at the station and that there is reason to believe that the detention of that person is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence. There may be something specific to be checked out and it may be possible to do it in half an hour, and in such cases persons should be told that they would be detained for that period.  That would ensure that the persons were informed of the time.  They are entitled to know how long they will be detained.  They are the reasons why the amendment has been tabled on Report Stage in a slightly expanded form and, with the leave of the House now, amended to be a more correct representation of what is behind this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> We discussed the Senator's amendment on Committee Stage and I was opposed to the first portion of it which provides for the arrested person to be told on his arrest of the offence for which he was being arrested.  That was because that was already law and any provision to that effect in the Bill would, therefore, be unnecessary.  That is still my position on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point which we discussed also, that the arrested person should be handed without delay a statement in writing of the offence in question, I am still of the view that whatever about the merits of the proposal it would not be appropriate to incorporate it in the Bill. If it were to be implemented the place to do it would be in the regulations.  As I <Col N="1106" /> explained, the arrested person at present is given a form which sets out various entitlements.  For example, entitlement to bail, contacting a solicitor and so on. A record is also made of the offence for which the person was arrested in the custody record kept in respect of each arrested person.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind at present on the provision to be made in the regulations on this point.  It is inevitable that a fair number of additional records will have to be kept as a result of the Bill.  That is in addition to those kept already which are fairly substantial.  I do not want to impose additional clerical work unless it is reasonably necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan remarked the other day on the cumbersomeness of the requirements in section 4 of serving a notice to suspend questioning after midnight and having the detained person giving his consent in writing to that suspension.  He was not saying these forms are unnecessary but he was pointing out that the reality of the situation in Garda stations was that it could be cumbersome and that too much clerical duties on the Garda could be cumbersome. Whatever needs to be done, or whatever is reasonably necessary, then it should be provided in the regulations.</P>
    <P>In this case the person has already been told by the arresting garda what he has been arrested for.  That is recorded in writing in the station record and it can be produced if there is any dispute.  It might be enough for the member in charge to tell the arrested person then what he was arrested for.  I am not sure on that point. I would like to see the regulations as a whole and examined now.  We have a first draft, as I said previously, and we will look at the full extent of recording that has to be done.  It may be that a requirement for a written notification would be included, but it does not seem to be at present that such a requirement would be so essential a character as to give a definite commitment at this stage.  I will give a commitment that I will examine it fairly.  If, on examining it, I think it is reasonably necessary then we will put it, and there is no difficulty about that, in <Col N="1107" /> the regulations.</P>
    <P>A third point mentioned on Committee Stage and again today was that the detained person should be told the period for which he may be detained.  I do not see how we could impose that requirement when the member in charge who would make the decision whether to detain or not, will frequently not be in a position to say how long the person in custody may be detained.  That would depend on the progress of the investigation.  That can be very unpredictable.  It would be hard to say, for example, how long it would take to check a person's story. To take the Senator's example, someone saying, &ldquo;well, all right, you have said that but we need to check it out and that will take a half an hour.&rdquo;  It would be reasonable to say, &ldquo;We will check it out&rdquo;, but actually saying, &ldquo;We would do it in half an hour&rdquo;, is going beyond what the gardaí could do.</P>
    <P>The result of forensic testing, for example, could require further questioning when it was completed.  The amendment is inappropriate in the Bill, but certainly, the latter portions of it if considered necessary are appropriate for the regulations. I will consider what has been said when preparing the draft regulations. The matter can be gone into again when the draft comes up for approval by the two Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for being willing to consider the various strands in this amendment and what has been said in the House on it.  I take the point that it might be difficult to give a very precise time.  It would be virtually impossible to do so and become a handicap that is not necessary.  The main concern that I and Senator Higgins, in seconding, have is that a person would be at least informed, if not of a more precise time, that he can be detained for six hours.  If a person is in a never-never land of not knowing how long he will be detained &mdash; some people who are very experienced might know their rights fully but the people that perhaps we would be more concerned about would not know <Col N="1108" />&mdash; he could be left for an hour in a room and not know for how much longer and not have availed of his right of access to a solicitor which he would have if he realised he was going to be kept that length of time.  A person should be definitely informed that he faces a period of detention of up to six hours and, if it is possible to give a more precise indication, it would, obviously, be desirable.  In view of the fact that the Minister has indicated that he will look at these areas and will consider the possibility of making appropriate provision in the regulations, and in view of the fact that we will have the regulations before us in draft then I propose to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 39 and 40, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) Where a person under the age of seventeen years is detained in a Garda station pursuant to this section that person shall not be questioned other than as provided for in section 6 unless and until a parent or guardian or other relative of such person has been informed of the detention of that person and afforded an opportunity to be present when such person is being questioned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to a concern which was discussed on Committee Stage.  It seeks to provide that where a person under the age of 17 is detained pursuant to section 4 that the person would not be questioned except for the minimal question in section 6 which a person is obliged to answer.  In other words, he is obliged to give his name and address and he faces a penalty if he refuses to answer or gives a false name and address.  Apart from that, the amendment proposes that a person would not be questioned until a parent or guardian or other relative of the person has been informed of the detention of that person <Col N="1109" /> and afforded an opportunity to be present when such person is being questioned.</P>
    <P>This amendment is couched in terms that are intended to be as helpful to achieve the objective as possible.  It clearly would not be appropriate to require the Garda not to question a young person until a parent, guardian or relative had come because they might well not come to the Garda station.  The amendment does not confine itself to parent or guardian which other provisions of the section do because the objective would be to have some relative &mdash; perhaps not necessarily the parent or guardian, but some accessible relative &mdash; informed that this young person under 17 is being detained, will be held and can be questioned while detained, and that the person would be simply afforded an opportunity to be present when the young person is being questioned.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage a number of us expressed concern about extending the provisions of section 4 to persons under a certain age and there were amendments to that effect.  This does not rule out the possibility of a person of 12, or over being detained but it simply provides an additional safeguard that before they can be questioned a parent, guardian or relative is afforded an opportunity of being present.</P>
    <P>A number of parents have expressed concern, certainly to me and I am sure they have to other Members of the House, about having had their 14 or 15 year old questioned.  The amendment also incorporates into the Bill a safeguard which appears to be recognised by the President of the High Court in the Travers case.  The Minister may reply by saying that in so far as the courts are concerned about the protection of the individual it is not necessary to write it into legislation, but we are taking a very significant step here in extending the power to detain young people for questioning.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the course of an arrest under present circumstances a person may, in fact, be detained for a certain period before being brought before a peace commissioner or district justice. <Col N="1110" /> What we are really seeking in this amendment is the additional step in relation to somebody under 17 years, that before they were subjected to the questioning over a period their parent or guardian would be afforded an opportunity of being present at questioning.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I think the arguments in favour of it have been made on the previous Stage and have been explicitly focused upon by Senator Robinson in moving this particular amendment on Report Stage.  The only point I would add is that as we have a responsibility for this Bill as a piece of legislation the safeguards which Senator Robinson speaks about should be incorporated visibly in the Bill.  The advantage in that seems to my mind that while one can argue that the courts would uphold the rights of access of parents or guardians or the rights of people of a relatively young age to have access to their parents or guardians, there is quite a distinction between that and the public perception of these in practice.  It seems to me that the inclusion of the safeguards which are referred to in this would go a considerable distance towards that in terms of the public perception of the rights which exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept generally the principle of what is here. Certainly the rights do exist.  Even though the Travers case suggested that the rights existed &mdash; I think it was around 14 years &mdash; we can take it for granted that they would move from the particular to the general very quickly and would apply to people under 17 years of age.  It is on that basis that I will be drawing up the regulations under section 7 and I think the Seanad will be quite happy with the regulations when they are drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present law the admissibility of statements made in the absence of a parent or guardian would be seriously prejudiced and not just at 14 years of age; in my opinion it would be from 17 years of age downwards.  The amendment goes far because there may be circumstances <Col N="1111" /> where it is necessary to question the young person before the parent or guardian arrives.  The obvious case would be where a delay in questioning would involve a risk of harm to somebody or serious loss or damage to property.  In that case there would be a conflict of constitutional rights.  In such situations the other person's rights &mdash; the person at risk for example &mdash; should prevail.  The court would find such evidence admissible when it was the rights of a third party that were being potected by having the period of questioning.</P>
    <P>I accept in general what has been said. I have a firm intent of covering this in the regulations and I will taken into account the views that have been expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(12) Subject to the provisions of sections 15 and 16 a person detained under this section shall be questioned only about matters connected with the offence being investigated, or a related offence, or any other offence which a member of the Garda Síochána with reasonable cause suspects him of having committed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask a few questions that I have asked consistently through this debate. First, what about the people, the majority as the Minister has agreed, who will be detained under section 4 and will not be charged?  Other than a person's willingness to proceed with matters through the courts or through the tribunal when it is set up what is there to protect him? <Col N="1112" /> The curiosity factor, the desire to accumulate information, all of these things are natural human nature.  There is a piece on information theory and on communications theory in large organisations to distinguish between what people need to know and what is nice to know. It applies very particularly to the question of questioning people in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>There should be clearly delineated legal limits to what it is that people can be questioned about when they are in Garda custody.  I listened with interest to other views.  While I did not necessarily agree with them, I felt that it would be useful to put down an amendment on this Stage which attempted, even in fairly broad terms, to delineate the limits of questioning that are permissible under this power that I find so objectionable. My original proposal was that it should only be matters on the offence being investigated.  People raised various questions, some of which I did not respond that much to, but which they felt rather strongly about.  The obvious first one, which is probably straightforward enough, is a related offence.  The Minister produced the example of somebody running away from a house whom a garda suspects of burglary and then discover somebody dead inside.  He asked, can they not question him about that and I said &ldquo;fair enough&rdquo;.  Suppose a fellow happens to have information or something comes up so that the garda suspects there was something entirely different, where he makes some statement which suggests he is responsible for 15 different major crimes in the previous week, can he not be questioned about that?  That seems reasonable also.  What is not reasonable, which is what appears to go on at present under section 13, is that the people are not only asked about their activities in terms of suspicion of their membership of an illegal organisation, but they are asked about the activities of organisations with which they are connected, not their own activities in those organisations but what those organisations are doing.</P>
    <P>Incidentally among them is the campaign against the Criminal Justice Bill in <Col N="1113" /> which some sections of the Garda seem to show a rather excessive interest.  Considering that it is a perfectly legitimate political activity to oppose a piece of legislation &mdash; otherwise we are all breaking the law &mdash; or they show an excessive interest in some of the activities of various groups of the unemployed.  There is some concern about a certain organisation which is not proscribed but about which people are very uneasy and its infiltration of these organisations but I would have thought there were ways of dealing with that without asking everybody about the activities of groups like the unemployed action groups.  I was quite disappointed at the peculiar judgment involved when I spoke at a meeting in Chair during President Reagan's visit. There were no more than 300 people there but there were about six plain clothes Garda Síochána and about 20 uniformed gardaí.  In terms of wasteful public expenditure that most non-violent and peaceful of groups really did not need that much attention and I do not think the State could afford it.</P>
    <P>I think there is a tendency on the part of security forces generally to want, understandably, to collect as much information as possible about possibilities for crime, about connections between people whom they suspect of crimes, even if they cannot prove them, about circumstances that might be useful in a future investigation, about a whole host of things.  As the section stands, it is a matter for the Garda to decide about what matter they are going to question people.  It is a matter for the Garda to decide what is the important line of questioning they wish to pursue.</P>
    <P>The answer we have got consistently on this Bill and all through this debate, has been that ultimately if the gardaí exceed what is reasonable the courts will decide that was not lawful custody or that the law was broken and, therefore, any information obtained was unlawfully obtained and would not be admissible as evidence.  For the majority of people, there will not be a court available to decide whether what happened to them was lawful or not because they will not <Col N="1114" /> appear in court.  It is very frustrating to ask in a reasonable tone of voice again and again, what about the innocent people, what about the people who were never charged, and to get no answers.</P>
    <P>There is a scenario which I know about and which is fairly well documented, namely, the case of a recent murder where the person in question who was murdered was a practising homosexual and 1,500 members of the homosexual or gay community in this country were questioned by the gardaí because they would be associates of his.  Under this section all of those people could possibly be subject for detention under suspicion of homosexual acts in private, that is, if that particular Act does have powers of arrest.  Again, I have sought a simple bit of information from the Minister.  Is there a power to arrest without warrant in the case of a suspicion of a male being involved in homosexual acts in private?  Unfortunately so far the Minister has not given us an answer.  Presumably it is either yes or no.  If the Department of Justice do not know whether it is true or not, it is going to be very difficult for the Garda to know whether they have the power or not.</P>
    <P>If the situation is that there is power to arrest, it would be very simple, for instance, to detain anybody from the gay community where somebody who was known to have such sexual orientation was involved in the crime and arrest him under that 19th century Act and then question him not necessarily about a crime, but in connection with his relationship with the individual in question and with a whole lot of related matters.  I suspect that is not the Minister's intention. I hope it is not.  Therefore I suggest that a reasonable, broadly based delineation of the garda's right to question should be contained here.</P>
    <P>The other comment I must make is that I found a slightly distasteful tone in some of what the Minister has had to say about this whole matter of questioning.  It seems that while it is conceded that people have the right to silence, it is hoped that the circumstances will exist during questioning <Col N="1115" />&mdash; and I am not suggesting that anybody is talking about anything untoward being done &mdash; under which people can be persuaded not to insist on that right.  I do not think we have any particular business trying to get people to give up their normal legal rights just because it will help an investigation.  If people want to remain silent they should be entitled to do so.  If they say they want to remain silent, that should be the end of it.  That is not the central issue.  The central issue is to try to keep some limit on the extent and the range of questioning to which people can be subjected.  Somebody is suspected of having committed hundreds of crimes over a long period, he is detained because there is a reasonable suspicion in one crime.  Are we then to have the case where he will be questioned <i>ad nauseum</i> about hundreds of offences because the Garda think he is the type of fellow who might have committed them?  There have to be some reasonable grounds for questioning a person about any offence about which he is questioned, otherwise it would be close to an oppressive environment.  Therefore I uphold the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, I appreciate that the Senator has redrafted the amendment which he tabled on Committee Stage and has tightened it up considerably.  It would now allow the Garda to question a person not only about matters connected with the offence being investigated, as in the Committee Stage amendment, but also about related or any other offences of which he is reasonably suspected.  There is a qualification for sections 15 and 16 cases.  Nevertheless, the amendment is still too restrictive.  A person in Garda custody can be asked questions on various other matters to which no possible exception can be taken.  I am not just talking about asking somebody whether he wanted sugar in his tea or <Col N="1116" /> not, or any kind of conversation like that not related to the offences which might be necessary simply for the normal welfare of the person held in custody.</P>
      <P>I gave an example of what I am talking about on Committee Stage.  A person being questioned about an offence might say that he had witnessed another offence, say a hold-up, in which he was not a participant.  He could be a very valuable witness for the prosecution in that case. No doubt, there are many other instances of a person in custody giving information to the Garda which is of value to them in carrying out their duty to prevent and investigate crime.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  In any case, if there is a problem of the type outlined, it seems that legislation is not necessarily the way to deal with it.  Senator Ryan has asked what options are open to an aggrieved party if he is held and questioned and not subsequently charged. He says I have said that a majority of the people will be released without being charged.  I do not recall saying that. I said a significant proportion will probably be released without being charged. I do not think I said the majority would be released.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We can both check the record, but that is the way I recall having said it.  The Senator constantly refers to section 30 offences and I dealt with that matter at some length previously.  To take the events at the weekend for example, there were a number of people detained and five people were subsequently charged.  You will find that in section 30 offences because in many cases there is not a basis for a charge subsequent to the detention. I do not think, however, that one should transfer the experience from section 30 automatically into matters under section 4 which would be non-subversive offences.  The Seanad should take that point.  It is difficult to express it more strongly than I am expressing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of homosexuality &mdash;<Col N="1117" /> and Senator O'Leary raised this point previously &mdash; the position is that in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, section 61 states: &ldquo;Whosoever shall be convicted of the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal, shall be liable to be kept in Penal Servitude for Life...&rdquo; Obviously buggery would be included, but I understand that homosexual activity between consenting adults carries a two year sentence.  That would not come under the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary made a point the last day and I feel I should reply to him.  He talked in terms of somebody who was a declared homosexual being treated by the Garda on the basis that they had reasonable suspicion that he was involved in homosexual activity and involved in some of the activities that carry serious terms of imprisonment.  It would be as reasonable to arrest heterosexual people on the reasonable suspicion that they were guilty of rape.  I do not see that the reasonable suspicion arises there to any degree.  I know the case that Senator Ryan has referred to on a number of occasions.  It was a particularly horrific murder and there was difficulty in investigating it.  By and large, the experience has been that known homosexuals in society are not arrested and charged by the Garda and have not been harassed. There was a particular problem in investigating a particular murder and I know that it caused concern but the murder certainly caused concern for other people as well.  There was great concern among the Garda Síochána that a murder had remained unsolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I do not think that those who are or who see themselves as the victims of the two pieces of legislation which the Minister has mentioned will be reassured.  Fortunately, for myself, the implications of these offences do not trouble me, but it does trouble a substantial minority &mdash; probably of the order of 10,000 people &mdash; in our society who do genuinely feel frightened by this legislation and who so <Col N="1118" /> far have not got a sufficient answer to the question.  I do not want to become involved in the difference between homosexual acts between consenting adults and buggery, but it is a fact that the two pieces of legislation do exist, that there was a phase in Northern Ireland when particularly the RUC used that legislation in a quite offensive fashion against people who were campaigning to have the law changed.  The general secretary of the Garda Representative Association delivered himself of a magnificent piece of self-righteousness about homosexuals campaigning to have the law changed and about how it manifested the basic tendency towards corruption in Irish society.  Therefore I regret that the Minister cannot either say that that offensive legislation will be removed or give some assurance to the people involved.</P>
      <P>I keep having to express my regret that the Minister still does not give us much indication of what is going to be done for people who are not charged.  We will not argue about whether he said a majority or not &mdash; a substantial proportion.  There is very little written into the Bill to protect those people.  The real protection, and I accept that, is that when people come to court they can claim unlawful detention or unlawful treatment.  There is no question about that.  If people do not come to court, all they have available to them are various procedures which are going to be enormously expensive.  I can testify from what people have said to me that if you have been detained in Garda custody the last thing you want to do is to pursue the matter.  For many people, the one thing they want to do is to forget about the whole thing.  I regret very much, therefore, the fact that various attempts to try to ensure that written into the legislation were protections for people so that people would know in a somewhat clearer fashion what their rights were do not seem to be acceptable to the Minister.</P>

Therefore, it behoves us to try to mitigate the adverse effects of the introduction of detention to the greatest degree possible.

    <P>Three clear viewpoints have emerged in this House with regard to the prospect of detention.  There is a substantial, and probably the majority, group of Senators who enthusiastically agree with the concept of detention.  There is a smaller and significant number of people who while they agree on the need for detention do so with the greatest reluctance.  There is a small number of Senators who do not agree that detention is necessary.  The purpose of this amendment is to try to forge a coalition between two of those three categories.  I do not make any apology for that.  I think it is in the interests <Col N="1120" /> of the people who believe that while section 4 is necessary, it has dangers, and it is in their interests to ensure that if introduced, it is introduced with the maximum number and type of safeguards. Similarly there are those who like myself, are opposed to the concept of detention for the purpose of questioning.  While these exists in this House these three categories of people, the small category who are against detention for the purpose of questioning have now been beaten. Our race is run and we must now try to concentrate our efforts on mitigating the efforts of the introduction of detention.</P>
    <P>During our exchanges on Committee Stage the Minister brought to the attention of the House on a number of occasions certain aspects of the Ó Briain Report.  I brought to the attention of the House certain other aspects of the report. The Minister and I had quite a considerable discussion as to the status of the various quotations and the importance that should be attached to them.  This section is directly related to recommendations in the Ó Briain Report.  The Ó Briain Report, as the Minister said, is not Holy Writ.  There is no reason why it should be accepted as being correct in all its conclusions.  Therefore, it is open to any of us to agree or disagree with portions of it, with sections of it, or with its main conclusions.  There is a thread running through the Ó Briain Report that the people in the care and custody of the Garda Síochána need special attention by reason of the fact that they find themselves in a hostile environment, or, if not hostile, certainly in an unaccustomed and unusual environment.  There is reference in the report to the fact that being present in a Garda station can be quite disconcerting even for hardened criminals.  Certainly it can be a disconcerting experience for those who, even though they might have committed a crime, are not by any stretch of the imagination habitual criminals.</P>
    <P>Having examined that problem and having given the matter as full consideration as they considered right and proper, the committee did make certain recommendations. One recommendation <Col N="1121" /> struck me as particularly appropriate.  It was in connection with the right of the detainee, or the accused person as the case may be, to access to a member of the legal profession.  In response to this the Minister introduced section 5 which recognises that access to a solicitor is an important element in the framework being set up under this legislation.  However, when Members examine section 5 they will notice that when the section is stripped of its particular care for those under the age of 17 years, it is a very limited section.  It merely enacts what is the constitutional law, the Minister may have added slightly to it in one or two ways and he may, in his regulations, add even more to it.  But by and large, it merely confirms the right of access to a solicitor and the notification of detention. Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person not below the age of seventeen years is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to section 4, the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station shall inform him or cause him to be informed without delay that he is entitled to consult a solicitor and to have notification of his detention and of the station where he is being detained sent to one other person reasonably named by him and shall, on request, cause a solicitor and the named person to be notified accordingly as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>That extends the constitutional rights of the people slightly.  In so far as it does that, I think it is right and proper.  Having considered the constitutional right which people had under <i>The State (Harrington) v. Garvey</i> case, the Ó Briain Report made a very specific recommendation as to the part that the solicitor should play in the investigative process on his arrival at the station; and it went a little further than that.  I will quote from column 750, of the Official Report, of 26 September 1984.  Paragraph 5 of the Ó Briain Report reads:</P>
    <P>If an arrested person has asked for a named solicitor, a reasonable time should elapse to allow for the attendance <Col N="1122" /> of the solicitor.  The duration of a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; must necessarily depend on the circumstances, but we regard a period of not less than one hour and not more than two hours as reasonable in most cases.  Questioning in the absence of a solicitor should not commence until that &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; has elapsed.</P>
    <P>That was the first portion and what it is basically seeking to do is to say not only should the person be informed that they are entitled to have a solicitor, not only should the Garda cause a solicitor to be notified as soon as practicable with regard to the person's detention, but that the questioning of the person in the absence of the solicitor should not commence until a reasonable time had elapsed.  It also discussed what a reasonable time is and one can have different views on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister during the course of the discussion on the rights of access to solicitors under various headings in the Bill stated that if people were given the unbridled right to the presence of a solicitor they would be inclined to say &ldquo;I want Patrick Durcan who practices in County Mayo and I am detained in the Bridewell Garda station in Dublin,&rdquo; or Cork, and that would be an unreasonable approach. Because I wish to write in as much protection as is feasible I have decided not to include in my amendment the reasonable time that the Ó Briain Report suggested should be made available during which questioning should be suspended pending the arrival of the solicitor.  I have decided not to include that because I felt it might be going beyond what was reasonable in the circumstances or what would be likely to be accepted in the circumstances rather than what was reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on the second portion of paragraph 55 which states:</P>
    <P>The solicitor should be granted access to his client immediately on arrival at the Station, the consultation to be out of the hearing of the Gardaí but subject to such requirements as to safe custody as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will seriously object to that.  I am sure the Minister has <Col N="1123" /> every intention of ensuring that all these things will happen.  The solicitor should be entitled as of right to attend any subsequent interrogation as an observer.  That was the Ó Briain Report's recommendation. In other words, when the person was arrested, when he was going to be questioned the position was that time should be allowed to elapse to allow the solicitor to arrive.  The solicitor should then consult with his client and the solicitor should be present for the remainder of the questioning but should not be entitled to participate.  I have cut out the first portion and I said that there should be no waiting time, let the questioning commence immediately, but that the solicitor should be entitled as of right to attend any subsequent interrogation as an observer.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to accede to my request that there should be no stop on the investigation.  The investigation can commence and questioning in so far as it is reasonable can commence but the solicitor from the time of his arrival at the Garda station should be entitled to attend at the questioning of the detained person.  That gets over the other problem that the Minister referred to in this House and in the other House.  The Minister referred to the difficulties that might arise with regard to having a panel of solicitors available and with regard to the cost that would arise in making this panel of solicitors available at all times and with regard to the difficulty of ensuring the attendance of a member of the legal profession during the whole of a period of questioning. I am proposing that we should leave that aside and we should say for whatever time he is there he should be entitled to be present.  Let the person worry about his or her own solicitor; let it apply only to people who want a solicitor but where a person has a solicitor and the solicitor is present at the Garda station, the solicitor should be entitled to be present during the course of questioning for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The way in which I recommend doing this is by adding a new subsection to section 5 which is subsection (4), stating that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Where a person is detained under the provisions of section 4, the solicitor of the detained person, from the time of the solicitor's arrival at the Garda station, shall be entitled to be present at any questioning of the detained person.  The solicitor shall not be entitled to participate in the questioning</P>
    <P>We are at the crucial point here.  Is there an objection in principle to the solicitor being present during the questioning? We are not talking about the solicitor being able to say to the accused, &ldquo;Do not answer that question&rdquo;.  I do not want the solicitor to have that right, I just want the solicitor to be there.  The solicitor can give whatever advice he wants to give to his client during the course of their initial consultation.  All I want is that the solicitor would be there for the remainder of the questioning for as long as the solicitor deems it appropriate to be present.  If the solicitor wants to walk out after five minutes let him walk out and let the questioning continue after that, if the Garda think it is appropriate to continue the questioning and they are not being in any way oppressive, restricting or in conflict with the rights of the individual. It is a very limited right I am giving but it is a right which is based on the minimum interpretation of one of the recommendations of the Ó Briain Report and it is done in such a way that it would not involve the State in a colossal amount of money.  It would not mean that any individual could not be questioned in the absence of a solicitor.  It would not mean that the solicitor would be able to switch on and switch off the investigation by his presence or availability.  It would merely allow for the possibility of the solicitor being there even when that situation was appropriate.  For that reason I think it is a very modest amendment and I ask the Members of the House, of all political parties, to support this amendment which would be a considerable improvement to the concept of detention which I accept is going to be included in this Bill when enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my colleague, my ally and co-struggler, Senator O'Leary, <Col N="1125" /> put his finger on the nub of the question. Is there an inherent objection to the presence of a third party when a person is being questioned?  That is what we are talking about, not an intervention by a third party, not advice from a third party or anything like that, but an inherent objection to the presence of a third party and in this case the third party whom most of us recognise is most useful to be there, a member of the legal profession. With all my reservations about the legal profession I would concede that.  If there is an inherent objection and it is stated I think Senator O'Leary will reply very admirably.  For many of us the question of the right of a third party to be present is the nub of the question of why we fear powers of detention, because we think there is going to be either actually or implied or with the various devices available in terms of inducement and persuasion to a professional police force an attempt to induce people to say things that under different circumstances they would be either well advised enough or wise, clever or stable enough not to say. If it is simply that people are to be questioned about things they are willing to talk about freely there is no reason to object to a third party being present.</P>
      <P>There are positive reasons for the Garda to welcome the presence of a third party because of allegations about how the questioning was conducted, whether it was oppressive in any form or at any time.  When those things are raised in court if a third party had been present, a member of the legal profession, whatever his duties to his client he is not going to perjure himself in the interests of his client.  The presence of a third party during questioning would alleviate a considerable amount of unease, fear and worry.  The absence of a third party leaves the section unquestioning with some of the implications that we are leaving people with the right to silence but we hope they will not insist on it and we hope the Garda will persuade them not to.  I find that profoundly disturbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary made the point perfectly clearly.  This is the nub of the issue. Why should there be any inherent objection <Col N="1126" /> to a third party being present as a silent observer when a suspect is being questioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly I should like to go into the interpretation of this amendment.  Senator O'Leary suggested a political type argument, that this is a minimalist type of amendment.  It is in a number of ways, not least in the last sentence which proposes that the solicitor shall not be entitled to participate in the questioning.  The general argument about access to a solicitor has been considerably shrunken to deal specifically with the right of a solicitor to be present.  This is a very considerable narrowing of the general case built around the principle of access which was developed on the Second and Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one point which I found interesting.  The amendment is very much less than what I understand to be the thinking represented in the editorials of <i>Gazette</i> of the Incorporated Law Society. Shortly after the initiation of the legislation, in November 1983 <i>Gazette</i> referred to the general principle of access and its importance.  It cited two recent cases, the <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Lynch</i> and the McShane case.  In regard to both, the editorial made the important point about dangerous statements being made in relation to occasions when the principle of access was affected.  In the first case the accused person had undergone questioning for a period of 22 hours and later outside witnesses showed that the statement could not be sustained.  In the second case, which was a very serious one, an issue was raised about the access provision not being implemented during a weekend.  The editorial continues:</P>
      <P>It is not difficult to see this provision being construed in the case of an arrest on a Friday evening as notification of the following Monday morning.  There is nothing in the Bill to limit the station switching suspects, which the courts have criticised.  If the detention parts of the Bill are to be introduced, the introduction of a duty solicitor system in larger urban centres will become essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> That is a general argument that this amendment does not take on board.  Its proposals operate only in relation to a very confined aspect of the argument in respect to access.</P>
    <P>Those were the arguments of the Incorporated Law Society in November last year.  In June 1984 <i>Gazette</i> of the Incorporated Law Society, under the heading &ldquo;Unbalanced&rdquo; Bill, repeated its arguments in relation to access by a solicitor to his client or, it stated, more importantly, access by a client to his solicitor.  They say this is not adequately covered.  By their own admission in November 1983, I regard the Incorporated Law Society as a conservative body.  I do not think the journal they publish is an inflammatory magazine of a madly reforming kind.</P>
    <P>These editorials, one shortly after the introduction of the Bill and the other much later, did not retreat from one of the core principles of their submission on this legislation, the importance of the principle of access.  Senator O'Leary's motion is of the very minimalist because it goes beyond the arguments in relation to a person picking a solicitor in a remote area to whom access might not easily or quickly be effected.  It simply asks that from the moment of arrival at the station the solicitor should have access to the client.  The amendment goes on to suggest that the solicitor shall not be entitled to participate in the questioning.  It seems, therefore, that the argument about administrative difficulties cannot be adduced reasonably in relation to this amendment.  The amendment, though minimalist, has great merit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment as one worthy of consideration by the Minister.  In one way I wonder if it is necessary at all because the section is not at all clear as to what &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; means, as to what &ldquo;access&rdquo; means.  Even if the detained person was told that he was not entitled to have his solicitor present he could insist on consulting his solicitor concerning almost every question <Col N="1128" /> he was asked.  He might say, &ldquo;That question seems to me to be very serious and fraught with all sorts of serious consequences for me and I want to consult my solicitor&rdquo;.  In such a case the Garda might like to let the solicitor be present at the questioning because otherwise they would have to stop every few moments to allow the detainee to consult his solicitor. The section is not at all clear as to what &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; means, and the section does not have the word &ldquo;access&rdquo; in it except in a headnote.  The powers given to the Garda under section 6 can be counted as six and all of them are radically different.  A person might well say that he wants to consult a solicitor as to whether the Garda are entitled to his name and address, to search him, to photograph him, to take his fingerprints. The person might want to consult his solicitor on numerous occasions in the course of the detention.</P>
      <P>A person must be entitled to consult his solicitor at several different times and on several different points during the course of his detention, and therefore I can see no serious objection, particularly in view of the authorities that have been quoted by previous Senators as to the desirability of having a third person present. There is a very strong case for allowing a solicitor to be present during questioning.  It certainly does not create the situation which was mentioned earlier on in this debate of a garda having to wait until a solicitor arrived and, possibly, having great difficulty in getting a solicitor. It merely says that if a solicitor is there he should be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very definitely an amendment which should be considered, which should be agreed to by the Minister and, possibly, as a kind of a footnote to this, even if it achieves nothing else it might have the effect of making the Garda get on with the investigation very quickly and conclude it before the solicitor arrives. That, of course, is not the purpose of this amendment but it might be helpful in achieving what I wished to achieve in one of my amendments, of getting the investigation over quickly and not having <Col N="1129" /> people detained for longer than really necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how much I welcome the comments of Senators Eoin Ryan and Michael Higgins in relation to this matter.  I certainly feel very strongly, as, indeed, I did prior to the Minister's response in relation to the development of an independent tribunal to look into complaints, that in the State of Ireland today, it is particularly important, especially when we consider it is that section of society out of which many of the people may come who are being detained, that they should have access to some form of representation.  It should be known in the communities in which they exist that they will have such access. Having said that, I can understand the Minister's predicament.  In my profession I am called, as little as possible, I always hope, to the courts in Belfast and one of the first questions I have been asked coming through the door is, &ldquo;which side are you on&rdquo;?  I cannot, for the life of me, see that in a legal profession which is concerned with justice primarily rather than litigation, that my side should be important.  The evidence I would give should be the important matter.  We have, in fact, reason to fear the intimidation of lawyers and solicitors as ordinary people.  Just as prisoners, or detainees, are terribly intimidated by uniformed people interrogating them, so I would suggest younger members of the Garda, or of a police force anywhere, can be quite intimidated by the legal process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only putting forward one suggestion. I would go further than Senator O'Leary and would be much more inclined to the proposals made by Senator Michael Higgins.  The spirit of that was largely supported by Senator Eoin Ryan. If the Minister finds himself in some difficulty in this respect, and if there is fear on the part of the Garda Síochána that clever barristers, or solicitors, will soon become known to equally clever criminals that he might consider that a fourth party should be present, not just a third party.  He might consider that there might be a solicitor there who, in his opinion, <Col N="1130" /> is concerned with justice and who would be just as concerned that when the Garda were subjected to the legal process in due time in court they got as fair a hearing in the court as anybody else.  That is my suggestion to try to overcome a difficulty which I am sure presents itself to the Minister at this time.</P>
    <P>I earnestly appeal to the Minister to recognise that at a time of increasing unemployment, social unrest and tremendous tribulation and change, particularly where so many detainees will come from such a small segment of society, it is important &mdash; to use the cliché &mdash; that justice is not only done but seen to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the part of this piece of legislation which, if I did not get it across before, worried me and still worries me.  I should like to ask a very direct question and ask the Minister to give me a direct answer.  I got a very upsetting letter this morning from a parent of a mentally handicapped child. I am not going to go to cloud cuckoo land and I am not throwing in a red herring at this stage of the debate.  That is the last thing on my mind, but for somebody so long involved in this field, the letter I received was one of deep concern and upset me a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This parent asked why some Member in the Dáil or the Seanad had not asked while this Bill went through the Houses of the Oireachtas how would a garda judge if he picked up a 12 or 13 year old mildly handicapped child that that child should not have the protection of (a) a solicitor, parent or guardian or (b) a doctor?  I have dealt with these children on a voluntary basis for 20 years and I am aware that nine out of ten gardaí would not recognise a mildly handicapped child.  I want the House to be quite clear that I am not getting high about something.  I am not throwing in something that will result in all hell breaking loose, but the letter deeply upset me this morning.  Until this parent wrote this letter to me, that matter had not lifted its head in this House.  The Minister might give me an answer to that question.  How <Col N="1131" /> would that child in a Garda station be dealt with?  What protection and guidance would be given to that child?  I hope the Minister accepts my questioning in the manner I sincerely mean it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to deal with the point Senator Honan raised.  There is obviously a difficulty with children where they interact with the law and this problem is a bigger one and is reinforced if the children are incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any respect, even mildly mentally handicapped. However, as I said previously, there are no new powers of arrest.  The garda faced with the 13 or 14 year old at present who is mildly mentally handicapped has the problem that he has reasonable suspicion that this young person is involved in a crime; he arrests the young person and takes him to the Garda station.  That is not going to change in any way with the provisions of this Bill.  The problem exists already in that respect.  On coming to the Garda station &mdash; this relates to what we are talking about here &mdash; internal Garda regulations, supported by decisions of the court, have ruled that the parent or guardian must be informed and must be present in the generality of situations where somebody is questioned.  Naturally, that would be enforced and would be made statutory in the new regulations.</P>
      <P>I have had correspondence from associations concerned with mentally handicapped people and, certainly, I am studying their views and talking them into account with a view to seeing if it would be appropriate to have something specific in the regulations covering the situation raised by the Senator separate from that whole section in the regulations which will govern the treatment of young people in custody.  I am aware of the concerns of the Senator and I am glad she raised them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general amendment proposed by Senator Sean O'Leary, I should make it clear again what is and is not in the Bill.  What is in the Bill is that people will be informed of their right of access to a solicitor.  That is the right that is being <Col N="1132" /> conferred in the Bill.  I do not purport to confer the right of access to a solicitor in the Bill because that is an existing constitutional right.  In the relevant cases which I cited previously, the <i>DPP v. Madden</i> and others in the 1977 Irish Reports, page 336; the <i>State (Harrington) v. the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána</i> and others, the High Court, 14 December 1976, unreported, the constitutional right of access to a solicitor was established in the first one.  The second one restates the first judgment and also says that access to a legal adviser must be allowed in privacy and out of hearing of any member of the Garda Síochána. People should be informed of that right because frequently people are not aware of it.</P>
    <P>What is at issue in Senator O'Leary's amendment is that the solicitor should be present throughout the questioning of the suspect.  That goes much further than the courts have been prepared to go up to now in the matter of reasonable access to a solicitor and I do not think it could be justified in the context of a short detention period such as we are proposing. What the courts have decided is that there should be reasonable access and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; cannot be interpreted as unrestricted or unlimited access because if that was what was intended the courts had the opportunity on two occasions to say that.  They did not say unrestricted access or unlimited access, they said reasonable access.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point that Senator Eoin Ryan raised: somebody is detained and asked a question by a member of the Garda Síochána; he says that is a serious question and he must contact his solicitor. The solicitor comes in, then the next question is asked but the solicitor is gone and he is brought back in again.  This would be interpreted as unreasonable demands and unreasonable access but, again, in the final analysis it is a matter for the courts and they said reasonable access, not unrestricted or unlimited access.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary in arguing the case for his amendment said that we should ignore the cost factor here.  Really what <Col N="1133" /> he is saying is that we put in the right of the solicitor to be present; if people can afford a solicitor, well and good, and if they cannot they might not want the solicitor and the solicitor might not be there.  In the internal safeguards in the Bill and the external safeguards in the complaints procedure and so on, the Government were very careful that whatever safeguards were put in would apply to all detainees.  It would not be appropriate that we would have a safeguard which would apply to people who could afford the safeguard and not apply to people who could not afford it.</P>
    <P>If you talk about a general right of a solicitor to be present right through a period of questioning, you are talking about some hourly fee multiplied by six or 12 as the case may be.  When we are talking about the regulations to govern the treatment of people in custody, it will be politically and practically impossible and probably wrong of a Minister to have a series of safeguards which apply to section 4 of this Bill and which he did not intend to apply subsequently to people arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  In section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act we are talking about an hourly fee and a multiplier of 48 in the most extreme circumstance. There are great practical difficulties in this.</P>
    <P>The Senators are advocating in effect that a solicitor should act as custodial guardian.  This point came up earlier in the debate and we discussed it at great length when Senator O'Leary had an amendment of similar intent where a district justice or a peace commissioner would act as custodial guardian.  I mentioned the various alternatives the Government had considered in this connection.  We talked about peace commissioners at great length, we talked about other lay persons and finally about solicitors.  I dealt with the objections in each one of these cases.  In the case of solicitors, I said there was the practical objection that solicitors in general would not be prepared to sit in a Garda station for the whole of a 12-hour period to hold themselves available for those times <Col N="1134" /> when the Garda would wish to question the suspect.  I said that I did not see it happening purely on a practical basis because the expense would be prohibitive on the client even if solicitors were prepared to do it.  I mentioned already that the courts have decided what reasonable access should be.</P>
    <P>We should not proceed on the basis that the Garda will act unprofessionally and that all other professions will always act professionally.  We should not move on that basis.  The right of access to a solicitor has been established by our courts for a long time now.  I also know that over the last ten years at least two solicitors were involved in taking advantage of that right to interview prisoners in private and two solicitors participated in a breach of security.  It is worth saying that also.</P>
    <P>Another point which Senators should bear in mind is that information given in the presence of a solicitor might in certain cases be damaging to third parties named by the suspect.  In some circumstances it might result in physical injury to a third party, it might result in the prejudice of rights of a third party to have sources of information divulged in front of a solicitor or any persons other than the Garda. I cannot overlook the fact either that there can be situations where the interests of the public in the proper investigation of offences may require that a solicitor should not be given more than the access he is already guaranteed.  That is particularly obvious in questioning persons detained under the Offences Against the State Act.  A solicitor could be engaged by a particular organisation to attend the station and sit in on questioning to prevent any intelligence information being given by suspects during questioning.  That is not an outlandish suggestion.  We are dealing with highly organised people and they could, and would if this provision was in the Bill, ensure that they had a particular solicitor retained who would tell them what happened when the Garda were questioning a suspect.  If the person who was being questioned gave information about a particular <Col N="1135" /> crime, about associates, or about particular circumstances in which he or the particular organisation was involved, that person would be seriously at risk indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not accept either that the presence of a solicitor through the period of questioning is an essential safeguard.  Even at present we should remember that the Garda keep people in custody to check out a story before they are charged.  The result may be to secure their release or to await the arrival of a parent or guardian. During this period questions are asked and statements are made.  That is quite apart from detention under section 30. These procedures have not given rise to any concern although, as I have said, the position of the Garda under the present law is uncertain and unsatisfactory when they are detaining people like this.</P>
    <P>In providing by-laws in section 4 for a reasonable two-tier maximum period of detention to replace the present uncertainty, we are adding on and building in substantial safeguards for the detained person and also for the Garda who are liable to have unfounded accusations made against them by accused persons seeking in this way to have damaging admissions made by themselves declared inadmissible.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to mention these safeguards again because they are often either ignored or dismissed as if the Garda Síochána were not the disciplined force they are and that they could not be relied on to observe them.  As I said previously, detention can only be sanctioned where the member in charge of the station has reasonable grounds for believing that it is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.  The initial detention is for a maximum of six hours and it dates from the time of arrest but the suspect must be released forthwith if he is cleared before that or charged without delay if the Garda are in a position to charge him and have the information to charge him.  Again, a maximum period of six hours can be authorised for the same reason, this time by an extension by the superintendent or officer <Col N="1136" /> of higher rank and, again, there is the same requirement of release forthwith or charging without delay.  Non-compliance with these requirements, and it can be tested in court, could result in the detention being held to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>There will also be the regulations for the treatment of persons in custody.  They will provide in particular that the member in charge will be responsible for overseeing the application of the regulations at the station.  It is specifically provided that the regulations will not disturb any civil or criminal liability the Garda may have arising out of the custody.  That liability is not affected in any way but any non-compliance with the regulations can result in disciplinary proceedings being taken against them.  There are also specific provisions for contacting a person's solicitor or his friend or the parent or guardian of a juvenile.  There are restrictions on the exercise of the powers conferred on the Garda in relation to detained persons.</P>
    <P>These are the safeguards that are in the Bill.  In addition a complaints procedure with a strong independent element will be in operation before the detention provisions are brought into force.  Also there are the provisions for electronic recording of police questioning.  As I have said, it is no harm to put this in perspective. We shall have a custodial guardian to look after the interests of the detained person, almost exactly as the Ó Briain Committee envisaged except perhaps that the member in charge under the regulations will be more likely to be a sergeant, whereas the Ó Briain Report thought of him as a garda assigned by the station sergeant or the senior garda present.  This system will provide adequate protection for the interests of the person in question, although, as I said on Committee Stage, not quite to the same extent for the Garda, as the accused will continue to have an interest in making unfounded allegations.  I said that only electronic recording will fully deal with this problem.  That is the background which leads me to argue that there is no need to go further than the present law requires provided the person's solicitor <Col N="1137" /> should have unrestricted right to be present throughout the questioning.  I am fully in favour of the present position where a solicitor has reasonable access and the Garda will ensure that that reasonable access will be carried out in accordance with the law and that consultations will be in private and out of the hearing of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's reply unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.  First of all, I did not state at any stage in proposing my amendment that it sought to establish the position that solicitors would have the right to be present throughout the period of detention. That was never my intention.  It was never my intention even that they would be present throughout the period of questioning, but merely from the point at which they arrived at the station.  The Minister is facing in three directions at the one time.</P>
      <P>First, I must consider the arguments being put forward by the Minister concerning the extension of the right of access to a solicitor and its application to this law.  The right of access to a solicitor as outlined in the various cases mentioned by the Minister arises in respect of the vindication of the person's right under various headings of our Constitution. It does not mean that they are the only rights that the person has or the only rights that the person should have.  It is not a reasonable argument to say that because the court did not extend the constitutional right of a solicitor to be present throughout the questioning that that right should not be given by the Legislature. We are not limited by what is in the Constitution, except in so far as we cannot take away the rights that are in the Constitution.  We can, of course, add to the rights that are in the Constitution. The Constitution is not a document which limits the right which we give to the citizens. It merely gives a benchmark beyond which we cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court, in considering whether or not to extend the right of access to a solicitor or if it did consider at all the question of the right of a solicitor to be <Col N="1138" /> present throughout the period was not considering the position as it arises under section 4 of this Bill because section 4 of this Bill did not exist.  It did not consider that.  We do not even know whether or not there is a constitutional right to be present in respect of detention which arises under section 4 of this Act.  That is something which, no doubt, will be tested in time in our constitutional courts.  It is not reasonable to say, because the court did not give to somebody detained under the Offences Against the State Act the right for the solicitor to be present at all times, that they will arrive at a similar conclusion in respect of people detained under this Bill.  There is no indication whatsoever or guarantee that they will arrive at the same conclusion.  Even if they did arrive at the same conclusion, I put it to the House that we should extend that right, that we should go further than what the Constitution says and confer upon the person the right to have the solicitor present, as in this minimal amendment.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as Senator Higgins said, that is a minimalist approach.  The amendment was put down in the hope that the Minister would accept it.  It was not put down as a benchmark, nor were any of my Committee or Report Stage amendments put down for any other reason but that I hoped that the Minister would accept them.  I had made my various approaches under the various sections on Committee Stage of the Bill. My attitude from that on was to help to improve the Bill and it was in that spirit that I put the amendments down.</P>
    <P>I concede absolutely what Senator Robb said about there being no question of solicitors being for or against the accused, that solicitors are officers of the court.  I must refer to what the Minister has said, directly or indirectly, on a number of occasions about criticism of certain solicitors who have behaved in an irresponsible fashion.  I am quite sure there are solicitors like that.  For the Minister to base his case on the irresponsible acts of a few solicitors would be as irresponsible as for me to base my opposition to this Bill on the irresponsible <Col N="1139" /> actions of a few members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Minister has resolutely objected to members saying that because a few Garda Síochána members had abused the powers conferred on them under other Bills that that <i>ipso facto</i> should mean that they should not get increased powers.  He has resisted that strongly.  The Minister cannot say that that is not a relevant consideration in considering the extension of the powers of the Garda Síochána and at the same time, just because a few members of the honourable profession of solicitors might from time to time misbehave, deny them the right of access to their clients and the right to be present during the course of their questioning.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about the Offences Against the State Act and about the fact that this could not apply to the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not want it to apply to that Act.  This is not an amendment of the Offences Against the State Act.  Nobody has been more strident than the Minister in saying that we are not considering the Offences Against the State Act.  We are not considering that Act.  Therefore, what may or may not arise from the same rights that are given to people under the Offences Against the State Act is not a relevant consideration in dealing with the protection of the rights of the individuals who are going to be detained under section 4 of this Bill.  If the Minister wants to amend the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; and there are one or two ways in which I would like to see it amended, although I do not think this is one &mdash; that Act should be amended in so far as the Schedule of Offences should be looked at.  The Minister has given an indication of a desire to do that but that is another day out in this House in which we could consider the very genuine problems that arise during the course of the debate arising out of any proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has looked two ways at once about solicitors misbehaving being used but Garda Síochána misbehaving not being used as the basis for an argument. He has also looked both ways in <Col N="1140" /> saying that there might be dangers in solicitors being present because of the information which might be given to outside people.  If electronic recording is going to mean anything, there will have to be some system of access to the electronic recording &mdash; not necessarily taking copies of it &mdash; by those who allege that they have been ill-treated.</P>
    <P>Whatever considerations of confidentiality arise in respect of the questions which may be put opposite a solicitor, will also arise in respect of the electronic recording method.  You cannot say &ldquo;I am in favour of electronic recording but I am against telling the people what went on.&rdquo; When you have an electronic recording, everybody is going to know.  The reality is that the Minister's advisers are determined that there will never be electronic recording.  The Minister will no longer be Minister and they will get their way.  The Minister will never introduce electronic recording.  He will not be able to do so because he will not be permitted to do so by the vested interests of the security forces of the State.</P>
    <P>Electronic recording has already come under attack as being &ldquo;impractical&rdquo; by the representatives of the Garda Síochána. This is one of the ways in which it is reputed to be impractical.  Let me make this prophecy, an electronic recording will not be included.  I am not talking about experimenting.  It will not be introduced during the lifetime of this administration.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, this is a most reasonable amendment.  It is, as Senator Higgins said, a minimal amendment and it is important that the very limited protections it will afford should be extended to the people detained under section 4.  I recognise what Senator Eoin Ryan said. I think it is very valuable and could hurry up the whole process.  The question of whether repeated consultation with a solicitor could or could not take place is a very interesting point.  More than one consultation with a solicitor could take place, there can be little or no doubt about that, but whether repeated consultations could take place is a different matter.  But that is not the issue here, <Col N="1141" /> as Senator Ryan has correctly analysed. This is very much less than what might otherwise have been introduced.  For <Col N="1142" /> these reasons I feel that this amendment should be accepted by the House and I ask them to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be cribbing about this, but I should be grateful if Members of the Seanad would resume their seats after divisions because there is a great deal of noise about the place.  Thank you very much.</P>
      <P>The tellers involved in the division on the Fifth Stage of the Copyright Bill, 1984, earlier today, have come to me and stated that an error has been made in the division in that Senator Lanigan was not recorded as voting níl.  In the circumstances, the result of the division will be altered in the Journal of the proceedings today to take account of the error.  However, in correcting the error I must put on record, as I believe has already been done earlier today in the House, that the clerks are only responsible for recording the names of the Members.  The tellers are responsible for the accuracy of the numbers.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 17 is an alternative to No. 18 and they may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;Sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 will not apply to persons below the age of 12 years.</P>
      <P>I do not want either to use language which is unnecessarily emotive nor do I want to leave myself open to the accusation of using language which is unnecessarily emotive.  Nevertheless, there is a very fundamental issue of principle involved in these sections.  It is possible, I understand, that sections 15 and 16 cannot apply to persons under 16 years because persons under 16 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment.  My understanding is that they are not usually sentenced to imprisonment.  I am not certain that it is legally impossible to sentence children under 16 years to imprisonment.  So we will carry on on the assumption that it is theoretically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my understanding of Committee Stage, the Minister was fairly clear that sections 18 and 19 would apply to persons above the age of criminal responsibility and that it was his desire that that should <Col N="1144" /> continue to be the case.  I want to go through each of the sections now briefly and I do not want to take very long about it because while I would never concede that we have lost the battle &mdash; in a democracy battles are never over &mdash; it is one of the great virtues of democracy, therefore, whatever we win or lose on this occasion in this struggle on this issue you can take it that we will be back at every opportunity we get to try to redress the balance that many of us find so unevenly loaded at present.</P>
    <P>We are late on in this discussion and there is no point in prolonging it &mdash; I would probably be technically out of order if I were to repeat everything.  The four sections have implications for children over and above the question of young people being in contact with the law.  I will talk about young people being in contact with the law first.  Let us get rid of a few of the arguments that have been thrown around here.  The fact that many other areas of our law permit certain things to be done with or to young people in terms of detention and questioning and so on, is no argument for persisting with that position.  The fact that something is going to be done in the indefinite future about the whole question of juvenile justice is no argument for persisting, maintaining or insisting upon something that runs counter to what most of us understand to be the future thrust of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Since the proposals on juvenile justice in the national plan consist of about seven lines of a vague statement and therefore are very far down the line, we must do all we can to preserve young people from further run-ins with the law.  There are further implications involved in this.</P>
    <P>The sections about witholding information regarding firearms or stolen property are written in such a way that nothing that a person says can be used to incriminate himself or herself and nothing that a person says can be used to incriminate his or her spouse.  But it can be used to have a child incriminate his or her parents.  Indeed, where a child apparently refuses to give such information it is an offence, whether or not it is punishable. <Col N="1145" /> It is still definitely, or apparently would be, an offence.  The Minister can settle my concern on these points fairly clearly in a moment.  But my information is that it would be an offence and it would be punishable in theory at least.</P>
    <P>I find it distasteful that a child could ever be in a position of having to give information that would in some way incriminate his or her parents.  I accept that it is exceptional and unusual for children to be involved in firearms offences.  I accept that whatever my qualms or reservations, the whole area of access to firearms in the commission of crimes is a serious problem and one that we in this country, unfortunately, have to come to terms with in the context of our largely unarmed police force, something that all of us in the House value and which all of us who have watched developments in Northern Ireland in recent years would wish to retain.  Therefore, the question of withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition has logic to it.</P>
    <P>However, stolen property can range from a book, a bottle of milk up to massive amounts of stolen goods.  It seems to me that such a wide-ranging offence can draw children in very easily.  They may well have been present, they may well have some suspicion that what is in their house was stolen.  Children's perceptions of what goes on in the world are very often quite acute, yet it is proposed that anybody over seven years, presumably, could be questioned.  I object to that. Such a child could be asked to explain how he or she came upon stolen property. I object to that because I do not believe that is the way to deal with young people.</P>
    <P>We are talking about children, not adults.  They do not have the responsibilities of adults, or their opportunities, and quite clearly we cannot attribute to them the capacity to accept responsibility or to take the consequences of things they do. Much against my better judgment, I have used the age of 12 in the amendment not because I believe it is the best age but because I think it might be an age the Minister would consider and accept.  At least we can argue about the principle without getting involved in distinctions <Col N="1146" /> between 12, 17 and various things along the way.</P>
    <P>I would prefer the age of 17 below which a totally different regime should be operated in regard to juveniles because there is ample evidence that neither the coercive methods of which people would not approve &mdash; there are the &ldquo;bring back the birch&rdquo; brigade and people like them from whom I know the Minister is an outstanding exception &mdash; nor others should be applied to juveniles.  Neither that regime nor the alternatives of education and rehabilitation and training seem to work.  The British Government's experience of the sharp, short shock treatment has been that the instances of second offences have been as frequent as after the operations of other forms of treatment when dealing with juvenile crime.  Juvenile crime is motivated differently, organised differently and repeated for different reasons.</P>
    <P>The centre of my objection to sections 16 and 17 is in relation to children being questioned by the Garda about these matters.  I do not think the ordinary member of the Garda, without specialist training or knowledge, should ever be dealing with children, no matter what the exigencies or the circumstances are. Children are very important and should be dealt with sensitively.  I have ample experience of the way in which children are dealt with by the Garda.  They are dealt with very sensitively and I concede that the Garda often have to do the job that should be done by caring agencies in relation to the provision of overnight accommodation for homeless children.  It is to the credit of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The issue here is not a suggestion of abuse, it is not even a hint that our young people are being abused.  The issue is the impact on children of contact with the law in the guise of the law enforcement agency.  In sections 18 and 19 there are implications which will reflect particularly on young people who are less than articulate.  Children under 12 years cannot be detained for questioning &mdash; the Minister's amendment in the other House ensures that &mdash; so any inferences of an accused's presence at a particular <Col N="1147" /> place will be based on an immediate contact between the Garda and a child. Apparently the child's parents cannot be present since the child will not be in a Garda station.  The child will be seen at a particular place, the Garda will ask him what he is doing there, the child will say &ldquo;Mind your own business&rdquo; and the Garda will be able to use that in evidence against the child in court subsequently.</P>
    <P>I do not like that.  I find the implications in it for children quite astonishing.  I find the suggestion that somehow we need those powers against children to be quite astonishing, and I will use words I have used before: to put children into that sort of relationship with the Garda is unfair to the Garda but particularly to children. It implies a lack of civilisation on our part to put children into that sort of relationship. I, and I am sure the Minister, have had representations from a number of groups dealing with children who are worried about the inference from an accused's presence at a particular place.  I know it can be used only as corroborative evidence but it is a new and different part of our criminal law.  When it is intended to apply it, it should be applied only to people against whom there is serious evidence of serious crimes.  It would be simple, it would be practicable and I do not think there would be any particular implications in regard to the intentions of the Minister and others who support the Bill if children aged 12 years and under were to be excluded.</P>
    <P>Children below that age have not got the articulation, the knowledge of their rights or the maturity to cope with that. They would be wide open to misunderstanding. The suggestion that it could be explained to them in ordinary language is quite naive in the circumstances of the pressures a member of the Garda would be under and his busy routine.  In regard to young people, particularly those in marginal situations, who come into contact with the law, the sort of somewhat less than intellectually adequate young people who end up in places of detention for young people, the evidence is that the incidence of intelligence in young people <Col N="1148" /> in places of detention is about 5 per cent or 10 per cent lower than in that general age group in society.  That speaks for itself.  It is that sort of intellectual capacity and educational attainment of the young people who will come into contact with the law because they were at a particular place at a particular time, it loads the dice more heavily against some of the vulnerable people in our society.  I do not say that 12 years is an age about which I am particularly happy but it is the age the Minister chose in another section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is adopting precisely the same approach as I adopted in the last amendment.  He is being very modest.  He is not looking for 16 years of age.  He is merely trying to make the age 12 years.  I know that his view is it should be considerably higher. Recognising that the Minister has excluded people under 12 years from some of the provisions of the Bill, there are different considerations applying to each section.  It is true to say that section 19 applies only to a person who is arrested without warrant.  Therefore, it applies only in this case to a person under 12 years of age who is arrested without warrant at a time when the alleged offence has been committed and, as the section states:</P>
      <P>(b)  the member reasonably believes that the presence of the person at that place and at that time may be attributable to his participation in the commission of the offence, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the member informs the person that he so believes, and requests him to account for such presence, and</P>
      <P>(d)  the person fails or refuses to do so,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of any of these inference sections requires a decision, a judgment by the person who is the subject of the section and it is quite inappropriate that they should apply to any person who is below the age not only of criminal responsibility but the higher age at which there is a rebuttable presumption of the person's innocence of a crime.  That it should apply to a person of seven or eight <Col N="1149" /> years of age is just not right.  I have no doubt that when the Minister's colleague brings in the Children Bill these, and many other considerations, will be taken into account.  It is reasonable to assume that there appears to be emerging a very minimal increase to the age of 12 in respect of raising the age of criminal responsibility.  Therefore, Senator Brendan Ryan's attitude to this amendment is quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply to section 18.  That section requires arrest without warrant and that the mark be on the person.  It requires the person to make a judgment as to whether he is going to explain that or not, a judgment between the adverse consequences of not explaining it and anything which might arise at the subsequent trial.  The mere fact that a person has a mark on him, a mark which has been imparted to him during the commission of what appears to be an offence does not necessarily mean that he had committed an offence.  For the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence wilfulness may be a necessary ingredient, knowledge to one degree or another may be a necessary part of the offence.  Consequently, in deciding whether or not to account for these matters a person has to make a judgment. What the Minister is doing is tipping the balance in favour of making a disclosure because he is saying if a person does not make a disclosure there may be inferences drawn from it.  That is a judgment an adult may be in a position to make, although the adult may not always be in a position to do that.  However, it is certainly true to say that no child under 12 years of age would be in a position to make such a judgment.  That is another reason why I think this is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to a person who has firearms or ammunition.  Even in the case of a person of 12, 13 or 14 years of age it may be considered right that he should account for where he got the firearm.  A person under 12 years of age would, if this Bill is not amended, be under an obligation to explain where he got the firearm.  Instinctively, people might say that is a reasonable enough thing to <Col N="1150" /> expect but what is not reasonable to expect is that the scale of the offence which the person committed in not disclosing this information is beyond the comprehension of a person of such tender years.  We are not giving the person any choice.  We are just saying he has to.  We are using a really terrifying instrument to do that.</P>
    <P>Section 15 contains a particular additional piece of responsibility which was described in the other House by Deputy John Kelly as an extraordinary, if not a unique, addition to Irish jurisprudence. Basically, what he was referring to was the requirement in section 15 that not only if a person could give the information which they have in their possession, they are also under an obligation to take whatever reasonable steps they may have to inform themselves with regard to the facts in question.  The section does not just say where a person is found in possession of firearms the garda has reasonable grounds for believing and he informs that person of this belief.  It does not say that it requires a person to give them any information in their possession.  It says that the person is required to give any information which he can obtain by taking reasonable steps.  That is an additional requirement under that section and this is the portion of the section which was referred to in the other House as being of an extraordinary nature.  It was extraordinary because it introduced a relatively new concept into legislation, requiring that a person in order to fulfil their duty under penalty of law should not only give the information which they have now but should seek additional information which they can reasonably get.  That is really a most extraordinary development.  I have the exact quotation from the other House which will give this House an idea of the scope of the section. The matter in the other House was reported at column 978 of the Dáil Official Report.  Deputy Kelly said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has made a reasonable inquiry of the Minister, what the Minister has in mind in regard to the obligation which section 14 would appear to impose on somebody who <Col N="1151" /> has been interrogated in this way to take reasonable steps to obtain information which was not in his possession. It may be that the Minister and the Department have something particular in their minds and it may be that when we hear it it will cut the ground from under the misgivings I have about a form like that.  Those misgivings relate to the relative rarity &mdash; I am not sure that it is not quite unprecedented but at any rate it is extremely rare &mdash; for a Bill like this to impose in certain conditions a duty on somebody or an incohate or incipent criminal liability which that person can discharge by future action...</P>
    <P>Basically, Deputy Kelly was saying that the extraordinary responsibility, the extraordinary duty was imposed on somebody to take additional steps to inform themselves.  When the Minister was replying, I do not think he dealt fully with that matter.  We can only assume that the position as stated by Deputy Kelly &mdash; anybody reading the section can only assume that it is true &mdash; remains true, that under the section a person has to take reasonable steps.  Is it reasonable then to expect a person under 12 years of age to take reasonable or any steps? People might say to me, &ldquo;Well, a court would take into account the person's age in deciding what would be reasonable for them to do,&rdquo; but it is reasonable that the matter should be considered?  Taking all those circumstances into account Senator Ryan's amendment is the minimum of what should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with explaining the origin of certain property.  This section is different from the other three sections in that in the other two sections, Nos. 17 and 18 the person had to be arrested without warrant and, therefore, the Garda had to have a reasonable suspicion that they committed an offence.  In the other case the person has to be found in possession of firearms, but here it is merely a question of the person having property in his possession.  We have an amendment before us this evening which seeks to extend that.  In other words, the <Col N="1152" /> children in the street can be asked and required under penalty of law to explain the origin of the property they have.  As it stands unamended that goes very far and even after the ministerial amendment, it is an extraordinarily wide section. It will call on a person not only to explain in respect of the property itself which may have been stolen or unlawfully obtained in one way or another but also in respect of the proceeds.  That is what you are requiring a child to do under the penalty of imprisonment.  There is no point in my saying what are the terms of imprisonment.  That is only playing on emotionalism.  That the child should be under any obligation, if there was never a question of penalty, to explain where he got property which is in his possession and which he may have got from his parents, is ludicrous in respect of a person under 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>My instinct is to support the amendment of Senator Robinson and Senator Higgins which seeks to achieve the same thing in respect of 15-year olds.  A very strong case can be made for either.  In the circumstances the Minister could shorten the discussion by telling us that he is accepting the latter amendment, in which case the first amendment would undoubtedly not be moved.  I feel that the House should give serious consideration to making this amendment because it is appropriate.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 18, in the name of Senator Robinson and myself, it should be understood that Senator Robinson is chairing a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and cannot be with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of substantial arguments in favour of raising the age from 12 to 15 were put forward on Committee Stage and the specific arguments as they related to section 15, 16, 18 and 19 have been developed by Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator O'Leary.  The only point I want to make about what I suppose should be referred to, if I take up Senator O'Leary's point, as the immodest amendment if <Col N="1153" /> you take the other one to be the modest proposal it is, is that we were influenced in placing this amendment by the representations which had been made to us by the number of child care organisations to which I made reference on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that in reforming criminal law you must retain the principle that the law exists perhaps much more for the protection of the innocent than it does for the apprehension and imposition of sanctions on absolutely everybody who is guilty.  Put it another way, if the occasional guilty person escapes it is far less of a wrong I would argue in the view of the criminal law as I understand it looking at it from outside than that an innocent person be apprehended.  That has been the thrust of the law as it has evolved.  The fundamental principles within that are based on, for example, the different certainties within the criminal legal process which have evolved over the years and also certain presumptions that have grown up, such as the presumption of innocence until proven guilty and the related concept of the right to silence, perhaps not specifically established but generally understood.</P>
    <P>If you were to take that and extend it, I think the assumptions that must guide you in framing legislation of this kind &mdash; leaving aside the earlier arguments as to the appropriateness of detention for questioning and whatever &mdash; must be ones that are addressed to the position of children in general.  In the development of an argument from the specific evidence of children of relatively young age who have become involved, or have been shown to be involved, in major crimes you cannot depart from that minority of children to develop sections of legislation that will impact on children in general.  I think you have to be guided by the general concept in this regard of the characteristics of children of tender years in general.  The general principle of the Travers decision and the President of the High Court's statement was that it is in general most desirable in the interests of justice, unless there are practical impossibilities <Col N="1154" /> arising, that if a person about the age of 14 is suspected of the commission of a crime he should not be questioned or interrogated except in the presence of a parent or parents or some person of an adult kind who is looking after him as an accepted guardian.  That decision was quoted by CARE and the other organisations to which I referred at different stages of the passage of this Bill through this House.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is not that Senator Robinson and I are anxious to develop a less attractive proposal than that of Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator O'Leary.  The age we suggest &mdash; 15 years &mdash; is the one that is consistent with a number of interpretations as to capacity and as to the possibility of understanding the procedures that are at stake and the sections to which the amendment makes reference.  It is for that reason that we have chosen the age of 15 years.  It happens also to be the age which is chosen for most of the submissions from the child care organisations.</P>
    <P>As has been correctly pointed out by Senator O'Leary and Senator Brendan Ryan, amendment No. 18 specifically addresses itself to sections 15, 16, 18 and 19.  Amendments on Committee Stage referring to earlier sections of the Bill have obviously been decided upon by this House so the amendment is focused on the specific terms of sections 15, 16, 18 and 19.  I think Senator O'Leary has developed the argument in terms of capacity or the probability of the people affected in the age groups to which we make reference, of understanding the balance of the scale of the offence and the sanctions and penalties which are involved in their withholding of information. I would only add to his general observations in this regard that there is the question equally of the impact of these measures on the young population involved.  I would stress that my arguments on Second Stage were not developed from a simply civil libertarian framework but were from a socio-economic group.  This did not meet with much support from some Senators but I emphasise <Col N="1155" /> it yet again that it will impact disproportionately on people with very lower rates of partcipation in formal education, people who have experience of disadvantage and so on.  The distinction between sections 16 and 15 of the Bill have been made by Senator O'Leary.  It creates a new kind of relationship on the street between the enforcement authority and the people to whom these new powers could potentially, perhaps even not probably, be directed.  The distinction varies, even if it is the distinction that where reasonable grounds have been satisfied that a person is in possession of any property and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the property is stolen and that the person has been informed of this belief, the enforcing agent shall at that stage begin to make inquiries.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that it is my purpose, as much as anything else, in everything I have to say in the passage of this Bill, to question the ethics of anybody trying to reduce the crime rate.  I would argue that this will impact on the community in a totally negative way.  I cannot say that it will, but it could potentially which is the appropriate question for a person making a decision on the legislation.  In relation to the arguments about sections 18 and 19, they logically follow as an extension of one's fears about sections 15 and 16.</P>
    <P>Members are well aware of the question of inferences that may be drawn from the withholding of information referred to in sections 15 and 16.  The question of inference is what we are dealing with here.  It is the compounded consequences of the Bill falling on a section of the population on whom we are anxious for it not to fall.  We have in our amendment limited ourselves to sections 15, 16, 18 and 19.  This is justifiable in terms of the sanctions that are there, particularly those which arise in relations to the potential operation of sections 15 and 16. Amendment No. 17 is a position very much less than that put forward by Senator Robinson and myself.  Fifteen was the age chosen because we felt that the arguments we developed on Committee <Col N="1156" /> Stage consistently suggested that this would be the age which we would choose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a legal luminary, I was hesitant to become involved in this debate but from listening to the contributions of my colleagues supporting these two amendments, I find that my view would be against them.  I would hope that the Minister would resist them because to accept them would be to significantly change the age of criminal responsibility.  It would certainly place a greater strain on children under 12 or 15 years, as the case may be, from ruthless criminals who would, by virtue of that very amended section, use children for their own nefarious purposes.  This would be a disastrous step and it would cause untold hardship to so many children in the years ahead.  For that reason alone, I would hope that the Minister would resist it because, from any point of view, in whose hands would the children at risk be safest?  Is somebody going to say that children, whether they be on the street or not, are safer in the hands, under the care and at the behest of the criminal elements in our society than they would be with the people who take an oath to serve the country and to implement this law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would reject the arguments being put forward in favour of these amendments and it would be a very dangerous precedent if the Minister were to accept them. The young people at risk in our society must be protected and defended in every possible way.  If the Minister is to accept this amendment and write into the Bill that children up to 12 or under 15 years would be immune in this particular fashion, who are the criminals and the organised gangs going to go after to do their dirty work for them, other than children of those tender years?  It would be placing an intolerable burden and exposing those children to intolerable dangers if the Minister were to accept that line.  I would hope that the Minister would resist those amendments because the youth of our country and especially the small numbers of children who are exposed to the criminal elements in that <Col N="1157" /> fashion surely numerically and as a percentage of the total numbers of our schoolgoing children must be very small, indeed.  Surely it is possible to provide for them, to offer them more shelter and to improve the services that are designed to look after them.</P>
    <P>To accept those amendments would be to expose these children to tremendous danger and put them as an attractive weapon for the ruthless criminals &mdash; and there are such in our society, whether they be in the political arena, or in the drug rings or acting as fences or whatever. I hope that the Minister will take the larger view and will not, as it were through the backdoor, change or alter the age of criminal responsibility in this fashion.  It is unusual to have somebody speak against an amendment in this way, but if the Minister were to accept these amendments I would see sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 then holding out great perils for young, unsuspecting people who would be used in a ruthless fashion by our criminal classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On balance, I would be prepared to take the risks which Senator McDonald has envisaged for children under these ages.  The risk of their putting themselves in a dangerous position by being subject to these sections is a far greater risk.  Sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 are new provisions.  They are very sophisticated provisions and introduce a new element into the law.  They are sophisticated in the sense that people have to keep their wits about them to avoid being trapped by the kind of situation that these sections will put them into.  I think &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; is not an unreasonable way of describing the situation in which people will be put if they are questioned under any one of these four sections.  They are new and sophisticated and they are, in a sense, a trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they were introduced at first &mdash; like many other sections of this Bill we are used to them now &mdash; there was a great deal of opposition to them.  There was a very strong feeling that they were undesirable and dangerous even when applied to people of full age.  That being so, they <Col N="1158" /> are more undesirable when we come to consider whether they should be applied to children.  For that reason we should certainly make a distinction between the application of these sections to people of full age, or even to children of an older age, and the kind of ages which are being mentioned in these two amendments.  It seems scarcely credible that these sections would be applied to children under 12 years and it is certainly very undesirable that that should happen.  I would even go further than that and say that they should not apply to children under the age of 15 years.</P>
    <P>A strong case was made by the Minister for having detention for children between the ages of 12 and 15 years, and as far as I was concerned with reluctance I agreed to it, but this is a different kind of situation. Detention will still be possible for children over 12 years of age, and questioning will still be possible but to apply these very sophisticated sections to children between 12 and 15 years is undesirable. For that reason &mdash; I do not propose to go into all the reasons again because they have been very fully developed by the speakers before me &mdash; I would be very surprised if the Minister does not accept amendment No. 17.  I do not think these sections are appropriate to children under the age of 15.  Nothing would be lost by agreeing to the amendments and saying that these sections should not apply to children under that age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator McDonald's concern about the exploitation of children. I have no doubt that if we exclude children from these provisions his fears could in some circumstances be realised. However, I do not think we need despair if we decide to pass the amendment.  I worked for three years in the children's hospital on the Falls Road.  It was not for nothing that a distinction was made between the treatment of children at 14 years of age and the been treatment of adults, and that people who specialised in the care of children had been involved in this work over a considerable period of time. We now have a child psychiatry as well as adult psychiatry unit and quite different <Col N="1159" /> demands are made on them &mdash; the problems are different, the techniques used are different, the approaches are different, the feelings of those involved are different, and the relationships developed are different.  Nevertheless, in the area of psychiatry one gets very close to and in fact crosses over to the area of criminality.  I would like to ask once again a question which has been asked throughout this debate &mdash; I regret for reasons I cannot go into that I have not been able to be there as much as I would like &mdash; that is, whether enough throught has been given to the in-depth training of the Garda and the ban gharda &mdash; in this particular instance, I would emphasise the latter &mdash; to deal with the specific requirements of children caught in these very invidious situations and subject to the pressures which Senator McDonald outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise to the point of being tedious and perhaps boring, what I said before, that, we are urgently in need of some citizens' chatter in this country.  We are urgently in need of a much more imaginative approach to community policing and inter-play between representatives of the police force and representatives of the local community.  We need to look in-depth at police training.  In this context &mdash; and in particular in relation to the Children Bill which will come before the House in due course &mdash; I wonder whether the Minister would consider the very serious implications of this Bill as it has been brought forward for children under the age of 14 in the medical or psychiatric context of making a distinction between the treatment of adults and the treatment of children.  Perhaps it is intended to deal with these very matters in the Children Bill.  If so, I shall be pleased, but if not, I shall be very disappointed to find children subjected to this legislation and not sufficient consideration given to the means by which it is applied, the specialised nature of the type of interrogation to which they should be subjected &mdash; if subjected to it at all &mdash; and perhaps a much broader and deeper challenge to the forces of law and order <Col N="1160" /> to go into the whole area of child criminality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We had a fairly full discussion of the matters covered by these amendments in Committee. Senator Brendan Ryan was then proposing that the four sections should apply to persons under 17 years of age.  As regards sections 15 and 16 which create offences, there would be no precedent for excluding persons of a particular age from their application.  Statutes creating criminal offences are expressed to be of general application, leaving it to the common law governing criminal responsibility to provide for exceptions. Thus, insane persons or children under 7 years of age are not criminally responsible, and between 7 years and 14 years there is a presumption against such responsibility.  The presumption may be rebutted.  It is strongest at ages close to 7 years and becomes progressively weaker as one approaches 14 years.  The treatment of children &mdash; those under 15 years &mdash; is governed by the Children Acts.  Senators will appreciate that for that reason alone I would have difficulty in accepting these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we talking about here?  We are not talking about the Garda asking a simple question &mdash; where did you get that gun, or where did the video come from and so on?  The Garda have that power already.  They can ask anybody, whether a suspect or not, any question when they are investigating an offence.  That right is expressly recognised in Rule 1 of the Judges' Rules.  The sections here take this a stage further in the event of the person refusing to say where he got it.  They authorise the garda to require him formally to say how he came by the gun or the property which is believed to be stolen. When doing so, the garda must explain in ordinary plain language that he may be fined the maximum of £1,000 or sentenced to the maximum of 12 months or both if he fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to say where he got it.  That is what is involved.  The sections are an attempt to get information so that we can get at suppliers of guns and dealers <Col N="1161" /> in stolen property.  I am glad they have been so well supported in the House. They are an innovation and that is why safeguards have been provided and I shall be monitoring their operation carefully to see how they are working in practice because the traffic in guns and stolen property is one of the features of the crime situation which give rise to the greatest concern.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the technical reasons for not accepting the amendments, there is the fact that youngsters under 15 years of age may come across a gun or may have possession of stolen property.  Certainly, I accept it is not so likely as regards guns and in that case there is no particular problem.  It is otherwise, I believe, in the case of stolen property.  Children under that age can be engaged in stealing and unlawful possession.  The sections are aimed at the supplier, not at the person in possession.</P>
    <P>Recently somebody told me they were stopped in traffic and saw a man passing a roll of notes to a child who immediately hid it in her shoe and went off, obviously by prearrangement.  Members in both Houses told me recently of a meeting with city centre traders who explained to them in great detail how children in O'Connell Street are organised to take objects from the stores and to pass them on to adults who are controlling them. These sections are not aimed at the person in possession, whether it is a child or an adult.  They are aimed at the person who is organising the trade in stolen goods.  Senator O'Leary talks about an obligation on the child to take reasonable steps.  The Senator is well aware that the concept of reasonableness is well known to the law and has been interpreted frequently both in civil and criminal cases. What is reasonable for an adult might not &mdash; and probably would not &mdash; be reasonable for a child.  If a child took no steps at all, it could be regarded as quite reasonable for him not to have done so in view of his age and mental capacity.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the application of certain provisions, and in particular those we are now discussing, to young persons, but much of it is unreal. <Col N="1162" /> I do not see any difficulty at all in the application of the inferences section to under 15s or, indeed, to under 12s.  It is a matter for the court or the jury acting upon the directions of the trial judge, not for the garda.  These sections are not at the discretion of the garda; the court will drawn an inference where the judge believes it is proper.  If the judge believes it is proper, he will draw the inference or if he is sitting with a jury, he will direct the jury that it is proper to draw an inference so the rights of young and old are protected by the court and it is the court who will decide in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason whatsoever for the exclusion of the under 12s.  I simply cannot imagine a garda reciting to a child the complicated formula in sections 15 or 16 before formally requiring him to give information about the property and then explaining in ordinary language what the effect of failure or refusal might be.  What would he do?  Would he summon the child to appear before the Children's Court for an under 12?  I would be very surprised if a district justice had nothing to say about a garda who went through this formula with an under 12.  I would say that his prospects would not have been improved &mdash; to say the least &mdash; in court.  For these reasons I am not accepting the amendment, but I say to the House, not on the basis of rhetoric but on the basis of concerned advice, that what we did on section 4 was to exclude people under 12 years of age but that made no change in the age of criminal responsibility because the existing powers of arrest without warrant would still apply to the existing age of criminal responsibility.  In the particular peculiar circumstance of the 11 or 12 year old, a garda has the power to arrest without warrant, take the child to the Garda station and send for the parents. We excluded the power to detain them when they were taken there: no change in the age of criminal responsibilty.</P>
    <P>What is being advocated here is that we change the age of criminal responsibility because there are two new offences being created in the first two sections.  We are saying now that people under 12 should be excluded from those two new <Col N="1163" /> offences.  That is a change in the age of criminal responsibility and I respectfully suggest to the Seanad that in advocating that change you are pre-empting the Minister for Health and the Government in coming in with the general change in the age of criminal responsibility which they intend to do in the very near future. I do not know what age the Minister will recommend to the Government, but if this amendment is pressed, then you will have a situation where the Seanad has decided after consideration that in certain offences the age of 12 will be the age of criminal responsibility.  I suggest to Senators who are concerned about the age of criminal responsibility &mdash; and certainly I am &mdash; that you will have cut off a very large portion of the discussion and I would be very surprised if you get a higher age than 12 subsequently.  You may get a lower age, but you are going down the road where you are almost making it certain that it will be 12 years of age.  It is different from section 4; section 4 made no change in the age of criminal responsibility but because there are two new offences involved here, you are changing the age of criminal responsibility in respect of those offences.  It is pre-emptive to do that when the Government have stated that it is their clear intention to change the age of criminal responsibility; it is pre-emptive on the Minister for Health who clearly is committed to changing the age of criminal responsibility.  However, I am not standing on the privileges of Government or Ministers; I am saying you will also preempt the discussion and bring about a situation where I would be very surprised if an age other than 12 is seriously discussed if you make this change here which is, in effect, a change in the age of criminal responsibility.  I ask the Senators not to press it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a bit disappointed &mdash; this will not surprise him &mdash; at some aspects of the Minister's reply.  Stories about young people committing crimes, <Col N="1164" /> especially those involving organised robbery, particularly where there is no violence involved, should be used with great care because when a youngster is involved in organised crime of a kind which does not involve violence, in other words, which involves robbery and things like that, the most wounded victim of that crime is the child who commits the crime. I would see it differently where there is assault, violence or any sort of upset to people, but where a child is involved in a crime which does not involve violence and particularly in the sort of case the Minister talked about &mdash; the first about the organised children in gangs in O'Connell Street and the second about the child with the roll of notes in her shoe &mdash; the most tragic victim of those crimes in each case must be the children.  I am glad the Minister is nodding agreement, but that is not the way the Minister presented those two examples in his reply on this section and I regret that profoundly.</P>
      <P>I came into this House with a commitment to social reform which is shared, incidentally, by the vast majority of Members of the Oireachtas, I do not claim for one second to differ in kind from any other Member; I have a particularly indulgent constituency among other things and, therefore, I can devote far more of my time to issues that other people would be concerned about but who have less time to devote themselves to.  Perhaps because of that I am less impressed by arguments about precedent and about what happened in the past than I would otherwise be because I am not really concerned about precedent.  I am concerned about new things, about change and about innovation and improvement.  We cannot allow change, innovation and improvement to await some promised future date, whether it be in a Children Bill or in other legislation. The time for change is now.  If change is needed, it is needed now, not in the future.  That is the context in which I proposed what I believed to be a reasonable amendment, a small part of the necessary wideranging review and revision and change in the whole area of juvenile legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> One of the arguments, I advocate for this amendment, the minimal age of 12 &mdash; Senators Higgins said it on another occasion &mdash; is that it will hasten the production of a Bill on juvenile justice.  It is not entirely appropriate, but it is worth reiterating that the section in the national plan on juvenile justice is vague in the extreme, contains absolutely no specifics and suggests that it is a long, long way from us.  Our children have suffered enough from the most antiquated children's legislation in Western Europe. The time to start reforming it is now, this instant on this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of a very able and very reasonable &mdash; from his point of view &mdash; argument defended his point of view very vigorously but did not resort to anything other than reasonable argument 90 per cent of the time and if I could claim that I would be quite happy. From that perspective, nevertheless he has conceded that the Bill is innovative, that it involves a large number of new ideas and concepts; the Garda will have new powers; they will not be familiar with historical precedents but they will not be given any training about how to operate these powers, other than by intent.  There will be no practical experience.</P>
    <P>Therefore, each of these powers must be examined for all its possible implications and not just because of our concern about the scale and intensity of crime in Irish society.  That is why, even though there is some basis for the concern that children could be used, it depends on one's perspective how one would work from there.  I do not want to suggest that I have a more noble perspective about children than the Minister &mdash; none of us who have children would ever try to suggest that others with children do not share our concern &mdash; but this is fundamentally a matter for political judgment and priority about how and when you start and not about who is most concerned about children.</P>
    <P>From that perspective we are giving new powers of inference, asking people to do things that they never did before. Even if the exclusion of children under <Col N="1166" /> 12 is no more than purely symbolic &mdash; the Minister has indicated that a garda would be very foolish to use these powers in cases of children under 12 &mdash; it would be worth doing because it would be a move away from the dreadful 1908 Children Act which had the dreadful suggestion that children over seven could be somehow criminally responsible.</P>
    <P>I repeat what has been said to me over and over again by people working with children.  They are not some sort of dogooder liberals living in suburbia, far away from the problem associated with inner city crime.  The organisation that has impressed me most in its concern about the implications for children of some of these sections is the organisation called Hope who provide accommodation for homeless children and who themselves are often the victims of the criminal activities of some of those children. They are victims of juvenile crime but they choose to respond to it in a fundamentally different way.</P>
    <P>Effectively, that is the argument inherent in my amendment proposing to exclude children under 12 years.  The argument is that from the first contact with the law children under 12 years should be dealt with in a different way, in different premises, by specially trained people, in different courts with different procedures when they are found guilty.</P>
    <P>This is a new piece of legislation with provisions that did not exist before and it is therefore singularly appropriate that if we are to talk about dealing with children differently we should make sure that extra new provisions in the criminal law should not apply to them.  There has been a suggestion that we are creating a precedent. I did not pick 12 years, the Minister did in section 4.  I believe, and I have often said it, that the age of criminal responsibility should be 17 years because I think that below that age we should treat children differently.  Below that age we treat children as children in virtually every other area except in that of crime. Quite clearly the age of criminal responsibility should be 17.  That is not the same as saying that children under 17 years should escape scot-free if they are involved <Col N="1167" /> in offences that hurt other people. The question is how we deal with them under the law if they are below the age of criminal responsibility.  It is what you do with them, what you do for them and the alternatives you offer to them.</P>
    <P>As I have said often during this debate, it is a great pity that the problem of drugs very often comes up as an example of where children need to be brought into contact with the law.  The Minister did not say it but others have spoken about drugs in the course of this debate &mdash; drugs and children.  It would be much more credible if there was somewhere in which children under the age of 16 years who are addicted to heroin could be treated. There is no residential treatment facility available for heroin addicts under the age of 16 years.  If that alternative were available there would be some logic to the argument.  So long as we do not offer them treatment there is hyprocisy in talking about concern for them if they are addicted to heroin.</P>
    <P>It is not so much a matter of a huge impact by huge numbers of gardaí on huge numbers of children.  The issue here is where do you start the process of reforming children's legislation.  The provisions of this Bill are new.  They have never applied to children before because such provisions did not exist.  It is therefore singularly appropriate that, as a first step on the road to reform of children's legislation, these new provisions should not apply.</P>

      <P>My question arises only in regard to the amendments.  Senator Brendan Ryan correctly replied to amendments Nos. 17 and 18 in so far as they had been grouped for discussion but, in the course of the final speech on those, the issue of the age of responsibility was raised as to whether it would be established at the age of 12.  The amendment in the name of Senator Robinson and myself mentions the age of 15.  In view of that I believe the amendments should be voted on separately.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should explain.  Senator Higgins has no right of reply to the discussion on amendment 17.  Where two amendments are taken together the right of reply rests only with the mover of the first amendment. Amendment 18 was taken with 17 for the purposes of discussion only and a separate decision can be taken on 18 if necessary.</P>

      <P>Could I bring to the attention of the House that there are two matters on Report Stage which the Minister indicated he would look at, but which have not been dealt with by way of amendment?  Would the Minister let us know what is the result of his consideration? One item was section 4, which Senator Durcan mentioned, the introduction of &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; in the context of the arrival of the person at the Garda station and the reasonable suspicions &mdash; or whatever the appropriate expressions were.  The second matter concerned the extension of the powers of the District Court in general to sentence people to two years' imprisonment consecutively in respect of two offences, and <Col N="1172" /> the effect that this might have on reducing the incentive for people charged with these offences not to commit further offences while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The first matter raised by Senator Durcan I have had looked at.  I thought that putting in the phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; would create a loophole in that respect.  My intentions is that there would not be any undue delay of any sort when somebody is brought to a Garda station and when the member in charge is evaluating whether he would be detained or not.  I would expect the member in charge to do it as soon as he possibly can do it.  That is why it is phrased as &ldquo;on arrival at the Garda station&rdquo;.  So there is no suggestion of an interval of time elapsing before the member in charge makes that decision. Of course, in the <i>de facto</i> situation he will have to speak with the arresting garda and he will have to make an evaluation, but to put in a phrase such as the Senator suggested would imply that there was an undefined interval of time which could elapse before the member in charge would make his decision.  I do not think it is a good idea for that reason.</P>
      <P>On the question of the two years' imprisonment by the District Court, Senator O'Leary made the point on Committee Stage that increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court to two years for consecutive sentences generally would have the effect of diminishing the impact of the consecutive sentences on offences committed while on bail.  He argued that a criminal who is charged with two offences, say stealing apples, would be liable to be given two consecutive sentences of 12 months each and if this were to become the norm that it would remove the incentive for habitual petty criminals to avoid committing offences while on bail.  He suggested that the existing limit of 12 months should be retained except for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the bail cases, it is a matter for the district justices concerned to decide if consecutive sentences would be <Col N="1173" /> appropriate where the accused is convicted of a number of offences.  Consecutive sentences will be mandatory under section 11 for offences committed while on bail, but in the case of other offences a district justice has discretion whether or not to impose consecutive sentences. Section 12 (1) is an enabling provision that provides that where he wishes to impose consecutive sentences he may do so for any term up to the limit of two years.  It does not follow that there will be an increase in the rate of consecutive sentencing by district justices as a result of this section or that they will become so commonplace that, as envisaged by the Senator, they will have the adverse effect on the consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>If section 12 (1) were to be limited to offences committed while on bail, it would be rendered superfluous since it would then be providing for the situation already covered in section 11.  Furthermore, it would give rise to an anomaly in that mandatory consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail, section 11, and offences committed while serving a sentence, section 12 (2), would be subject to a maximum of two years.  All consecutive sentences for other offences would be subject to a maximum of 12 months.  This would introduce an undesirable disparity and added complexity into the District Court jurisdiction.  To apply the above to the offences, say, of stealing apples, it would be strange if the district justice were to decide to invoke his discretion to make the sentences consecutive. He would not do this at present in such a case and the extension to two years of the discretionary limit for consecutive offences would be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>There could be persons accused of two or more offences not committed on bail which were of such a serious nature that the justice would think it right that the sentences for them should be consecutive rather than concurrent and should add up, say, to 18 months or indeed to the two years limit.  It is that type of case that section 12 (1) was introduced to meet. <Col N="1174" /> That is the evaluation we did of the points raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things I wish to say.  Firstly, there was a great need for the Bill.  People felt strongly about it, judging by the number of contributions we have had in the other House and in this House.  Public opinion has been crying out for such legislation for some time.  Indeed, in the recent election it was evident from surveys that were carried out that crime was one of the biggest issues on people's minds.  It happens in my own county of Donegal that the rate of indictable crime is lower than anywhere in the country.  Indeed, in Donegal the rate at 10.5 per 1,000 population is one-third of the average of the total country at 29.8, indeed, one-sixth of that of Dublin at 59.5.  I do not <Col N="1175" /> say that with any degree of extra consideration for Donegal.  What I am saying is that even in Donegal, despite the crime rate being as low as those records show, there is anxiety about an increase in crime, in vandalism and in thuggery in our county.</P>
      <P>The second reason why this change of law was necessary was coming from the Garda themselves.  Crime was on the increase and the Garda were implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, being blamed for that.  They felt hampered and restricted by the law as it was in existence and the way they were expected to enforce the law.  The Government and the Minister for Justice had to do something.  The Government and the Minister for Justice have done something.</P>
      <P>The present Minister is not the first to promise legislation in recent years but he is the first to deliver.  It is greatly to his credit that he does not go about claiming to have all the answers.  Indeed, when the Minister saw fit he amended legislation as it went through the other House.  He has listened effectively and attentively to all that has been said about the Bill and he has not been slow to introduce the changes, even substantial changes, suggested by critics of the Bill.  He did this on the Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil and he has indicated a willingness to introduce, and he has introduced, other amendments.  It is good to feel that in this case at least what we say and what has been said in the other House did not go unheeded.</P>
      <P>Some sections of the Bill have been controversial, but the major part has been uncontroversial and has had the support of the majority in this House. People from different sides of the Houses have lined up in support of the Bill but a minority, a very responsible, industrious and very articulate minority, opposed some sections.  Many of the critics of the Bill had a degree of unreality about them. Despite their protestations, they come across as being more concerned about protecting criminals than about protecting the victims and the potential victims of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being taken up wrongly and I regret that.  I know it is out of concern that Senator Ryan, Senator Higgins and Senator O'Leary have opposed sections of this Bill.  What I am trying to do is to put on record that despite their best efforts, and despite the fact that their intentions were completely honourable, there will be people who will think less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> There is something worrying about the self-confidence, self-assurance and sense of right of the huge majority in the Oireachtas who support what are, everybody agrees, drastic changes in the law, changes which in some cases overturn basic legal principles.  We, the legislators, can get carried away with the assumptions we make about how well we represent the people.</P>
    <P>On this issue of law and order there are two perspectives of what the State is doing and what the State should do about crime.  The first view is that of those whose only contact with the Garda has been when they are reporting something or looking for help but there is a substantial number of people, and I am not talking about criminals, who for a variety of reasons, including personal experiences, do not see the State forces of law and order as being on their side or as being helpful to them.  We may feel that this view is unjustified or wrong-headed, but we cannot ignore the fact that this view does exist.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the youthfulness of the population and that half the population is under the age of 25 years.  I would like to mention another figure.  If we exclude children up to school-leaving age, approximately one-third of the population are between the ages of 15 years and 30 years.  It is important that the settled people who are rearing families and have a stake in the community should have confidence in the forces of law and order.  I want to talk about confidence in the forces of law and order.  These are the people who talk to TDs and Senators, these are the people whose views we try to reflect but it is important that the younger people should have confidence in the forces of law and order.  We should be careful that what we are doing and what has been done in this Bill is seen to be helpful from that point of view.</P>
    <P>To develop this point further, I must talk about the effectiveness of the Garda. We are all against crime.  We are all in favour of law and order.  We are dependent on the Garda to fight crime and to keep peace.  We must ask ourselves how <Col N="1178" /> the Garda can be more effective and point out that this legislation is only one aspect of that effectiveness.  The first thing we must look at is the make up of each individual garda, his commitment to law and order and we must ensure that his real reasons for going into the job are honourable.  He must feel he has a vocation to help his fellow man.  We should ask ourselves what we are doing in this law, or in other similar legislation. We are giving powers to the Garda to protect the vast majority of the citizens of the State from the minority of citizens of the State.  We are asking the Garda to protect us from ourselves.  It is therefore imperative that the Garda be of the highest quality, of the highest standard and when the Minister and the Department are recruiting for the Garda Síochána they must ensure that the motivation of those young gardaí is of the highest order.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of training of gardaí I feel ought to be corrected.  I believe that the training college should not be outside this city because the vast majority of crimes are carried out here, in this city, simply because a big percentage of the population reside in or around Dublin city.  In my view, it was a retrograde step to move the Garda training college from Dublin to Templemore.</P>

We have spent a lot of time in both Houses talking about the standing of the Garda in society.  I believe that while the critics of the Bill were well intentioned and honourable &mdash; I want to put that on record &mdash; while they were putting their criticisms on record they may have been undermining our Garda.

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Loughrey said that the genuine contributions of people made on the Bill undermine the Garda.  That is exactly what Senator Loughrey said and I object <Col N="1180" /> to that because I know that in contributions from all sides of the House they were at pains not to undermine the Garda.  Even at this 11th hour of the Bill to infer that is most unfair and I would ask Senator Loughrey to read the full record of what has been said on the Bill in this House.  I think he will be impressed with the legitimate concern of people who opposed sections and put down amendments.  They did not do it to undermine the Garda or to cast aspersions on anybody.  They tried to have the best possible legislation passed in this House and that is the function of Senators.</P>

One of the most important things that must happen and should happen as a result of this Bill being passed is that there must be co-operation between the general public and the Garda.  If I say that the Garda must earn it I mean that they must earn it.  The Garda force have done this country a great service and some have paid the highest price for that service.  That must continue.  I can recall as a young man growing up, although I would not say I was terrified of a garda, I certainly walked on the other side of the road, as I did when I met the priest or the schoolteacher.  That has been slowing down for some time.</P>

      <P>I have only been suspended once and I know you suffered it more than I did.  I will devote myself to the contents of this Bill.  I have no fundamental opposition to the Garda Síochána and I will not even discuss any implied suggestion that I have.  I have often recorded the fact that sections of the Garda Síochána are better at doing caring jobs than many professionals are. I have ample evidence of that.  Nevertheless, the Garda Síochána do have a perspective on things in the same way that every profession has a perspective.  I would not like teaching to be run by teachers, engineering to be run by engineers, medicine to be run by doctors or the law to be run by solicitors, because I think the capacity for detached analysis is lacking in such circumstances.  I do not think law and order should be run by professional enforcers of the law.  That is where parliament and the community at large should be supreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this Bill represents as it stands and even as amended is the perception of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice about how to deal with law.  It is regrettable that it is difficult to argue with the perception particularly of the Garda Síochána about what is lawful and what is proper and what is necessary without immediately being shifted into the camp of at least being hostile to the Garda Síochána, if not positively subversive. It is quite conceivable that the Garda Síochána are fundamentally and utterly wrong about what is needed to deal with the problem of crime.  In terms of changes in the law, in terms of technical resources, in terms of professional expertise and in terms of their own training, they are fundamentally experts.  In terms of the analysis that what causes crime, in terms of the analysis of <Col N="1182" /> what perpetuates crime and in terms of the analysis of how to respond to it, it is quite conceivable that a professional Garda force, because of their own inevitable perception, could be fundamentally and inexorably wrong.  This Bill is what the Garda Síochána believe is a solution to the crime problem and I believe they are fundamentally wrong about the solution to the crime problem.</P>
    <P>Central to the problem is an astonishingly sweeping power of detention and although there have been amendments, many of them welcome, and the Minister has responded well in many areas to amendments to this Bill at the centre is the power of any garda to arrest a citizen and take him to a Garda station with a view to detaining him for questioning. Every single member of the Garda Síochána with, whatever it is, ten or 12 weeks' training &mdash; which many Members and even the Minister by implication accepts to be inadequate &mdash; can assess whether somebody has committed an offence or whether they have reasonable cause as somebody committing an offence and can take that person to a Garda station with a view to having that person detained for questioning.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured &mdash; and many of us have &mdash; to tease out what reasonable cause means and to tease it out in a way which takes it out of the realm of <i>post hoc</i> judgments by the courts and put it into the realm of where the Minister has suggested it is which is a matter of objective judgment or some such term.  I am not quite sure but he did use the word &ldquo;objective&rdquo;.  The tragedy for me is that the &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; term and the other related terms contained in this Bill are singularly lacking in any element of objective judgment and that is going to be the core of the problem with the implementation and the operation of this Bill. Linked to the question of reasonable cause is the whole role and nature of Garda questioning.</P>
    <P>Never in the whole of this Bill have we had a satisfactory explanation as to why a third party should not be entitled to be present and there are profound social implications involved in question of a <Col N="1183" /> third party being involved because those who could afford to pay for it would have them but I do not believe that is the reason why we do not have a third party. It will raise a cloud of suspicion about what precisely it is intended to do under questioning if it cannot be done in the presence of a silent but independent third party.  It will raise fundamental questions about what is behind it, perhaps not so much for those of us here who have the benefit of being able to view the State and the enforcers of law and order from a fairly reasonable and moderate point of view but there are many in our society who do not share that perspective.  Many in that society are, in terms of their perspective, their perception and their aspirations, inadequately represented in this House.</P>
    <P>I will put on record what I believe will be the direct result of what is in this Bill. Within a short period we will have a clamour to extend the power to arrest without warrant because we will be told that certain serious offences cannot be investigated because either the Garda do not have the power to arrest without warrant and therefore are not covered by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, or the penalties must be increased.  Let nobody assure me to the contrary because I already know of a child of 16 who was a passenger, knowingly, in a stolen car and who is already subject to the provisions of this Bill because we decided to extend the penalty for car theft from six months to five years.  It is now a far more serious crime in the eyes of the law to steal a car than to drive a car while under the influence of alcohol, a quite astonishing disorder of priorities in my view; a quite astonishing response to an immediate problem through a change in the law which will prove disastrous in the long term.</P>
    <P>I think that is where we are going to move: pressure for further powers of arrest, pressure for larger sentences in areas where perhaps the power to arrest without warrant already exists.  I await, fairly quickly, in the next couple of years <Col N="1184" /> the next campaign from the forces of law and order to extend other areas so that further things will be contained in a Bill.</P>
    <P>I return, with no apology, to our children and the implications for them in this Bill.  What I have said all through this is apart from my concern that this Bill may and perhaps will be abused by some members of the Garda Síochána and particularly the capacity for abuse when people are not charged and when there is not a court case.  I repeat what I have said over and over again: nothing in this Bill can give assurance to people who are not charged because they will have to go either to a tribunal or to the courts to obtain justice.  Many of the people who will be the victims of this Bill will not have the will or sometimes the capacity and in most cases the resources to do that, particularly financial resources.</P>
    <P>That is why I talked so much about our children.  I think there is a perception of wild young children running around this country who need to be brought under control and which is implicit in a number of the things that I have said about the need to incarcerate children between 12 and 17 in section 4 of the Bill and children between 7 and 17 in the remaining provisions of the Bill.  It is regrettable that this legislation will produce profound alienation in children.  I say this without considering the possibility that the powers will be abused but simply because a perception of the Garda's relationship with children will develop or will be extended beyond that which already exists, and the argument that because there is already some provision under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act that somehow ameliorates the significance of the Criminal Justice Bill escapes me entirely.</P>
    <P>It is a reality and one that we have not addressed in this House at all in any significant way that there are increasing and large sections of urban Ireland where the Garda are not seen as part of the community: they are not seen as allies but are seen to some extent as oppressors. The present Garda Commissioner adverted to that in a very incisive and perceptive speech some years ago.  I think <Col N="1185" /> he and I would probably take a very different view as to why that is the case, but we agreed and we still agree on that.</P>
    <P>The public will see this Bill as a blunt instrument in its first application because whatever the merits of the checks contained within the Bill what the public will experience is arrest and being taken for detention.  While thee are no new powers of arrest contained in this Bill there is a certain technical distinction. There are no new powers of arrest but it appears to me that the powers of arrest without warrant are considerably extended.  Currently the powers of arrest would be when a garda could reasonably hope to bring charges against somebody. We have now diluted the definition so that a reasonable suspicion is sufficient, whether charges may or may not result. The ultimate result will be that while there will be far more arrests without warrant and not just in a successful attempt to deal with crime and to bring criminals to justice but because something else can be done, the intermediate step between arrest and charging.  What would concern me, and has concerned me since this Bill was first published, is the evidence that those powers, as with all Garda powers, as with all the powers given to all the forces of the State, will be used in a particularly oppressive way against the poor and the marginalised in society.</P>
    <P>You cannot have it both ways.  Either crime is related to poverty conclusively and we accept that, or else it is not.  A large body of society says that crime is not related to poverty.  Then the question that must be asked is why are our prison population predominantly poor; why then are they predominantly unemployed, illiterate, many of them innumerate and from broken families?  If poverty does not cause crime it must be because the law bears unevenly on the poor.  If poverty is not a cause of crime, then there should not be more poor people in prison than anybody else.  If there are proportionately far more, then it is either because poverty causes crime in which case they are effectively not guilty <Col N="1186" /> because we have created the poverty, or it is because the law bears unevenly on the poor.  You can have your choice. I happen to believe the former because it is more acceptable than to say that the law bears unevenly on the poor. There is some evidence for the former.  The alternative is available, that it is because the law bears unevenly on the poor and because the crimes of the well off very often do not result in their being detained in prison.</P>
    <P>I think the possibility of how this Bill will operate has created widespread suspicion.  It is regrettable that we have not listened to the extraordinary range of objections not, I emphasise, from dogooder liberals but from organisations and people who are firmly implanted in those areas where crime is highest.  It is not the priests from Foxrock and from similar wealthy parishes who are leading the church campaign against this Bill, and it never has been: it is the priests from the inner city who have lived with the crime problem, who have experienced the sort of things that we have had described to us &mdash; they are the people who have led this campaign; it is the voluntary organisations who deal with the consequences of our criminal procedures, the consequences of the appalling way we have treated young juveniles in the past in places like Letterfrack and Daingean.</P>
    <P>They are the people who have spoken most loudly and they are the people who suffer from our crime rate.  They are people who suffer because they experience the escalation of violence.  They have experienced the escalation of other forms of crime.  They are not talking from the slightly protected environment that most of us live in.  They are talking from the reality of being in the front line of experiencing the problems of crime that we are talking about.  Therefore, they are in some ways more expert and more knowledgeable than we.</P>
    <P>Because of this Bill and the way it introduces the power to detain for questioning &mdash; and I make a confession here that will shock many of my allies in the campaign against the Criminal Justice Bill &mdash; I can envisage the possibility of <Col N="1187" /> detention for questioning in certain serious crimes.  It has been said by members of the Garda that in the case of rape, for instance, it is very difficult to investigate an allegation of rape if you cannot detain a suspect and do various tests.  That seems to me to have some validity, but if the intent was to deal with the specific example that has been used to justify this power of detention then this power of detention should refer specifically only to those examples.  It covers an enormous range of crimes.  The conscious or unconscious intent behind it is manifestly demonstrated by the decision to include car theft among the crimes for which people can be detained.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as it is constituted, all the amendments notwithstanding, all the effort that has gone into it from various people notwithstanding, represents a useful compromise between all the groups who basically agree that this Bill is necessary and have simply got a useful and worth-while discussion going about how to make it safer.  It shows nothing of the input of the admitted minority in this House &mdash; Senator Loughrey was right &mdash; and probably in the country who do not agree with the basic provisions of it.  I am not saying that because we disagree the basic provisions should have been changed but the proposals, amendments and suggestions that came from that section of society which does not agree with the principle of this Bill represented a genuine attempt to incorporate about the legislation our concerns about the Bill and attempts to alleviate them.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; over and over again. The fact that this Bill has no definition of &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; is a matter of great concern to me.  I am concerned that it will apply in a particular way to minority groups.  I have raised the issue of prejudice among the Garda which is as true there as it is in Irish society.  I have produced a specific example which shows that the travellers of south Dublin are already, obviously, under reasonable suspicion by a senior officer of the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the amendments <Col N="1188" /> that have been accepted, while they will make those who are unhappy about the operation but in favour in principle, a lot happier, many of us who have fundamental objections to the Bill put forward amendments and tried both in this House and in the other House constructively to incorporate them into legislation that we found objectionable and, as I said before, that I find loathsome because of what it says about Irish society.  I regret that those efforts did not meet with a greater response.  I have said repeatedly that this Bill will increase the boundaries of marginalisation, it will increase the boundaries of alienation and it will produce a larger alienated and it will produce a larger more than any intellectual concern of mine, and more than any liberal instinct of mine, or any socialist instinct of mine, is what is at the centre of my objection to the contents of this Bill.  I do not think in the way it has been handled in the Oireachtas, in the way that amendments have been concerned, that the problem of alienation from the State and from the agents law and order that will spring from this Bill has been accepted because I do not believe that the Minister, or the vast majority of the Members of this House or the other House, believe that it is going to happen.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that on the evidence, and the record of what has happened in other countries with the police, it is going to happen here.  It is regrettable that we have had the opportunity through this Bill and through the debate on it to try to meet that problem and fear which are consequences of urbanisation followed by mass unemployment on the scale we have.  We did not meet them and this Bill will be a recipe not for a reduction in the crime rate but for an increase in crime of a different kind, crimes of alienation and various other crimes.  It will not produce the improvement that people have suggested. Other countries have had powers like this for years and they also have serious crime rates well in excess of ours but not very high rates of solving them. The power of detention will not change anything because it did not change anything anywhere else.  In the fragile nature <Col N="1189" /> of our society, with the population structure and the age structure we have it will increase and extend alienation.</P>
    <P>The final, and most frightening fear I have &mdash; I do not say this to be sensational but because it represents what is a proper understanding of Irish society &mdash; is that if there is profound alienation of Irish society and if it is extended and directed in a particular way against the Garda as a result of this Bill, is that there is a political organisation in this country perfectly willing and able for its own ends to exploit that and to offer an alternative way to people to respond and to deal with their alienation.  We have a regrettable tradition of violence in this country and this Bill in the way it will create further divisions will offer opportunities there. We should have been drawing people together.  We should have been drawing communities together.</P>
    <P>This Bill, unfortunately, will do the opposite.  It looks to me that we now have to take our opposition outside this House and into other areas.  I hope that when and if we set up organisations to monitor the operation of this Bill that we will not be branded subversives in the way that those who have attempted to monitor the operations of the Offences Against the State Act have been branded.  It is our democratic right to continue to oppose something, even if the Oireachtas passes it.  If the Oireachtas passes this Bill I am bound in law to obey it but I am not bound to agree with it.  I am entitled to continue to object to it and to make every possible effort to have it repealed, amended and sections of it withdrawn. That I intend to do continuously and, hopefully, in four years time when the review comes with a bit of luck I will still be here and continuing my objections.  It represents the wrong direction for Irish society.  Instead of bringing people together it will create divisions and it will create and exacerbate the division particularly between the rich and the poor and the division between large sections of poor urban communities and the Garda who should be on their side.  After all, the citizens of poor urban communities <Col N="1190" /> are very often the major victims of crime.  Instead of protecting them this Bill will further exacerbate their problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reflect strictly within the terms of a Final Stage consideration on this Bill.  In doing so I should like to say that the concern of people like myself for the impact of this Bill have been about the Bill as an instrument in dealing with the crime problem. I recognise that fear of crime is widespread in the community.  In my Second Stage speech I made the point that I am aware that working class victims of crime suffer more than middle class victims of crime.  This is strictly sticking with the Bill.  The departure point of my own critique of this legislation was that I felt it was based on a misconception of the nature of the crime problem. This misconception of the nature of the crime problem stemmed at its root from the forms of analysis of the crime problem.  That is all over.  I respect the right of people to differ in their approach towards crime.  There are differences that it is far more honourable to emphasise rather than to disguise.  One approach in understanding the crime problem of modern European states is to suggest that there has been a breakdown of individual moral control and appeal back to individualism and soon.  My view of crime, which is based as much on political motivation as it is on the basis of studies, is that this is a misconception, that crime cannot be understood except in its wider social setting.  I have to look at the Bill in terms of its impact on a total social setting and, within the social system involved, on its particular application to those who will be affected by its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very dishonest in relation to this House if I were to suggest that all my experience is such that in pursuing the roots of crime the structure of our enforcement process, the structure of our vigilance is directed disproportionately towards some sections rather than others. This, in turn, involves certain conceptions not only about the nature of crime but where it is located.  I do not intend to wander off my Fifth Stage speech by <Col N="1191" /> giving a long dissertation on all of the forms of anti-social behaviour which are not regarded for sanctioning purposes within society at present.  On Report Stage we were discussing different forms of gains from indirect proceeds from a crime which arises under the Bill and I made the remark that the Revenue Commissioners should be given the powers we were talking about, but of course the withholding from the State of resources that should rightfully belong to the State is not regarded frequently with the opprobrium with which it should be regarded. I am not going to individualise the argument in such a way as it would be set out in a textbook, comparing the position of somebody charged with shoplifting and who has spent some time in Mountjoy with that of someone who was involved in an elaborate fraud.  Neither am I getting involved in what I might say is the casuistry of a very distinguished Member of the other House who draws the distinction between mortal and venial sins in this regard.</P>
    <P>To summarise this basic argument, I frankly think that white collar crime is something which does not appear in the statistics, against which adequate sanctions are not addressed and which does not properly incur the opprobrium of the population.  In fact our lack of moral evolution &mdash; if I might fall back on a category of explanation not usually associated with me &mdash; to my mind is that the crass individualism and the forms of property-based society we have serve as an obstacle to enabling us to go to the point where we would see in such anti-social behaviour the criminal activity that it is.  If that be the departure point, I want to say that my criticisms of the Bill then were heavily influenced from a socio-economic perspective and as it will be experienced by those who will be the people at the other end of its provisions.</P>
    <P>I said I was influenced in a secondary way by a civil libertarian argument.  The civil libertarian argument as it approaches the specific measures of this Bill will be in terms of how the rules have changed.  It would always be insufficient <Col N="1192" /> in my view because it would assume that the perceptions of the rules being changed was equal throughout the entire society. something that all of the evidence suggests to us is manifestly not true.  Therefore, the protection which the civil libertarian will offer to the person who is the victim of new measures improperly applied is never adequate.  But of course what we are concerned with as legislators is the protection of the groups to whom the Bill will be directed, if properly applied, in its terms as discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point I want to clarify and I want to clarify it very explicitly.  Those who have opposed this Bill &mdash; they have been many different group &mdash; have had their own diverse motivations.  I certainly want to dissociate my own critique, developed not only in this House but outside, from anybody or any organisation who have chosen to pursue their campaign against the Bill in terms of questioning the personal motivation of the Minister given responsibility and so forth.  I want very explicitly to place that on the record and to say that I have, in the whole nature of my political practice, never been but appalled by the prosecution of personalist arguments as a substitute for genuine political argument.</P>
    <P>That having been said, equally, I think it was very unfair throughout the debate to suggest that those of us who are critics might find our remarks being construed as an attack on the Garda or as concern for the welfare of criminals and a lack of concern for the victims of crime.  I know exactly the structure of the arguments that suggest this.  &ldquo;While I am not saying this is true, nevertheless it may arise as a construction&rdquo;, as one might say with a little help from our friends who would be willing to accept the absolute sincerity of our motivations.  I am glad that the record has been cleared because people who have spoken against the Bill were concerned &mdash; for example, Senator O'Leary &mdash; about it as a piece of legislation and the changes it would make in the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I must say that question deserves mention on the final stages of this Bill.  In <Col N="1193" /> relation to the Joint Programme for Government, agreed between the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party in December 1982, it is very important to note on page 23 of that document &mdash; which is available in the Library &mdash; one of the paragraphs which states:</P>
    <P>A judicial inquiry will be established into allegations of political interference with the gardaí, with terms of reference governing the past three years and a remit to recommend any necessary action to ensure that such interference cannot take place in the future.  In any event a Garda authority will be established whose functions will include recruitment and promotion of gardaí.  An effective independent complaints procedure will also be established to safeguard both the public and the gardaí, who are often subject to false allegations.  Linked to these reforms legislation will be introduced immediately to strengthen the criminal law.  There will also be legislation to introduce community service orders for minor offences and steps will be taken to increase the number of Garda man hours available to prevent and detect crime.</P>
    <P>My construction of that paragraph as a statement of intent is that reform of the criminal law will be carried out and I refer again to the words, &ldquo;legislation will be introduced immediately to strengthen the criminal law...&rdquo;  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Minister very sincerely believes that this Bill &mdash; which will be passed by the Oireachtas no doubt &mdash; does indeed strengthen the criminal law. I would argue that one could construe from these paragraphs &mdash; in so far as there is not an explicit reference to, for example, the introduction of powers of detention for the particular purposes as they arise in this Bill &mdash; that no such wide sweeping powers were envisaged.  For example, I do not see in that, or in the manifestos of my own party or of the Minister's party, any reflections back to the justification for the prototype model of legislation like this &mdash; if I might refer to it like that &mdash; namely, the Bill introduced <Col N="1194" /> in 1967.  For that reason one could reasonably assume that such reforms in the criminal law, as were envisaged in the joint programme, could be ones which might perhaps begin, as the Bill indicates in certain places, with reforms in trial procedures and so forth.</P>
    <P>To make a long matter more brief the focus of opposition to the Bill has undoubtedly centered around section 4.  In its passage through the Dáil and through this House a number of changes have been made.  Again, I would like to place on the record that it is the mark of a Minister concerned for legislation that the or she is amenable to suggestions that have been made by way of Committee.  I acknowledge the amendments made in the Dáil and the amendments which have been made in this House, some of which are worthy of mention.  Certainly the insertion of a duration clause made in the other House was very important even though there are very powerful differences in this House.  I worry about the principle of continuous review which was not accepted and, equally, there is a fundamental difference of opinion between myself and the Minister and the supporters of this Bill in relation to the period of four years which is suggested.</P>
    <P>Another amendment which is very important is in relation to the integration of the complaints procedures and the regulations in the main body of the legislation itself.  Here there may be a difference of opinion as to the necessity for it. As far as I am concerned that was a very necessary step because at the end of the day the instrument that will be the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, &mdash; if we are to go by voting trends, to use a popular phrase &mdash; has to be judged as an integral document. If I have any regret in relation to my being a Member of this House ten or eleven years ago it is that I would regard myself as having been at an early stage seduced by the arguments that you can take guarantees that are offered on the day in relation to legislation: in that context I am speaking of emergency legislation. I have learned not to trust these guarantees from whomever they may come.  As a legislator you vote on the <Col N="1195" /> document before you and it behoves you to change it and improve it, to accept it or reject it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the response of the Minister in agreeing to the complaints procedures and to the regulations being a substantive, integral part of the Bill itself.  My objection to the Bill has been that I felt it was extending my point about being a misconception of crime.  My first worry I have already stated.  It is in terms of its impact and its perception among certain socio-economic groups.  Here there is no point in my being assured that these are unreasonable words.  Remember rather, to take up Senator Loughrey's point, it is important how things will be perceived. It is important, if you follow that logic, to look at how this Bill will be perceived in the areas to which it will be applied.  It has the potential for massive misconception and will be seen as an instrument of a State which is not perceived as one which offers participation to everybody equally.  The case has been made that the vast majority do not need convincing any more as to the connection between the poverty rate, the unemployment rate and the crime rate.  I have to use the word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; because I have failed over ten years to convince people of that.</P>
    <P>What is important to realise is that equally as significant as the connection between the socio-economic conditions of the people at whom this Bill might be directed most is their perception of their participation in society &mdash; a point not sufficiently made.  If you do not continue in the formal educational system and you find yourself, for example, more than average in your neighbourhood or in your family being apprehended for particular offences and perhaps you are released and the procedures are always correct, your view and perception of the State is different from those who rarely, if ever, find themselves in these circumstances. You must think of that as the atmosphere in which the Bill will find itself being applied.  I did, and more than once in the course of this long debate I made the point that I acknowledged the alternative approach that already exists within the <Col N="1196" /> juvenile liaison system by the Garda, to whom I give credit.  The Minister thanked me for that, to his credit.  This could not be repeated enough.  That is the road to go, but I must emphasise my profound belief that this Bill can do little else that alienate the community from the enforcement authority and, in that, not contribute to reduction in the crime rate.  I could be more specific and say it is not likely to improve a present unsatisfactory detection rate, be it in terms of general crimes of 34 per cent or whatever and of larceny of 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>My regret about the debate is that, unfortunately, the detection rate has been confused regularly with the crime rate throughout the debate.  The problem of crime was so confused in many cases. The more emotional arguments in favour of this Bill were made in terms of the problem of crime as it might even notionally affect elderly people living alone, whereas perhaps we did not address specifically and more precisely the details as to why the detection rate is so low.  Several Senators did try to address that problem.</P>
    <P>My other point is in relation to the civil libertarian framework which can be included in my general critique of the Bill on social and economic grounds.  I would suggest that a majority can often demand what is manifestly wrong for the minority. I would suggest further than that, that it is up to the Legislature to resist that.  Equally I would argue that in bringing in measures which may be popular in the short term but which may be based on demand and response, on a profound misconception of the nature of crime, the majority damages itself as well as the minority being damaged.  This is my point about the alienating effects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I argue that the criminal legal system, for example, is something which has been established essentially within a conservative and libertarian ethos.  It assumes that everybody has the capacity to appear equally in court, to equally play all the rules effectively.  There is no evidence to suggest that this is so, but in so far as it exists &mdash; and this is relevant to the Bill &mdash; it exists principally by its two key <Col N="1197" /> elements.  The first is the right to silence and again the exclusion of the original section 16 was an assistance in that regard, but one could argue that it is the effective right to silence which is changed by some sections of the Bill.  The other is the key notion of the presumption of innocence until proved guilty.  Those which, for example, proceed from an arrangement by which detention can be used to gather information and the clear, not notional, effect within the provisions of the Bill that the persons will give such information as will be required to vindicate themselves from charges that will be made, are a reversal of a fundamental principle within the criminal law.  No attempt was made to disguise that, but it was argued that we need to give these away in order to deal with the crime problem.  One speech after another suggested that we have got the balance right now.  I agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret &mdash; and enough has been said about it &mdash; the manner in which this Bill will affect people under the age of 12.  Let me make a clarifying point here and it is by way of that section of the Bill.  I was interested in the Minister's suggestion that the debate on the age of criminal responsibility might be anticipated by the debate on the very late amendments to the Bill, such as Nos. 17 and 18.  I am very concerned about that and would like to think that in accordance with my suggestion of the age of criminal responsibility, sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 of this Bill would apply to people not <Col N="1198" /> under the age of 15.  I would not want to prejudge the debate about the age of criminal responsibility because I would not like to think that I was biasing my own argument which would be inclined &mdash; the Minister asked me this in one of his interventions in the debate &mdash; to the age of 17, which would be my own choice. I want to place that on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendments providing that certain sections of the Bill will not come into effect until the regulations have been made and approved by the House and the complaints procedure established, I was glad to see that the volume of the regulations is substantial at this stage and it exists in its first draft form.  It is important that these regulations be now very comprehensive.  Here again let me warn about a misconception that can arise from the interpretation of certain sections of this Bill.  Those who are in favour of adequate safeguards in the regulations and those who want a comprehensive and independent complaints procedure which is referred to here, are not lifting themselves out of responsibility to the wider public and accepting some kind of partial view of society living within the mind only of the accused person.  The people who do that are interested in the quality of the law itself.  I am sure, at the cost of greatly boring people to death, in this, that the criminal law exists very much more for the protection of the innocent than it does for its punitive purposes of allocating sanctions for certain behaviours of a criminal kind.  In its practice, great attempts were made not to dissociate this Bill from the nature and practice of the Offences Against the State Act, particularly section 30.  I hope that as it is applied in all its sections it will set up such an atmosphere of vigilance that it will spill over into the area of that other Act and its sections as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an instrument, and despite all the disclaimers to the contrary, in my opinion it will stand on its own as an approach to the crime problem.  It does not stand alongside massive redistribution programmes; <Col N="1199" /> it does not stand alongside significant interventions into the economic or social experience of the poor; it does not much stand alongside extended community provisions in areas of known high crime rates, but if put into practice as it now stands it will stand on its own.</P>
    <P>The Minister was anxious that it stand in the context of an anticipated Children Bill.  I hope that the children's legislation will come quickly so that it can be judged in that context and that the protective measures can be built into the legislation as it affects children and that will mitigate it, but I have to judge it on its own.  I see this &mdash; particularly section 4, its new power of detention, which so changes the criminal law &mdash; in relation to the way in which it has not been amended in its impact on so many groups that I believe are inarticulate.  I refer to people who often do not know their rights and, most importantly, have had little experience of justice and in their not experiencing justice have become suspicious of the legal enforcement process that frequently serves as an ally or instrument of a society that perpetrates injustice on them.  I believe that in relation to most of the other positions and in relation to the sanctions that may now fall on many people who may find measures directed at them, and who may later find themselves vindicated as totally innocent, it will be seen as an instrument outside of themselves and, therefore, it will be seen as the principle of alienation.  I hope I am proved wrong in everything I have said, but it would be simply dishonest of me if I did not say that.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the critics of those of us who wanted to oppose legislation of this kind, who stand for a totally different approach to handling the crime problem, to understand that we are concerned about the crime problem not only in terms of its victims &mdash; it might sound even a more vague suggestion to make but it is one that I know to be true &mdash; but in many cases criminals are damaged themselves by the crimes they commit.  There is no crime of violence for example that does not harm only the victim, it damages <Col N="1200" /> the person involved in violence as so many of us know.  I respectfully ask for a more comprehensive treatment of the crime problem.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have opposed this Bill do not set out as the opponents of the Garda.  We have acknowledged the work of the Garda in relation to the community, and particularly in relation to juveniles but nobody should be immune from the criticism that is necessary when powers are given of perhaps an inordinate kind in an atmosphere that is charged with so much social deprivation and so forth.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I ask the Seanad to understand what this Bill involves.  I cannot convince people more than I have done so far, but I feel that the Bill is based on a misconception of a problem, that it is the wrong instrument, that it will, I am afraid, be counterproductive, that its products will be alienating, rather than contributing to the solution of the crime problem.  For these reasons I felt it necessary in the first instance to oppose the principle that lay behind section 4 and later to seek to mitigate the impact of this Bill &mdash; and I am grateful for the common ground discovered between the Minister and ourselves and I have acknowledged that but as it stands, as our instrument in 1984 for approaching the crime problem, it will be judged by its impact.  When we go looking for the justification for it as an instrument we will be found wanting because it came out of an atmosphere of a lack of understanding of the complex problem of crime and its social setting, it was very much in the nature of a reaction rather than a contribution to the elimination or reduction of the crime rate and the rate of detection and perhaps in the end the solidifying of such social bonds as are necessary, and the forging of new connections between communities so as effectively to prevent crime before it is commissioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult to speak after Senator Michael Higgins.  After a performance like that who can possibly shine?  Despite the changes in the Bill, I continue to feel <Col N="1201" /> it will not achieve what clearly it was intended to achieve, and what I am convinced the Minister is sincere in intending it to achieve, that is, preventing and reducing crime in our society.  I acknowledge fully that the Minister has made a great many amendments to this Bill both in the other House and in this House and in that context I particularly acknowledge his amendment which allows for the complaints procedure to be brought in in a coterminous way with the other sections. That is an important advance in improving the situation brought about by the Bill.  Nevertheless, I continue to feel that section 4 and the following sections are not going to operate in the way the supporters of the Bill hope.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Senators who feel that, in a country where we have already a considerable degree of deprivation and a high rate of unemployment, coupled with a very large number of young people, this kind of measure will tend to drive a wedge between those who wish to enforce the law, those who are trying to enforce the law and the young people, particularly in our cities and towns.  This is more damaging than any good that the Bill can possibly do because if society is to survive in a reasonable fashion, one of the most important things is that there should be a general consensus of respect for the law and for those who enforce the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tragic events in Northern Ireland for instance have shown quite clearly that where a community is alienated from a police force that police force becomes ineffective.  I am very concerned lest this kind of ineffectiveness may move towards the Garda Síochána, a force which up to now has generally commanded very wide public respect.  I am not using this opposition to the Bill as an opportunity to attack the Garda; I do not wish to attack the Garda.  It is simply that I feel this Bill is not going to give those who support it what they think it will give them.  I do not think the end result will be the end result we might wish for.  In particular among the amendments that were moved both on Committee and <Col N="1202" /> Report Stages, I am concerned that the amendments, excluding the application for the various sections with regard to people under 15 years' should have been rejected because I still remain very concerned about what will happen to children of this age.  They are still children as the various sections of the Bill apply to them.  In my opinion in this context the Bill will not achieve what it is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years there has been a public perception &mdash; whether backed by the facts is open to question of a large increase in crime and an increase in public fear of crime.  It is obviously something that any responsible government will want to do something to meet and I can see that that may have been the purpose in bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, this begs the whole question of what we do about crime and how effective measures will be.  Even if we have a higher rate of detection and commit more people to prison, what do you get at the end of that?  Is this really an effective way of dealing with the situation?  As a response to public fear and as a response to what may have been seen as a demand for more law and order legislation, this Bill will not achieve what it sets out to do. Unfortunately, it will tend more to alienate large groups of our population than it will add to the safety and happiness of the population as a whole.</P>

      <P>I will be as brief as possible. I intend to speak in support of the Bill.  The Criminal Justice Bill, 1983, is the first serious Bill to tackle the problems of crime and the powers given to the Garda are necessary to enable them to carry out the difficult task of combating crime.  Change in the criminal law in Ireland is not a new subject for debate.  As far back as 1967 there was pressure for a similar Criminal Justice Bill to be introduced in the Dáil.  The Bill fell when there was a change of Government and was not reintroduced.  There were opportunities for other Ministers for Justice in the intervening time to introduce the Bill but because of the sensitive nature of such a Bill they did not grasp the nettle. I congratulate the Minister for Justice for his courage in bringing this Bill before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I intend to deal with a few of the sections briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is one of the most controversial sections in the Bill.  It has been debated at great length in this House during the last few weeks.  The reason for this Bill is that the Garda for years now have been severely restricted by the existing law in carrying out their investigative duties.  If the Garda are to be successful in investigating crime they need the powers of detention.  It is ludicrous to think that at present when a garda brings a suspect to the Garda station to help them with their inquiries he may not detain him for questioning.  Up to a few years ago the Garda were detaining suspects in the belief that they had such power.  In <i>The People</i> v <i>Shaw</i> the net effect of this judgment is that the Garda are not entitled to arrest or detain a suspect for the purpose of securing evidence. The provisions in this Bill empowering the Garda to detain persons arrested without warrant on suspicion of having committed a serious offence are intended to restore the position to what it was thought to have been.  The Bill <Col N="1204" /> does not give the Garda any new powers of arrest.  The power to detain suspects for a reasonable time so as to give the Garda an opportunity by questioning or checking out a story is essential if we are to tackle the serious crime situation. Section 4 (3) provides for a person to be detained without warrant for questioning for six hours which can be extended for a further six hours by authorisation of a chief superintendent.  No questioning can take place between midnight and 8 a.m. At the conclusion of the detention period, if there are no longer any grounds for suspecting that he has committed a crime, the suspect must be released.  This section is necessary to enable the Garda to carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>Under section 5, a solicitor and another person must be informed that if the persons detained are released they cannot be rearrested for the same offence unless by the authority of a district justice.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill as a whole is a good one but on its own it will not solve the crime problem in Ireland.  The community have a big part to play.  We need total co-operation with the Garda to help them in their efforts to tackle crime. Since the debate on this Bill started there has been unnecessary criticism of the Garda.  There are 11,400 gardaí and 99 per cent of them are doing an excellent job.  Some of them even lay down their lives for that job.  Politicians have a duty <Col N="1205" /> to support the Garda.  I was not surprised, because of some of the statements made by politicians in this House, to read in one of the papers about concern expressed by the General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Mr. P.J. Rogan, regarding lack of support for the Garda.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and compliment the House for giving the measure a very thorough examination. Every Stage of this Bill has got adequate time, there were no restrictions, there were very full, in-depth debates right through.  Senators O'Leary, Michael Higgins, Durcan, Brendan Ryan, McGuinness and many more spent a lot of time debating the Bill and the Minister was most patient, and what he has now is an improved Bill.  It will improve the letter of the law, and the extensive debate here has clarified the spirit of the Act, as this measure will be when it is passed.  Of course I do not believe in all Senator Brendan Ryan said but I am indebted to him for drawing my attention to something I said during the course of my Second Stage contribution, reported at column 397 of the Official Report of 19 September, when I inferred that crime was synonymous with poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that and I do not believe <Col N="1206" /> it.  I am sure I did not intend to say that. As a full time politician for the last 26 years I have worked with every section of the community and I know that is not the case.  I would not like to have this important debate concluded and leave that kind of misconception on the record. I believe that what the Minister has steered through this House so expertly over the last number of weeks will give the Garda and the Judiciary, the people who are charged with administering the laws of this country, greater capacity to carry out their duties to protect the weaker sections of our community.  It will, perhaps, assist the Garda in detection and will make them that little bit more efficient in combating modern criminals. That is a significant step forward. I look with confidence to the Garda and the Judiciary being in a better position to carry out their duties, having the Criminal Justice Bill of 1983 to help them.</P>
    <P>I do not look at the measure in the way some of my colleagues in the House have expressed themselves.  After listening to most of the debate I hope that the Minister might avail of the opportunity not just in four years but next year to come in with a general review.  Perhaps we could organise a debate on the Annual Report on Crime presented to us by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I think that would be an appropriate vehicle through which to monitor not just this legislation but the way in which the various powers are being handled and used by the Garda. I have every confidence in the Commissioner and the force and every sector in the law enforcement area.  Indeed today it was impressive to see the prison officers.  It is the first time I have seen them parade, a very fine body of persons. It gives one confidence in the institutions of the State when one sees that fine type of personnel who work for the State and with the State in the interests of ordinary law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>I feel happy tonight in the Seanad after concluding this legislation.  The Seanad has given very open and full deliberation to this important measure and as it leaves the House I think it has been improved. <Col N="1207" /> I compliment the Minister for the very dedicated and patient way he has listened to the debate and acted on it.  I am sure the Department are definitely in safe hands.  He has been more than kind in accommodating the Members of the House over the past number of weeks.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House for as long as I detained it on Second Stage.  There are just a few things I would like to say.  First of all, it would be wrong for me not to thank the Members of the House who were so kind to me during the course of the consideration of this Bill, particularly my former colleagues, Fine Gael Senators and, of course the Fianna Fáil, Labour and Independent Members.  It is right that I should place on record the attention which the Minister gave to the Committee and subsequent Stages of this Bill.  It showed the co-operation between the House and the Members of the Government at its best during that period.</P>
      <P>Very briefly, I just want to say that many of my friends chide me that I made a mistake in not getting involved in the controversy on this Bill at an earlier stage.  Here is the difficulty; this is the only place in which I have a mandate to speak.  I have a mandate indirectly from the people to speak in this House: the people, having taken the Constitution upon themselves, allowed the Taoiseach to nominate certain Members to the House.  It is only in this House that I have a mandate.  I am different in that way from other public representatives.  That is the reason.</P>
      <P>There are just a few points I would like to make on the Bill and in particular on section 4.  I do not intend to go through section 4 subsection by subsection, but to look at it in its global effect.  I intend briefly to dwell on a number of unresolved problems with regard to section 4 and things that might be yet put right with the Bill.  Article 40 of the Constitution is the great Article in the Constitution.  I would like just briefly to examine whether section 4 as about to be passed by this House is in accordance with that Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> I do not intend to go into any great textual analysis of it, but it is important that we should consider whether the legislation we are passing is in accordance with the Constitution.  Article 40.3.1º provides that the State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  Does this Bill do that?  Are the rights of the citizens vindicated in the way in which we are proposing to enact this Bill and in particular with regard to the detention provision in section 4?  It is our duty to consider that because obviously we have to consider whether to enact this legislation.  It may be the duty of other people to consider it as well.</P>
    <P>Article 40.4.1º provides that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty except in accordance with law.  It is under that extraordinary simple and direct statement that no power has existed until this to detain a person suspected of a crime, save in respect of crimes falling within the ambit of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>Whether the marrying together of these two great guarantees in the Constitution in the context of the Bill as it is proposed we should enact it falls within the range of options open to the Oireachtas in making laws is a matter for the President to decide, and it is a matter for the Supreme Court to decide in the event of the President deciding to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.  I certainly am not going to offer any advice to the President on that matter &mdash; no doubt he will be well advised himself.  However, the matter does not rest there, and our duties and responsibilities do not rest there.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which this Bill can be considered.  There is another way in which we should examine whether or not it is appropriate to have it considered by the people.  We should consider whether the powers contained in section 4 are so fundamental that they require to be referred to the people by way of referendum.  There is a provision under Article 27 of the Constitution to do that in the event of a majority of Seanad Éireann and one-third of Dáil Éireann deeming it <Col N="1209" /> to be appropriate.  That is a matter which each of us has an opportunity to consider during the course of the period of time between this Bill being passed in this House and coming into law by reason of the amendments which we propose to make being approved of by Dáil Éireann sometime during the month.  That is a matter each of us will have to consider.</P>
    <P>We have to decide whether to invite our colleagues to consider the application of Article 27 to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4, as it deals with detention, and section 5, as it deals with the access to a solicitor are the sections I have concentrated on right throughout this debate in this House.  They are the ones that have been the most hard fought on the floor of this House and, without repeating what I said on Second Stage, no adequate case has been made for the introduction of these powers.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage &mdash; my view has not changed &mdash; that this Bill, if enacted, will in so far as it relates to the power of detention lead to great confusion in criminal trials.  The length of ordinary criminal trials before a jury will be extended considerably.  Extreme pressure will come on these and the Judiciary will be called upon to adjudicate on a lot of problems which will arise out of the application of section 4.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the compatability of the legislation with the Constitution. On the other hand we have the practical effect of the legislation in the courts.  Quite separate and distinct from that we have the atmosphere which this legislation will create in the State.  It is with this atmosphere that I am most concerned. The enacting of the powers in connection with the detention of arrested persons will, in my opinion, give rise to considerable disimprovement in the relationship between the members of the Garda Síochána and the general public. I am not saying that this disimprovement will take place instantaneously.  I am not saying it will take place overnight, but it will take place gradually over a period of time by reason of two things.  First, the alienation of those who are involved in the detention procedures, particularly <Col N="1210" /> the alienation of those who are not subsequently charged with an offence, and the alienation of their relations and their friends by reason of that person's involvement. That is one bad effect that is going to follow from it.</P>
    <P>Another equally bad effect will be the effect of turning the Garda Síochána in on themselves, making them an introspective Force, looking in on themselves instead of looking out to the community; making the police station a place of fear and a place of dislike in the community instead of what it should be, a haven of peace and friendliness in the community. In those two aspects, the alienation of the individuals involved on the one hand, and the priority which this detention provision will represent the Garda Síochána and the way it will turn them in on themselves will be the most foul effect of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Some portions of this legislation have been amended through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I regret to say that the party which I have an honour of being a member participated as part of a triumvirate who coalesced together to get this Bill through the House.  That triumvirate was Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. It was unstoppable.  We just could not stop it.  The political parties should have stepped back from themselves, looked at the powers contained in this legislation and asked themselves: &ldquo;Is this appropriate legislation on which to impose a party Whip?&rdquo;  I do not believe it is.  I do not object to it being done, but I do not think it is appropriate legislation on which to impose a party Whip.</P>
    <P>Is the Seanad really a place for political parties or is it a place where people will genuinely look at legislation from an objective viewpoint?  We have no control over the finances of this country.  There are vast areas of the Government which are never touched upon in the Seanad. We have no responsibility whatsoever in that area.  There is no possibility of, say, the National Plan being voted on in this House or, if it is voted on, it will be in some innocuous way that the House takes note of it.  It is the other Houses's responsibility.  The Members of that <Col N="1211" /> House are elected directly by the people to look after that matter.  Our responsibility is different.  Our responsibility should be different and, while we might have party affiliations, we should be freed of the party discipline on this kind of legislation.  It is irrelevant.  There should not be a Fine Gael position on detention or a Fianna Fáil position on detention. The relationship between that and the Government of the country is too remote for it to be considered a defeat for the Government if the Bill is changed in any way.  That is what the atmosphere here has been.  It was a defeat for the Government if this Bill did not get through.</P>
    <P>There are many Members of this House on all sides who would have voted differently had there been a completely free vote on this legislation.  I am not blaming them.  Maybe I blame myself for what I did, but it is wrong that there should be a party whip on something like this.</P>
    <P>There are many fine sections in this Bill.  There are many parts of this Bill that are badly needed and which will make a significant contribution towards creating the right climate in the country.  The sections dealing with the offences committed while on bail are excellent sections.  They are sensible.  There are one or two problems which were discussed earlier today, but, by and large, the idea is good.  The habitual criminal is given some incentive to obey the law.  That is a very good thing. I do not know whether it will work, but it is certainly worth trying and while trying it nobody is being incommoded in any way.</P>
    <P>There are other things with regard to trial procedures, electronic recording of questioning, and all those things, generally speaking, should be welcomed.  The core and the heart of this legislation is the detention.  Very briefly, I should say that the people who analysed and decided to oppose this Bill inside and outside these Houses of the Oireachtas and who decided to concentrate on those sections of the Bill which the Minister removed in Dáil Éireann made a tragic mistake with very severe consequences.  I believed from <Col N="1212" /> the very start that the section of this Bill which would cause the greatest difficulty in the long run for the people was the detention provision because the whole concept of detention is so extraordinary, that we take a person who has been accused of no crime, on the merest suspicion of a member of the security forces and detain him at the pleasure of other members of the security forces.  It is not compatible with our view of civil liberties.</P>
    <P>Good things have gone into the Bill. The prospect of a review in four years time is excellent but will there be a Whip on when that review comes up in four years time?  Are the Members of the Dáil and Members of Seanad Éireann to be whipped into acceptance of that legislation when it comes up?  It is a funny thing that we in Fine Gael cannot successfully get through legislation which deals with sex because some of our own people and the Fianna Fáil Party together have a veto.  It is the same way with Fianna Fáil.  They cannot get through something which deals with criminal justice because we have a power of veto over it.  If a Bill identical with this had come before the Houses of the Oireachtas when Fine Gael were in Opposition they would have voted against it to a man.  We can only increase the powers of the Garda when we are in Government and when Fianna Fáil are in Opposition, just as we can only increase the civil liberties of people in sexual matters when Fianna Fáil are in Government and we are in Opposition. One of the ironies of the situation is that the only person who can bring about a reform is the person that you do not expect to bring it about.  The only person who brings about something like this is a person from a party that have the reputation of being the haven of what used to be known long ago as the &ldquo;wiggy wigs&rdquo;, the barristers.  It is funny that it is only we who can change the civil law in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say to the Members of the House.  I would ask any Members of the House who disagree with the central core sections of the Bill dealing with detention to vote against it on Fifth Stage.  By doing so they will be <Col N="1213" /> doing a great service to the country.  I doubt that whatever the eloquence of Senator Higgins, Senator Ryan, Senator McGuinness, myself or any of the other people who have spoken on the same side with regard to this Bill there will be any change when the vote comes on Fifth Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): First of all, I would like to thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  Certainly from my point of view it was a very interesting debate and I thought there was a most searching Committee Stage.  I have conceded a number of amendments but I think one of the main benefits of the searching debate, especially on Committee Stage, was that the public will understand it a bit better as a result of the debate here and in the other House than they understood it 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>I know that the Senators who oppose the Bill here have genuine concern for the effects that the Bill will have or might have.  I accept their bona fides absolutely and I accept what they have said came from genuine concern.  It is part of the democratic process and this House should be as central to that process as the other House.  On a personal level, I am very sorry that Senator O'Leary felt that on a matter of principle he had to vote against a section of the Bill.  I would like to thank members of the press who covered this debate.  Not being a Member of the House, it would be appropriate for me to say that the many excellent contributions made by Senators were not fully reported by the media but certainly that was not the fault of the press people who covered it here over such long periods of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the amendments which were made here and which were made in the other House have improved the Bill. Some of the amendments I conceded because I thought that they would improve the Bill.  Other amendments I conceded because I thought that they would provide a greater consensus.  I will now proceed, if Fifth Stage is passed here, with the remaining steps needed to bring the <Col N="1214" /> Bill into operation, first of all, the complaints Bill and then the regulations.  As a result of the amendment passed by this House on Report Stage, it is written into the Bill now that the controversial sections cannot be implemented until both Houses of the Oireachtas have had an opportunity to discuss and ratify in one way or another the complaints Bill in the normal process and the regulations by positive resolution.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made already in electronic recording.  I hope that very quickly we will be able to move to field trials, to gain experience ourselves and not just depend on the experience of others in this area.  There will be a full debate on the complaints procedure and on the regulations.  Certainly I will have the same willingness to consider what Deputies and Senators have to say as I have had in this debate.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions of this Bill are beneficial and I want the best possible legislation which will be of benefit to the community and which will be above challenge. I expect again that there will be very detailed and searching contributions made by the Seanad.  I have confidence in the Garda, and the implementation of this Bill.  I do not think anybody casts aspersions on the Garda Síochána here and anything I said about the Garda Síochána was more in the light of keeping up Garda morale than suggesting in any way whatsoever that the Senators were making attacks on the Garda, because they were not.  I have also confidence in the Garda in their relationships with young people.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a change in the age of criminal responsibility.  This would have had been an easier debate for me to carry if the age of criminal responsibility was higher.  I am committed to monitoring the operation of the Bill and watching it very carefully.  We have argued about when a review should take place and I have argued that four years after the implementation of the Bill is the appropriate time.  I also say now that I will not hesitate to bring in amending legislation before that time if the fears of the opponents of the Bill are realised and if <Col N="1215" /> the Bill proves to be defective.  I will ensure also in the regulations that adequate statistics are kept because it would be impossible to review legislation like this on the basis of hunch or opinion, no matter how informed.  The statistics will have to be kept and will have to be produced.  I am committed to doing this.</P>
    <P>I have not presented this Bill as an answer to the crime problem.  I see it as part of a particular package.  I see it as a response to the needs of the community and to the fears of the community.  Senator Higgins in referring to this asked what was meant in the Programme for Government by saying that we would reform the criminal law.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Mitchell, in 1981 was engaged in the consideration of proposals close enough to those which became the present Bill.  There was no secret about the proposals that were under discussion. I remember a television debate during the election campaign and my two immediate predecessors as Ministers for Justice waving the text of the Bill at each other in the television studio.  There was no secret about what was being proposed. There was no possibility that those who drew up the Programme for Government and those who accepted it were in doubt about the general provisions of a Bill such as this which was to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins also referred to other aspects of that Programme for Government. It might be interesting to note that the Community Service Order Bill has been passed and will be implemented in the next court session as the staff are now employed.  The commitment to have extra gardaí on the streets has been fulfilled.  The complaints procedures is at its final draft stage and I should have it within a very short period and will certainly bring it before both Houses in this session.  The regulations, which are very comprehensive, are at first draft.</P>
    <P>For the last couple of weeks I have had the Assistant Secretary of my Department in charge of the Garda side looking, among other things, at how the United States and Canada, especially one particular <Col N="1216" /> state in Canada, make their arrangements for a police authority.  Our mandate is for a full period in Government and the commitments which we have made will be fulfilled and I am not confining myself to the commitments of the Programme for Government.  There will be substantial other changes in the law which I think will have a higher level of acceptance in this House than the legislation which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>When this Bill and the complaints procedure and the regulations about treatment of persons in custody are all brought into operation, it will be the most important development in criminal law and procedure since the State was founded.  I think that will be so particularly in relation to the safeguards that are now being expressly provided by law, both by statute and by regulation having the force of law, for the protection of the interests of people who are in custody.  This was never done by law before.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary in this very comprehensive Fifth Stage speech suggested that there may possibly be a constitutional challenge.  He quoted from Article 40 which he said was the heart of the Constitution, the Article of the Constittion without which the rest of the Constitution would not be the kind of document that we want it to be.  He said that the State guarantees in its laws to respect in as far as practicable by its law, defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  Then he went on to quote another section where he said that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberties save in accordance with law.  He did not quote Article 40.2 which says &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;  I suggest that that is what the Houses of the Oireachtas have done and that is what the Seanad is participating in if they now pass this Bill, as I hope they will.  I would like to thank you very much indeed.</P>
