      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement that the Government have agreed to make a double payment in the week ending 7th December 1984 to certain categories <Col N="2" /> of persons in receipt of social welfare benefits and allowances.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The continuing failure of the Department of Health <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the homeless to issue its report.</P>
    <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have <Col N="3" /> selected Senator Robinson's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ryan may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is quite inconvenient on that point.  I must say, for rural Senators to be here at 3 o'clock on the day prior to a sitting to hand in those motions.  It is a very uncomfortable situation for us. I arrived here at 3.45 p.m. yesterday to discover that I was too late to hand in the motion, but I want your permission under Standing Order 30 to raise this evening a matter of immediate importance which concerns the vocational school in Tuam.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.  Because of the very tight schedule of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who wishes to participate in the debate on item No. 3, it is proposed to take Private Members' Time from 4 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. instead of the more usual time of 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Accordingly, we will commence with Nos. 1 and 2 and at 4 o'clock we will take up No. 3 until 5.30 p.m.  At 6.30 p.m. we will resume Government business.  I might say, for the information of Senators, that it is proposed that the House will sit next week.  Next week, we will be taking items Nos, 4, 5 and 6 on the Order Paper today and, in addition, a small Bill, the European Communities (Supplementary Funding) Bill, which is necessary because of the settlement of the budget problem in the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, since No. 3 is a motion that has become increasingly more important over the past number of weeks, would it be possible for time for this debate to be extended?  We have from 4 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. today.  The Minister, perhaps, will take a half hour.  I believe he is coming in today.  But in view of some of the items mentioned in the motion it <Col N="6" /> could give us the only opportunity we might have in the near future to discuss the implications of the food problems and where aid should go.  It is a motion that I should like to see extended far beyond the usual three hours.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to express concern about legislation which this House passed some time ago, the Funds of Suitors Bill.  To my knowledge, the terms of that legislation have not been carried out.  It is not a matter for me to make representations to the Ministers; it is a matter for the whole House.</P>

      <P>Could the Cathaoirleach assist me so that this House might express its concern that the terms of the Funds of Suitors Bill, referring to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have not been complied with?  In the process of legislation no strings were attached to the allocation of these funds.  I am rather disappointed.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Senator Lanigan's request that more time be given for the motion put down in the names of the Labour Senators on development aid, and in particular referring to the famine in African countries.  I agree with him that this is an extremely important motion and that it would be desirable that we have additional time, if possible, to discuss it.  I would welcome that.  The time fixed is 4 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. today and it is proposed that we break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  I suggest &mdash; although I am not in favour of this as a general proposition &mdash; that we might sit through <Col N="7" /> the break.  It might even be an appropriate thing on the particular terms of this motion to sit through the break and to continue the discussion on this motion from 4 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  That would give further time today and it could still be carried over to the next day.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I wonder if the Cathaoirleach could advise me as to the way in which I can raise the appointment of the Minister for Education's brother-in-law, Brian Hussey, to the committee advising on forestry, due to the fact that he has a vested interest, representing the banking institutions of this country on that committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very supportive of any measures that would facilitate the reasonable request that we get more time for debating this motion.  My main reason for this is that mention had been made of the public interest which arises, for example, from the food aid aspect, but the motion refers to the whole question of the structure of a development aid policy, which is a broader context than the food aid one.  Therefore, I would certainly support any way in which more time could be given to the motion, including the way suggested by Senator Robinson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <P>I would like to support this very reasonable request.  Whether this is done during the tea hour this evening or carried on until next week is irrelevant, but one or the other should be agreed upon.  In the debate on <i>Building on Reality</i> many of us had not the opportunity to speak.  The House should have taken into account the large number of Senators who wished to make a contribution. Because the Order of Business suggests that it should finish at a certain time, that is done.  We should be fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but the House did not take cognisance of the fact that people had contributions to make and wanted to make them.  I was next on the list and I was very disappointed that I could not make my simple contribution on an allegedly important document, particularly taking into account the propaganda that the Government are now engaging in throughout the country in bringing certain Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of giving additional time to this motion, it is very important that in this House we should distinguish between Private Members' Time and Government time.  The position is that I had agreed with the Minister of State to come in here for a general debate on overseas development aid.  That debate would have been taken in Government time. The extent of the speeches would not have been limited.  The extent of the debate would not have been limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this motion was put down in Private Members' Time and chosen as a priority motion by the Labour group, a difficulty arose.  I considered the question of whether the two should be debated together but I considered that it might appear that a Private Members' motion was being taken over by a Government <Col N="9" /> motion and that that would be a bad precedent.  Accordingly, I asked the Minister of State if he would postpone until after Christmas the matter of a general debate on overseas development aid. On the last occasion on which we had a Private Members' motion there was an urging that the topic was of such importance that we should extend the time beyond the normal three hours.  Here we are finding ourselves with the same request.</P>
    <P>In the present Seanad we have had more time devoted to Private Members' business than I can remember in my period in this House of over 20 years and we should not allow ourselves to develop the practice that we should frequently decide that the time should be extended. We will end up in chaos if we do that.</P>
    <P>This problme is one of importance and I suggest that we should debate it as a Private Members' motion in the ordinary way and that we should, very early in the New Year, have a Government motion which will be completely broad in scope and in which we can take up the whole question of our ODA policy.  I do not promise we will have that debate in January, but certainly I would hope that it could be held before the end of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Leader of the House has taken a reasonable stand on this.  He has given a guarantee that we will have a general debate in the very near future on overall development aid policy.  Could he guarantee that next week we will have a motion on development in the European Communities?  On this motion we could take in many of the issues that are in the Private Members' motion or, if we want to extend the debate to developments or non-developments in the European Communities, we could develop the theme right along the line.  Can we take it that we will have an early debate on overall development aid programmes?  It is about time we had a debate on the report &mdash; developments since January 1984.</P>

      <P>It is said that nothing is certain except death and taxes.  Anyone <Col N="10" /> who has ever been concerned with Seanad business will know that it can shift from time to time.  As of now, it is my firm intention for my deputy to stand here next week &mdash; as I will not be here &mdash; and propose that we have a debate in Government time which will be open-ended and that we will take, not only the general motion which is No. 4, but we will take with it the motions in regard to the super-levy and the fisheries policy based on the joint committee reports, that is, Nos. 5 and 6.  Unless the Chair is unduly restrictive in regard to the Private Members' debate that is going on and the projected general debate, I should imagine the Senators would be entitled to talk about the Community's development policy.</P>

    <Title>Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill in the Dáil last week, a Chathaoirligh, I <Col N="11" /> indicated that the Ombudsman had already received approximately 1,300 complaints and had dealt with over 1,000 of them.</P>
      <P>These figures reflect, in my view, the major impact which the Ombudsman has made in his comparatively short period in office.  They also underline the efficient way in which he has been discharging his responsibilities.  It is clear, therefore, that the all-party agreement to establish the office of the Ombudsman was fully justified.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note that Deputies on all sides shared this view.  Indeed, to my mind, the general tenor of their comments amounted to a vote of confidence in the office itself and in its present incumbent. I think that a very wise choice was made in having Mr. Mills as our first Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>A number of very interesting points were raised during the course of the Dáil debate.  One which struck me in particular was the suggestion that the Ombudsman should highlight those areas, such as social welfare, for example, where grievances can only be remedied by reforming legislation.  This, to my mind, was a point well made.  I believe that the Ombudsman has an important role to play, not merely in investigating individual complaints, but also in pointing to areas where general remedial action is needed through changes in legislation.  In doing this, of course, he would be of considerable help to the Oireachtas which, because of pressure of business, has not always the time to review the impact of legislation on an on-going basis.  No matter how slight the anomalies identified might be, they could still give rise to very serious problems for large sections of the community.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I was glad to note that earlier this week the Ombudsman had highlighted anomalies which he felt existed in relation to the social insurance system.  In fact, the Ombudsman has already made a submission to the Commission on Social Welfare on this very matter.  This is precisely the kind of role for the Ombudsman that I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> Reference was also made to the importance of ensuring that the public at large gained an appreciation of the role of the Ombudsman.  I think that the figures I have quoted in relation to complaints to the Ombudsman's office speak for themselves. It is clear that the Ombudsman has, in his comparatively short time of operation, made a considerable public impact.  I know that the Ombudsman himself has taken important steps to advertise his services through participation in debates and discussions throughout the country.  He has also taken other measures to publicise the work of his office.  Nevertheless, I think that the point made during the course of the Dáil debate relating to the need for widespread publicity for the office was well made.  It is vital that all citizens be made fully aware of the part the Ombudsman can play on their behalf.  For this reason, I provided £20,000 in this year's budget for the Ombudsman's office, specifically for the purposes of advertising and publicity. I will continue to ensure that, in future years the office is provided with the necessary financial means in this area.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Ombudsman has a major role to play in relations between citizens and bureaucracy.  In essence, he is the focus for citizens in seeking remedies against administrative malpractice. He must, accordingly, be able to respond quickly to situations where the need for urgent action on his part is clearly demonstrated.</P>
    <P>This is one of the main purposes of the present Bill before the House.  The two schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980 determine, effectively, the extent of the Ombudsman's remit.  Amendment of the schedules is at present made by order.  At present, under section 4 (10) (c) of the Act, a draft order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days.  The order can then be made if a resolution disapproving the draft is not passed within that period.  This procedure can, however, lead to delays.  Because of the 21 days sitting requirement, it can take up to five months &mdash; due to frequency of House sittings, holidays, timing of the Order etc. &mdash; to effect <Col N="13" /> changes to the schedules.  These, however, in many cases would be changes on which there was widespread agreement. In some cases, the public interest would require urgent action.  I am sure that nobody in this House would want to see a situation where such action was inhibited because of procedures.  The Bill, therefore, proposes to change the present arrangements to speed up the procedures which govern changes in the Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>There is one other very important aspect to the Bill.  Under it, all future changes would require a positive motion of approval of the relevant order by both Houses.  There would thus be a full debate, where the need arose, and all Members would have the opportunity of making their views known.  The Houses, therefore, would be fully involved in all decisions affecting the Ombudsman's remit.  This is a major contrast to present arrangements which, essentially, assign a somewhat passive role to the Oireachtas. They put the onus on it to take the initiative in deciding whether to take action in disapproving the terms of draft orders.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, I, as Minister for the Public Service, would have to submit myself to the scrutiny of the Oireachtas each time that changes to the schedules arose.  This is a task which I would gladly assume.  As I have said, I think it is only right that the Oireachtas should be fully and actively involved in all major decisions affecting the Ombudsman.  Indeed, as I mentioned in the Dáil, some committees of the House might with profit look at the system which pertains in much of our legislation whereby a similar order procedure is adopted very often resulting in delays in implementing what are worthwhile changes.  Perhaps a more positive motion of approval might be sought in many cases to the improvement, not only of the system but of the relevance of participation of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the affairs of State.</P>
    <P>I was very gratified at the response of Dáil Deputies on all sides to the Bill. They, too, accepted that the Ombudsman must be permitted to take urgent action where the need arose.  They also <Col N="14" /> accepted that the Oireachtas must play an active role in this area.  I think, therefore, that the Bill will have a major impact in achieving these twin purposes.  For this reason, I strongly recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Since the establishment of the office of Ombudsman over 1,000 complaints have been finalised, as was pointed out by the Minister.  I wish to join in congratulating Mr. Michael Mills, who was an inspired choice as Ombudsman, and his able staff on the successful completion of such a heavy workload to date.  Now that we have an Ombudsman, with his office fully operational, there is a compelling case to have his jurisdiction extended without any further delay.  The administrative injustices that the citizen suffers at the hands of local authorities, health boards or State-sponsored bodies are no less because they occur outside the Departments of State.</P>
      <P>The principle that we should adopt is that where there exists any chance that a powerless citizen may be injured by his or her dealings with the administration, then that area of the administration not only should but must be brought within the Ombudsman's remit.  I must, therefore, record my disappointment that the Minister is not using this, the first instance on which we had an opportunity to refer to the operation of the office of Ombudsman, to do something meaningful to extend the jurisdiction of that office.</P>
      <P>When the Ombudsman legislation was passing through the Oireachtas in 1980, the Minister of State who steered the legislation through at that time took a great deal of stick about the exclusion from the Ombudsman's remit of specific areas of public administration.  In particular, the Minister of State was criticised harshly by Members of the present Minister's party, Fine Gael, for failing to include local authorities and health boards within the Ombudsman's purview from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was explained by the then Minister that an extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to those areas could not take place until the elected representatives <Col N="15" /> had been consulted.  The Minister, who indicated that his personal preference was for inclusion at that time, promised that there would be immediate consultation with the local authorities and that within three months of the Ombudsman's office coming into operation, jurisdiction would be extended.  Consultations with the local authorities as promised by the Fianna Fáil Minister took place in 1981. The response in the great majority of cases was positive.  Very few local authorities opposed giving the Ombudsman jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>A series of elections, coupled with the cancellation by the then Coalition Government of the 1981 budget provision for the Ombudsman, delayed an appointment to this important office until 1983. At that stage there was no impediment to giving the Ombudsman jurisdiction over local authorities.  Yet the office was created, in spite of all that had been said, without granting jurisdiction over this vital area of administration.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not found it possible to bring local authorities and health boards into the Ombudsman's jurisdiction before now.</P>
    <P>There is another area of public administration that we could consider bringing within the Ombudsman's scrutiny which is the area of State-sponsored bodies. The citizens can count on the protection of the Dáil through parliamentary questions in dealings with central Government but it could be argued that the injustices which occur in other areas of public administration are greater because there is less accountability.  This observation is particularly true in the case of noncommercial State enterprises where the citizen does not have the benefit of registering a protest by taking his business elsewhere.  In the case of commercial State-sponsored bodies like the ESB and An Bord Telecom Éireann, the citizen is a customer of monopoly utilities.  The aggrieved citizen has little comeback.  He cannot depend on political intervention nor can he readily take his business elsewhere. The solution in the case of those commercial State-sponsored bodies <Col N="16" /> which are monopoly utilities is to extend the Ombudsman's jurisdiction there as well.  With regard to precedent, Ombudsmen in various Canadian provinces investigate complaints from citizens in the Canadian provinces in respect of electricity supply and also telephone bills in the case of telephone authorities.  I am not interested in the actual number of complaints, but there is a serious complaint problem in relation to Telecom.  The extension of the Ombudsman's remit to include An Bord Telecom and the ESB would be very much a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made the point that the purpose of this Bill is to speed up the procedural arrangements for amending the schedules to the Ombudsman's Act, 1980 and he has stressed the importance of speed in the context of making changes in the scope of the Ombudsman's remit. The primary aim of this Bill, presumably, is to speed up the extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and I heartily welcome this development.  It is appropriate, however, to draw attention to a provision in the 1980 Act under which public service personnel issues are excluded from the Ombudsman's examination. I find it difficult to accept the continuation of this exclusion because public servants in the main, do not have the right to bring their cases to the Labour Court or to a Rights Commissioner. Unless there is some immediate intention to extend to all public servants the rights enjoyed by other workers I would propose that those public servants who are excluded from the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner service should be permitted to refer their cases to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The practical experience of the Ombudsman was brought into sharp focus on Monday of this week, something to which the Minister referred to in his speech.  Mr. Michael Mills highlighted serious anomalies in the contributory old age pension scheme which are a source of complaint.  It is worthwhile recapping what Mr. Mills said.  His view was that old age pensioners had found that on <Col N="17" /> reaching the age of 66 they had not the required average stamps each year to meet the social welfare regulations. Changes in these regulations between 1953 and 1974 meant, in effect, that contributors who had paid more social insurance contributions are being treated less favourably than those who had paid less contributions over a shorter period.  I realise this is not a functional matter for the Minister for the Public Service, but I take this opportunity to ask him to use his influence with his Cabinet colleagues, namely, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare, to end this inequity.</P>
    <P>Most of what I have said has focused on the urgent need to expand the remit of the Ombudsman.  This, inevitably, raises the question of an increased workload for the office of the Ombudsman when the extension takes place.  With a small staff a very substantial workload has been tackled successfully to date.  The co-operation of Government Departments &mdash; I know the Minister is very keen that such co-operation should at all times be forthcoming &mdash; is vital to the work of the Ombudsman.  Clearly, if Government Departments were prepared to review their decisions before the investigation &mdash; there is an opportunity for them to do so &mdash; or even during the investigation, it would help to speed up solutions to the problems at issue and also allow the small number of staff in the office to process more complaints.  The natural inclination of public servants is to defend decisions already taken.  Public servants are now faced with a new situation.  There is now an independent office which has access to files and to a range of information about departmental decisions which the Ombudsman wants reviewed by public servants.  This process, of course, is unprecedented in Civil Service experience. This is totally foreign to public servants. The natural inclination is to defend decisions already taken.  However, the co-operation of public servants is essential and may well require a rapid change in attitude on their part.</P>
    <P>Precisely because the office of <Col N="18" /> Ombudsman is new, many public servants do not know what exactly it deals with.  The Ombudsman is not a public representative.  He is not a court of appeal.  It will take all concerned, including public servants, some time to adjust fully to this new office.  Such adjustment must be speedy in order to get the greatest benefit and justice for citizens who have complaints.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of staff through the Civil Service procedures is a very slow process.  The Minister indicated that he proposes to expand the remit of the Ombudsman's office.  I put it to the Minister, therefore, that the actual process for the recruitment and selection of additional staff to meet this new demand should be put in train and completed before the extensions in the remit actually take place.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that the greatest weapon the Ombudsman holds in the promotion of his work is publicity.  I am happy to note the Minister's allocation to the office to improve the opportunity to publicise his activities.  In that context, however, we will have an opportunity to help with the publicity in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I understand it, the first report of the Ombudsman should be available early in 1985.  I would urge that as soon as the report is published, that it be thoroughly debated and analysed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Time should be set aside for the debates as a matter of priority.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, and his staff, for a job well done, to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Senator Hillery in his comments about the Ombudsman.  I congratulate the Minister for the Public Service for having made the appointment and I also associate myself with the compliments paid to Mr. Mills. All of us have heard much about him from people who have been aggrieved and have approached him.  They have said how genuinely concerned he was in ensuring that their cases were heard efficiently and quickly.  For that reason, <Col N="19" /> any amendment that the Minister considers necessary to speed up this process should be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The extension of his remit to cover other areas of the public service, whether it is the Civil Service, semi-State bodies, local authorities or health boards, will also be welcome.  I have no doubt that in those areas the demands that will be made on him will be so great that the staff Mr. Mills will require will be somewhat greater than what he has now available to him.  Would the Minister confirm that if and when he extends the remit of the Ombudsman into these areas he will look favourably on the deployment of staff?</P>
      <P>All of us are confronted each week with many problems that should never arise if the matters were dealt with in a fair and favourable manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery referred to An Bord Telecom Éireann.  Many of us get repeated complaints about An Bord Telecom. It is obvious that the Minister should address himself specifically to this board because it is new.  It was set up only last year.  There is no doubt that those of us who have had communications with them know, that the level of response is, first of all, cold and the efforts they make to rectify matters seem to be almost negligible. I ask the Minister if there are specific areas of complaint in the semi-State sector, particularly in the area of Telecom Éireann in regard to which approximately 150,000 complaints are being lodged, to indicate whether he or the Minister for Communications would be prepared to accept complaints either directly from us or through the Ombudsman, if his remit is extended into that particular field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned in regard to the Department of Social Welfare, which should be covered by his remit, that people suffering from diseases which are medically recognised as being terminal, probably are being subjected to medical examinations.  There is no doubt, from the evidence available to me, that in some cases the prognosis, to say the least, is extremely poor.  I am concerned that <Col N="20" /> people who are in and out of hospital are suddenly being certified, in the opinion of the medical examiner, as being fit for work, without recourse to any medical evidence on the date of the examination.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Acts are worded in such a way that people at this level can give an opinion that the person is fit to go back to work.  If the person feels aggrieved, he has the right to appeal.  A further process of examination then goes ahead. If the person is still dissatisfied and if further medical evidence is available a referee comes into the situation.  I have a particular case with which I am dealing with the Minister.  I am beginning to lose faith in the process of democratic represenations. I cannot understand how a medical referee can give an opinion on lung diseases without X-rays available to him.</P>
    <P>I had one such case recently.  In spite of submitting the results of medical examinations to the Department the medical people there still considered that their original opinion should stand.  Shortly afterwards the person was re-admitted to hospital, was then transmitted to Peamount sanatorium from where he was transferred to Steevens Hospital.  There they certified, on the medical evidence available to them that the man would need medical certification over an unlimited period.  I still have a decision from the medical referee that in his opinion that man is fit to work.  I have no time for people who play the system, who get certified as being unfit to work and are able to work, but I am worried about the rights of people who have medical evidence available that they are unable to work and when these referees come to visit them they look at them and ask what are their names, how many children they have, do they go to bed early, what do they drink and eat and then say they are fit to work, without having recourse to medical examinations that would be necessary, particularly in regard to lung diseases.  It is in these areas that the public feel frustrated and feel that the political system has let them down.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the courageous step of appointing somebody to look <Col N="21" /> into cases like this.  A typical example was a recent case which was looked at in relation to social welfare payments.  I am concerned that, for some reason, we seem to be setting up widespread areas of bureaucracy almost to ensure that people who are entitled to things do not get them.  As a legislator that would worry me because we would like to have order in our society.  We would like to see people who are genuinely entitled to things and who do not have financial facilities available to them to take either the Department, the Minister or a health board to court, having the office of the Ombudsman readily available to ensure that justice is done.</P>
    <P>I put these facts on the record because I have been slightly frustrated, to say the least, about some developments in these areas.  I have continued to make representations and eventually I may have to call in the Ombudsman to do the job for me.  A legislator, whose sole remit is to try to represent the public who elected him should not have to do that.</P>
    <P>I compliment Mr. Mills on what he has done to date.  I hope his terms of reference will be extended into all the other areas of delivery of service to people, whether at local authority level, county council level, health boards or whatever.  By law people are entitled to certain things when they are ill or out of work.  They have contributed to them and they are their entitlement.  They should not have to go cap in hand to a politician or the Ombudsman.  I hope that the Civil Service will look particularly at the areas of social welfare, health, medical certification and all the other areas I have just mentioned.  I welcome the Bill that will facilitate Mr. Mills to function as speedily as possible.  He certainly will have the support of the Members of this House in doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill.  The only regret we have is that it is not widening the scope of the work of the Ombudsman still further to cater for local authorities, health boards and the semi-State non-commercial sector.  Tribute has been paid to Mr. Mills <Col N="22" /> and his staff for the work they are doing and I would like to be associated with that tribute.  However, I do not take the same consolation from the figures and I would be inclined to support Senator Ferris.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to congratulate ourselves over the developments that have taken place arising from the appointment of the Ombudsman but what is it showing? For many years people in public life at all levels have been making representations. I could not go into figures but they run into hundreds of thousands of pounds each year.  At Question Time in the Dáil details are elicited with regard to various constituency problems all over the country. It is fairly clear from all our experience that we have an over-centralised, entangled and too bureaucratic system. There are a number of things that we need to do apart altogether from strengthening the hand of the Ombudsman, which is a very important office and one which has undoubtedly done a lot of good since its establishment.  More needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Unless we try to dismantle the layers of bureaucracy that we have established over the years all we will be doing is coming into this House each year extending the scope of the Ombudsman and giving him a remit for a wider area and not doing anything fundamental about the problems that affect individuals, particularly the poorer sections of the community. The application forms which are required for a variety of schemes, particularly in relation to health boards, social welfare and environment need to be simplified.  We have a doctrinaire classified system which does not help the ordinary individual to understand what he has to do.  Therefore, he is inclined to use public representatives and take up their time.  We do not complain about that but it militates against the opportunity for people in public life to address themselves to policy matters and deeper questions.  They should not be embroiled to such a degree in the day to day working of the Civil Service and the administration of schemes that affect people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could give a number of examples. <Col N="23" /> Thousands of people are applying for unemployment assistance.  A person completes an application form.  It is sent into the local office, and is then sent on to Dublin; it is referred back to the social welfare officer who in turn cannot report to the local office.  He sends his report back to Dublin who in turn sends it back to the local office and they implement the decision.  That kind of thing is happening all the time.  It may be a question of decentralising power, or a question of transferring sections of the Civil Service into different regions.  People in the rural areas suffer very considerably and I am sure people in this city with the same kind of problems suffer similarly.  No. matter how much power we give to an Ombudsman or how we widen the scope of his activities as long as we have those continual unnecessary layers of bureaucracy the ordinary individual is unable to penetrate them so there will be more complaints and in a few years the Ombudsman will not be able to cope with the variety of problems presented to him.</P>
    <P>In the context of overall cutbacks in health services and social welfare, obviously there will be very tragic situations. Senator Ferris referred to one particular case.  I am quite certain that if you are a VHI patient, if you can afford top class health services and if you have a heart disease you will get every test that there is to find out what is wrong with you and you will probably survive.  I am equally certain that many medical card holders will not get all those tests, and they will not have made available to them the wide array of facilities that are available in our top heart hospitals.  I am following up one particular instance.  In those kinds of cases we can inflict lethal damage on people by not allowing freedom to the individual to avail of the best services there are.</P>
    <P>Recently I had a problem relating to the regional technical college in Waterford where a young girl qualified for a higher education course.  She became ill and when she reported the following day she was told that her place was taken the previous day.  Following representations <Col N="24" /> from me she was invited down the following week at a particular time but there was nobody available to meet her.  She was told to come back the following morning.  She comes from a family of eight.  They are very poor people.  She had to get lodgings in Waterford that night.  We could mention hundreds of cases like this.  There are people in the Civil Service who give sterling service and who are very compassionate but undoubtedly we have small groups who, for one reason or another, are not taking into account the overall family situation of people.  They can create untold hardship and psychological damage by not trying to have a more compassionate, more understanding and more flexible attitude to people's circumstances.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction and we would like to see it extended further.  The fundamental point that I have to make to the Minister is that as long as we continue on the road that we are on at present, and have been for years, as long as we do not try to dismantle some of the systems that we have, that are outdated, cumbersome and contain delaying aspects, we will be continually coming before the House with Bills of this kind.  The parliamentary time of this and the other House, and thousands of pounds will be spent trying to do the job which could be done more simply if we had a more simplified, more decentralised system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's very clear statement on the necessity for the amendment which will eliminate undue delay.  I also welcome his statement on the work that Mr. Michael Mills has done to date.  As a retired Ombudsman from Northern Ireland I can say that the figure &mdash; 1,000 &mdash; is quite remarkable.  I could never conceive in my office dealing with 1,000 cases in the number of months that Mr. Michael Mills has been operating.  I would like my congratulations to be conveyed to him in some manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deem it as a retired Ombudsman a great privilege and honour to address Seanad Éireann on the occasion of this <Col N="25" /> debate, on the Bill affecting the Ombudsman, Mr. Mills.  Unfortunately, because of illness I was not present when the original Bill was being debated.  I had put a few notes on paper at the time, trying to set out what I should say.  I was endeavouring to say something about the Ombudsman.  Why did this happen? What kind of animal would he turn out to be?  What would he do?  What would be his relationship to Parliament?  Where was democracy?  All these questions kept floating through my head so I will address the Seanad now on that historical survey of how and why.</P>
    <P>The concept of Ombudsman is not new.  I am not talking about developments in the 19th century.  I am talking about the Roman republic in 200 to 80 B.C.  They had a censor.  He was an official to overlook other officials and their decisions.  We had a similar development about the same time in China, the Control Yuan.  They, too, had the responsibility of overlooking the work and the performances for the previous five years of officials and officialdom. Some people call it bureaucracy.  This is what they had and that was the development of the system that they found necessary.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of these institutions must remain speculative.  It is worth noting that it was found necessary to have them set up to deal with individual citizens' complaints against the Government and the rulers.  Many kinds of individual grievances may be remedied by legal process in the courts.  In the case of other grievances the individual did what he could to ventilate his grievance, using public representatives, parliamentary and local, but, for quite a number of years, there has been a growing body of opinion in democratic countries that the democratic process and the law between them are inadequate to deal with many of the grievances of the citizens.</P>
    <P>Here was the first indication that the democratic process, the parliamentary system and even the legal process, the law, were found to be inadequate so the search was on for the Ombudsmen.  That dissatisfaction is more widespread and it <Col N="26" /> is usually regarded as one of the consequences of the expansion of governmental activity.  Alongside this expansion you get this dissatisfaction and it becomes more widespread.  In complex modern societies with democratic Government there is an insistent demand for governmental activity accompanied inevitably with the broadening of the ground for grievances.</P>
    <P>The Welfare State has, quite clearly, multiplied the opportunities for individual grievances.  The political remedies inside the traditional function of parliament and the efforts of the parliamentary representatives to seek remedies for individual grievances has become less and less effective.  This may not be apparent to too many people but it is a fact.  It is one of the reasons that we have Ombudsmen all over the world.  The results can very well be injurious to the image of the administration in the eyes of the citizen and this is not a good thing.  This is unhealthy.  Widespread cynicism towards the system follows and this is bad for democracy.  It is very bad if the administration is felt by the citizens not to be just, fair and efficient.  Recourse to parliament is and remains very important, and could be more effective given the taking of certain measures towards administrative efficiency and fairness. Nevertheless, it is felt widely that remedies should be sought in a way which is less affected by the vagories of politics and of current political personalities.</P>
    <P>To Sweden goes the honour of coming up with a distinctive grievance procedure neither legal on the one hand nor political on the other, in the usual sense that we understand these terms.  In 1809 they provided for the office of Justitiekansler, in English, procurator for Civil Affairs. Ombudsman in Swedish means agent or attorney.  My own choice is simply a justice man, much like the Swedish word. The Swedish Parliament in 1809 appointed an Ombudsman whose function would be to hear complaints against Government Departments.  His duties were to supervise the observance of laws and statutes as applied by the courts and <Col N="27" /> by public officials and employees.  I may point out that the Swedish Ombudsmen have the power to prosecute.  The Ombudsmen across the water, in Northern Ireland and the local commissioners, do not have that power.</P>
    <P>We are coming to distinctive details which are all over the world, each administration producing its own ideas.  His main function has, over the years, come to be the recipient from citizens of complaints of maladministration, and the investigation of such complaints with full access to officials and their files.  That is the beginning of the power.  He has the power to meet with officials, have discussions with them about the complaint and have their files &mdash; that is very important &mdash; and, if he thinks the complaint is justified, the making of representations to the official and the Department concerned with a view to righting the wrong. I may say that today the Swedish Ombudsman rarely prosecutes.  The idea of prosecution has withered away in Sweden.</P>
    <P>The concept of Ombudsman is currently accepted over the world in civilised and democratic countries with some differences in detail &mdash; I have mentioned that &mdash; as to powers and responsibilities. Here and there you will get these differences. It is necessary to recognise the importance of the Ombudsman and I welcome what the Minister said about publicity. This is vital.  The public should know what the Ombudsman is and what he has the power to do.  I was very pleased when I read that Michael Mills had talked to a Rotary Club in Mullingar and painted the picture of the anomalous situation inside the pension field.  This is all to the good.  I congratulate the Minister for allocating funds for the purpose of letting the people know what the Ombudsman is about.  Television, radio and press should be used.  I used these in Northern Ireland and it worked.  The people have to know the powers of the office and the remedies successfully obtained in selected cases. He should be able to go to the press with selected cases as examples of how he did <Col N="28" /> his work, when he received the complaint and how long it took to process it.</P>
    <P>New Zealand was the first English speaking country to enact the appropriate legislation and the Ombudsman was set up by Act of Parliament in 1962.  Initially it was felt by the parliamentarians that the Ombudsman would, to some extent, usurp the function of parliamentary representatives. That view is not only unfounded but in fact it was discovered that the Ombudsman supplements the work of parliamentary representatives. He supplements their operations in so far as he relieves them of the tediousness and the time wasting effort in getting questions asked, in investigating Departments and in trying to right a wrong. The Ombudsman does this, therefore he supplements the work of the parliamentary representative.  Note also that he is an officer of Parliament although we know &mdash; and the whole concept is useless unless we recognise this &mdash; that he is completely and totally independent of Government.</P>
    <P>This Ombudsman legislation can be seen, therefore, as an extension of parliamentary democracy, an extension of the idea of fair play and justice.  But again I say he is a parliamentary officer, appointed by Parliament and can only be dismissed by Parliament.  This is part of the idea that the function of democratic Government is to serve the people in the interests of efficiency and fairness.  The Ombudsman, who is an officer of Parliament, fills the position admirably.</P>
    <P>In 1967 a parliamentary commissioner for administration, an Ombudsman, was appointed in London.  Following that in 1969 a similar post was set up in Northern Ireland and in addition &mdash; this brings me to the question of extending the powers of the Ombudsman in the Republic &mdash; there was set up a commissioner for complaints. I held both posts.  I am going to advocate an extension of the remit in the Republic into the whole local authority area and all public bodies.  It may well be, therefore, that you would keep the Ombudsman's office as a separate entity and formulate a new office similar to the Northern Ireland commissioner for <Col N="29" /> complaints.  I was able to do both in Northern Ireland.  You may not be able to meet that situation in the Republic, from a purely arithmetical point of view, population-wise and staff wise for the commissioner, and so on.  The purpose of the latter post &mdash; commissioner for complaints &mdash; was to investigate complaints by citizens against local authorities and other public bodies.  This was an extension of the Ombudsman concept into the local field.</P>
    <P>In the course of my work as parliamentary commissioner for administration &mdash; that is Ombudsman in the North &mdash; obviously I had to deal with civil servants, particularly up to ministerial level. Without the unstinted co-operation I received my job would have been made much more difficult.  The same applies to the local authorities and the public bodies from whom I received full co-operation and I understand that my predecessors have received the same kind of co-operation.</P>
    <P>No body or bodies equivalent to commissioner for complaints in Northern Ireland was set up in England, Scotland or Wales until 1974.  The men who were to operate as commissioners for local administration came to my office in Belfast to see how the commissioner for complaints worked at local level.  Indeed, it worked out that they were given less power than I had in Northern Ireland. Here I am coming to the idea of the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman. I have already spoken about that and I think I have said enough.  It should be extended.  The picture of fairness and justice in the administration and in the administrative field in the Republic will not be complete until you extend the remit to cover local authorities and other public bodies.  I believe there is much work to be done hearing complaints against local authorities.  That is my personal experience.  I can interpret what is in this document which was passed around.  I believe it will not be long before the extension is a fact.  I see the Minister smiling when I say that.  I would urge him <Col N="30" /> to proceed quickly.  The idea of eliminating the 21 day stay is an indication to me that something is intended.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome this Bill the main purpose of which is to speed up the procedural arrangements for amending the two schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  I believe it is vital and essential that the Ombudsman &mdash; because of the unique role and position which he has as a means of redress for the citizen &mdash; should be able to deal quickly and effectively with complaints which are made to him from the public at large.  I agree with Senator McGonagle that we owe a lot to the Scandinavian countries.  In Sweden, for example, the institution was in existence in a particular way for well over one and a half centuries.  We owe a lot also to the pioneering spirit of a great Danish parliamentary commissioner, Professor Stephen Hurwitz.</P>
      <P>It was as far back as 1644 when the poet and sometime parliamentarian, John Milton wrote:</P>
      <P>When complaints are freely heard, deeply considered and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bond of civil liberty attained that wise men look for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that context that I would like to pay tribute to the present Minister for the Public Service, Deputy John Boland, for the enthusiasm and the endeavour he has shown in promoting this concept of the parliamentary commissioner.  I join with the other speakers in paying tribute to our first Ombudsman in this country, Michael Mills, for the dedication and commitment which he has shown in dealing with the complaints of maladministration which he has received from the public at large, thereby &mdash; as has been said &mdash; supplementing the citizens' classical constitutional remedy whereby he approached his local TD, requesting that a parliamentary question should be <Col N="31" /> tabled to the appropriate Minister.  As has already been said, the success of Michael Mills as our first Ombudsman can be seen from the fact that of the 1,300 complaints he has received he has finalised over 1,000 of them, that is a success rate of 77 per cent.  Also he has proved himself to be very vigilant and conscientious.  Also, because of the way he is handling his post, he is performing a very important extra role in explaining the difficulties that public bodies face in performing their public duties.  He is helping to improve the morale, the standing and the status of our public servants. It is for these reasons, therefore, that I welcome the extension of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to local authorities, health boards and indeed to the commercial semi-State agencies.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be back to this House with appropriate proposals in the near future in this regard.</P>
    <P>I advocate that extension as a member of a local authority and as a member of a health board because I believe that the citizen who feels that he or she is a victim of maladministration at the hands of local authorities, or at the hands of health boards, should enjoy the same right to have his or her complaint independently scrutinised as that citizen already enjoys in respect of maladministration or alleged maladministration at the hands of central Government.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the UK Commissioner for Health Services in his Report of 1983, when dealing with the response to the remedies that he had advocated makes the following statement:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to record that the remedy which I regarded as appropriate was agreed in every case before the year's end.</P>
    <P>That kind of statement from a health commissioner in the United Kingdom &mdash; that all the remedies he advocated were agreed by the health boards &mdash; is an indication of how beneficial the extension of this jurisdiction to health boards and to local authorities would be.  It is for that <Col N="32" /> reason that I have pleasure in supporting this Bill and also urging upon the Minister the need to have the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman extended in the future.  I have no doubt that he will be back to the House very quickly indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I also welcome the opportunity to review briefly the operations to date of the office of the Ombudsman.  With 1,300 complaints received 1,000 of them have been finalised.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that when the proposals for the setting up of the Ombudsman were being discussed by an all-party informal committee chaired by the then Deputy Richie Ryan, the view was expressed strongly that the office should cover not only central Government administration but should be permitted to accept complaints against local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I would like to add to this list the commercial State-sponsored bodies such as the PMPA.  It may well be that it is not possible to do that at present.  I would ask the Minister to consider it in future reviews.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the changes which the Bill will bring about will make a positive contribution to the effective operation of the Ombudsman and that it will also fully involve the Oireachtas in relevant decision making in this area.  I join with the other speakers in the tributes paid to the Minister for bringing this Bill to fruition.  He introduced the original Bill, he is now back as promised with a review and I am sure he will be back in the near future when he sees the need for further reviews.  I join in the tribute paid to Mr. Michael Mills for the efficient and impartial manner in which he has carried out his duties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Ombudsman over the past 12 months.  I would like also to congratulate the Minister on the speed with which an Ombudsman was appointed.  I have waited here this afternoon to suggest to the Minister the he should act with equal speed in <Col N="33" /> extending the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman into areas which have been mentioned here.  However, the Minister has got the opinion of this House over the past hour because most speakers &mdash; if not every speaker &mdash; urged the Minister to extend the activities of the Ombudsman into the area of the local authorities and the health authorities.</P>
      <P>I do not have to give instances of how the Ombudsman could operate in these areas because I have worked for a considerable number of years with the Minister on the local authority and I know only too well of his anxiety not only to have justice done but also to have justice seen to be done.  One could not have the office of Ombudsman cover all the fields in which it is desired to have him operate. Mr. Mills has excelled himself in that office.  May I say, in congratulating Mr. Mills on his activities to-date, that today must be a sad day for him.  I would also extend to him our sympathy on the loss of many of his colleagues with whom he worked in the past.  There is no doubt he has handled his work with speed and efficiency and he has proved that his selection by the Minister leaves nothing to be desired.  The Minister could not have chosen a more worthy person to fill this office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister is considering extending his activities into further areas.  I hope that having extended them to the local authorities and the health boards, and let us hope that that will come in the very near future, the Minister will go on to consider extending his activities into private areas.  Telephones have been mentioned here and indeed I am sure there is not a public representative in the country who has not had a list of complaints regarding telephone charges.  The opinion is widespread that everybody gets a telephone bill in excess of the number of calls made. If the Ombudsman were dealing with complaints in this area I believe that many of the complaints we get would turn out to be without foundation and that many of the bills people get are the correct bills, but I have no doubt many of them are in excess of what they should <Col N="34" /> be.  It is extremely difficult for anybody, no matter how vigilant, to record, as some of us do, the calls made over a period.  We still doubt that we could have made a mistake.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the activities of the Ombudsman were extended into many other areas many of the complaints that are now floating around would dwindle away.  There are several reasons for this.  People would have the security of knowing that if they have a complaint there is somebody to whom they can turn. I have evidence in the recent past of people who have taken their complaint to their TD, have had questions asked in the House and have carried it to the full length and have eventually ended up in suicide.  That is not an exaggeration.  A certain broadcaster in the last couple of days has highlighted how we Irish tend to take the service as we get it and solve the problem ourselves, and do not make the complaints in the proper manner.  In other words, we complain to a public representative and if we get no satisfaction there there is little or no publicity given to it or no effort made by the individuals themselves.  They accept it as part of life.  I have no doubt that the appointment of Mr. Mills as Ombudsman has made a significant change in the attitude of people now making decisions at Government level, at departmental level. As his powers are extended to cover other fields it will affect areas in the health boards, local authorities and semi-State bodies.  It would be my wish to see his powers extended into the private areas as well.</P>
    <P>To highlight the great need for it in the health boards and local authority areas, I would like just to give one example that I have handled recently.  The local authority &mdash; my own local authority, on which the Minister himself served for many years &mdash; gave a planning permission which was eventually appealed to An Bord Pleanála by a neighbouring local authority because that local authority was receiving a water supply from the area in which the planning permission was given and because of the likelihood of pollution <Col N="35" /> of that water supply.  It was a very justifiable reason for appealing a planning permission. That planning permission was given to a person who had lived all his life, and his father before him and his father's father before him, in this area. He was a person who lived mainly from farming but had reason to take employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Many small farmers in my area have to supplement their income by taking a part time job for six months or three months of the year.  He was such a person.  A further planning permission was given some months later to another person who had fallen in for the land &mdash; the land was left to him by his uncle but he had never lived in the area &mdash; a piece of ground not 200 yards from where the first planning permission was granted.  In other words, it was a new family coming into the area. Despite that and despite the fact that it was even nearer to the water reservoir the second local authority did not appeal that to An Bord Pleanala.  There was a glaring case of injustice.  I could repeat these instances, not only in planning permissions but in other areas as well, over and over again.  I do not want to delay the Minister here.  I want to see him get on with this job and extend the activities of the Ombudsman into these other areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of congratulating Mr. Mills on the efficient job that he has done to date and the Minister for his foresight in selecting Mr. Mills to fill the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for the welcome which they have extended to this measure.  The House is fortunate in having amongst its Members Senator McGonagle, who has served in an analogous position to that of Ombudsman in this country.  The exposition that he gave regarding the development of the role of Ombudsman, even before it was called by that title, was particularly interesting. The House has not only debated the Bill quite fully but has taken a long and detailed look at the procedures <Col N="36" /> whereby the grievances of citizens were dealt with back to the time of Caesar's Rome.</P>
      <P>In the context of Senator McGonagle's remarks it is interesting to reflect that when the Swedish Ombudsman was first appointed one of the main purposes in that appointment was also &mdash; apart from those outlined by the Senators &mdash; to act as a policeman upon the elected Parliament and the Government of the day so as to ensure that there were neither excesses engaged in by the administration nor the wasteful spending of public moneys.</P>
      <P>That is a role which has not generally been assigned to latter day Ombudsmen or parliamentary commissioners.  In that respect I think the Swedish model probably still stands relatively alone or unusual in that aspect of its operation. Its near neighbour, Denmark, probably more closely reflects the activities of Ombudsmen in this part of the world and indeed Ombudsmen in the southern hemisphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to prosecute which also is available to the Ombudsman under the Swedish system or, indeed, as the Senator pointed out the Ombudsmen, because there are now a variety of Ombudsmen who investigate in various aspects, including the question of the defence forces in Sweden, that right to prosecute is not a right that has in general been assigned to Ombudsmen whose offices have been created in the last 30 or 40 years.  Generally speaking, particularly in relation to this country, it was right and appropriate that that assignment of the power to prosecute should not have been given to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman essentially operates on the basis of his moral authority and on the basis of his appointment by parliament and his reporting obligations to the parliament. In that respect he is an integral part and an important extension of the concept of parliamentary democracy.  Senator McGonagle outlined and developed that point very well and very thoroughly in his explanation of the Ombudsman's role.  It is, of course, central to the operation of the Ombudsman that he should have the right of access, not only to decisions made <Col N="37" /> by officials and officialdom but also to that which they hold most dear, their files.  If the papers relating to cases are not made available to an Ombudsman, he would of course be very severely restricted in his ability to pursue adequately grievances advanced to him. The Irish Ombudsman does have that right and it is a right which when he is unable to resolve cases immediately or in an informal basis can be, and is, I believe, exercised by him.</P>
    <P>We have in relation to the Civil Service instructed each Department to assign a particular officer within that Department at a senior level who acts as the liaison officer between that Department and the Ombudsman and in that respect I think the remarks made by Senator McGonagle and by other Senators are also germane to those which relate to the success of the Ombudsman's role to date.</P>
    <P>I gather that, with very little exception, the willing participation and active support of these liaison officers in each of the Departments of State have been quite marked and have contributed in no small way to the speedy resolution of many of the cases which the Ombudsman has advanced for initial examination.  Long may it be so.  I think it is important too, to public servants that they should realise that the establishment and operation of an office of Ombudsman serves in a particular way to protect them too in the proper discharge of their duties and in the image which they themselves have, that it serves as a sort of consolation to the citizen to realise that there is a court of last appeal, as it were, available and not only will complaints be fairly and impartially investigated but that when decisions are proven to have been made correctly and on good grounds the Ombudsman is in a position to verify and uphold the action of public servants in those cases also.  In general, I think it has been accepted by the Civil Service that there is nothing for public servants to fear in the establishment or operation of an office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle and other Senators spoke about the need for the <Col N="38" /> Ombudsman to advertise the existence and operation of his office extensively.  I share that concern.  I think to some extent the Ombudsman has been somewhat inhibited in this the first year of his operation in that he initially carried out his duties from temporary accommodation and he was rather anxious not to advertise that office too extensively lest the location of it became so firmly embedded in the minds of the public that they would become totally confused to discover that within two months he had departed from there.</P>
    <P>There is quite an amount of the advertising budget for this year as yet unspent but I would like to think that the Ombudsman &mdash; and I understand there are plans in train for the Ombudsman to expand on the level of advertising principally in the media now employed by him &mdash; would also begin to develop what might be called point of sale material by the production of posters and information leaflets which might be made available to community information centres and community councils and such other areas frequented by the public, such as schools, libraries and other public buildings. That would be an important part of the development of the consciousness of the general public regarding the existence of the Ombudsman office.  It is for that reason that we have established quite a reasonable budget for advertising during 1985 also.  It is in consequence of that that I gave the commitment in my introductory remarks to ensuring that in subsequent years there would be adequate moneys made available for the advertising of the existence of the Ombudsman role.</P>
    <P>I was a little taken aback at the response of one or two Senators regarding their perception of what this Bill is about, though in general I would have to say that the remarks made about the Ombudsman were generous in nature. The fact is that in order to change the remit of the Ombudsman and, as most Senators would urge, to extend that remit, it is necessary, as I explained at the outset, to make a draft order which would be laid before each House of the <Col N="39" /> Oireachtas and could not come into effect until 21 sitting days of both Houses have elapsed.  That, in turn, can lead to an inordinate delay before the order can be implemented and it prevents the carrying out of the function of the recruitment of additional staff and that staff being identified and having to leave their existing employment before they can take up duty.  So, from the time of decision to extend a remit until the Ombudsman would actually be in a position to go ahead can take a considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to set that procedure aside and to allow instead, indeed to oblige instead, the sponsoring Minister to come before each of the Houses so that each House of the Oireachtas will not only have the opportunity but the obligation, as would be happening if we were debating an extension of the remit now, to discuss and put on record their views regarding the correctness or otherwise of the extension, the size of the extension of the remit and to make a positive declaration by their acceptance or otherwise &mdash; or indeed a negative declaration &mdash; of their attitude regarding that extension of the remit.  The Houses in general do not do that at present because it is most unusual for a motion to be tabled rejecting an order laid before the House.  In that way I think the Bill represents a very positive improvement in the involvement of the Oireachtas in deciding on the extent of the Ombudsman remit.</P>
    <P>That does not alter the fact, however, that as the legislation now stands I cannot extend the remit without making an order which I would have to lay before this and the other House for 21 sitting days.  I cannot provide in a Bill which has not yet become law to extend the remit in a different fashion to what the law is at present but what I am doing now is inviting the House to agree with the Government's decision to amend the law so that I may come back to this House and the other House within the next few weeks to put positively to the Houses a motion to extend the remit of the <Col N="40" /> Ombudsman into particular areas.  This is the reason for the Bill &mdash; to enable that to happen &mdash; and it appeared, if I may say so, as gently as possible, to have been lost on Senator Hillery and to some extent Senator Smith because they both regretted the fact that within the proposed legislation an extension of remit was not advanced.  It cannot be.  What the Bill is doing is to set aside the cumbersome procedure regarding the extension of the remit so as to enable a positive procedure to take place within the next few weeks and progressively, I hope, over the years to come.</P>
    <P>Senators have in general concentrated on the concept of the extension of remit to the areas of, initially, local authorities and secondly, health boards.  There have been a number of other and some quite novel as well as interesting suggestions.  I am not in a position at this stage to inform the House categorically as to the Government's decision regarding the extent of the extension of the remit but I can say that there are specific proposals before the Government at present which will be dealt with either later this week or during next week.  Assuming the enactment of this proposed measure I would hope then to be in a position to return to both Houses within several weeks of that date and certainly well in advance of the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>It was reasonable and correct for Senator Hillery to suggest that when the Bill was being put through the Houses in 1980 the then Minister of State gave a form of commitment that the Ombudsman's remit would be extended to the areas of local authorities and health boards within three months of his taking up office. When I was establishing the office I felt it was unrealistic to expect the office to move so quickly into a wider area within such a short period of time.  One of the very important aspects of the initial office of Ombudsman is to ensure that it gains public respect and acceptability.  If the office became so overworked that its administrative procedures broke down within its first year of office it could take a considerable number of years to reestablish the confidence of the public in <Col N="41" /> the operation of the office of Ombudsman. It was for that reason that when the motion to appoint Michael Mills was being moved in this House and the other House I explained that I intended to delay the extension for the better part of the first year and come back and seek the approval of Government and both Houses to the extension at a stage when the Ombudsman indicated that he felt his office procedure had been well enough established and that he had enough grasp of the nuances of his role to be able to take on the extra work without the efficiency of the operation being called into question.  This measure before the House is the first stage in allowing that procedure to take place.</P>
    <P>I take the point that has been made by a number of Senators regarding the possibility of a wider extension of remit to the non-commercial State bodies and in certain cases &mdash; as was suggested by a number of Senators &mdash; to some of the commercial bodies, in particular the utility companies.  I am interested in the complaints voiced in this House and the other House regarding the standard of servicing provided to customers by An Bord Telecom. In response to some of the complaints made in the other House last week I outlined the degree of complaint which I knew existed in relation to An Bord Telecom.  I did that not to single out An Bord Telecom but merely in response to the reasonable criticism that had been made by Deputies and which was reechoed here today by Senators.  I was more than taken aback by the hysterical response from somebody who is apparently a public relations officer for An Bord Telecom which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> the following day.  I had suggested that in a one year period complaints regarding the telephone subscribers list amounted to some 150,000.  That is a lot of complaints.  My understanding was that only 12,000 of those had been resolved to the customers' satisfaction.  That is not a lot of satisfaction. This figure was very vigorously disputed by the Bord Telecom un-named spokesman who said &ldquo;I feel that Mr. Boland is some distance away from the <Col N="42" /> truth on that&rdquo;.  I want to reiterate the figures and tell the House that I am not any distance away from the truth and that I did not attempt to mislead the other House or this House.  In a recent 12 month period 150,000 complaints were made by subscribers regarding the telephone billing system, of which 12,000 were resolved to the subscribers' satisfaction. That is not taking into account all the complaints regarding those who would aspire to become subscribers, were telephones to be made available to them, or those who would aspire to have the telephone service provided restored to working order.</P>
    <P>According to <i>The Irish Times</i> article the Bord Telecom spokesman conceded that they had received only 137,000 complaints in the past ten months.  One need not be a mathematical genuis to establish that 137,000 complaints in a ten month period amounted to substantially more than 150,000 complaints in a 12 month period as outlined by me.  I am taken also aback to discover An Bord Telecom's suggestion that there were telephones made available on demand to everyone except those in the greater Dublin area and in Donegal and Sligo.  I would have thought that exemption entails a lot of people.</P>
    <P>An Bord Telecom are in their first year of operation and have teething problems also, but if they have, they have to understand that the public when they feel aggrieved have the right to expect a fair complaint against bureaucracy, to whatever public body or authority it is, is dealt with courteously, efficiently and in the knowledge that those who receive the complaint are operating in the service of the public.  If that standard were adhered to on all occasions then perhaps the level of complaints and the degree of customer satisfaction might improve in a marked way.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the legislation establishing An Bord Telecom for the appointment of a users council to whom complaints regarding the firm's operation could be addressed.  It is reasonable for the Government to examine and decide whether the users' council can adequately <Col N="43" /> deal with the type of complaints which are being advanced by the public and which all public representatives are aware of.  Complaints have been referred to them in large measure.  There has been &mdash; not only in the Houses but in the precincts of the Houses &mdash; considerable unhappiness expressed by the Members of the Dáil and Seanad regarding the manner in which legitimate complaints and representations made by public representatives on behalf of their constituents have been handled by a certain public body.  Any procedure that improves that situation and reminds those employed in a particular body that they are there to provide a service to the public can only be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery suggested that when the first annual report of the Ombudsman is made no time should be lost in taking steps to see that the report is fully debated in both Houses of Parliament.  I want to assure the House that it is my intention to do that.  That will provide a very useful opportunity for Deputies and Senators to examine the contents of that report and make contributions in the light of it which are more relevant to the concept of the operation of the office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris had particular complaints regarding the operation of the medical referee system under the social welfare procedure.  I would like to remind the House that as the Ombudsman's remit stands at present, as they are civil servants and carrying out basically administrative tasks the Ombudsman has the right to investigate complaints made by aggrieved parties in relation to that system.  It is well that point should be emphasised.  I would cavil with the Senator slightly when he suggests that he does not feel it correct that he as a legislator and a Member of the Oireachtas should feel obliged to refer cases to the Ombudsman in the hope that he might be able to get greater satisfaction than the Member of Parliament.  Over a period of time the office of Ombudsman will have a positive spin-off effect on the Legislature in that an increasing number of people will take their grievances directly to the <Col N="44" /> Ombudsman's office and that a greater number of members of the Oireachtas will address some of the more difficult and intractable problems of their constituents to the Ombudsman also, resulting in a greater amount of time being made available to Members of the Legislature to devote to matters of legislation.</P>
    <P>Many Senators made points regarding the need for adequate staff and facilities to be made available to the Ombudsman in the event of his remit being extended. I will deal with those points in greater detail on my return to the House in the near future.  It is not unfair to say that the imminent publication of the Public Estimates for 1985 will, if my memory does not fail me, show a percentage increase in the Vote for the Office of Ombudsman greater than that applying to any other Vote.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment received for final consideration, and passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the need for an aid programme directed towards developing countries that excludes military aid for oppressive regimes as a principle and that has no structural disadvantages for aid-receiving countries and asks the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advance this view as part of an integrated foreign policy at home, in the European Community and at the United Nations and further calls for a full report on the Irish and European Community's response to the food problems and famine in several African countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> In introducing this motion in the name of Senator Robinson and my colleagues in the Labour Party, there is no doubt in my mind that, in the nature of events which give urgency to the discussion on this motion the discussion will concentrate on the widespread famine in Africa and the commendable Irish response across a number of institutions both public, semi-public and private to resolve the food crisis.  However, the motion itself is an attempt to set these issues in a wider context.  I hoped that in so doing, I would be able to develop and bring forward the response of the Irish public which has been demonstrated so magnificently so far.  Indeed, I do not want to waste the time available to me so, I pay one single tribute to all who are responding in their different ways at levels of individual and community sacrifice to assist in combatting the problems in Africa, including an attempt in my own city to bring all the residents' associations together to collect money from every house, something that I think is taking place all over Ireland.  However, the principles of the motion are really five.</P>
    <P>First, the motion noted the need for a comprehensive development strategy. This arises for a great number of reasons. Let me say there is no tension between these general principles now and the specific problem of starving children and adults in Africa.  Many of these problems were predicted.  Many were predictable, and distinguished groups of scientists published reports predicting the problems that would arise in relation to food shortages, in relation to agricultural production capacity, in relation to the problems that would arise.  I heard Senator Killilea, at a committee meeting last evening, say that countries who have no capacity to produce food would lose their capacity to buy food and so on.  Many of the problems to which the Irish public are now responding were predictable and were predicted.  It behoves us to respond, not only to the tremendously moving accounts of the people who are dying on the African Continent, but to ask ourselves a further question as to why we did <Col N="48" /> not develop a broad general development policy.</P>
    <P>If I may give an example of what I am saying, several people came to me and commented upon how moving they found Deirdre Purcell's account of conditions in Ethiopia in the <i>Sunday Tribute</i> of 11 November 1984.  On page seven of that newspaper she describes a child dying. She said &ldquo;Manama died quietly, making no sound; her eyes closed gently; that is all.&rdquo;  People are moved, of course, by this.  It has been impressive to see the individual response.  The appropriate analogy seems to me as being the sight of the people who came out of the camps at the end of World War II.  It gave rise after a certain delay to a consideration of the issue of human rights, in other words that humanity would not sink to such a level again as to allow atrocities of this kind to be perpetrated on other human beings.  But the point that must be emphasised is that the need for these human rights pre-existed.  It existed before the camps.  We knew that many of these were predictable and indeed, as I said, distinguished groups of scientists suggested that these would happen.</P>
    <P>The second main element of the motion asks for such a broad integrated development policy to be made a central feature of foreign policy.  I want to say that the present Minister with responsibility for development aid will have the support of my party and myself in making sure that the aims of development policy be given a priority within general considerations of foreign policy.  What I had in mind in this provision was that very often issues of trade advantage are pushed in tension against development aid proposals.  Issues of more global foreign policy considerations, such as, for example, the conflict between the Eastern and Western blocs so-called, are also dragged into the equation.  What this second element argued for was that a development policy was so important in relation to the future of humanity spread across the different needs, in terms of food and survival and the development of the human personality, that it should <Col N="49" /> not allow itself to be tampered with by other considerations.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister of State for being present under great difficulty this evening to listen to this debate and I want to pay tribute to his colleague, Deputy Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in resisting the attempt to politicise, for example, the discussion on aid to Central America recently at San Jose at the end of September when it was suggested that the country Nicaragua be excluded from aid to that region.  In doing so, the Minister defended not only the integrity of our own foreign policy but the integrity of the Community's independent position in relation to aid, and deserved and has earned respect for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The other parts of the motion which I think are important are in relation to the fact that we have to develop and to establish a development policy that will be based on a historical analysis of what poverty has arisen in the world.  This means destroying the notion of there being two worlds, a world of undeveloped countries and a world of developed countries which can and do exist apart.  The fact is &mdash; and it is a matter of scholarly argument as to the degree to which it has had an effect, but as to its existence there is no doubt &mdash; that it has been the practices of the developed world which have very often created the problems of the so-called undeveloped world, even in relation to food shortages, because food shortages are not explained solely in terms of either the productive capacity or the transfer capacity of the countries with population requirements. It is also assisted by the structure of international debt, by the deterioration in the terms of trade between the industrialised countries and the non-industrialised countries, and it is also affected, in such, by the structure of international aid and the world financial institutions.  The elements that are mentioned in the motion would suggest that we develop this policy not only for ourselves but that we support it within the European Community and in <Col N="50" /> the international fora such as the United Nations and so forth.</P>
      <P>The final part of the motion dealt with asking the Minister to give an opportunity of responding, as no doubt he will, to the particular two separate problems, the food problems of the African countries and the immediate problems of famine. When I say the two separate problems the questions of the food problems of Africa have engaged the concern of a number of distinguished scientists who have looked at the effects of this &mdash; for example, the structure of soils, irrigation problems, the whole question of a hostile environment, the question of the supply of grain and so forth.  The Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, is a competent person to comment on some of these aspects as he has served on some of the international committees that have been addressed to this problem and is, in fact, a living testimony to the fact that the problems of Africa in relation to food are not certainly current and will certainly not disappear and that they were predictable and are now predictable over an unfortunately longer time span than we might have welcomed.  That is the reason that these different elements were included in this particular motion.</P>
      <P>Helen O'Neill, who has served as an adviser to the consultative committee on development co-operation, wrote some time ago in a paper entitled &ldquo;Irish Aid Performance and Policies.&rdquo; She spoke about the evolution of Irish policy in relation to the developing countries.  She spoke of the period of the fifties which included particularly missionary activity and the commitment that followed from United Nations membership.  The second stage that she identifies was the sixties, a period in which we passed into the category of a donor country.  In 1965 we became a bilateral donor on a small scale. Stage three in the seventies was the period during which our bilateral aid programme was established, and she regards 1973 as the turning point in the development of Ireland's overseas development aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that we are now moving into stage four.  As people read <Col N="51" /> of the child dying in Ethiopia and as people raise funds to be of assistance in trying to stop the deaths that are immediately observable and of which good journalism and modern technology through television have made us aware, one would like to think that now is the time for passing into a further stage of responsibility in the matter of development aid.  For that reason, I am very anxious to urge on the Minister my first immediate suggestion.  That is, given what I believe to be the wide public support for pushing forward our development policy, that it is a time for him to put to the Cabinet the suggestion that, we do not take the average performance over the last few years in relation to development aid.  For example, in Britain it had been anticipated that there would be a cut in development aid funds and then, given the response of the British public, that was revised.  I am not saying that we should copy the British in this regard but it was a good development.</P>
    <P>Far from revising downwards our agreement in the Programme for Government we should seek to reach our target in development aid as .05 per cent of gross national product each year until the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent is reached.  The proposals to revise that would, in effect, cut that by a third, or by a fourth in real terms.  Given the Irish public interest, the Irish Governmental response should be to think again in terms of reaching the target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be thanked by the world for joining the tiny group of countries who have made such a commitment. I know only two that come immediately to mind.  Norway and Holland would be the countries that have attempted to reach that target.  The position today, as we move this motion, is that the overall expenditure on aid in the world is, in fact, falling.  In the Soviet bloc and Eastern bloc countries development aid has been almost frozen.  The United States' contribution was frozen in the end <Col N="52" /> of the seventies and has been falling in the early eighties.  There has been a slight increase in the contribution of some of the Arab countries.  It would be a very fine development to take such a step and I would urge it most strongly.  I also think that it would have a moral effect within the European Community and would reflect on Ireland's Presidency of the Community.  It would create a great push towards emulating that.</P>
      <P>To take up the fundamental issues that are involved here, it is necessary to think in terms of what the situation is that we are dealing with.  I have said there is a special reference to Africa.  Today, 23 countries of Africa are affected by a food crisis.  The worst affected are Ethiopia, Mozambique, Chad and Mali.  In 1983, the United Nations estimated that one African in three, 150 million Africans, were undernourished.  Today the figure is higher.  In 1981, the average African had ten per cent less to eat than in 1970. However, this same African produced 26 per cent more food in 1982 than in 1970.</P>
      <P>We come to a number of points.  At the same time as these great shortages exist in relation to the world population, we have dislocated resources to the point at which three to four tonnes of nuclear destructive material exists for every man, woman and child on the planet.  We have created a situation in which the dislocation not only of physical resources but of intellectual resources, has two-thirds of the world's physicists, for example, involved in the production of materials which will be used for military destructive purposes. It is extraordinary that when the television cameras of the world begin showing children and other humans dying like flies, we begin to think that we can have a quick and short-term response.  It is important that it take place and that the situation be acknowledged.  It is equally important that we realise what the structural basis of that problem is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The structural basis of the problem involves ourselves.  It is rather like imagining that you can with a <Col N="53" /> stroke eliminate, for example, the buildup to the Irish famine.  Historians would tell you that we were in a position where we exported grain while people died of starvation.  The position is that African countries are exporting basic food commodities while populations are starving. It raises a number of questions that have lain dormant since the virtual neglect of the Brandt Report.  My views on these questions involve such issues as the renegotiation of the world economic order, the whole relationship between the developed world and the undeveloped.  The latter is the producer of primary commodities, the first is the major consumer of the major resources of the world, dominating the world resources and so the economic reconstruction debate is not taking place.</P>
      <P>Worse than that, the development within some of the industrialised countries &mdash; for example, the effect of the USA high interest rates &mdash; has exacerbated the debt problems of many of these poorer countries.  It has equally put a strain on the financial institutions and it has politicised financial institutions that used to give assistance.  Last night a committee of which many of us are members agreed, for example, even in aid that political considerations should not preclude the giving of urgent aid and assistance to countries.  Nevertheless, we are looking at a situation where far from there being renegotiation of the international economic order so as to redress the balance between the developed and the undeveloped world, this process came to a halt in many places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brandt Report had an appeal to two principles.  It was a moral appeal that we would assist some of the worse problems of the undeveloped world but, equally, it was an appeal to self-interest, because, it suggested that the inner problems of the developed world could be solved in some respects by developing assistance in a particular way.  In many ways, it was far from being a radical document in that regard.  It certainly was not in ideological terms a socialist document. It was built on the two principles of reconciliation between the needs of <Col N="54" /> an undeveloped world and the economic behaviour of a developed world.  Today, we are witnessing a situation where our concern has moved to one country, for example, but there are other countries that will have a situation as bad as Ethiopia or even worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Countries such as Chad and Sudan and Lesotho.  President Nyere of Tanzania once said about the World Bank that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were set up by and are still controlled by the rich nations of the world.  Whether they are now assisted in serving the purposes for which they were established I would have thought questionable.</P>
      <P>What is quite certain is that, apart from the International Development Association's subsidiary, The World Bank, they are not instruments for attacking world poverty and dependence.  The International Monetary Fund, in particular, endorses and serves the present international financial structure rather than in any way acting as a corrective for its injustices.  Further, although it is a creature of the developed nations, these hide behind the IMF when they find it convenient. They pretend that it has a special expertise and is politically neutral.  When a poor country seeks credit, it is therefore told first to reach an understanding with the IMF.  This approach must be ended and replaced by a system which will support development and not crush it as is the current deplorable case of Jamaica. Jamaica is one of the corpses to this international politicisation of the international political institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next potential corpse is, of course, the country from which I have just returned, Nicaragua, where economic destabilisation is the principal instrument of the destruction of Nicaragua, not interventions. Since January, 1982 it was precluded from all loans from the World Bank, all loans from the Inter-America Bank, it was the only country in Central America denied funds to build roads, hospitals rural clinics and so forth.  It has <Col N="55" /> 30 per cent of its export crop locked up in a war zone, totally because of the effects of the large international institutions now threatened by commercial banks &mdash; and you can move on.  In 1979, coffee cost 2½ times what it does today so it produces more.  Like some of these countries in Africa, the terms of trade go against it.  War costs were $287 million in one year and the terms of trade cost $350 million.  You wait for the country to die, you use food shortages to create internal discontent.  Therefore what I am trying to do is to make the case for a comprehensive development policy.  I am saying that that development response will have at the very beginning to set out an analysis as to how, in fact, different problems arise.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that because you are interested in the overall development strategy at global and at international regional levels and in relationships between the developed and undeveloped world, you are uninterested in the food problem, or the famine problem.  They go together.  I would argue that the establishment of the development strategy and the acceptance of some new initiative must include the renegotiation of debts, a restructuring of trade, a re-examination of the international aid agencies, a whole new set of procedures for the transfer of technical assistance and for the transfer of both short-term and medium-term food aid.  We need that kind of analysis, and I think it will mean that we accept a number of principles that we will, perhaps, be less willing to accept, and this is where the politics of it all comes in.  It is a very significant moment in the moral development of anybody when he or she moves from compassion to a sense of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been shown as being willing to give to those that we perceive to be in distress, but to be able to live as equals in a world requires a very significant moral leap forward.  It is that <Col N="56" /> that is being asked for in the suggestion of there being a broad development policy.</P>
      <P>The evidence is that the major powers in the world, by their excessive defence spending, their artificial interest rates and their trade policies which exclude the development of the undeveloped countries' economies, are unwilling to accept these principles of development.  These must find their way, in some form, into an Irish strategy with, for example, a commitment to equity, a commitment to the freedom that is integrity and the right to self-determination of these nations to solve their own problems in their own way, a commitment to democracy and the rights of countries to define democracy in their own terms.</P>
      <P>I find it unusual to be one of 400 people with 1,000 journalists following in one's train, asking whether a country that we are economically destabilising within 18 months meets our voting standards or not.  Then we all come home again and we wait for the country to be strangled to death by the international economic institutions.  That is indefensible.  To my mind, the other problems that arise would deal with respect for the countries that are seeking to undo problems of different kinds, of imperialism and of dictatorship.  Equally there would be a respect for cultural diversity, and one matter on which I am sure Senator Dooge would be so competent to speak is that in development strategies we will have to have recognition for environmental integrity.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that the behaviour of the industrial world has required the destruction, for example, of forests in some zones.  There is the whole question of the pressure we have put on people and that what we have made them sell has created massive ecological disasters in the short term and has threatened even further ones in the future.  I am thinking of the incredible position in which the earth finds itself.  It is degraining at the moment at the rate of 100 acres per minute, 50 million acres per year. Deserts are growing at the rate of 15 million acres per year and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have made the point for the <Col N="57" /> necessary extension of this wonderful concern that the Irish public have demonstrated into a political commitment, I hope we will have the courage to say that the Cabinet are placing on the agenda the matter of the return to achieving the United Nation's target in relation to development assistance and that they are doing this hoping to influence other members of the European Community and other countries in the world.  I hope they will go on from that to say that not only are we doing this, but we intend to establish, in the White Paper which will be published, a comprehensive analysis that will truthfully acknowledge the role of the developed world and the industrialised world in creating so many of the problems of the undeveloped world, so called, and of the present economic policy which has created a crisis in relation to international debt, inflexibility in relation to trade, the politicisation of aid, the obstructions on the transfer of technology and so forth.</P>
    <P>Equally, I feel that on TV screens and in photographs and written articles in the newspapers, we have been able, too, to bring forward issues of development education in a way that we were never able to do before.  People are now interested in this issue.  I know that many of the contributions from the voluntary sector, the private and the public, have come often from those who have been hurt most.  There has been an incredible generosity.  I want to impress on the Minister of State, above all, the political initiatives that are important, the political issues that will have to be faced.</P>
    <P>Within the European Community we occupy a singular role.  I have paid tribute already to the manner in which efforts to politicise the European Community in seeking to exclude a country from aid have been resisted.  I would like to hear, where political solutions are being put forward to serve as a context for the economic recovery of countries and regions, that this will be defended by this country and that we will continue to perform in the way that we have.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying this.  Much of what I have to say requires an internal <Col N="58" /> political response.  Externally the political response lies at the United Nations. It lies at the European Community in the way I have spoken about, particularly through instruments like Contadora. Very specifically, I want to ask the Minister of State to use such influence as Ireland may wield in the development, in the funding agencies, the internationally financing agencies, to seek to remove the political block that has been placed against some very necessitous countries. I am very grateful for the presence of the Minister to hear this.  Above all else, the most important point is that we must make up our minds now that we will not look simply at individuals dying in one country in one year, but that we will make a leap forward of a very significant kind into breaking the impasse that exists in renegotiating all these obstacles that will threaten &mdash; and they do threaten &mdash; regular death of so many millions of people throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion in the names of the Labour Party Senators, I, too, want to join my colleague, Senator Higgins, in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, who has joined us for the debate this afternoon.  On page 11 of the summary of <i>Building on Reality</i> it is stated under the heading &ldquo;Development Aid&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Aid for the Third World remains a priority for this country.  While we remain well short of our long-term objectives in this area, the Government have decided to continue to increase the share of GNP devoted to this purpose by 0.015 per cent per annum, thus raising this provision by 47 per cent from £34 million to £50 million by 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that that type of increase might be significant and we also realise that a certain amount is obligatory on us by our membership of the Community. While we on this side of the House do not want to decry the significance of the increase, we are saying that our base at the beginning &mdash; when we started to take into account our commitments to the <Col N="59" /> Third World, particularly in the seventies &mdash; was so low that we are not really achieving the target that we have set for ourselves and that we agreed with our partners in Government when we formed the Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I realise that other parties have a specific commitment in this area also, but the Labour Party above all &mdash; and this is written down for everybody to read &mdash; have always had a commitment in this area of development aid, which has resulted in this motion placed before the House today.  The motion notes that the need for this aid programme should be directed towards developing countries and that that would exclude military aid for oppressive regimes.  In another section of the motion we call on the Irish Government &mdash; to which the motion refers &mdash; and the European Community.  Indeed, our Presidency of the European Community is of paramount importance to us.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Higgins, I join in the tribute to both the Minister and the Minister of State for the use of that office at this moment to ensure that we have a direct response when the question of these food problems and famine in several African countries arises.  Our party's policy has been outlined in our policy statement on &ldquo;International Development Co-operation&rdquo;. There is a section that says:</P>
    <P>As a socialist party, the Labour Party sees the issue of world development as an aspect of the fundamental search for freedom and equality and that of co-operation for development as an expression of solidarity.</P>
    <P>Working here in Ireland as we are on this motion &mdash; and indeed more widely throughout the socialist international &mdash; the Labour movement are committed to the elaboration and implementation of policies which will adequately discharge our responsibilities and fully realise our political contributions in the cause of the true development of all peoples and countries.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, because of the power of the media, everybody in Ireland had <Col N="60" /> become conscious of the tragedy in Ethiopia. Because of their generosity, they have responded magnificently.  Ethiopia is just one part of what Senator Higgins has outlined as what was predicted, was predictable and has happened, is happening and is likely to happen throughout the whole Third World.  It is important that we broaden our thoughts away from Ethiopia, which is a tragedy in itself, and look at the whole Third World and what development in the Third World will mean and what responsibilities it will place on us as a developing nation ourselves and as part of the western world.  The world population between now and the end of this century is likely to increase by nearly a half &mdash; from 4.3 billion to six billion people.  The vast majority of this increase will be in the Third World.  That area is least able to provide for them.  In 1978 30 million people died from malnutrition. The majority of them were under five years of age.  Those figures have escalated since.  Television has brought this fact to our door steps.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is as high as 35 per cent of the total labour force in developing countries.  In the search for jobs migrants have ensured that urban slums double every five to seven years.  Today one-third of all the developing country town dwellers live in shanties without adequate access to minimum nutrition, safe water, health facilities, primary education, public transport or cultural facilities. These are the urban poor and their numbers are growing by approximately 15 million per year.  At present approximately 800 million in the Third World live in absolute poverty, their condition is so limited by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease and low life expectancy that it is below any rational definition of human decency.  It is imperative that we respond positively to this situation if we are to call ourselves true Christians.</P>
    <P>During the seventies this meant for hundreds of millions of people, living at the bare margin of survival, an income of £1 to £1.50 per year.  For a large number of people economic growth completely bypassed them.  Only about a quarter of <Col N="61" /> the world's population live in the industrialised countries yet they have over 80 per cent of the world's output and exports and they have 85 per cent of world armaments and consume about 87 per cent of the total world energy.  They use 78 per cent of the world's fertilisers and have more than 90 per cent of all the minerals such as aluminium and copper.  That accounts for 98 per cent of the total spending on vital research and development.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of figures that put in to context our responsibility as a small nation but one that has always shown concern for people worse off than ourselves. We lived through a period when many people glibly said that charity began at home.  Nowadays there is no longer peace of mind for those of us who sit back and let other institutions wealthier than us do more than we are doing. The point made by Senator Michael D. Higgins is that if we, as a small nation, currently having presidency of the Community, make a significant contribution, even if it means setting priorities within the terms of the <i>Building on Reality,</i> even if it means calling to our minds what demands can be made on us for the Third World, we will set an example for nations much stronger than us in the Community and in other parts of the western world.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that the Minister in his response to this motion will accept it in the spirit in which it has been placed on the agenda of the House.  I want to allow the other side of the House to contribute as well as the Minister of State but before I finish I would like to quote from Tim Bergin from a document he published called <i>Reshaping the International Order</i> in 1977 which stated:</P>
    <P>We have today about two-thirds of mankind living, if it can be called living, on less than 30 cents a day.  We have today a situation where there are about one billion illiterate people around the earth although the world has both the means and the technology to spread education.  We have nearly 70 per cent of the children of the Third World suffering from malnutrition <Col N="62" /> although the world has the resources to feed them.  We have maldistribution of the world's resources on a scale where the industrialised countries are consuming about 20 times more than the resources <i>per capita</i> of the poorer countries.  We have a situation where in the Third World millions of people toil under a broiling sun from morning until dark for miserable rewards and premature death without even discovering the reasons why.</P>
    <P>This motion is put before the Minister of State in the knowledge that it will trigger off a positive response from him and the Government in this particular area.  As a party we have made a major contribution over a number of years.  We have never been afraid to discover the facts and to put them on the record of this House and before every Socialist group in Europe and internationally.  We feel we have an obligation, irrespective of the financial restrictions, to do something. I hope that there will be an adequate response in relation to the distribution of aid in a proper structured way that will ensure that our responsibilities to those who are less well off will be met with all the human Christianity and compassion this country and the Government are capable of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely welcome the initiatives of the sponsors of this motion in providing the Seanad with an opportunity to discuss the important question of Ireland's response to the problems of developing countries. Listening to the contributions so far it appeared to me that the motion raises issues which, amongst others, I have presently under detailed consideration.  I take this opportunity to announce to this House that work on a policy paper on development is now well advanced.  I hope to be able to bring it to the Government within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House can be assured that in their general policy towards developing countries and in their aid programmes a primary objective of the Government's <Col N="63" /> approach is to foster self-sustaining for self-reliant growth in the developing countries.  Thus, for example, there is emphasis in our bilateral aid on enhancing the capacity of the developing countries concerned to undertake development programmes by assisting with institutional support and manpower development.  We also assist, as far as possible, in the development of the natural resources of the countries concerned and in the promotion of internal economic linkages so as to encourage soundly-based growth.</P>
    <P>Moreover, since the objective of development efforts is not merely aggregate growth but involves also the way in which such growth affects the lives of ordinary people, we are concerned that the development programmes with which we are associated should take place in an environment in which the benefits of growth are equitably distributed, and we are ready to assist as far as possible by encouraging and facilitating the development of such an environment.</P>
    <P>The House will, of course, already be aware that Ireland does not provide military aid to developing countries.  I nevertheless welcome the opportunity of emphasising that this will continue to be the case.  I should also like to confirm that the approach followed in our own bilateral aid programme is the one we seek to encourage on the part of the large scale multilateral programmes with which we are connected, particularly those of the Community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the motion deals with the current emergency situation in Africa and with the underlying problem of underdevelopment, for the link between the two is not always apparent. The reality is that harvest failures and adverse climatic trends do not result in famines except in underdeveloped countries.  It follows that the solution to the problem must go beyond emergency measures and must address also the long term developmental requirements of the countries concerned.  If this is not done, famines will be a recurring phenomenon, and probably to an increasing extent, at <Col N="64" /> least in sub-Saharan Africa, since the developmental prospects of that region are now particularly gloomy, irrespective of the generosity of the response of developed countries after famines have arisen.</P>
    <P>There is understandable public concern about the immediate and horrifying short-term consequences of the failure to meet the long-term development requirements of the developing world.  But we must not lose sight of the long-term objective, which is to enable countries to feed their peoples and to fend for themselves.  To maintain and extend the public understanding, when the present media attention has died down, is the fundamental challenge facing opinion-formers active in development today.</P>
    <P>The current horrific famine in Ethiopia which threatens the lives of more than six million people &mdash; about one person in five of the total population &mdash; has, with the aid of the media, focussed the world's attention on the chronic and increasing problem of food deficits in Africa.  The disastrous combination of drought, civil war, environmental degradation, population pressure and a stagnant agricultural sector has hit Ethiopia in an apocalyptic fashion, but Ethiopia is not by any means the only country to be threatened by such a deadly combination.  Neighbouring Kenya and the Sudan are also severely affected, as are 20 other countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  The food requirements of all of these countries will greatly exceed the available supply for months ahead, and as these countries simply do not have the resources to import food at market prices there will be a need for massive food aid contributions from the rest of the world &mdash; a massive 3.8 million tonnes according to recent estimates.</P>
    <P>These problems are not new; the problem of food deficits in sub-Saharan Africa has been growing apace for the past two decades, and the danger signs have already appeared on several occasions with famines triggered by climatic failures appearing within countries and regions every few years.  While Asia, though affected more by severe population pressures and urban poverty on a massive scale, has been forging ahead <Col N="65" /> with significant increases in agricultural production, especially noticeable in countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia and in South-East Asia where improved seeds and methods have yielded great benefits, Africa's agriculture, affected by poor infrastructure, bad farming methods, lack of technology and essential inputs, and insufficient expertise as well as, in many cases &mdash; and I must say this &mdash; policy neglect by governments, has been losing ground badly.</P>
    <P>Without stressing the question of policy neglect I was interested in the argument introduced by Senator Higgins in relation to the IMF.  He will understand there are two viewpoints as to how one gives a considered reaction to the IMF approach.  This approach normally consists of devaluation and encouraging an increase in agricultural prices.  It also proposes a reduction in Government expenditure. That is the normal criterion.  Is not one of the problems in Africa that there is insufficient encouragement for production by the farmers of Africa?  It is fair to say that those ingredients of a normal IMF package could and probably would have the effect of stimulating agricultural production, admittedly at a cost to the urban population.  Very often we have a situation where you have food subsidies in the towns and virtual subsistence prices for farmers.  That combination does not provide the greatest encouragement for agricultural production. I merely mention it in passing, as it is obviously a subject which requires far more detailed analysis and discussion. When I see the situation in Africa I feel there must be a greater incentive by governments for more agricultural production in that part of the world.</P>

      <P>I will come to food strategies in a moment.  Of course the agricultural sectors of some developing countries have also been adversely affected by external factors caused by, <i>inter alia,</i> the trade policies pursued by <Col N="66" /> developed countries.  Inadequate development assistance has also been a problem. Thus, it is becoming more and more evident that hunger will continue to be a characteristic of sub-Saharan Africa unless the correct measures, backed by aid from the international community, are adopted to stimulate greater food production in that region.</P>
      <P>It is not enough for the rest of the world simply to react to televised horror pictures of human catastrophes which had their origins in events which happened several months ago, the root causes of which have been present for many years.  Relief efforts are very urgently needed now, of course, and will continue to be needed for months and years to come but the situation will only begin to change through practical, long-term development assistance to the rural areas, accompanied by policies at the country and regional level which will favour increased food production and greater self-sufficiency for the rural poor.</P>
      <P>Support for these development programmes must come in the main from the multilateral agencies and the major bilateral donors of aid.  The EC has already taken significant steps in this direction through the initiation of its food strategy dialogue with a number of ACP countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community has of course also taken significant steps in response to the current emergency affecting Ethiopia and other African countries.  In April last, when it began to become apparent that an exceptionally serious crisis was developing in a number of countries in Africa, the Community adopted an emergency plan which provided 80 million ECUs in addition to the moneys provided in the budget and the Lomé Convention for emergency relief.  As time passed it became clear that the dimensions of the crisis were greater than had earlier been realised and that further actions were necessary.  For this reason, having I may say, had advice from people who had seen the situation on the ground in Ethiopia I raised the matter on behalf of Ireland at the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 September.  The Community was <Col N="67" /> ready to respond, and in the recent past additional measures have been adopted involving 32 million ECUs, equivalent to about £23 million of emergency financial aid and 100,000 tonnes of cereals valued at 25 million ECUs, equivalent to about £18 million.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no reason for complacency or self-satisfaction.  It is clear that the crisis will last for some time yet and that the requirements in a number of countries are very great.  The Community's role must, therefore, be subject to constant critical reappraisal.  The House can be assured that Ireland will play its full role in this process.  Indeed, as the House will be aware, I will be going to Africa at the end of this week to review developments on the ground both in my capacity as Minister charged with particular responsibility for development in Ireland and as President of the Council of Development Ministers with a view to assessing what further actions may be necessary.</P>
    <P>In so far as emergency financial aid from Ireland is concerned the Government have, in response to the serious food shortages and famine situations in Africa, allocated a total of £380,000 in 1984 for famine relief on this Continent. Earlier this year £30,000 was allocated from the Disaster Relief Fund through Christian Aid and the Irish Red Cross Society towards the purchase of transportation and emergency food supplies for the relief of Mozambican refugees in Zimbabwe.  A grant of £40,000 was allocated to the Disaster Appeal Committee which involves several Irish non-Governmental organisations (NGOs) and which launched an African appeal earlier this year.</P>
    <P>In view of the severity of the famine situation in Ethiopia £310,000 has been allocated from the Disaster Relief Fund in 1984 to assist famine victims in this country.  In July, £20,000 was allocated to Christian Aid towards the purchase of trucks to distribute food supplies to victims of the drought in Eritrea and Tigre.  Concern also received £20,000 to finance their emergency relief <Col N="68" /> programme which operates feeding centres in Wollyata, in the Sidamo region of Southern Ethiopia.  In September of this year, a grant of £20,000 was allocated to the Third World Self-Help Development Organisation towards the cost of shipping containers of food and other emergency supplies to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>On 25 October, in response to the deteriorating situation in Ethiopia, an additional £250,000 was transferred to the Disaster Relief Fund from other aid subheads.  In view of the tremendous response of the public to the various appeals made on behalf of the famine stricken people of Ethiopia, these funds are being used mainly to cover the costs of transporting emergency supplies procured by various organisations to this afflicted country.</P>
    <P>Approximately £45,000 was allocated to cover the cost of an airlift of 22 tonnes of emergency supplies organised by GOAL which left Dublin for Addis Ababa on 8 November.  The Government have also been closely involved with the arrangements for two airlifts of emergency supplies sponsored by Guinness Peat Aviation, the first of which left Dublin on 31 October, 1984 and the second yesterday.  In addition, the Government have had discussions with various non-Governmental organisations which will be involved in shipping to Ethiopia up to 1,500 tonnes of emergency supplies, including building materials, transportation, medical supplies, blankets, clothing and up to 750 tonnes of grain.  The shipment will leave Dublin towards the end of this month and will be co-ordinated by Concern in co-operation with the other agencies involved mainly the Irish Farmers Association, Gorta, Action Aid, The Third World Self-Help Development Organisation and the Irish African Friendship Society.  The cost of the shipment will be met by the Government and additional funds will be allocated to cover some of the costs of co-ordinating the distribution of the supplies in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>These funds provided by the Government are, of course, additional to the amounts very generously subscribed by <Col N="69" /> the public to the Irish NGOs.  It is not possible at this stage to provide an estimate of the amounts concerned as money is still pouring in but it certainly can be taken that the amount is very considerable indeed.  I should, therefore, like to avail of this opportunity of saying how proud I am of the generosity of the public and of the invaluable role played by the non-Governmental organisations, the relief organisations and the other bodies who have tried to help in every way they can in meeting this crisis.</P>
    <P>In our bilateral aid programme we have been conscious of the need to provide assistance to our principal partner countries. These are, of course, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia in the agricultural sector, which in each of these countries is weak enough, though, at least in the case of some, if not all, capable of great potential.  About 25 per cent of our bilateral aid goes to agriculture.  We are ourselves a food-producing country, though this in itself, while it makes us conscious of the need to promote agriculture and rural development, does not automatically give us the resources or know-how to solve the problems of African countries which are very different climatically, ecologically and otherwise to our own.  One particular sector in which we have an advantage, dairying, is not suitable for every area of Africa, but we have attempted to put our know-how in this sector to good use in projects in the Sudan, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, while in Lesotho and the Sudan we have made use of our strength in developing producer and marketing co-operatives in agricultural development schemes using extension services and expert advice to improve production of crops and forage.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the long-term problems inhibiting improvement of food production in Africa be studied, and improved methods of land-use and technology developed to overcome these.  For this reason pilot projects and agricultural research are very important especially since the improvements in Asia can largely be attributed to break-throughs applied in a widespread manner.  We are supporting a number of schemes of this <Col N="70" /> nature.  One such notable scheme in Africa is a highland dairy research programme with the International Livestock Centre in Africa based in Ethiopia. We are also supporting applied research programmes designed to effect improvements in the production of potatoes, maize and wheat in other international research centres in which Irish scientists or technologists are working on programmes designed to assist the countries of the Third World.  Water is often the key not only to agricultural improvement, but to health and control of the environment. Through training programmes both here in Ireland and in Tanzania, as well as in research projects to be undertaken in a number of developing countries, we are assisting developing countries to become able to manage their own water resources.</P>
    <P>There is much more that we could do in-this area, utilising both our own national resources of willing personnel, experience, and know-how and combining our efforts with the major aid agencies and the increases in our bilateral aid programme which will be permitted by an expanded official development assistance contribution provided for in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality</i> will be put to use in this direction.</P>
    <P>The House will be already aware that our aid figure has increased considerably in recent years.  I recall that in 1981, when I first took up my appointment, the figure was £18.8 million.  It is this year £34 million. In accordance with the national plan it will grow to about £50 million in 1987. It goes without saying &mdash; I have never hidden the fact &mdash; that my personal preference would be for greater increases. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to record some degree of satisfaction with the increases achieved and provided for against a background of international trends that show stagnating and even decreasing development assistance by donors generally.</P>

      <P>The figure has grown from £18 million in 1981 to £50 million in 1987.  I have never made a secret of the fact that I wish for more.  This is a progression from which we can take some satisfaction.  This expanded programme will also include increased encouragement for, and collaboration with, the voluntary agencies such as Trocaire, Concern and Gorta who are active, especially at village level in the rural areas, in attacking the manifestations of poverty and rural stagnation, through schemes for co-financing of small-scale projects and sponsorship of volunteer personnel &mdash; agriculturalists, engineers, doctors, nurses and teachers.</P>
      <P>I never fail to take the opportunity of pointing out my particular interest in the area of co-financing.  It is an area which I have had the opportunity of increasing support for over the years.  I should like to make it clear that it is my intention, as far as I can, to continue this increase in the co-financing area.  The work that can be done at local level reaching the poorest of the poor under the schemes undertaken by the voluntary agencies, by our missionaries and by the other people with whom we work with on a co-financing basis, is incredibly good and is absolutely cost effective.  The effect of the efforts of our dedicated and competent Irish personnel, whether expert consultants or managers or volunteer community workers or educators, can be enormous in transforming the potential for development of an area or an enterprise.  Technical assistance &mdash; the transfer of capability through expert help and training &mdash; will continue to be the central element in our programmes to help the developing countries to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be true to assume that the African countries are not themselves very conscious of the need to improve the food situation within their countries in the long term.  One very positive example of this is the priority given to food security programmes in the context of the Southern African Development Conference, an internationally-supported mutual self-help grouping consisting of nine countries <Col N="72" /> of Eastern and Southern Africa, including three of our priority countries.  Ireland has already begun to assist one SADCC project in the food security sector which involves the drawing up of a detailed inventory of the agricultural resource base in the region.  During the SADCC conference which took place in Lusaka last spring, I pledged Irish support for the SADCC food security programme, which will provide a basis for rectifying the chronic problem of food deficits in that region.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate note on which to conclude by emphasising again that the objective of Ireland's development policy is to reinforce the efforts of developing countries to bring about their own development. There is not a strategic objective except to the extent that development in the Third World is helpful to the maintenance of international peace and stability. The overriding consideration at all times is the requirement of the developing countries concerned rather than any political considerations.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of aid provided the main criterion is that it should be genuinely helpful to the countries concerned. This means, <i>inter alia</i>, that the underlying causes of underdevelopment must be addressed as well as its symptoms such as famines.  The Government are hopeful that the public will appreciate the need for attention to the problem at both of these levels and that support will be forthcoming for appropriate programmes towards this end.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, earlier today when I first saw this particular <Col N="73" /> motion on the agenda for the debate this evening I remarked at first reading that I thought it was couched in very convoluted phraseology and I thought simple wording would have been far better. However, after listening to Senator Michael D. Higgins's wonderful contribution this evening I now completely understand the reasons why this phraseology has been used.  As spokesman for Fianna Fáil I must lend my support in one broad statement and say that we appreciate and compliment all the organisations, from the largest to the smallest, the school-children who stood on cold evenings at road junctions to gather money, in order to make the Irish contribution to the Ethiopian famine project such a success.</P>
      <P>Wonderful work was done by all of them, including the small school-children who lent their support in a most fantastic manner.  I must also compliment the Minister present here this evening on his own rapid action in arranging and getting out the first air flight to Ethiopia.  It was indeed an example of the Irish attitude to such a situation.  Listening to the debate this evening I think we must now harness this goodwill and anxiety of the Irish people to make a contribution to the underdeveloped world.  Over the years we have helped in many spheres, in education and missionary work.  We all remember putting pennies in the black baby box.  Little did we understand then the reasons why that was necessary but now we do.  The Irish people have given tremendous encouragement now to the Government and to the Minister here this evening in particular to harness this goodwill and to bring it to a very fruitful conclusion.  It would be preposterous of any Minister not to harness it, and I think that the onus lies upon him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate and accept the Leader of the House's goodwill towards us to have a very broad debate on this issue as early as possible in January.  I would like to impress upon the Minister that we would like the earliest opportunity in January to have a very broad debate on this issue, because this motion this evening confines us in time but most importantly to the <Col N="74" /> specifics enshrined in it.  The point raised by Senator Michael Higgins about a comprehensive development policy as item I on this agenda arising out of this motion is particularly important.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, did not respond more positively to that request.  I am sure that after digesting the speeches he will probably put it together a bit better for us in January at the broader debate.</P>
    <P>This matter is not new to us.  I have been privileged to have been a member of the Council of Europe and we have debated this question of famine relief, of relief in general and of a comprehensive policy towards this relief by not alone the ten nations of Europe but the 21 nations of Europe enshrined within the Council of Europe.  We discussed last April, which is a long time ago now, that we should have a comprehensive policy on development in relation to Ethiopia.  We are not in the arms race, as the Minister rightly said, and we eliminate that straight away so then we get down to the development policy.  I was on the Council of Europe Agricultural Committee. When discussing surpluses we agreed that the development policy should be divided into two different areas, that is the outer Sahara regions of Sudan and Ethiopia and Chad and all the other nations mentioned, and that there were some which needed educational and development policy.  I agree there are some which are incapable of ever growing their own food.</P>
    <P>At our joint committee meeting yesterday evening I brought that issue up again and I want to reiterate it here now.  Predictions can and must be made as a fundamental basis for any constructive policy that we want to bring forward in the areas of development and education and while we can play a role there I do not think it is the one to which we should turn our attention, but rather take it from the other hand.  There are those misfortunate nations who for geographical reasons and for reasons of rains and waters and growth problems are not able to produce their own food.  We should decide now on exactly who they are.  We should face the fact that for the foreseeable future, <Col N="75" /> for at least 100 years, they will not be self-sufficient in food.  We would be as well off now to state this and produce food in this country or indeed in any other country that wishes and give it to them, because it is unrealistic to ask them to try, at an unreasonable cost, to produce food that obviously is not a balanced ration and at the end of the day it is so costly for them to produce that their efforts would probably be better directed in another way.  If we are going to set up a comprehensive development policy we must look at the fundamentals first.  We could talk for ever here about it.</P>
    <P>There are countries, of course, and Ethiopia is one of them, where if a proper development and educational policy were brought to those regions, they could produce food in greater quantities and with a far higher protein content and more suitable to the digestive systems of the people of those nations.  In the other ones, and I specifically speak about Sudan, I think it is ridiculous for us to waste money, time and energy in asking them to grow a crop which is impossible for their climatic conditions to produce. Ireland is a nation which has I think the greatest surpluses of food and the ability to produce even more surpluses of food than any other nation in Europe.  All we have to do is look at the situation in regard to the surpluses in milk, in cheese, in beef, in lamb, in potatoes and in grain where this year we have had a bumper crop and an excess quantity of it.  We can look at sugar and the products of sugar and the protein power of sugar.  We are now in the situation where we have an excess sugar production.  One would not believe it two or three years ago when there were many motions in this House regarding, for example, the situation appertaining in my district and the district of Senator Michael Higgins where we were unable to get the raw material to produce enough sugar.  Now we are oversupplied. That over-supply should be harnessed.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would look at this aspect of it in view of this nation being so capable of producing <Col N="76" /> surpluses.  It is not often I compliment the media but I must compliment the media on this occasion on the manner in which they brought to our attention the horrifying situation in Ethiopia.  It was a BBC programme which first highlighted it, but our own national press have helped in every way to appeal to the generosity of the Irish people and to explain to them the difficult circumstances that prevail there.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain to the media the complications of our situation as regards surpluses and the manner in which the EC could release the food mountain in intervention.  There seems to be an enormous amount of red tape and an enormous cost included in the release of food in intervention which would relieve the famine in Ethiopia.  Further investigation should be made by us as Parliamentarians and as responsible elected representatives to encourage the EC to find some way to release this food.  It is a horrendous situation where we have mountains of butter, beef and milk decaying in stores throughout Europe and the people of Africa dying of hunger.  A complicated system is in operation where we cannot release some of the food.</P>
    <P>We have, as a nation, a role to play.  I would like to take up a point made by Senator Michael Higgins about Nicaragua and the economic destabilisation of that country.  There may be political overtones in what the IMF are doing in Nicaragua. I do not know much about it.  But I know of another situation familiar in its economic destabilisation programme but unfamiliar from the political point of view.  I am speaking of Turkey where the opposite is happening.  There is an economic destabilisation programme going on there for political reasons. Efforts to destabilise there are being pushed strongly by the friends of Russia, of Iran and Iraq and the kindly neighbours they have.</P>
    <P>After a recent earthquake in that country we have seen the poverty there where the mud houses fell on top of people and suffocated them even though the earthquake was so weak we would not even feel it in this country.  There is <Col N="77" /> poverty and destabilisation going on throughout the world.  Senator Michael Higgins put his case on Nicaragua very eloquently.  If one could have the same time as he had one could make it about other nations too.  We in the Common Market and in the Presidency of the EC at this time should move to stop this destabilisation immaterial of whether they are Marxists, whether they are extreme right, whether they are communists or whether they are extreme conservatives. The Irish people should take into account the suffering of human beings.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening at our joint meeting of the aid and development committee we made a unanimous decision that immaterial of who the government of the particular country were, if there was such extreme hardship to people, we should directly get the aid to them.  That was a wonderful decision by the joint committee, and it has laid down the foundations of what the Irish people should do.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the joint committee, I requested yesterday, and I do not know whether it is outside the terms of reference of it, that when we sit down to talk about a new comprehensive development policy we should have from now on deliberations with comparable committees in the EC and in the Council of Europe so that they can get our opinion and we can get theirs.  We should be working towards that.  We are talking about elected representatives of three different Parliaments. There should be some cohesion between them.</P>
    <P>While I might not agree with Senator Michael Higgins' basic political philosophy, as regards his contribution not alone to the debate here this evening but his contribution for many months and years towards such motions as this one, he is a remarkable man.  His contributions have always been remarkable.  It is fitting that a man who has tried to do so much to help down-trodden people should be complimented and I should like to do so now.</P>

      <P>I am happy to support this motion which was put down by the Labour Party group.  It asks us to do three <Col N="78" /> things.  It asks us to take three attitudes in relation to aid.  It asks us to advocate a policy towards developing countries that excludes military aid for oppressive regimes. It asks us to support, at home and internationally, policies towards developing countries that do not involve structural disadvantages for them and it calls for a statement in regard to the present famine in Africa.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to support this motion on all three of these grounds. The motion says that aid programmes directed towards developing countries should exclude military aid for oppressive regimes as a principle.  I believe they should exclude military aid <i>simpliciter</i> and that what may be a benign regime today can become an oppressive regime tomorrow and what appears to be a country firmly founded in democracy today can have its government overturned tomorrow. The only safe policy in regard to development aid is that military aid should be excluded.  I am happy that this has always been the attitude of Irish Governments and I am happy that here this evening the Minister of State has given a guarantee that that will continue to be our policy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question that aid should not involve structural disadvantages for the receipient country, we in this country have nothing to be ashamed of. Our development aid has been disinterested in contrast to the development aid of some countries of the developed world.  Aid, if is it really to be of assistance, must be positive aid in the fullest sense of the word.  It must be aid that promotes self-sustaining development. Not only should this happen but it should be aid of such a type that it does not create any artificial demand for nonessential goods or any similar effect.  Our record is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea suggested that the Minister of State had not responded to the request from Senator Michael Higgins, the proposer of the motion, for a statement in regard to a comprehensive aid policy.  The Minister of State did mention that a policy paper on development is now well advanced.  An indication was <Col N="79" /> given that the request from Senator Michael Higgins for a statement on comprehensive strategy will be met in the policy document.  All of us, and I am sure Senator Higgins would agree, while we would like to see this document as early as possible, we want to see it fully worked out.  We want to see a development policy that has been fully worked out.  We look forward to this policy paper.  We would all be glad if that policy paper were available before we have our debate early in the New Year.  This would make an excellent background to the more general debate which we intend to hold.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position in Africa, we must thank the Minister of State for the good description he has given us of the efforts being made, both governmentally and non-governmentally in regard to our reaction to the situation in Africa and in Ethiopia in particular.  I would like to reecho what he said about the necessity for a sustained effort, of the necessity after this disaster has been replaced on the television screens by other disasters and later when the peak of this disaster is over, not to forget the plight of Ethiopia and the plight of other countries in Africa.  We should all give support to the continuing efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The problem that now afflicts Africa is fundamentally a problem that is going to continue to afflict Africa.  The problem of drought in Africa will not be solved either by doctors making rain dances or by highly commercial gentlemen guaranteeing that they can produce rain for a considerable sum of money.  Both those approaches will not lead anywhere. Almost half the land of Africa is limited in its production potential for agriculture by recurring drought.  This is a situation that cannot be changed.  Africa has almost as much rainfall as Europe.  The rainfall in Africa is approximately 90 per cent of that in Europe.  Because of its situation, the evaporation in Africa is much greater.  Consequently the amount of water available as run off in Africa is less than half of that in Europe.  Therefore, Africa faces a continual problem in regard to water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> The present severe condition has resulted from a number of factors.  The Minister pointed these out in his intervention here this evening.  There is no need for me to repeat them.  But one of the problems which has faced Africa in the drought years of the early eighties has been the failure of agricultural production, even to keep pace with the population rise in Africa.  Throughout the seventies the amount of food produced in Africa per head fell by 10 per cent. Africa came into the eighties on a declining agricultural production.  The cultivated land in some countries in Africa in the last few years has fallen to half its previous value.  The herds in many African countries has fallen to one-third.  In Mozambique it is said that over 100,000 cattle have died.</P>
    <P>Our reaction to this &mdash; and a very proper reaction &mdash; is to send immediate short-term relief.  But we must do more. We must do more in the medium and longer term.  In this regard I want to indicate that the African people would wish that we in the developing countries would take this longer-term attitude.  The Economic Commission for Africa, a U.N. organisation, comprising all the African states, has itself drawn up a Plan of Action in regard to drought.  I was privileged to have taken part in preparatory meetings and in the final meeting in Addis Ababa at which this Plan of Action was drawn up.  I would like to quote something said in that Plan of Action in regard to short-term relief.  It said that relief is necessary in the short term, for 1984 and 1985.  But they ask for relief in such a form and I quote:</P>
    <P>Not to be such that it would act as a disincentive to local production when this becomes possible.</P>
    <P>So what Africa is asking for is immediate aid.  But it asks for something else as well. It asks that we should, in the immediate post-emergency period, continue by providing seed, fertilizer, tools, vaccines, so that local production can be revitalised. Africa does not want to live on charity.  Africa wants to stand on its own feet.  Our job is to help them to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> One of the problems in regard to this question of trying to avoid what has happened is the establishment &mdash; again this is part of the African Plan of Action &mdash; of early warning systems.  We now have famine in many parts of Africa, but this is the end of a long chain, the chain of meteorological drought, followed by hydrological drought, followed by the agricultural drought which results in the loss of harvests.  One of the tragedies of Africa today, and of previous disaster areas, is that international aid has not been initiated soon enough.  International interest has not been aroused until we reached the situation of crop failure and human starvation.  One of the things that the African countries are trying to do and that we must help them to do, is to establish proper early warning systems. One of the tragedies of the past three or four years in Africa is that in their attempts to provide relief nationally and to find funds elsewhere to do this, one of the things that has suffered has been their national climate stations.  We find that the data which could establish these early warning systems have been run down as an economy measure.  Africa has now seen the error of that and is prepared to take the longer view.</P>
    <P>In the medium term we must help to produce improvements in agricultural policy.  We must help in the development of conservation policies, we must help in regard to data collection and research. We must help the African countries in their manpower, planning and development.</P>
    <P>Here again it is quite clear from the account the Minister has given us that we have a good record in this, that already our own development programme is taking a medium-term view.  The projects which are being supported governmentally or by our non-governmental organisations and the projects in which the Minister takes a special interest, those which are co-financed, have been projects well selected and well designed to promote self-help by the Africans.  In education and training we have also done our part.  I personally am very happy to <Col N="82" /> be associated with the programme in University College, Galway, for the training of people in engineering hydrology, where every year 20 to 25 students from developing countries are trained.</P>
    <P>In the longer term we must also be able to help.  Here there are already signs that the African countries are realising that all of their national planning must be adapted.  Our national planning must also be adapted so that we can help them.  Let us not stint ourselves in regard to the immediate aid which is so desperately needed but let us not stop at that.  Let us go beyond that.  It is not possible to draw on the generosity of people year after year to the extent that they have responded in recent weeks and months. I think the Government must on their behalf make a contribution as large as they can to the medium-term and the long-term development because if this is not done Africa will not be helped to help herself.  The African countries and the African region are prepared to do this but they can only do that with our help. If we do not make the response in this regard then what we have seen on our screens in recent weeks and what has affected us so much will recur.  There is absolutely no doubt that the drought will recur in Africa.  It is our job in combination with the peoples of Africa themselves to ensure that the recurrence of drought does not necessarily mean also the recurrence of famine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion and I certainly welcome the Minister of State's reassurances on the positive approach not only of his own Department and our Government but of the EC as well.  It is heartening to find that in our own country, once our people were awakened to the horror of the present crisis they have responded so generously to the very many appeals that were made on behalf of various agencies working in Africa and especially in Ethiopia. It is true to say that of the 52 African countries almost half of them are having difficulties in feeding their own population at present.  We must remember that when we look at the make-up of the <Col N="83" /> governments in the various countries we are inclined as Irish people and Europeans, to look at them and to compare them as though they were Europeans and that they had the same opportunities as we and other European countries had. This is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as 1973 I had the opportunity of working as a member of the old Assembly of the Associated African States in Madagascar.  It was the forerunner of the ACP and that was established in 1969.  At the first meeting I attended as a Member of the European Parliament the problem of famine in Ethiopia was high on the agenda.  Over the years there have been difficulties in feeding populations in many of the African countries.  I remember while serving on the Commission for Development and Aid coming up against the problem, for example, of Uganda when that African country, having as leader President Amin &mdash; who by any standards was obnoxious to civilised people &mdash; and whether or not the Community should aid people there despite the fact that the Government and the leadership were completely at variance with thoughts that we might have had.  That is one of the problems of Africa.  I would like to make a special appeal to the Minister of State this evening to have a special regard for the country of Chad, definitely one of the poorest countries in Africa.  It has less control over its own affairs because it is landlocked and in addition its surrounding neighbours, Libya, Sudan, the Central African Republic, Niger, the Cameroons &mdash; almost all of them have closed their borders.  Here you have an absolutely undeveloped country.  They have had famine in their mountainous districts for very many years.  There is no hope of getting aid to them.  From our point of view one of the difficulties in meeting the representatives of Chad is that it is a Francophobe country but nevertheless they always appear to me as being very quiet, moderate people, but obviously in Africa the situation is that people have no great regard for what happens outside; they are all preoccupied <Col N="84" /> with the problems within their own borders, and if people are starving across the border it does not appear to be of any great import to another country.</P>
    <P>I was horrified last night listening to an interview on the BBC to hear an African minister denying to a BBC correspondent that there was any difficulty or crisis in his country.  This is indicative of the problems that face the EEC and indeed all agencies that strive to help in situations like this where the government do not want to know, where people, especially those who form nomadic tribes are very often not looked on as being part of the responsibility of government as we recognise governments and look on governments.  I would hope that the Minister and especially the EEC would endeavour to find a way of surmounting that problem.  It is important, as Senator Dooge has said, that we must not just respond to a crisis at the height of a crisis but we must certainly assist the development of as many underdeveloped countries as possible so as to assist them to provide food and shelter for their own population.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to say that so many people throughout the country continually ask why the EC cannot use up their mountains of surplus foods such as milk, butter, beef, grain, wine and so on.  The Minister did not mention this in his speech, but nevertheless in the EC Developmental Aid originally in this years' budget provided in excess of £3 billion for development through the ACP.  The Minister did indicate the additional sums that were provided. It is difficult to monitor exactly how much that would do when you look at a crisis.  Nevertheless, the kind of investment in the development of the infrastructures that all of the undeveloped countries require must be an ongoing process.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to people not just to respond in the generous fashion in which they are responding to the present crisis, as from an Irish point of view in Ethiopia, but to have it as an ongoing contribution to the wonderful organisations and religious communities that have over the <Col N="85" /> years done so much to relieve suffering and hardship.  I would like to pay a compliment to Fathers Michael and Kevin Doheny whose film clip on the BBC triggered the chain of events that has awakened the conscience of not only this country but the UK and America. Those missionaries have spent a quarter of a centurey working and living in those conditions.  Father Doherty returned to Ethiopia last month, but in September he told me of the horror of the situation that is in Ethiopia at the present time.  He&mdash;&mdash; present time.  He&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue.  He was counting the days until his film could be processed and shown so as to get more people into the effort of bringing some relief.  I know that these agencies on their own cannot fully ease the horror that is in Ethiopia.  Senator Higgins in one of these fine speeches stressed and advocated more aid for economic recovery.  I do not wish to correct the Senator but the emphasis I believe must be a gigantic one, a gigantic effort to introduce effective planning and technology to organise in some way food resources for the rising population in all the underdeveloped countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in increasing, as they have, the development aid budget, on the last occasion had the opportunity to take the right road.  A higher percentage of the moneys that are allocated this year should be channelled if at all possible through our voluntary organisations, whether it be Concern, Oxfam, Christian Aid or various missionary houses.  Moneys handed to a missionary here returning to one of the developing countries for a project, whether it is a Cheshire-type home or it is a co-operative to develop agricultural industry or towards a school, will go in total towards the development of the project that the organiser or voluntary worker or missionary has in mind.  I <Col N="86" /> would ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, in whom I have the utmost confidence, to allocate a greater percentage out of our resources during the coming year to that side of his policy.  It is very difficult for us to visualise the horror of the situation in Africa.  Senator Dooge has given the House the benefit of his tremendous experience of the situation from his view of the climatic conditions, the problem of providing proper infrastructural facilities, and the hydrology. It is difficult for us to visualise the situation where we have so many eggs in the basket whereas most of the African countries are a one-crop economy or a one-item economy.  If that fails it affects the entire economy of the country.  While the ACP through their ordinary policies have endeavoured to ease the position in quite a number of situations by controlling the price of sugar or whatever, nevertheless it is difficult to visualise the impact especially if you have more than one element, such as a drop in the price on the international market coupled with a weather dimension.  This is bringing great hardship on these people.  I should just pay tribute to and be associated with the people who have been so unselfish in their efforts to do what they can do to help to alleviate the situation in Africa. We should gear ourselves to thinking of an ongoing contribution to the development of the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robb and myself introduced a multi-faceted motion on neutrality some months ago, and in some ways this motion contains so much on so many different issues that even in the ten minutes or 15 that I have, one could actually end up talking about one issue and still go on forever.  The basic principle that needs to be reiterated again and again on this whole area of aid programmes towards development is that, first of all, we are not talking about some sort of charitable munificence on our own behalf to other people.  We are not talking about us feeling obsessed or perturbed or concerned because that great big body of the world out there does not have sufficient resources to live or to develop or to live <Col N="87" /> with even the standards basic dignity requires.  We are talking about the fact that there is a fundamental structural injustice in the way the world economic order has developed.</P>
      <P>That structural injustice has a number of manifestations, the first being the change for the worse in the terms of trade of the last ten years, particularly represented in the change in the terms of trade for energy but in many other concerns as well, and the fact that the prices of most basic commodities produced by developing countries have dropped dramatically in real terms or particularly in terms of their capacity to purchase the necessary technology and technologically-related goods that they need for their own development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the price of so many of their basic products has dropped has fundamentally shifted and increased the burden on developing countries. Secondly, the escalation in the value of the dollar, which is a major currency for international lending, and the frighteningly high level of international interest rates has imposed another burden over and beyond the burden that already existed on developing countries.  Thirdly, there is the existence of various protective tariffs and devices, particularly in the area of primary products and of food.  We have to say &mdash; it is neither politically wise nor politically practicable to say too much, nevertheless it would be dishonest not to &mdash; that among the major obstacles to the development of the production of food and of commodities for export is the Common Agricultural Policy. There are products &mdash; particularly sugar &mdash; that many developing countries can produce at a price way below the price at which they can be produced within the European Community but which we, by the structures of protection for agricultural production in the European Community, prevent them from developing, apart from political considerations which have excluded a major sugar producer like Cuba from the closest market to it. There are economic and tariff structures <Col N="88" /> which have discriminated against developing countries.</P>
    <P>All of these things are not some sort of accidents of a great big free market out there.  They are the collective decisions of those who have benefited most from the inequalities in world trade and the inequality in the distribution of resources and power.  They are those of us who have the good fortune to live in the developed world.  It is one of the most unfortunate characteristics of western society as it has developed in recent times &mdash; and a characteristic that still continues notwithstanding the recent recession &mdash; that we describe ourselves as a world of increasing affluence.  It is a very small part of the world that has increasing affluence.  It is this proportionately decreasing minority who make up the developed West and a large part of the developed Eastern European States that are actually the affluent world.  It is arguable that a considerable part of our affluence is not based &mdash; as we like to pretend &mdash; on our own ingenuity or our own hard work or our own capacity to produce efficiently or anything like that.  It is based on the fact that we got there first and once we got there we took all the necessary steps to prevent anybody else getting there too, in terms of the way we define the terms of trade, in the way we have controlled the allocation of resources and in particular in the way we have protected our own interests all over.  That is the underlying structural problem as most people would see it.</P>
    <P>Proceeding from there, we look at what we can do about it.  We can and we should give substantial aid.  It is very welcome that this motion does identify the need to have a careful look at what aid is for and what aid does.  Indeed, it is one of the criticisms that has been directed against the Department of Foreign Affairs Report on Overseas Development Aid and that the criteria by which the success of various programmes of aid are judged are far from clear.  There are references all through the ODA report on how successful things have been, on the progress that has been made and similar things.  But nowhere within that report <Col N="89" /> do you have the kind of yardsticks by which those judgments are made.  All the way through it is perception by the authors of the report without any objective criteria by which I or any other body could assess the success of those projects, criteria which would be susceptible to some sort of objective analysis, which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>That is a simple criticism.  A much more fundamental criticism is the fact that we have, as a community &mdash; all of us bear some responsibility &mdash; backed away from even the most minimal of commitment to development aid.  Despite the extraordinarily low target of 0.7 per cent that the United Nations has set as the proportion of GNP to be devoted to development aid only a small number of countries have achieved that level of aid. We are not one of those countries and we are nowhere near becoming one of those countries.  While I understand that the pressures of Government can bring about re-assessment of various priorities I think it is regrettable that both the present Government and its predecessor found it necessary to identify overseas development aid as one of the categories for cutbacks.  As is identified, and as has been identified on a number of occasions, the total body of overseas development aid involves both multilateral and bilateral aid.  The argument has been made very often that we do not deserve much credit for a large part of our multilateral aid because we have no option but to cough up that money because it is part of our international commitments.  The only really discretionary element in our overseas development aid is our bilateral aid.</P>
    <P>The motion identifies that aid should exclude military aid for oppressive regimes as a principle.  I would take the view that the whole concept of aid programmes directed towards developing countries should exclude military aid to all regimes.  There is a moral choice involved here.  I cannot accept that there is some overwhelming economic need on the part of the Western and the Eastern European countries and on North America which makes us accept the concept of military aid as being in some way beneficial to <Col N="90" /> Third World countries.  It was during Senator Dooge's period as Minister for Foreign Affairs that he very promptly reminded me that part of the problem of the armaments race was the responsibility of developing countries themselves and their apparent willingness to spend enormous sums on armaments.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the world is coming close now to spending in the order of one million million dollars a year on armaments. Two years ago it was in the order of $650,000 million.  I presume by now it is close to $800,000 million and one has to assume that in a couple of years it will be up to that staggering figure of one million million dollars per year being spent on armaments.  It is the least adverted to but the most fundamental of all moral choices for the community at large, whether it is prepared to address realistically this problem of armaments development.  The problem, as I noted about 12 months or 15 months ago, is that every country sees their own military expenditure as a very sacrosanct thing, that their own expenditure is simply for defence, and the problem is because everybody else is doing something wrong and that if the other fellow will be reasonable then of course we will be reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on countries that are as they stand &mdash; this is true of the western countries generally, adequately well defended, to use a rather ambivalent term since most of their weaponry is much more offensive than it is defensive &mdash; to begin to reduce their commitment to armaments expenditure, first of all as an instrument of defence policy and secondly as an instrument of economic development.  It is true &mdash; notwithstanding propaganda to the contrary &mdash; that armaments expenditure is not a particularly useful method of economic development. Armaments expenditure is grossly inflationary because in a free market economy it does not have any of the normal criteria of a market of supply and demand and competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The armament issue is a central moral issue on development, because it is dishonest and immoral to pretend that there is a scarcity of resources for development in the world.  There is not a scarcity of resources.  The amount of expenditure on armaments would deal more than adequately with all the problems of development if it were allocated to development aid.  Of the $650,000 million, or $700,000 million, or $800,000 million spent on armaments every year, two or three weeks' worth would provide most of the basic services for most of those in the world who are without.</P>
      <P>It is not a question, even at this early stage, of our having to cut back dramatically the level of public consumption in the western economy, because the greater part of armament expenditure is still within the western and eastern bloc economies.  The problem is the moral choice involved in choosing to do something about the armaments race.  I welcome the motion.  The principles involved in it are principles that this House as a body should accept.  We are coming to a stage when we, as a community, will have to do more than express high-minded moral principles.  We will have to take decisions in terms of the allocation of our own admittedly limited resources towards the objectives outlined in the motion.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 13 September 1984 takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Proposals relating to equality of Opportunity (including Parental and Family Leave) which was laid before the Seanad on 17 October 1984 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> It gives me great pleasure to move the motion which notes the omnibus report which the Joint Committee on EC Secondary Legislation have produced on equal opportunities for women and men.  In that report, the Joint Committee examined seven different proposals from the EC.  The report runs to 127 pages of text and if one counts the appendices that are annexed, it comes to a total of 133 pages. It is, therefore, a very comprehensive and very substantial report.  It certainly was a matter of considerable political import that the report was a unanimous one by the members of the committee who represent the members of all three of the main political parties and there is also an independent member.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in moving the motion inviting the Seanad to examine the recommendations in the report, I do so as a member of that committee and as chairperson of the sub-committee that prepared the draft report for consideration by the committee.  The fact that it is a unanimous report is significant because, as Members of the House can see in looking at the details of the report which I am about to turn to, it is a very positive report on equality.  Indeed, it is one of the most positive reports that have come from any committee of the Oireachtas strongly endorsing and supporting the principles of equality of opportunity.  I very much welcome that and I hope that that approach and the specific recommendations endorsed by the committee in the report will be further supported by Members of this House and that this will help to ensure that the actions already being taken and, indeed, more positive actions in the area of equal opportunity may be set in train here and may be further implemented at the European Community level.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House for ensuring that there will be ample time for discussion of the contents of this report, both this afternoon and on a future occasion.</P>
    <P>I will begin by referring to the seven different proposals, or instruments, that were considered by the Joint Committee. These are referred to at pages 8 and 9 of <Col N="93" /> the report, where they are summarised. I will list them for the record; firstly, the Council's resolution of 7 June, 1984 on action to combat unemployment amongst women; secondly, a proposal for a Council directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment as between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self-employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood; thirdly, a draft Council recommendation on the promotion of positive action for women; fourthly, a progress report on the implementation of the new Community action programme on the promotion of equal opportunities for women; fifthly, a proposal for a Council directive on parental leave and leave for family reasons; sixthly, a proposal for a Council directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes, and, finally, an interim report on the application of the directive on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.</P>
    <P>The first point I will make about these various proposals is that some of them are proposals for draft directives which require legally binding implementation in this country.  Therefore, certain considerations apply to those proposals.  Others refer either to a council recommendation or a council resolution which are not as binding in their import but which can have a very real impact on the position of women and the attainment in a very positive context, of equality of opportunits by women in the various member states of the European Communities. Suffice it to say, and it deals with part of the general observations of the Joint Committee at the end of the report which I hope to come to in my analysis of the report, the committee does acknowledge the very positive role played by the European Communities in this area of the attainment of greater equality of opportunity by women in the member states of the Community through the Treaty provisions themselves and through the <Col N="94" /> steps that have been taken, particularly by the various directives which have been passed and which have required to be implemented in the member states and the action programme which was launched in 1982.  The Community have played a very significant role and the impact of that has been very beneficial, particularly for women in employment.</P>
    <P>With these general observations, I turn now to the various measures which were examined by the committee and I will draw attention, in particular, to the views of the Joint Committee on the implications for Ireland of these various measures. The first measure examined, as I have already indicated, was the Council resolution on action to combat unemployment amongst women.  This resolution was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 7 June, 1984.  In member states generally in the Community there is substantially higher unemployment amongst women than amongst men, but Ireland appears to be an exception in that our female unemployment rate is much lower than the comparable rate in other EC countries.  It is clear &mdash; and the Department of Labour accept this &mdash; that the figures for female registered unemployment are likely to seriously underestimate the true employment situation. Furthermore, the trends here show that female unemployment is increasing at a faster rate than male unemployment.  I refer Members to pages 12 and 13 of the report where these figures are referred to and, in particular, to a passage in paragraph 6 which I quote:</P>
    <P>The female unemployment rate in Ireland is lower than that for males &mdash; a factor which is not common in most of the other Member States in the European Communities.  However, the trends in registered unemployment in Ireland show that female unemployment is rising.  The female share of registered unemployment (seasonally adjusted) has risen during the past two years from 23.9% in April, 1982 to 25.6% in April, 1984.  In recent years, the general trend has been for a faster rate of increase in female than in male <Col N="95" /> unemployment, and in the two-year period to April, 1984 female unemployment increased by 54% in comparison with an increase of 40.9% in male unemployment and 44% in overall unemployment.  It is also important to note that the figures for female registered unemployment are likely to understate the true employment situation.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will understand the reasons for this.  To a considerable extent there are, particularly, cultural and social reasons within the Irish environment for women not applying for and being registered for unemployment and figuring on the official figures, so that we have a serious and worsening problem of female unemployment here.  For this reason, the committee have welcomed the resolution of the Council of Ministers, and the views of the committee are set out in pages 19 and 20:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee..... notes with approval the stress placed by the Council on equality of opportunity as the underlying factor in framing national policies and practices.  In respect of job creation and recruitment, the measures taken should aim for a more balanced representation of men and women, particularly in skilled jobs, in the new technologies and where women are under-represented. The Joint Committee urges that equal opportunities should be vigorously promoted in the public and private sector.  It is pleased to learn that the Minister for Labour has arranged for consideration to be given within his Department to the formulation of a general policy framework, within which the principle of equality of opportunity could be applied, and that it is his intention to seek Government approval shortly for the application of this framework to public sector organisations. The Joint Committee sees the introduction of flexible working hours and reduction and re-organisation of working time as positive contributions to attaining equal opportunity in <Col N="96" /> employment.  Other specific areas the Joint Committee feels attention should be directed towards are the provision of child care facilities (which are practically non-existent here), job sharing and the protection of part-time working.</P>
    <P>These are some of the views of the Joint Committee in response to the Council resolution.  In that regard &mdash; and I have already referred to him &mdash; I would like to welcome the Minister for Labour to this debate.  I would like to refer to the fact that the Minister appeared before the Joint Committee and discussed in detail the measures which the committee were examining and assisted the committee in the preparation of this report. I look forward to his contribution to the debate which is now taking place in this House on that report.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the provision of child care facilities which the Joint Committee have called for.  I attended the annual general meeting of Cherish, the self-help organisation for single parents.  The focus of that meeting was on the urgent need to provide for child care facilities.  Cherish recognise that the Government have committed themselves to introducing legislation to abolish the discrimination against children born out of wedlock.  Cherish see, as a natural and necessary parallel to that, the urgent provision of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Of course, these facilities are not just facilities that are needed by one parent or single parent families, but are a very necessary provision for the children and quite significantly for women who wish or need to take up &mdash; as they are entitled to &mdash; the full possibilities of employment. Notwithstanding that the first instrument is a Council resolution and has already been passed, it has very far-reaching and very important implications.  The Joint Committee have responded very positively to it in saying in what ways it could be further implemented here.</P>
    <P>The second instrument which we examined and which starts at page 26 of the report is a proposal for a Council <Col N="97" /> directive on the principle of equal treatment for men and women in self-employed occupations, including agriculture, and on protection during pregnancy and maternity.  It forms part of a programme of directives.  The first two directives, the directive on equal pay and the directive on equality treatment, which had been implemented here related to women who are employees and have greatly improved their status.  This draft directive has very important implications for women whose occupational status is not defined.  That is a particular problem in Ireland.  We have a significant number of women, particularly in the area of agriculture and where they are working for a family business, who have no occupational status.  They may carry out very serious responsibilities and administration in management and in the running of the farm or the business, but their status is still effectively that of that awful word &ldquo;housewife&rdquo;&mdash; as if anybody was ever married to a house.  That, in effect, in law is the only status they have.</P>
    <P>This draft directive was discussed last week at a meeting held in Dublin Castle as part of the initiative taken during the Irish Presidency and at which the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs made a very strong speech in relation to the importance of this proposed draft directive in Ireland and, indeed, the Taoiseach himself contributed very positively.  I would hope that the recommendations of the Joint Committee on that draft directive will be endorsed and accepted by Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The next measure examined, and this starts at page 45 of the report, is the draft Council recommendation on the promotion of positive action for women.  I would express the personal opinion that although this is a proposal for a Council recommendation &mdash; although I would prefer if it were a directive, a binding legal instrument &mdash; I, nonetheless feel that this recommendation, because it is calling for the promotion of positive affirmative action in this area, is one of the most important proposals.  It is one <Col N="98" /> that is dealt with very fully by the committee and the views of the Joint Committee on it are extremely positive.  I would like to refer in some detail to these views because they warrant repeating on the record of the House.  I would like to turn to page 55 of the report where the Joint Committee first of all express, as I have done, a regret that this instrument is a draft recommendation rather than a draft directive, which had been the original request by the European Parliament. This has been somewhat watered down to be a recommendation.  Nonetheless, I think its implications are very important indeed.  On page 56, paragraph 62 of the report, the committee state:</P>
    <P>A commitment to remove obstacles and to support measures to promote equal opportunity implies a systematic approach and a recognition that indirect or, in American terms, &ldquo;systematic&rdquo; discrimination is a root cause of unequal treatment as between male and female workers.  Removal of systematic discrimination, in the Joint Committee's view requires an intervention programme which is action oriented and is designed to facilitate equality goals.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we do not have an equal rights provision in the Constitution which gives equal rights to men and women in trade, profession or occupation, neither is there a legal provision regarding equality in education. Provisions in the Employment Equality Act of 1977, which prohibit discrimination in regard to access to training, do not ensure that positive action is taken.  The effect of the 1977 Act is to give rights to individuals to pursue claims.  The legislation does not call on employers either in the public or the private sector to take steps to achieve equality between male and female workers.  Amending legislation is needed, in the Joint Committee's view, to require employers to initiate actions which will assist desegregation of the work-force and thereby remove some of the burden of proof from a claimant under the Act of 1977.  The <Col N="99" /> Act has, in practice, required an almost impossible burden of proof and has initiated no positive promotion of equality measures.  The Joint Committee recommends that placing of notices which give information regarding the 1974 and 1977 Acts be mandatory in places of work.  The present legislation should be extended to include this provision.</P>
    <P>As part of the analysis by the Joint Committee of what would be involved in a programme of positive action, the committee note that the Employment Equality Agency have been urging the necessity for this kind of approach and have indeed, evolved a code of practice which they would like to see adopted and fully integrated into industry and into all sectors of our economic life, both in the private sector and in the public sector. The importance of the attitudes adopted, above all by senior management and down right through the structures of an individual company or of an organisation &mdash; be it a State-sponsored body in the public sector, a Department of Government, a profession, or a trade union &mdash; requires a very different approach to get beyond the stage we are at.  We have certain legislation on the Statute Book and individuals can pursue claims through the equality officer and through the Labour Court.  We do not have the ethos of affirmative action.  We do not have an acceptance of the kind of values that would be required in order to make the quantum leap in this area that, in effect, this committee are calling for in the report.</P>
    <P>The next instrument which the committee examined is a progress report on the implementation of the European Community Action Programme on the promotion of equal opportunity for women.  This is a programme which was launched by way of a Council resolution. It is an action programme from 1982 to 1985.  The Council asked the Commission to present an interim report by 1 January, 1984 on the progress which was being made and there will be a final report in <Col N="100" /> 1985.  The views of the Joint Committee on this progress report are set out on page 68 of the report.  The Joint Committee refer, in particular, to the impact in Ireland of the action programme of the European Community on Women.  It notes very explicitly that the budget of the statutory agency here does not appear to be adequate to enable that agency to fully discharge their tasks.  I should like to quote what the committee states at paragraphs 85 and 86:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee is satisfied that the budget of the Employment Equality Agency is insufficient to carry out the functions devolved on the Agency by the Oireachtas, both with regard to staff levels and members, and with regard to the cost of activities necessary after salary costs have been met. The present arrangements for financing and selecting staff means that the Agency is reliant upon a single, comparatively small Government Department to supply high level staff.  In particular the Joint Committee believes that the recruitment of special staff would require that the selection be made from a wider pool.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee commends the sterling work of the Employment Equality Agency in securing equality of women (and men) in employment and cautions that inadequate budgets and staffing levels can only impede this work.</P>
    <P>This is one of the major problems in facing up to the challenge of providing the positive impetus to equality which the committee discerned, and it is reflected in other paragraphs of the report as well.</P>
    <P>The next instrument is the proposal which took up a major portion of the time of the sub-committee and, indeed, of the Joint Committee itself at an earlier stage and which was and is a somewhat controversial measure, that is, the proposal for a Council directive on parental leave and leave for family reasons.  This proposal for a draft directive is summarised at pages 72 and the following pages in the report as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> The object of the draft Directive is to establish common statutory provisions throughout the Community governing parental leave and leave for family reasons.  It concerns male and female workers in the public and private sectors and is designed to ensure that the principle of equal treatment for men and women is fully respected by establishing the legal entitlement of workers to such leave, under harmonised conditions throughout the member states.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal first of all with the proposal on leave for family reasons.  This relates to short periods of leave to be granted, both to male and female workers, for pressing family reasons.  These could, for example, include the illness of a child or, something which is very common in the context of Irish society, a case where a single worker has responsibility for a dependent adult, an aged parent or an invalid, in the family.  A minimum entitlement of a certain numbers of days per year is to be fixed as proposed in the draft Directive by the member states.  Under the proposed directive this leave should be assimilated to paid holidays for the purpose of remuneration and social security.  One of the clear features of the proposal of leave for family reasons is that it would apply equally to male and female workers, thus signalling one of the values which underlie the draft directive &mdash; that the family responsibilities of workers are family responsibilities to be borne by both male and female &mdash; by mother and father, and not, as is so much the case in this country, that the family responsibilities are the sole burden and sole responsibility of the female workers, and not to any considerable extent, and certainly not to any extent recognised in our legislation, the responsibility of the male workers.</P>
    <P>It is important &mdash; and I do not mean this in a judgmental sense &mdash; to encourage the parenting role of fathers.  We need to be supportive of it because we need to recognise its importance.  It has a very vital effect on the development of children. It is their right to look to both their parents for parenting and it is our <Col N="102" /> responsibility, as a society, to create the conditions to recognise and support the importance for society of the parenting role and of the family responsibilities of workers.</P>
    <P>The second and different type of leave is parental leave and may be defined as leave which is granted to either fathers or mothers during a period after the termination of maternity leave, to enable either parent in employment to look after the new born child for a certain length of time whilst giving some degree of job security in respect of employment, social security and remuneration.  This proposal would give a working parent &mdash; whether married or not &mdash; the right of nontransferable parental leave of at least three months.  The draft Directive makes it clear that this will apply both to natural parents and to parents who had adopted a child following the placing of a child for adoption.</P>
    <P>This proposal for parental leave was one which concerned a number of members of the committee.  I should like to state frankly &mdash; and other members of the committee may wish to elaborate on this &mdash; that there was a concern among a majority of members, when this matter was first discussed in the full committee, that the proposals for leave for family reasons and parental leave would incur a burden of cost which in the present state of the Irish economy it would be difficult for it to bear and could have a detrimental affect, particularly given the very high unemployment level.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the reflected and considered view of the Joint Committee is very positive on the values which this draft directive seeks to promote, notwithstanding that a majority of the committee feel that it is not at present possible or realistic to make rapid progress in implementing its provisions.  If members of the committee would examine paragraphs 123 to 126 of the report &mdash; 126 in particular &mdash; they will see it is clear that the Joint Committee is very anxious that the importance of the values underlying the move towards recognition of the family responsibilities of workers <Col N="103" /> be furthered.  At paragraph 126 the report states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee in its consideration of the Commissions proposals regarded them as innovative and approached them in a positive frame of mind.  It sees the Commission's proposals for parental leave and leave for family reasons as another possible step forward in the reforming programme of the Community towards employees and particularly as an opportunity to advance the rights of women workers. The Joint Committee gave serious consideration to the Commission's view that the proposals could give opportunities for greater flexibility in the organisation of working time and could provide opportunities for work experience for young people.</P>
    <P>It refers to the fact that the majority of the members of the Joint Committee, however, after detailed consideration of the Commission's proposals feel they would, if adopted at the present time, offer another challenge to our struggling economy.  They point out the fact that some economies like Germany, for example, have lost their enthusiasm for the proposals.  The Joint Committee, as I say, asks employers to prepare themselves for a measure of this kind and note the very rapid changes that are taking place even in approach to work and, in particular, in the recognition of the family responsibilities of workers.</P>
    <P>The next measure which was examined by the committee is another proposal for a Council directive, this time a proposal for a Council directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes.  The Joint Committee understand that this proposal is still at a relatively early stage in discussion. Senators will recall that it was in December 1978 that the Council adopted the directive which we are at present in the process of implementing, the directive on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social <Col N="104" /> security.  That directive applies only to statutory schemes, and the present proposed directive, the one which the committee were considering at this stage, applies to occupational schemes.  These are schemes which fall between social security schemes and purely private insurance contracts, and they include schemes on collective agreements, company schemes and schemes set up by the representatives of a self-employed occupation, for example, doctors, lawyers or craftsmen.  The proposed directive is intended to apply to all workers whether employees or self-employed and it would prohibit any discrimination on the basis of sex or on the basis of marital or family status.</P>
    <P>The views of the committee are summarised on pages 100 and 101 and, in particular, it is important to draw attention to the view of the committee as expressed in paragraph 139 which stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission noted that women tend to benefit proportionately less than men from occupational schemes. Two reasons were put forward for this, firstly, occupational schemes are not usually operated in firms employing chiefly female labour because of traditional ideas of the respective roles of men and women in society and, secondly, because of the exclusion of part-time work from many occupational schemes.  As women form the bulk of part-time workers, they are affected to a greater extent as a consequence. These factors would need special measures to deal with this hidden form of indirect discrimination, and can possibly only be solved by broader social protection measures. One such measure would be a directive on the protection of part-time workers. The Joint Committee is, accordingly, very pleased that the Commission has drawn up a draft directive protecting part-time workers and feels that only a directive on this issue would bind member states to introduce legislation which would ensure that part-time workers would be guaranteed the same rights as full-time workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> So, the committee placed an importance on that further measure which we were not in fact examining but which is being proposed for the legal protection of part-time workers.  We also point to the proposals for a national pension scheme, proposals for bringing the self-employed in more substantially under this type of cover.</P>
    <P>The next measure which the committee examined was the interim report on the application of the third directive as it is called, Directive No. 7 of 1979 of December 1978 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The deadline for completing implementation of that directive is, of course, next month.  The Minister for Health has made it clear that Ireland will have secured the necessary removal of the discriminations under that directive. There has been some criticism, and I think there will be further debate, on the precise manner of the implementation of that directive and whether in some instances there are certain families on whom the implementation bears harshly in that they risk being less well off than before the directive was implemented in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering, before this criticism deflects from the values of that directive, that it is necessary to have a legal directive in this area because of the blatant discriminations that have existed. These have not been criticised as openly as they should have been.  Under the present social welfare code in Ireland, until amended, because of the binding requirements of this directive which we are just about to implement, married women receive lower rates of benefit than men in the scheme of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injury benefits. Also, married women can only receive unemployment benefit for a maximum of 312 days against 390 days for single or married men.  Thirdly, married women are effectively barred from the unemployment assistance scheme, which is one of the reasons why there is an under estimate of the female labour force <Col N="106" /> because, for a married women to qualify for unemployment assistance, either her husband must be dependent on her, which require a particular burden of proof of that, or she must not be a dependant of his.  Finally there are of course, different conditions applied in the matter of adult and child dependants.</P>
    <P>All of these are discriminations which have existed in the Irish social welfare code which we are now required to remove and to redress under the binding provisions of this directive.  That is something which the Joint Committee have welcomed.  I appreciate that for Members of the House this is a very substantial &mdash; I called it an omnibus &mdash; report in the area of equality and Members of the House will have to select certain areas.  I feel that the report is particularly significant because of the very affirmative attitude adopted unanimously by the committee in the area of the need for positive action and what positive action in the area of equality means.</P>
    <P>I will say one last thing lest there are Members of this House who fear that there is such a substantial economic cost to the proposals that in many instances that is not the case.  There are a number of serious proposals in this report and there are a number of examples referred to in the report of approaches, practices and changes which have not got an economic cost.  They are attitudinal changes They are a difference of approach and a difference in the values and principles but are not all necessarily matters that add significantly to economic costs.  One other benefit from having these various EC instruments examined in one report of the Joint Committee is that it enables us to look at what is happening in various companies or in various State-sponsored bodies and to urge that these practices be copied by other public or private sector bodies.  For example, in March 1982 Air Rianta were the first public sector body to appoint an affirmative action co-ordinator responsible for affirmative action programmes.  If there was a similar spin off effect that every other State-sponsored body and, indeed, the public sector as a whole, the Departments of State, <Col N="107" /> were to give a lead in this area of affirmative action that in itself would have a very significant impact and would accelerate the recognition of, the acceptance of and the positive endorsement of the values of equality of opportunity in our society. This is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that women workers are very defensive in the present state of the economy.  It is clear from the figures of the Joint Committee that the female unemployment rate is rising rapidly.  Women are defensive about seeking their rightful place, asserting the values which even a few years ago were much less questioned than they are now. Therefore it is particularly welcome to have this unanimous report of the Joint Committee placing in such a positive context the Irish attitude towards and the Irish view on these various EC proposals and their implications for Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to have this debated, and I look forward to hearing the views of Members of the House and the Minister on the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on their very comprehensive analysis of current initiatives at the level of the European Community which are concerned with the realisation of equality between men and women in employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to be able to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on 12 September 1984 to discuss the European Community proposals in relation to equality of opportunity and to outline the social affairs priorities of the Irish Presidency of the European Council. Having listened to Senator Mary Robinson and to her summing up in her very comprehensive outline of what the report contains I share her view that human progress and human liberation in this instance in relation to women's affairs, the concerns of women and, therefore, the concerns of men cannot be made conditional on achieving some level of <Col N="108" /> economic progress or output.  If that was to be the test of history then we would never have abolished slavery, we would never have introduced voting rights for men let alone for women or any of the other thresholds of social progress over which we have been able to climb in spite of the economic arguments of the day that have been hurled against them.  That is not to say that there will not be economic difficulties posed, but they are difficulties that should be capable of being overcome as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope that Ministers will avail of the opportunity, whenever possible, to attend joint committee meetings and discuss Commission proposals at an early stage.  I commend the Seanad for renewing the procedure for debating reports of the Joint Committee.  The last report of the Joint Committee on an employment related theme &mdash; the Tenth Report dealing with youth unemployment &mdash; was debated in the Seanad in May 1978.  I understand that the Joint Committee will shortly be considering a number of important themes in the social affairs field, including the Vredling Directive, youth training and long term employment. I would like to assure the members of the Joint Committee of my continuing co-operation in their deliberations and my interest in assisting this House in its consideration of the Joint Committee's work.  My membership of this House on a previous occasion and of the Joint Committee has somewhat coloured my commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee's report covers a range of documents and proposals in relation to issues affecting equality of opportunity for men and women.  These seven documents comprise (1) a resolution on action to combat unemployment amongst women; (2), three proposals for Council Directives which are still at some remove from adoption; (3), two progress reports of which one dealing with the implementation of a directive on equal treatment is in the social security field; (4), another one which reviews progress on the implementation of the European Community action programme on the promotion of equal opportunities for <Col N="109" /> women; and (5), a draft Council recommendation on positive action.</P>
    <P>I would like as briefly and as succinctly as possible to deal with each of these measures.  Referring to the resolution on action to combat unemployment among women, prior to assuming my Presidency functions last July within the EC I warmly welcomed the Resolution on Action to Combat Unemployment Among Women, which was adopted by the EC Council of Ministers in June of this year. It is not only current economic difficulties which have affected employment opportunities for women.  Other factors, including the effect which technological innovation and progress has in those areas of employment where women are traditionally heavily represented, has affected and will continue to affect their prospects in the future.  I am conscious of the important role which training and specific employment initiatives must play in overcoming the problems experienced by women in the labour market.</P>
    <P>In this context, the use of European Social Fund assistance is a matter of some importance.  The total amount of ESF aid approved for Ireland for special programmes for women during the period 1981-84 amounted to £1.9 million and involved 1,100 people.  In addition, women have participated in the various other programmes assisted by the fund which are open to both men and women.  There has been a continuing increase in the number of women participating in such programmes. For example, a percentage of women on training courses operated by AnCO, which is the largest beneficiary of the fund, has risen from 10 per cent in 1976 to approximately 32 per cent in 1983.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the positive action recommendation. The draft Council recommendation forms part of the new Community action programme on the promotion of equal opportunities for women 1982-85.  The draft recommendation was submitted by the Council to the Commission on 24 April 1984.  In my capacity as President of the Social Affairs and Employment Council of EC I decided to focus attention on the draft <Col N="110" /> recommendation, recognising its potential as a stimulus to the removal of existing inequalities against women and the promotion of equal opportunity in employment.  The progress made in advancing consideration of this instrument during the Irish Presidency should ensure its adoption at the formal Council in December.  We are on target to have that formal adoption made on 13 December 1984.</P>
    <P>The recommendation goes further than the aspirational character of the resolution on unemployment among women, and identifies a series of practical measures to be adopted within member states.  The European Commission will review progress and consider the effectiveness of the instrument at a later stage. I hope that the momentum generated by the adoption of the positive action recommendation will be influential in determining the stance of Governments towards the problems which have been encountered in the consideration of the three proposals for Council directives on equal treatment between men and women engaged in agriculture and small businesses, on parental leave and leave for family reasons, and on equal treatment for men and women in occupational and social security schemes.</P>
    <P>While the economic climate is a common factor among member states there are other factors which have a varied impact on the attainment of equal opportunity in employment.  The incidence of employment among women, the proportion who are part-time, the effect of occupational segregation, the prevalence of the concept of male breadwinner, are important in varying degrees in member states.</P>
    <P>On the question of positive action in favour of women I would like to take this opportunity to outline my proposals for the achievement of employment equality within my own Department.  With a view to the establishment of an equal opportunity programme as a specific item of personnel policy, I initiated an exercise some months ago to compile a profile of grade placements and upward mobility within my Department basically on the <Col N="111" /> premise that if you are going to try to preach to the rest of the economy how to achieve equal opportunity and promotion for women we could usefully start in our own back yard and see if the Department of Labour were attempting to practise what they were instructing everybody else to preach.  It might come as a surprise to Senators that we were a little bit in arrears in that regard.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the exercise was to identify constraints to the achievement of equal opportunity for women in the Department and to design mechanisms to eliminate such constraints.  Analysis of the profile data is proceeding and I expect to outline the details of an equality programme to the staff of my Department in the near future.  As soon as this programme is introduced in the Department of Labour I propose to take it up with the Minister for the Public Service on the question of introducing similar arrangements in other Departments.</P>
    <P>To give some indication of the time lag between an aspiration which takes root in the form of a political resolution among a party and its realisation on the ground we are still living with the consequences within the Civil Service in 1984 of the bar on marriage for females, in particular, continuing to work after they get married because the representation of women in the senior grades in the Civil Service is deficient in a significant degree as a consequence of that bar operating from the foundation of the State until 1973-74 when a previous Coalition Government removed it.  The legacy of that particular prejudice against women is still affecting the promotional opportunities of some women, particularly in the senior grades. When we have completed our study and when we have come up with a way of positively intervening in an affirmative manner within my Department I propose to take up the matter with the Minister for the Public Service and have it generally applied within other sectors of the public service.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Joint Committee's endorsement of the exemplary role for <Col N="112" /> public sector employers.  Both the resolution to combat unemployment amongst women and the draft recommendation on the promotion of positive action for women envisage that the public sector will make a special effort to promote equality of opportunity as regards their own employees, thus setting an example for the private sector.  My proposals with regard to the achievement of employment equality between men and women in State-sponsored bodies have been documented in the Joint Oireachtas Committee's report.  Prior to making those proposals, I arranged for a review of the current position in those bodies to be carried out so as to establish the extent to which equal opportunity initiatives have been incorporated in their personnel policies and to collect data on the distribution of staff as between males and females.</P>
    <P>The results indicated a clustering of women employees at the lower levels, where approximately one-third of the workforce is female and few or none of these female employees progress beyond the lowest rungs of the promotional ladder it is reasonable to question the reasons for this.  One of them is that boys get taught woodwork in school and girls get taught typing.  If we were to reverse that or equalise it out, we might reverse that particular historical bias.</P>
    <P>Policies to achieve optimum use of resources require flexible and inventive integration of theory and practice.  The primary requirement is a commitment to move from the current <i>status quo</i>.  It must be acknowledged that strategies are needed for the development of new patterns. Beneficial consequences are likely to flow from equalising opportunities between men and women in employment. Equal employment opportunity might appropriately be defined as a chance for all people to work and to advance on the basis of merit, ability and potential.  A capacity to motivate change and move towards a better balance of male and female representation in all grades of employment may be considered as both a symptom and a consequence of good management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> A significant practical difficulty arises for women on foot of the traditional hierarchical structure of organisations.  By their nature hierarchical structures can offer development to fewer and fewer people as they progress up through the system.  As the organisation narrows in towards its apex more people have to adjust to going no further upwards.  If a class of people, for whatever reason, never makes it beyond the bottom few rungs of the ladder, then members of that class tend to lower their expectations and motivation in a measure of self protection against frustration.  In Ireland, where the group clustered at the bottom of the hierarchy comprises mainly women this represents an under-use of a central organisational resource in that the technical and managerial ability of nearly a third of employees is being almost totally by-passed.  In formulating the scope of positive measures we, therefore, need to look at ways and means of altering the distribution pattern of women in the work place.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures which might be worthwhile considering in terms of efforts to alter the distribution of women in the workplace are those dealing with the following: management commitment, focus on jobs done predominantly by women, career development, communications instruments and personnel procedures. The key point is that the theoretical commitment to equal opportunity in the workplace which exist at present has to be translated into practical action which will be seen to serve to promote the best interests of the organisation as a whole.  For that reason, I was anxious that this pursuit of equality of opportunity for women should be integrated as a central function of the personnel departments and not hived out as some kind of parallel equal opportunities function, left to one side and treated as some form of a cosmetic exercise.  If it is not integrated right into the core of the personnel function for career development within the organisation, it will not be taken seriously and the resource that is constituted within the female workforce <Col N="114" /> will not be harnessed for the benefit of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of women in agriculture and small business.  Another initiative of our Presidency of the EC which I wish to highlight here is the major Community wide seminar which the Minister of State for Women's Affairs hosted jointly with the European Commission in Dublin last week.  The seminar, entitled Women in Agriculture and in Self Employed occupations, Issues and Options, dealt with the various issues relating to the proposal for a Community Directive on Equal Treatment for Men and Women in Self-employed Occupations including Agriculture and Protection during Pregnancy and Maternity. The Minister of State was anxious to ensure that all the issues relating to the proposal would be highlighted and comprehensively analysed at this relatively early stage of the proposal's examination at the various European Community fora.  This proposed directive raises a number of complex issues affecting several Government Departments and will require the most careful examination.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee recognise some of the difficulties.  Accordingly the colleges and their curriculum did not fit well within the overall pattern of youth employment and training programmes.  I am quoting from a Government decision to withdraw funding.  Senators may be aware that there were some difficulties in relation to some of the rural home economics colleges, and this was compounded by some of the difficulties to which the Joint Committee's report referred.</P>
    <P>In order to get the kind of equality that we are looking for, we have to look in detail at the question of the transition from school to work.  Reference is made on the subject in the Joint Committee's report to the major attitudinal and psychological problems to be overcome before women will become integrated into traditional male occupations.  For instance the report points to the fact that curricula and attitudes within the educational sector will require updating to <Col N="115" /> enable women to adjust to their new roles and occupations within our society.</P>
    <P>A major research study entitled &ldquo;Schooling and Sex Roles&rdquo;, which was undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, and partly funded by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency, highlights serious pragmatic grounds for worry about the continued viability of many of the traditional opportunities for women in the labour market and about the type of very generous second level education being received currently by girls, which places many of them at a serious lifelong disadvantage in the labour market and in the relationship between their work and family roles.</P>
    <P>The ESRI study points to the strong possibility of changes in trends in employment which could affect profoundly the career preparation of future generations of women.  The micro-electronic revolution poses a Community wide threat of loss of jobs in the fields of clerical, secretarial, data processing and routine technical work.  A declining demand for teachers and nurses will have a disproportionately depressing effect upon women's employment opportunities, because these are the most popular female professions.  In this connection I would like to mention that the Irish Presidency is making the theme equality of opportunity for girls its major focus in the European Community's Education Committee.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, has responded by seeking to identify specific measures that might be taken at both Community and at national level on this theme.  Among the particular issues she is pursuing in this context are: (1) the creation of co-operation in all member States between the education authorities and representatives of bodies concerned with employment and equal opportunities for women; (2) the improvement of means to collect information on the participation of males and females in all levels within the education system of member states; (3) the direction of attention within the education committee to <Col N="116" /> the importance of role models in influencing the behaviour and vocational aspirations of girls; (4) the possible organisation of a Community based workshop on the subject of sexism and sex role stereotyping; (5) the proposing of a search for enterprise project for girls in schools in order to encourage a spirit of enterprise and a willingness to seek out opportunities for self-employment.  I am sure the Seanad will agree that all of these measures, which may sound somewhat jargonistic or somewhat far removed from the reality of sex discrimination on the ground, are necessary if we are to achieve the essential attitudinal change among all of us to make a reality out of the political slogans and the campaign promises that different political parties in varying degrees of commitment have made over the last few years.  These things will not become a reality.  They will not, indeed, become effective in law unless we change our attitudes and become committed to the spirit of the law as much as to the level of it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the reorganisation of working time.  The Joint Committee indicated that they would see a role for the measures to reduce and reorganise working time in alleviating the unemployment problem and in realising employment equality between men and women.  I have emphasised the need to reorganise the current division of working time in my term as President of the Social Affairs Council.  In the Government's national plan entitled <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> we say and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Government states its views that developments in this area should be conducted within the framework of our voluntary collective bargaining system and that a case-by-case approach should be adopted with bargaining at local level which will take account of existing occupational benefits, production needs, and shift patterns at unit level.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the draft Council Directive on Parental Leave and Leave for Family Reasons, the committee deprecated the absence of any <Col N="117" /> recent comprehensive survey on absenteeism. In this connection I would point out that the agreement on pay policy in the second national understanding recognised that, in some employments, the level of absenteeism was a cause of considerable concern.  However, it went on to say that in such institutions the employers and trade unions involved should seek to agree on arrangements to reduce the level of unnecessary absenteeism.  A ministerial task force was established in 1983 under this Government to consider the issue of absenteeism in industry.  The task force has almost completed its work. One of the areas examined was the question of the differing rates of absenteeism as between men and women.</P>
    <P>Central to the efforts of the Government and the efforts of this society in pursuing equality in the work place and indeed throughout our entire social system is the role and the work of the Employment Equality Agency which was set up in 1977 on foot of the legislation brought in by a previous Coalition government.  I would like time to discuss the position of that agency and respond to the points that were made in the Joint Committee's report.  The agency which began operation in October 1977 has, along with its promotional and monitoring activities, the strategic role of enforcing the law in the public interest.  It has a wide variety of powers and considerable discretion in the exercise of these powers.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977 gives the agency powers to deal with discriminatory advertisements, with pressure to discriminate, and with discrimination by way of victimisation. By far the most important of its powers are (1) to assist individual complainants in equal pay and sex discrimination cases, (2) to undertake formal investigations into any purpose connected with the carrying out of its statutory duties, and (3), to take action against persistent discriminators.  Although the Employment Equality Act places the main responsibility of seeking redress on the individuals who feel themselves to be aggrieved, it recognised that there would be circumstances in which it would not <Col N="118" /> be reasonable to expect an individual to embark on legal action without some expert assistance.  The agency's powers of assistance to complain are in fact part of the strategic role of helping to clarify the law.  I am aware of the very significant expansion in the range and penetration of the agency's assistance to complainants making references to equality officers and to the Labour Court.  In addition the agency has referred a number of cases raising questions of principle to the Labour Court under its own authority.  I commend the agency for the vigour with which it has pursued precedent decisions. It has decided to concentrate on a new drive to highlight instances of indirect discrimination and to work to extend public awareness of the implications of equal pay for work of equal value.  The publication of the agency's code of practice on equal opportunity in employment is an important contribution to this end.</P>
    <P>I met the members of the agency in July of this year and discussed a wide range of issues with them.  The important role to be played by policy-orientated bodies providing information, help and advice on equal pay and equal treatment is recognised in the EC action programme which is considered in the Joint Committee's report.  The scope of the powers and duties of the Employment Equality Agency compares favourably with those of similar bodies in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  The experience and the capacity of the agency as an avenue for help has provided a model for other European countries.  The administrative machinery which we have devised for the implementation of equal pay and equal opportunities &mdash; which includes the Labour Court, the equality officers and the employment Equality Agency &mdash; is currently the subject of a review within my own Department.  The agency is very highly regarded within the EC by other EC member states and in particular by the Commission.  This is a very clear tribute to all of the staff of the agency but in particular to the vigour and the dynamism and indeed the commitment of the chairperson of that agency, Sylvia Meehan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> A review by my Department will look at the question of how the work is proceeding to date and in particular the machinery that has been established under the 1977 Act.  This machinery has to work in a context in which the paramount desire is to avoid the undue intervention of law in industrial relations and, more positively, to create an informal climate in which claims can be met and disputes settled without excessive legalism. Anti-discrimination laws have their limitations, and despite the divergence in legal systems in operation in member states a number of problem areas have become apparent, but within these limits they can be a crucial and on occasion decisive instrument in furthering equality for women.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to cover in a comprehensive way what is in itself an extremely comprehensive report.  I would like, therefore, to conclude by expressing my appreciation to the committee and especially to my colleague, Senator Mary Robinson, who is the chairperson of the sub committee that has produced this particular report.  Its publication at this time in the last eight weeks of the Irish Presidency of the EC and indeed in my own particular presidency of the Social Affairs Council is a significant morale boost for myself and in particular a boost in terms of the credibility of the Irish Government and indeed the Irish society to demonstrate our commitment to achieving the various proposals be they recommendations or directives that are set out by the Commission.  I hope we will be able to achieve considerable progress before the end of this particular presidency. I would like also, since we are discussing work that has been done by the Commission and work that has been done within the structure of the EC system of fora, to put on record my particular recognition of the work that Commissioner Ivor Richards has done during the last five years.  The House will be aware that Ivor Richards, the Labour Member from the United Kingdom, is an outgoing Commissioner of the EC.  He is not being reappointed by the present <Col N="120" /> Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for reasons that I think have become apparent to all progressive members within Europe, and it is right and proper that we should recognise that it has been his particular commitment to many of these proposals that has seen them emerge in the form in which they are now before us.  I would like to personally pay tribute and indeed to re-echo the tribute that Deputy Nuala Fennell, Minister of State for Women's Affairs, paid to him in Dublin Castle last week.</P>
    <P>I commend the committee for its comprehensive work and thank the members for the scrutiny they have applied to the way in which this legislation is being pursued by the present administration. Legislation can only go so far, and indeed the enforcement of existing legislation poses administrative problems in terms of resources of personnel.  All of it will be successful in the end if there is a human and social commitment to change what have been traditional attitudes among men and even among women.  Both sides of the sex divide need to change their attitudes in relation to achieving an equality of opportunity and an equality in terms of responsibility that have been effectively denied to all previous generations on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in congratulating the Joint Committee on the production of this comprehensive report on proposals relating to equality of opportunity.  Despite the operation of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 progress on equality has been very disappointing. This is due to a variety of factors including the following that I wish to highlight.  First, the low priority accorded to equality problems by trade unions. Second, the exceptionally low level of active participation by female trade union members in their unions, for example, the very small proportion of women on the national executive committees of their unions.  Third, the relatively small number of claims on equality issues which actually come before the Labour Court <Col N="121" /> machinery.  Fourth, the low level of awareness among employers of their legal obligations, especially under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Fifth, the seriously under-resourced Employment Equality Agency and Sixth the disturbing trend in female participation on AnCO training courses which shows little or no progress on traditional patterns.  For example, in 1984 apprentice training courses in AnCO were 99 per cent male while secretarial training courses were 99 per cent female.  The Minister has outlined a number of measures that are necessary to rectify this latter situation. Clearly, school curricula are central to any progress in this regard.  Their review and their updating is obviously very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to elaborate on some of these factors which are not helping the efforts towards equality of opportunity. Few female trade union members actually take an active part in their trade unions.  This is evident when we see the very low proportion of women on the national executive committees of their unions.  I have some figures on this. Almost exactly one-third of the membership of the three largest unions in this country are made up of females.  The three unions are the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union but female membership on the governing committees of these unions ranges between 7 and 9 per cent only.  In the case of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation the position is even less favourable.  Some 73 per cent of INTO members are female but only 10 per cent are on the National Executive Committee. Is it any wonder then that the trade unions accord a low priority to equality problems.  I should add that this relative lack of action by trade unions in the case of women's equality issues is not confined to recessionary conditions. Could I point out that this relative lack of action also obtained in the prosperous sixties and in the prosperous seventies? Increased active participation at all levels of their trade unions by female members <Col N="122" /> is essential in order to advance the equality of opportunity.  This low priority accorded to equality problems by trade unions probably also contributes to the relatively small number of claims which come before the Labour Court machinery under the equality Act.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to a point here raised by the Joint Committee on page 94 where reference is made to the Labour Court's quasi-judicial functions under the equality legislation.  It is true that the operation of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 have added a new dimension to the central dispute-solving role which has characterised the court since it was established.  Under these two Acts the court has a monitoring role in regard to workers' rights and also has the responsibility for hearing appeals and thus for making determinations which have legally binding effect.  This complex work has implications for the character of the court and for the principle of voluntarism which has been fundamental to the court's makeup since its establishment.  The Labour Court itself is very concerned about this particular conflict.  In its 1978 annual report the court highlighted its concern in this regard as follows:</P>
    <P>A feature of these appeals is the extent to which the court finds itself involved with legal aspects of its actions and its decisions thus depriving it of the flexibility which it enjoys when dealing with cases referred to it under the Industrial Relations Act.</P>
    <P>One possibility would be to transfer the determination of cases under the Employment equality legislation from the Labour Court to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, a course which, as the Joint Committee point out, is recommended in the Department of Labour's discussion document on the reform of industrial relations.  Having thought about this, I am inclined to believe that this appeal function under the equality legislation should be retained by the Labour Court rather than transferring it <Col N="123" /> elsewhere and I will develop the reason why I take this view.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court as matters stand is faced with a genuine conflict between its dispute-solving role and its quasi-judicial functions under recent statutes.  I would suggest that the way to proceed would be to add a new division to the Labour Court staffed by a chairman with a legal competence and with the remaining members being drawn from trade unions and employer representatives.  Following recent experience with claims under the equality legislation, it is emerging that rights conferred by this legislation can be problematic in an industrial relations sense.  For example, where a determination is made under the equality legislation its implementation could and, in some cases, actually has adversely affected other groups in the same organisation in relation to their promotion prospects.  In other words, determinations which are correctly made under the legislation when implemented can have serious repercussions for other groups in the same organisation thus highlighting the need for an input of industrial relations expertise into the determination process. Therefore the best way to handle the equality appeals cases I suggest would be to establish a further division of the Labour Court with a legal chairman together with employers and trade union members thus ensuring that both the legal and the industrial implications are fully considered before the determination is made.</P>
    <P>As the report points out, the statutory body in Ireland responsible for equal opportunities is the Employment Equality Agency and the Minister has rightly paid a signal tribute to that body.  It has a particularly wide brief which includes promotion and advice, research, review of legislation enforcement, conduct of formal investigations, codes of practice and assisting individuals with equality problems.  The agency is seriously understaffed. I too would like to endorse the hope of the Joint Committee that the agency will be given the resources to fulfil <Col N="124" /> its brief.  If the Minister and his Government are serious about advancing equality of opportunity, they can demonstrate the necessary political will by providing adequate resources for the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note, I join with the members of the Joint Committee in commending the Employment Equality Agency for their publication of a code of practice for the elimination of sex discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunity in the workplace.  This code of practice is a first and its publication is significant at a time when the Department of Labour are exploring with the ICTU and FUE the possibility of reforming our industrial relations system.  This code of practice, while now voluntary in nature, raises the possibility of giving it statutory effect at a later time, that is, the status of fair employment rules as recommended by the Joint Committee. While trade unions generally and many employers are reluctant to use the law as an instrument for regulating employer-employee relations there is in fact provision under existing legislation to give statutory effect to codes of practice.  It has never been activated but it seems to me that since it is there it should be used.</P>
    <P>I refer to the provisions under section 11 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 whereby the Labour Court can make statutory codes of practice or, as they are called in the Act, fair employment rules, which would provide for fair employment conditions for a particular class, type or group of workers.  Indeed the development of codes of practice on grievance procedures, disciplinary procedures, provision of company information to employees, provision of facilities and training for shop stewards and so forth, should be a major priority as a means to good industrial relations practice.  The example set by the Employment Equality Agency in publishing the first code of practice may well serve as the stimulus for the publication of further codes of practice on a host of aspects of relations between employers and unions, which could eventually attain legal status as fair <Col N="125" /> employment rules under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have to say that if substantial progress is to be achieved on equality of opportunity further action must be taken urgently by women themselves by becoming more active in their trade unions, by employers in increasing their level of awareness of the legislation and, very importantly, by adopting more positive attitudes to the question of equality, and finally by the Government in providing more resources for the Employment Equality Agency and additionally by reviewing and amending existing legislation where necessary.</P>

      <P>I want to compliment the chairman of the sub-committee and the chairman of the Joint Committee on this very comprehensive and detailed report.  It represents a considerable input from the members of the sub-committee, and they have certainly set the headline for indepth discussion on the secondary legislation which is so important and will have such an impact on our lives here in this country.  Therefore, it is good that the first report of this kind to come before the House will set the tone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this wide-ranging report the Joint Committee have brought together and examined the community measures proposed and adopted to ensure equal treatment for both women and men.  At present there may be misgivings among some about our membership of the European Community.  Some may be tempted to attribute &mdash; rightly or wrongly &mdash; our economic ills to that body.  In any event the Joint Committee are convinced that the Community played a dominant role in the promotion and enforcement of equal treatment for women, because the record is very clear on that since the first social action programme which was introduced by our distinguished President when he was the Social Affairs Commissioner when we entered the Community in 1973. The Community has brought about changes in employment practices which might otherwise have taken decades to achieve.  Irish women have the Community to thank for the removal of the marriage ban in employment, for the introduction of maternity leave, for greater opportunities to train at skilled trades, for protection against dismissal <Col N="127" /> on pregnancy, for the disappearance of advertisements specifying the sex of an applicant for a job, and greater equality in the social welfare code.  Indeed, after farmers, the Irish women in employment have probably benefited most from our entry to the EC.</P>
    <P>The Community's long standing commitment to the improvement of the situation of women has established it as a pioneer and innovator in this field and the task of achieving equal treatment and equal opportunities for women and men in society, particularly in employment.  I suppose we cannot expect that this kind of social progress is all going to be achieved overnight.  Nevertheless I would like to place on the record of the House the fact that in my view the Social Affairs Commission of the EC, over the last decade, has been most successful.  I join the Minister in complimenting Commissioner Richards for his stewardship over the past term.  The social affairs departments in the various Governments have been the most successful in all the Community areas over the last number of years.  The greatest progress has been made there.  It is quite clear that the moneys expended by national Governments, with the aid of generous grants from the social fund, have given greater benefit to the people for whom they were designed to serve.  That is very important, and it is good that we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>However, there are still many black spots.  One area of the report with which I disagree to some extent is the committee's findings with regard to women in farming.  Clearly the educational services for women have diminished over the past decades.  There is now no specialist education available to farming women.  Up to a couple of years ago we had a number of colleges of home economics.  They met the demand and the requirement of ladies wishing to remain in farming.  Since the introduction of ACOT the Department of Agriculture have neglected this area. There must be a demand for that kind of education.  As a matter of fact, ten years ago we had instructors in poultry keeping <Col N="128" /> and butter making.  With the development of the creamery system and the large co-operatives I suppose the practice of butter making has passed into history. In the forties and up to the fifties the farm women ran the houses and the families in many instances from farmyard enterprises. Education has done nothing to replace those husbandries, and we find that education specifically for farm women, who play such an important role in the farming economy, has diminished to a great extent.</P>
    <P>In this very extensive document the committee have identified the very many difficulties and the areas where legislation ought to be introduced in order to expedite reaching the target and the status that we as a civilised society ought to aspire to.  There are many who will say that we should not have working wives. I do not subscribe to that.  We must have not just equal pay for work of equal value but every individual in the State must have the equal right to work or not to work or to live their own life.</P>

    <P>Barry Desmond, T.D., Minister for Social Welfare, announces that the Government have agreed to make a double payment in the week ending 7 December, 1984 to the following categories of people: old age and widow pensioners, contributory and non-contributory, retirement pensioners, invalidity pensioners, recipients of deserted wives' benefit and allowance, recipients of social assistance allowances for unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women, those who receive occupational injuries benefits <Col N="130" /> by way of pensions and persons in receipt of long term health payments, disabled persons maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The press release continues:</P>
    <P>Altogether 414,000 recipients will benefit from this payment.  The cost is £20.35 million.  Some examples of the benefit are a contributory old age pensioner under 80 with an adult dependant will receive £156.10, a widow under 66 with two children in receipt of a contributory widow's pension will receive £135.80.</P>
    <P>The announcement of double payments for certain categories of persons at Christmas is a very welcome one.  It is a particularly welcome one at this time when there is great concern about the state of the economy and there was a question as to whether these payments would be made this Christmas.  It is a very welcome decision, and it was one which was very heavily canvassed by the Labour Members of the Cabinet.  What I want to raise and want to invite the Minister to respond to is the clarification of the scope of the proposal, because it is not entirely clear to me what that scope is.  I very much welcome the presence of the Minister at this debate and I hope he will clarify the matter I raised.</P>
    <P>I have been doing some homework on this proposal for double payment.  It was first introduced by an Act of the Oireachtas in 1980 called the Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1980. It provided for double payment for certain categories of recipients of benefits and allowances.  There was an Act in 1981, and then because a legislative change was made in the Social Welfare Act of 1982 it was possible in 1982 and 1983 to effect this provision for double payment by a statutory instrument.  I understand that there will be a statutory instrument this year to effect the intention in this press release.  It is very useful to raise this matter at this stage and to <Col N="131" /> seek clarification on what would be the proposed scope of the statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>My particular concern is that the list set out in this press release appears to miss certain categories of persons in receipt of benefits and allowances.  I am concerned because these appear to be the categories which were omitted from the Act of 1980, the Act of 1981, from the statutory instrument of 1982 and from the statutory instrument of 1983.  These categories &mdash; I may not have all of these categories, if not, the Minister might inform me of that &mdash;appear to be those on unemployment assistance, those on unemployment benefit and those on supplementary welfare allowance.  I am very puzzled by this fact because those categories would be on lower levels of benefit or allowance than a number of the categories which are mentioned in the press release and which were included in the legislation on the statutory instruments in previous years.</P>
    <P>On a point of clarification I will turn to the examples given in this press release. It refers to the fact that a contributory old age pensioner under 80 with an adult dependant will receive as a double payment at Christmas in the week ending 7 December 1984 the sum of £156.10.  That is made up of the maximum personal rate for the contributory old age pensioner of £48.25 and the rate for the adult dependant of £30.80 giving a total of £79.05 which when doubled gives £158, not £156.10.  That appears to be the amount. Similarly, in the case of the widow under 66 &mdash; the other example given &mdash; the maximum personal rate for the widow is £43.45 and the rate for the first child is £11.65, the rate for the second child is £12.80, giving a total for the week of £67.90 which when doubled gives the figure mentioned in the press release of £135.80.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the other categories that I mentioned, for example, a person on unemployment assistance who would be in receipt of what is called long-term unemployment assistance.  Again I am looking for clarification on this: I think it <Col N="132" /> is correct that &ldquo;long term&rdquo; means where a person is in receipt for 15 months of unemployment assistance or where a person goes from unemployment benefit when the time has run out on to unemployment assistance and therefore these persons would be in receipt of the unemployment assistance allowance for that sustained period.  Looking at the urban rate, the maximum personal urban rate for the long term, which is slightly higher than for the short term, would be £32.80. If you take a person on that with one adult and one child dependant it would come to a total of £64.60 or if one took a person in receipt of unemployment assistance with two child dependants, making a comparison with the contributory widow's pension, which is referred to in the press release, the contributory widows under 65 years of age with two children would be in receipt of the basic rate of £67.90 which would be doubled to £135.80.  A person on unemployment assistance with two dependent children would be on £50.55.  It does not appear that it would be envisaged that that person would receive a double payment at Christmas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for a person on unemployment benefit again the maximum rate is lower than the maximum rate for a number of the categories who are going to receive the double payment.  A person on unemployment assistance would receive a maximum personal rate of £37.25 and with two dependant children that would come to £56.00.  It appears that that person is not going to receive a double payment at Christmas.  Another category which I mentioned appears to be omitted from the press release &mdash; unless I have either misread it or misunderstood it &mdash; is a person in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance, which of course would be the lowest maximum personal rate. The maximum personal rate is £29.95.  If such a person was only in receipt of that and had two child dependants the total he would receive is £46.85.</P>
    <P>These are the figures that we should compare because we are not really talking about statistics in this matter.  We are talking about neighbours.  We are talking <Col N="133" /> about people living next door to each other.  In one case, for people who are at a higher level it appears that Christmas means they are going to get a double payment in the week ending 7 December of this year.  For the immediate neighbour who is in fact on a lower income, but in exactly the same family situation, they are not going to get a double payment at all.  I do not understand if that is the case what the possible rationale could have been in 1980, 1981, 1982 or 1983.  I certainly would not be happy that we would be drawing that kind of distinction going into Christmas of 1984.  We do have to accept now &mdash; and this is an important political reality &mdash; that the double payment at Christmas has become a very important factor for a number of families; the greater the need the more important that double payment is.  It is extremely welcome that even in the very difficult economic climate that we have this Government have ensured that double payments would be made this Christmas. It is equally of very great importance that we ensure that there is equity and fairness in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is of particular importance in the area of the unemployment allowance because a distinction is drawn in the rates which are issued by the Department between short term and long term.  We are talking about effectively long term benefits, although for some reason, which is not borne out by the reality of modern life, these allowances are characterised as being short term benefits.  They are not short term when somebody is 15 months in receipt of unemployment assistance and then it is means-tested; it is a very low rate of benefit and yet these appear to be categories that will not be included in the double payment.  I only want to ask for clarification on the matter.  I hope I have completely misconstrued the press release and that the provision for doubling of payments will extend to the categories that I have identified, because they appear to me on the level of payments to these families to be the categories in greater need.  Again &mdash; the Minister may correct me if I am mistaken in this &mdash; if one looks at some of the <Col N="134" /> categories that are included, the old age and widow's contributory pension, I am delighted that people in that category would get a double payment at Christmas but they could be people who are not in the same kind of need, who are not on the same low level of subsistance as other families.  We are talking about neighbours. We are talking about women with their children living next door to each other.  We are talking about families trying to subsist in very difficult circumstances. It is extremely important that we stand back from something that we have become used to &mdash; this double payment at Christmas &mdash; and seek clarification on the rationale behind it and seek clarification in particular on the scope of this press release which is being issued to Members of the Houses.  I would very much welcome clarification from the Minister.</P>

      <P>As announced on 25 October last the Government decided that a double payment will be made in the week ending 7 December 1984 to recipients of the following social welfare payments &mdash; old age pensions, retirement pensions, blind pensions, invalidity pensions, occupational injury pensions, payments for widows and orphans, deserted wives, unmarried mothers, single women and prisoners' wives.  The double payment will also be made to recipients of the following health allowances &mdash; disabled persons' maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance, domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children. These are the very same categories who benefited from a Christmas double payment in each of the last four years, that is 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.  The method of payment is also the same as in previous years.  The double payment will be made to the Post Office and the appropriate day of payment of pensions and allowances is the week ending 7 December.  Old age, blind pension, widows' and orphans' pensions will be due on Friday, 7 December, <Col N="135" /> the other categories on Thursday, 6 December.  The amount of the extra payment will be equal to the face value of the weekly pensioner allowance order and will include all increases in respect of adult and child dependents and any supplements such as the living alone allowance which form part of the regular weekly payment.  Certain long term recipients of occupational injury benefit by way of pension are paid by cheque monthly in advance.  These will be issued with cheques at the equivalent of five weeks payment instead of four.  Persons receiving health allowances will be paid the extra amounts by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who will benefit from the double payment totals 414,000. These are made up of 200,000 old age and blind pensions; 94,300 widows and orphans; 33,000 retirement pensioners; 23,000 invalidity pensioners; 8,000 deserted wives; 14,700 social assistance recipients; 7,000 occupational injury pensioners and 34,000 health allowance recipients. Even though no provision could be made in the Estimates for a double payment, the Government as the year went on made every effort to fund enough money to make an additional payment to the less well-off at Christmas time.  The Government's concern is indicated in the light of the overall budgetary situation that they still made it possible to make a payment but the maximum amount that the Government could find was only about £20 million.  For that amount of money it is not possible to give a double week to all social welfare recipients.  It is necessary to make extremely difficult choices between one group and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government had chosen to give a double payment to long term recipients of unemployment assistance it would not have been possible to give the double week to the 94,000 widows.  I have no doubt but that some long term recipients of unemployment assistance are financially less well off than some widows or some old age pensioners.  The Senator has given valid examples here tonight. <Col N="136" /> Unfortunately, without a massive across-the-board means testing operation covering recipients of social insurance as well as social assistance recipients it would not be possible to divide up what the Government managed to make available &mdash; that is £20 million &mdash; strictly on the basis of financial need.  An extremely difficult choice had to be made in terms of broad categories of groups of recipients. This choice becomes more and more difficult as the double week payment at Christmas becomes more costly each year as a result of the annual increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments and the growing number of recipients.</P>
    <P>This year's payment of the double week will cost over £20 million whereas the 1983 similar payment for the same group cost only £18 million.  In addition, this year we find that there will be 10,000 extra recipients benefiting from the double week, compared with last year.  It will be appreciated that a difficult decision had to be made.  The decision that was made by this Government &mdash; and also made by previous Governments &mdash; was to confine the double payment to pensioners and those in receipt of equivalent payments because pensioners as a group have left the labour force.  I should point out that those on long term unemployment assistance have not been forgotten by the Government.  They received a special 5 per cent increase in October 1983 in their payments and in July of this year they received a further 1 per cent increase above the general level of increases for social welfare recipients. The Government are very conscious of the plight of the long term unemployed and have shown their concern in a very positive way by giving those additional increases throughout the year over and above the increases given to other categories.</P>
    <P>The type of increases which I have outlined are beneficial to the unemployment assistance recipients for the whole year round and not just for one particular period.  The special increases I have mentioned are equivalent to an extra three weeks payment to those on long term unemployment assistance.  One could <Col N="137" /> think that the Government could have done a clever piece of arithmetic and not granted these special increases but instead giving them in the form of a double payment.  If the Government had to do this they would have saved money. The overall amount of social welfare resources devoted to those on unemployment assistance has, of course, been increasing more rapidly in the last few years than any other category of payment: between 1983 and 1984 alone, the increase has been 17½ per cent; this year over £260 million will be spent on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like people to have no doubt about the fact that I would have preferred by far to have been able to provide the additional benefit of the double week payment at Christmas to the long term unemployed as well as to those who will get it.  The resources to do this are not available, and the difficult choice of not to pay it to recipients of unemployment benefits and assistance had to be made. The unemployment benefit and the disability <Col N="138" /> benefit recipients for the duration benefit, in the main, from pay-related benefit.  The difficult decision had to be made taking account of this fact, and unemployment assistance was not included.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senator for highlighting this aspect of the matter.  I should hope that she will appreciate the kind of choices facing the Government, which are very difficult, and that she would accept the assurance that I give about the concern of the Government for the unemployment assistance people.  It is a concern that has been shown by the special increases which I have mentioned. I should hope that sufficient resources will continue to be available to help all these people in special need.  I hope that I have now clarified the position for the House.</P>
